I'm a big movie fan where people come in, and the House of Games is almost a genre of movies where people get famous. In short, this is an extraordinary thriller that keeps you on your seat, providing interesting signs with many levels and never really revealing what is happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to completely disturb what you just saw. The film takes the audience on several occasions and despite the fact that we know it; it's still hard to guess where it goes, and every twist is a surprise. As mentioned, I am a big fan of films and this plot is followed by a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a big debt to a colleague's gambler. He then goes to the gambler, trying to help his patient out and pulling the art of reading people out of the way. <br /> <br /> The House of Games breathes a foolish atmosphere all the time and David Mamet is making his movie settings well in urban areas. The film also works well because everyone involved brings life and faith to their character with the most skills. Joe Mantegna celebrates the film's middle-man, and although his presentation is a little undernourished, he is always confident and credible as a villain. Lindsay Crouse stands next to her as the psychiatrist entices her work, and again she is credible in her role. He may not be the biggest viewer, but at least he can act. While the film is filling its plot, it is the main star of the exhibition, but you will undoubtedly surprise it several times on how the film can always amaze and deceive the viewer. Sometimes it's almost the same thing we're doing and we've been holding on to the movie's male. The second thing about this movie is nice, how it shows the audience how to draw certain drawbacks that are useful if you want to say twenty bucks. All in all, the House of Games is truly a thrill of excitement.
