I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and since then my head has stuck. It marks two enchanting characters, which, unfortunately, is a mediocre documentary. To get the true story of Beales, I had to look for the entire DVD bonus material and comments and search the web. <br /> <br /> While Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie himself) brush on the suggestion that this movie is exploitative, it is exploiting the word in the most serious sense. Very little effort is being made to explain to Beales or how they came to the state they were in. The approach of Maysles seems to be just to turn on the camera and wait until Edith and Edie say something surprising. Sound, even when releasing the criterion, is bad and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate this movie in the history of documentary films, it is ironic to compare it with Geraldo Rivera (!) Much better series of sexual abuse of patients with intellectual disabilities at Willowbrook State School on Staten Island since 1972, four years before putting gray gardens. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a New Yorker review, many things needed by Edith and Edie in their lives were needed, and the documentary was not one of them. For Edith and Edie, I was wondering when I was watching the movie, "where is hell their family"? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy and dangerous conditions. How is it that Jackie O, who is married to one of the richest men (or the wealthy Bouvier family), couldn't afford Edith and Edie to get a decent home? Or at least hire a part-time housekeeper or caretaker to come in and keep them on both eyes? It is a shameful and enduring shame for the whole Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this review may seem negative, I would strongly recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries. Maybe someday one day and a documentary about this documentary - bringing the rich background of Beales in the 1970s and the subdivision of the whole Hamptons society.
