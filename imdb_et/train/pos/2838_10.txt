New York I Love You are full of love and power. But not for everyone, but it's a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> It's like Shia LaBeouf (see Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones and more), Maggie Q, Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman and more. Star-studded cast, this film is undoubtedly brilliant. <br /> <br /> With many top-notch drivers around the world, it can't impress. The difference from one story to another is creative and unique. <br /> <br /> It's easy to say that New York I Love You is a popcorn movie, and you should watch it on BIG TV! This time, trust the IMDb rating because it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> I expect Shanghai to love you in 2010. <br /> <br /> Look at NY ILY, you don't have to be disappointed.
