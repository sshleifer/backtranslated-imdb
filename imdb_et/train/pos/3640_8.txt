This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid moves and persuades a part of the man who gave up his dream of being a baseball cap when his hand gave him out. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division's championship, saying he's trying the baseball team when they do. They won (partly thanks to all the beating practices they do with a coach able to exceed 90 miles), and he keeps his bargain - and is signed! <br /> <br /> If you've ever decided something new and terrifying than an adult, Jim Morris's story will resonate with you. It moves and inspires, and human relationships are real. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason I rent it. Dennis Quaid is just a pretty dirty and baseball movie with a good-looking man who is changing his diaper, it's my idea of ​​heaven. Ladies, if you feel like I'm doing this, check it out.
