It's really one of Hollywood's "golden age" that they no longer do. This is a unique, fun movie that will keep you from what happens next. <br /> <br /> All actors are completely cast and they are all great supporters. This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Colman and since then has been his fan. Reginald Gardiner has always been my favorite supporting actor and adds a certain quality to every film she has. Although he played a different character here, he still added something to the film that would not have been added by another actor of this character.
