This is, in my opinion, one of Disney's five animated features. Cinderella was the perfect return to the feature-length animated feature film (unlike the 40's concise movies) and the expensive depth through multiple planes of the camera returns to the movie in other ways. Although Disney adjusts the story somewhat liberally, you collect the idea of ​​the era through dress and stylization --- a clear time period when the story goes. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than snow white and multi-dimensional. In fact, all the characters are somewhat well-developed except the prince who left the apartment - we know he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but that's all. Like Snow White, Disney has some lasting impact on the popular culture --- in most Cinderella versions, the steps are attractive, not as beautiful as the Cinderella, and their character takes a otherwise nice look. > <br /> Favorite Disney Additions: Mice! Consistency is also assessed - Cinderella always loses the entire shoe. Adding homemade dresses and the next step-by-step attack was always terrible as a child - I remember that View Master shows it on a black background and a big red light! The broken slipper shows the bad Lady Tremaine's unwillingness to give up Cinderella and admit defeat --- Audley goes on to characterize the worst of all Disney crooks, Satanic witch Maleficent, in bedtime.
