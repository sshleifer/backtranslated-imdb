I watch this movie over and over again. I have to watch it at least once a week. I'm from Africa and watching this movie I taught me things I didn't even know about Africa. Denzel movies are all biography. I wish she was my brother. I've also seen and love your Masala Mississippi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to get her brother to work, my teenager reminds me when my brother was always angry with me to occupy me all the time. My brother always cares for my old father and he wants to see me too. By the way, where did Denzel get this African accent in Cry Freedom? I've seen this movie for the first time in Africa and I didn't know Denzel was America until I moved down here.
