It's hard for me to criticize what Mitzi Kapture does. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actor. Nevertheless, the plot was predictable. I think if Jill HAD sleeps with Richard, maybe she would be a little bit sharper than she was, which would have been added. It would have been nice to see Jill and her husband find Richard's little problem with his former husband, maybe a bit more back in the story. I was a little disappointed with ending the movie. I would have liked to have kept Zack more dead and maybe shut down with my husband. However, I must say that I can never look at the burning gun and not imagine it standing there. It was a very good ending for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I look forward to your future projects.
