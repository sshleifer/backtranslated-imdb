This TV movie is brilliant. This is probably BAFTA's best and favorite role in winning John Thaw (Kavanagh Q. and Inspector Morse). The widow of Tom Oakley (Thaw) has lived in the village for some time because his wife and son died, and now he has landed on an evacuation called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). When he knows this child, he starts developing friendship. Until Willaimi's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants her back. After Tom's concern for William not to contact him, he goes to London to find him. Finally, Willaim gets her home with a loving family (or father). This is a great film during World War II. It was named the BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for the most popular drama. John Thaw was number 3 on TV 50 Greatest Stars. Very good!
