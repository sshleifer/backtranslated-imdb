Do you want to solve mysteries? Do you like complicated stories? This is for you. Natural, smart movie by Francis Leclerc (son of the legendary French Canadian writer Felix Leclerc). Fast photo and smart editing is Leclerc's word that was strongly helped by Roy Dupuis in leading role. someone unknown. Tourneur tries to remember who hit him, because he stopped the suffering of the deer on his way. Throughout his struggle he has strange behavior and seems to have taken something over him. <br /> <br /> Not a spooky but very mysterious and well-played movie. I have my own hypothesis about ending (I think India caused an accident), but this end was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this 9.5 / 10
