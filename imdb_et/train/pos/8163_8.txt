Corbin Bernsen delivers terribly intense and riveting performance, such as Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist who is perfectly obsessed. If he discovers that his lovely blonde babe trophy wife has cheated on her and the IRS starts her tax problems, Feinstone cracks under pressure and move around in the curves. Director Brian Yuzna, who works from Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli, and Charles Finch's appropriately dark, witty and demented script, opens up a rich and rich abundant American, with delicious malicious hell, with a nervous nervous and psychosis. What's more, Yuzna is still spiked by harsh moves with the humor of evil black devils. Bernsen looks positively on dr. As Feinstone; he is expertly designing a failed foundation that is under Feinstone's deceptively calm and firm veneer. The supportive majority is also excellent: Linda Hoffman as the deaf, unfaithful woman of Feinstone, Brooke, Earl Boen, like Marvin Goldblum, the fierce representative of the IRS, Molly Hagan as a weak assistant to Jessica, Patty Toy as a perky assistant Karen, Jan Hoag jolly office manager Candy , Virginya Keehne as sweet, lovely teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as a thorough, nonsensical detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as Gibbs' Equal Terrible Partner Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as a female plaque muffin cleaner Matt and Mark Ruffalo as mark sleazeball Steve Landers. The premium make-up f / x is, in any case, as big, tough and distracting as they should be. Levie Isaaks's polished cinematography offers many great crazy angles and some delicious zooming close-ups. Alan Howarth's delightful shaky score also hits the meat's indexing spot. A pleasantly curled treatment.
