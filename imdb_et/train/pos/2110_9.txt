So much has been written about the plot of the film, the wonderful example, the script, the melancholy, the bitter air, the great direction - what can I add? Just see if one of the warming, beautifully acting and enjoyable scenes ever been filmed. It's Christmas Eve and Frank Morgan's character (shop owner - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his broken marriage and suicide attempt. As every employee leaves, he calls them for Christmas Eve. Each of them has courtesy of him down. They all have plans for their Christmas Eve. At this stage, this moving scene is deeply sad. Frank Morgan gives his career a show and this scene brings me to tears. Fortunately, we are delighted with this special scene. The new employee, the boy-boy, is the last to leave the shop in a beautiful snowy street scene. Desperately, Mr Matuschek goes to this boy and asks him how to spend the evening with him, treating him with all the wonderful Christmas that this boy has ever seen! Alone as Mr. Matuschek and together they can enjoy a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you succeed in getting a delightful DVD, check out the great trailer where Frank Morgan introduced himself to Mr Matuschekin and the film's director - talented Ernst Lubitsch. This movie is a joy from beginning to end.
