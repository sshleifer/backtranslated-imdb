This film, which is critically acclaimed, has not, of course, yet been released on DVD in the United States, as is the second major - "Household" by Christine Lahti in the same year. But if you can support DVDs from region 4 (Australia), this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still copies of VHS on the Internet. It also complements this great story, as well as the memorable productions of its supporting paints, especially Claudia Carvani and late, great Jan Adele. Amazingly or not, this movie and its stars went past the Academy Awards, as well as "housekeeping", but meet yourself both - you're glad you did!
