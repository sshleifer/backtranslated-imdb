A very good drama, although some empty areas seemed to leave the viewers to perform themselves. I can imagine that life is someone who can't read or write. This movie just created the real world: a woman who is suddenly the only supporter, live-in relatives and their quarrels, a troubled child who can knock and then usually go out of school, a jackass-spouse who takes a nest egg and buys a beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
