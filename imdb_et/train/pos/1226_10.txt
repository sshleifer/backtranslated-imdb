They filmed this movie on a long island where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras from this movie. Obviously, some party scenes where they all drink beer (which they told me about colored water tasted nasty and it was very difficult to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in fox scenes). Yet, none of us ever heard that the film was released in any form. In theaters it never appeared (probably), and when I knew it was never published on video and I'm sure it wasn't published on DVD. However, some people seem to have seen it, though probably very little. So there has to be something. I would love to buy it for my brother, but I can't find it. Does anyone know when / where / how to buy this movie? And what format would it be?
