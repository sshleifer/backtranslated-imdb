Mina Kumari exhibits more style and grace simply by moving from the floor, sitting on the floor as you find most of the other films. The director has brought more memorable scenes about beauty than it seems possible. Music and dance are of the highest possible quality. The first dance picture shows that the director has all the things in the background: another girl dances, drunk down the stairs, a lot of activities, but he knew we'd watch Dance and Contribute if you didn't notice it many times. total, perfection.JQ
