I love this example! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats that are so different from each other, but they point to "brothers" together. I often have to try to nurture the tiring stress of my brother, Hove or even Gordon Scotland. More episodes of human Kimberly should be made. An episode of cats hiding themselves as teenage girls to escape the human Kimberly sneaking fight to get their thirst for their favorite drink Rootbeer is a fun classic. We cannot drink vegetables in our house without making kaskcratch voices or Hanson Brothers "Slap Shot". Future classic. Where can I get the first two seasons on a DVD?
