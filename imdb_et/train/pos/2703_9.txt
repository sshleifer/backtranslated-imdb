I'm not a big fan of the camp layer and a "so bad it's good" viewing type. But I like this movie as a fun factor and - believe it or not - it's an innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole thing contains a circle of John Waters and is unlimitedly enthusiastic, but some great actors and consider the direction and stylized movements. Billy Zane moves with an incredible output (see a textbook lesson on the scene on the bus) and is framed with some unexpected letters. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie to enjoy it, but if you have the opportunity to watch it, save time because you will probably end up with a smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humor of some big stars. Highly recommended.
