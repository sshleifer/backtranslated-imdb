One of my friends suggested this movie, citing their vocal and inflationary similarities with the film's main character Des Howl. I think I can see it and maybe a little more, I'm not sure if it's a flattering image. <br /> <br /> This is a very unique piece of work, the only movie to which it may be more than the apparent resemblance would be real romance, not the content of the filming or the pace of style or dialogue (whale music is just so much, well, relaxed.) But instead of both representing modern love stories. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm a big movie fan of Canadian music and musicians (for example, I highly recommend the Hard Core logo) and especially the movie. It has an innocent charm, Des is not always the most pleasing man, but he has something that draws some sort of empathy.
