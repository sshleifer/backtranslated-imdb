To see this movie, I can give you four reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. The four best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories related to the big scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. Surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. Reasonable contemplation in this country (and many others) for the biggest problems. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie, which has a good story in a comedy sense, a body that practices blackmail against ordinary people and is still waiting to evaluate their efforts. <br /> <br /> Then, Antonio Serrano will be more dramatic in the second piece, giving an Italian anecdote to "Neo-Realism". <br /> <br /> In the third story, Carlos Carrera speaks more independent of this series, but tells us that a person is in the wrong place at the wrong place. But after the recent lynching of Tlahuac and the tradition of this awful issue in the State of Mexico, this story could no longer be renewed. <br /> <br /> And finally, Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark finale "Grand Finale", where he brings together most of the stars from earlier sequences into one of the best comedy pieces ever filmed. Sariñana gives the central scene one of her earlier films "Todo el poder", which gives a final lesson on the topic. And by the way, give us a scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti for short striptease. <br /> <br /> When the movie is over, you can feel the bittersweet watching a good movie (and maybe I enjoyed it very painfully. They say Mexico is laughing at their shame and this is the best example. how the Mexicans have learned to live a crime in the middle of the country (and possibly against it), between two fires: criminals and the so-called authorities that are full of corruption, even this movie is pointless thinking because almost all good people have been victims of crime and If you had an attack without zero, then you are lucky. In the meantime, you won't lose the chance to see this movie, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
