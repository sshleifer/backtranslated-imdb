I like this great baseball movie! It's a good cast, including two huge actresses and two of my favorites, Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this movie are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has great special effects and shows all the actors in the movie! Baseball scenes are all realistic! The music of composer Randy Edelman is very good and it fits very well to the film! Some actors who reminded me of real baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson's Ray Mitchell character reminded me of Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley, and Jay O. Sanders commentator in my opinion reminded me how Al Hrabosky sees today. This is a fantastic movie for non-baseball fans and I recommend this movie!
