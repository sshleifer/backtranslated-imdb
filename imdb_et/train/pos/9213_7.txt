Gómez Pereira is responsible for some of Spain's most bizarre comedies (see his curriculum vitae) so I didn't expect much "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... Actually I don't know why I decided to watch it in the world. Anyway, I just did ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gómez Pereira has finally matured and is now able to make a good movie. He is the last job to deal with a crisis in the center, a disappointment and a second chance after you have destroyed everything. The last half-hour of the movie (the more dramatic) is the best part and it's just worth watching the movie. We also have Eduard Fernandez, who plays a major role, and I think he is the best actor of his generation (far away). <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
