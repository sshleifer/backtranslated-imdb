Really, I think this movie is more of a simple target than a really bad film. In fact, the film is doing very well in many aspects and is very fun. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit complicated, but it's a genre. The film has a noirish atmosphere that focuses on femme fatale. Like all the old noir classics, it is also a manuscript that revolves around you, so you don't always know how to understand it first, and it can be stretching if you think too deeply and try to put all the pieces together. It's a genre. In general, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer away and, in turn, surprised by the viewer without giving up. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also a simple target. The truth is that she looks good and she talks to her dual participant in a mass-laden dialogue so that it gets something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> The direction is more than satisfactory, because let's face it - you have to keep the audience interested "whether he or she?" question in two hours. In addition to the sophisticated script and Stone's entertaining performance, it is effectively heading in, while creating a dark and very harsh and modern noirish atmosphere. sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - press the pause everywhere and there is something interesting for the eye. , especially sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" it is treated more in reality here and is usually used to make the film more sexual. It is still dynamic, but it is not so easy that the shock is worth and buzz as in the first. I'm not saying it's still not a trick because we see that this movie should be fun. <br /> <br /> A fun movie. It may be a light target, but if you look at what it is: noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisted, sexy, non-ta-or-no-he-dunnit, you are sure to be glad it is not seen.
