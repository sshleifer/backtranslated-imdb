It helps when you understand the Czech language and see it in the original language and understand Czech detention with "Professionals", but if not, "Jedna ruka netlaska" is another big Czech film. It's funny, dark and extremely enjoyable. The highest compliment I can pay is that you never know what happens, even during the second and third viewing. <br /> <br /> For a small country, the Czech Republic has made an amazing number of world-class movies and literature, from Hababal, Hasek and Kundera to Menzel, Sverak, and many other films. Czech humor is by nature dark and often uncompromising, but often it is naive and warm. This movie is just that, it's inconvenient and deals with people's less loving facets, but there's a beautiful story full of promise, good intent and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it and most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved. Enjoy it, it's just a movie made for this reason - anyway, it's as close as the Czechs ever write a really happy ending ...
