I am a big fan of cinema blood and saw this movie because I heard it was interesting. I can honestly say it was really very interesting. The two leading actors are fantastic, the film is never boring and the concept behind it (although it is inspired by the killings of Columbine and the home videos of killers) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes, which actually reduces the realism observed in the first hour and the end does not make any sense. A disgusted camera can sometimes be annoying but in cinema blood that is given. But I still think that the film is very well done and director Ben Coccio deserves credit.
