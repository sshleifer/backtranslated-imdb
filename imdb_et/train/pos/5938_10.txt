Another exquisite taste that superhero movie should be after Batman: Dead Endi, which just helps to stimulate our tasting buds and leaves us more! It should be a real superhero movie and feel! Even hard this is the kind of fan film. The attention to detail, character and action is undoubtedly real. Although it is a production of scarce resources, it is shamed with big budget, star-shaped, mortgage products related to other superhero films. Here are the main and supportive characters and look like they are real people. Finally Superman, who actually looks "super" and looks like a real thing! Batman, how it should be, without glowing rubber molded, ripped body armor hide scrawny physiques over paid participants who do not give. I just want some sensible Warner Bros. exec gives OK to produce the full-length customization of this jewel. I don't care if it goes to theaters or directly to DVD, I'm never tired of watching it. Just the plot itself is worth it for my hard earned dough. I hope that the "big parks" of Marvel & DC productions will look and see what a real well-produced superhero movie should be. No more "Batman & Robin" fiasco, Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little leaders and learn that the "hero" of the movie "would not be needed" to be "bomb" theaters. Mr. Collora ... We need more leaders like you!
