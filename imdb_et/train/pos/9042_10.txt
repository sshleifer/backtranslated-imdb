I think I read it somewhere: Joe Johnston (film director and also one of the boys who founded industrial lighting and magic for the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something that hung up on his brain as "Rocket Boys" (I I guess there was nothing. <br /> <br /> One day they sent a computer program that forms words from other words (ie you enter a word or a series of words) and it interferes with the letters and other words) I think the technical term is "anagram" <br /> <br /> Anyway, they wrote "Rocket Boys" and certainly what is "October Sky". At least they were shocked. The title summarizes everything in the movie because the film rotates around Sputnik. Homer Jr didn't like the idea at first, but he warmed it up after the "movie novel" came out and went.
