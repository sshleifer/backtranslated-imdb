Rawhide was a great TV western series. Emphasizing a group of track drivers led by boss Gil Favor. Most of the episodes - especially the first 3 seasons - were indeed the researches of Favor and his men. Guest letters came and went, but unlike the wagon train, they rarely dominated the episodes they appeared. Rawhide was real, sharp west, and Gil Favor was a memorable character that was never forgotten. Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance, the show was a big hit. Of course, he was supported by a great example of great acting actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors left their own brand of television history. Rawhide has struck the taste of Western time, which has not yet been done by any other series. Later, the seasons began to share wires and give them an individual story. For a while, if it didn't work, the best stories were cattle breeders and regular. However, there were still some classical stories and Rawhide remained a top class. Black and white photography added a gloomy and realistic feeling that the second Western series was rarely hit. Rustlers, Indians, commancheroes, beautiful girls, serum killers, they all showed the problems of our heroes. The end came quietly when the last season was tentatively less than halfway. The reason - Eric Fleming had left and Rawhide was now almost without body - sharp realism had disappeared, Gil Favor commanded respect and affection - he was never infallible and made him even more interesting. We don't see her again. Always look at the episode whenever possible, they rarely disappoint.
