This really funny movie has nice characters, almost every strange middle-aged woman in Hollywood and a touching, funny story. Capomezza and Malacici are competitors in the neighborhood of New York, Italy. They are also on the opposite side of the taste scale. Their children are cast into the lead of the production of Romeo and Juliet Church. Of course they fall in love. On stage! The woes and confusion that it causes, as parents think about each other and their children, is played in front of Capomezza's excellent tasteless home and with their wonderfully tasted, catered weddings. <br /> <br /> Four senior elders and charming young lovers, the characters contain a vaguely clever priest, a grandma's grandmother, a woman who waves a wave and passes the spiritual advice she receives from a medium called Blessed Roscoe, a motel with beds there is a car in the back seat and two doves. There is no line of sight or stroke that doesn't click in this fast paced movie. <br /> <br /> Even the names of these two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" may be interpreted as "low finger" and "Malacici" may mean so-called. <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. When Bette Midler tortures you, you may not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love it!
