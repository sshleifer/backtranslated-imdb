I waited for the time to post this documentary, because when I first saw it ten years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> From a documentary point of view, I found it to be a good documentary. He did what he did, show me something that I had no idea and kept me interested about the world he was looking at. I didn't know about Drag about the world, and I know about them, and "Balls" was just remarkable to me. These people were just as talented as they did and how they did it. Foolish people, complainants (even when I was angry when someone told the judge that the hair that Drag Queen wore was not a man's coat!), Jealous, that's all there in every other competition. Like any other race, it likes it. What I felt was a point. even those who watched the future of balls change even more when they were ready to walk on the track. It was interesting to hear that some contestants lived on the street two minutes before the ball, but came to compete, it was important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories about who "house" and "house mother" brought out the best and brightest competitors. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now that 10 years after this movie, I lived through Madonna's madness. With this documentary I saw a couple of familiar faces that ended during Madonna's "Vogue" phase and rightly so. If not for these people, Madonna would not have been in the "Vogue" stage, I know it now. Credit should be given if the credit is DUE. Makes me think when someone else from mainstream America watches this documentary, they learn they're not as "mainstream" as they think.
