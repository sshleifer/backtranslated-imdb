The pilot is very well done. This provides how characters are binding in future episodes. I don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. This shows considerable creativity for writers. Although not all succeeded because it was the first episode, the pilot showed many events that took place in the future. For example, there could be a future relationship between Ross and Rachels. Although the nervousness of the first episode appeared, it was overcome with amazing land and outstanding selection. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start for invincible comedy!
