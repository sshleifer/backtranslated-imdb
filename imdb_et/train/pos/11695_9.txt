It's such a big movie! Don't forget the low rating here. I really have no idea where it came from, so they have to discuss another movie. Because I loved it and found it a tiny hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> This story was so original and charming. I really don't think anything bad about that. Maybe it must be "your thing," but I saw it with my sister and mother and we all took it. <br /> <br /> Action was also very good and it's hard to do in such a movie. But I found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Dougray Scott and found his new "dark" role very interesting. It's really terrible for me to be a bad guy, but I had no problem this time. What's more, I adored her. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama that also has a good love and tragedy should definitely watch this movie, no question! Anyone who wants to see a 80% blood supply movie should go for something else, but .. But I think the title is already that. This is a love story, not seen 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie five out of five stars !!! Good job !!! <br /> <br /> xxx Enjoy!
