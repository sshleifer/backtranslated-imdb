ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a special place in my heart because it introduced me to Ramones. I was too young to be very aware of them during the mid-70s of the band, even though I had an older cousin who was a big fan at that time. I finally saw RNRHS on television in the afternoon of the mid-80s when I was about fifteen years old and laughed at it all. (Wasn't every high school child's dream to throw away his school trash and break everything?) I wrote a year or two after the film's next incitement and watched the Ramones concert sequences over and over again, I thought, "men, these guys threw! I have my albums look through!" The rest is history. Twenty years, the umpteen Ramones LPs / CDs / CDs and the three Ramones later show they are still one of my all time favorite bands, and the RNRHS still breaks me every time I watch it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (R.I.P. all), we have at least this movie and a lot of music to remember.
