I saw it in the theater when it was first released, and it was annoying, because I'm sure it would still be. It was the first part of the '68, and it was still around in the United States, and recently there was a mass murder in my home town, where I saw it when a man went on a shooting rifle. The freshness of this nearby event, along with its dramatic real story, was a very disturbing theater experience. It really brought Robert Blake and Scott Wilson an excellent show. I was familiar with Truman Capote's real event-based novel, and Richard Brooks's scenario and direction brought the event and Truman's interpretation into a compelling cinematic adaptation. Quincy Jones's music is an effective way to appreciate the story. I've seen it a couple of times. It was too real. Almost like a criminal witness and with killers. I would give it to 9.0 as possible 10. Society today is so sensitive to violence and crime that it seems to be slow and tedious and can be seen as having a lesser impact, but for all over the age of 50 it is a sign of criminal proceedings. psyche.
