Thanks to God ABC chose this Fox instead. The best description (for those who feel) is really Wonderfalls will meet Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the experience of death and fate makes me a fan of Brian Fuller's creations, but I certainly enjoy his productions. I also like squared floors, pies, toys, gravelings, and other things to donate :) Sometimes I think it's a niche that doesn't require J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground. Here we find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood that fall into each other and actually create and make us want to live life completely!
