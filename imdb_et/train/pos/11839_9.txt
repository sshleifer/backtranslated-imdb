This movie was a lot of fun. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is just beautiful and inspirational. More impressive is Brian Adams, who makes all the songs in French. The result is also exaggerating and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film is made from a combination of traditional animation and computer generated images. The result is truly stunning. I watch this movie at least once a week with kids and we never rob him. The story is convincing and well told. <br /> <br /> I don't understand anyone who is less than 7 of that movie's rank.
