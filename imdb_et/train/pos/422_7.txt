"Plainsman" represents Cecil B. DeMille's performance, which is the most inaccurate and factual. It creates parallel plots for no less than the stars when united by Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer, and Abraham Lincoln, although in fact Lincoln was at a time when the story goes on. Every time DeMille swims, it gets dangerously close to the truth, but just as easily pulls out the spectacular spectacle and exemplification. The film is an attempt to affix Custer's latest tripod with a fancy heap, based only loosely on the lives of people already made of products and legends. Indeed, this is the world according to DeMille - an entertaining entertainment for journalists, but according to today's standards, it is quite a horrible relic. , which often have pure white and very solid black. In some scenes, there is a significant amount of film grain and its absence at other moments. All in all, the quality of the picture is somewhat inconsistent, but is it never bad or good? just a little better than the middle of the road. Age-related items are kept to a minimum and digital deviations do not attract attention. The sound is mono but well balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget about it. It's universal! BOTTOM LINE: As the pseudo-history has been painted on celluloid, it's Western weighty and fun. Take your characters and story with a salt blade? in some cases ?? the whole box is more suitable!
