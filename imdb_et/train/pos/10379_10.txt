Plato's run is a fun b movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown movie, so one I saw it while driving, I thought it seemed entertaining. I was fair. Gary Busey is playing Plato Smith's harsh mercenary who has been murdered by a powerful Cuban criminal lord now Plato must live long enough to prove his innocence with his friends, played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (expert). what I liked about Plato's move was how the movie never got bored because it was already done, but it was still good for the actor to have fun and it was fun, especially when Gima Busey's climax is good hero ironic as he usually plays bad boy and Steve Bauer is good because Plato's sidekick even Jeff Speaksman is doing good and he can't even do well if this Plato finish is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and give him 7 out of 10- st
