The premise of this film is simple and so is the script: an older Muslim gets her teenage son to guide her like her older French station in Saudi Arabia to Mecca so she can fulfill her sacred Muslim commitment before she dies. The Father is clearly devoted to the religious, but the son is impressive; he rather accepts his father as a religion; he would rather be his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in many things that the son does not understand and the misery between them is a device that preserves drama, although it is often quite unpleasant. However, as with any good road film, odd signs have arisen on the journey; for example, a female Croatian upside down, who, after being sent to Belgrade, is simply asked on the back side and guides one word with their hands, which they assume they are in place but can't find it on the map. In Bulgaria, another man asks that he says he can speak French, but then gives a thorough comment in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor - in one country a son eats eggs and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (maybe fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before a father can make a Muslim killer ritual. Finally, they make Mecca - the Vatican Muslim form, but on a much larger scale. For the West, it's all odd but exciting. The film is not complicated, but it is charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with soul.
