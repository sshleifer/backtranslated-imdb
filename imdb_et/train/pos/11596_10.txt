I've seen this movie when I was about 7 years old - it was 33 years ago - and I didn't forget this movie! I was deeply touched and moved by a brave little boy and a beautiful eagle. And I just couldn't believe it when he became an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was dying ... <br /> <br /> My sister was with me in the movie and I asked her recently when she remembers the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle, and he said he remembered it as we saw it only yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is NEED !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget it - just like my sister and I ...
