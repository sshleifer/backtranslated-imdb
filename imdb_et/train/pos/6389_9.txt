Stones are definitely one of the best comedy independent movies. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy it. For some reason, this film has not received a loan. First, let's start with a storyline that everyone loves good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters behind the hidden treasure hints, it brings not only two families together, but starts a swirl adventure. Mix Polish translator, coma mother, tower head with turrets syndrome, twisted homosexual hypnotist and one dragon queen, money not only makes the world round, but can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie should be a sister / crack addict with tower syndrome, his sudden break begins to cry and imitate for weeks.
