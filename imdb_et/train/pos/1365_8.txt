Ta-hey! It's a really fun movie. Basically, Party Girl has her own fun-loving, independent, early 90's New Yorker chick. Together with his party friends, he meets a mature Turkish seller. This is an age history for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It is comforting to see a female striker develop into a mature woman. Hope is given to all the slippers who may feel that their only skills are able to hold and nack a good party. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes this movie big. I've never been his big fan, but this movie just makes me watch all his movies. His character is enhanced by fine manners. If you want a good laugh and fun time, check out this movie. Repeated viewing is mandatory.
