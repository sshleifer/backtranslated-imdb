I thought it was a totally charming movie. The story seems to be John Water's thin reflected autobiography: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong takes the lead, but his best performances are his grandmother, Mink Stole (fun cafe) and all the people at Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are on this basis. They seem to take the worst value of the Pecker gospel when I think the film clearly says that it is indeed a promising artist.
