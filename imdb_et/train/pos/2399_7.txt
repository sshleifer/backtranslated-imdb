It was hit by the South West (SXSW) film festival in Austin last year and there is a fine cast, headed by E.R. Gloria Reuben and Landscape Chewing John Glover. Although the film is made with a small budget in NYC, it looks and sounds awesome and leads us behind the scenes through what the actors call "The Scottish Play", referring to "Macbeth". is thought to bring the game to an old desire. The actor has exhibited all of the game's own, lust, jealousy, rage, suspicion and some fun emotions. The games begin when the actress achieved is replaced (in a leading role) by the "real face" of the TV soap opera scene, to get a larger crowd. The green-eyed monster takes over and drama opens nicely. Fine soundtrack and good performances everywhere. The DVD also includes director reviews and some deleted scenes.
