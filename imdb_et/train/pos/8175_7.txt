Before we start, I have the fear of dentists. This film gives me a slip and even makes me forced. I love this movie. The film is so boring. To do this, take out 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The film is spoken by Dr. Alan Feinstone, who has just discovered that his wife has been cheating on him. Soon he will have hallucinations and start torturing his patients by killing his associates, and he has even died of his wife and killed the man with whom he had a thing. <br /> <br /> * End of Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is very bloody and passionate. I would recommend it if you are gore. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your usual daily dentist!
