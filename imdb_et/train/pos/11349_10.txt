This movie may have a questionable pedigree because it's made for a TV, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It's thrilling, exciting and it sucks you completely. The story that a person who is willing to threaten his career in order to save the lives of future victims is a blow to the killer in Russia would be a weighty story if it were a fiction, but it is probably a real story. I highly recommend it.
