According to this board, I think you love it or hate it. Usually how it goes to all movies. However, it is not necessary to test with others. Everything we do here gives opinions. I rented this movie last night and I want to come and throw my opinion into the mix. I was surprised how many people were throwing it. The difference is the fan of the movie and the fan of the horror film. I'm a fan of horror movies. Most of the usual movie fans don't like horror movies. With so many low budget cam corder looking for movies coming these days. It's hard to keep up. And what makes it difficult for them to stay in the movies is how bad it is. I wanted to come and write a review of "The Dead of Dead" because it's pretty fucking good compared to the rest of the spam there. It's not special, but it's a horror filmmaker who is trying to be too serious, which ultimately makes a horrible horror film. I really liked it. You tell me that there is no effort in this? And one more thing, I bet you all have all those great DVD collections that you are so proud of, just big mobile pictures? There is nothing wrong with this, but you need to know how to evaluate a low budget with independence. I knew what I got when I watched this movie. I'm not going to worry because I thought it was a $ 100 million movie. Some of you may need to look at the Matrix over and over, and stop comparing events with the matrix. And if most of you are under the age of 24, this will explain everything. Good movie, look at it.
