Okay. Yes, it was a very tight budget with errors of continuity (such as single scenes that were probably filmed in the sun and then shade and then mixed together), and as much as I love Nick Mancus, he often burned a little too good - part and some minor supporting pains were really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but striking roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very pleasant. Mancus had some good features, while Nancy Allen was ironic that he was completely gentle and uninteresting. Classic? Missing parts? Yes, yes. Entertaining? Great yes. I would have loved to have a sure day when they decided what hairstyle Grieco would be. "Are you fast?" ... "It's not fast."
