If you see a Ren√© Clair movie that has such a disturbed semi-attention that is the rule of watching television, it may be better to do something else. <br /> <br /> Watching "Le Million", paying special attention to what's going on in front of your eyes and ears, opens up a rich detail that keeps this musical comedy happy from the start of the explosion to the end. <br /> <br /> The Danish journalist Berlingske Tidende once wrote a journalist: "On my younger days I saw a movie that made me dance to a cinema home. This movie is on television today - look at it!"
