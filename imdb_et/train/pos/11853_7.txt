Life Pod is one of those movies that you just look at and try not to analyze too hard. Working at best is rather amateurish. The special effects are probably a low budget, but not too bad. The story is a reserve, but an interesting twist. Starting your computer, but not exactly your computer and running amok, is very understandable when the truth comes out. However, the film has moments and is quite observable. For me, at least part of this film's appeal is a prominent role for Kristine DeBell. He may not be the world's greatest actor, but being a former playmate, he is cute enough. In all Life Pods, there are many similar low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> White Star Lines is a little cute if it's completely inaccurate. The Last White Star Lines Company was bought by Cunard Lines in 1947 and the last ship flying under the White Star was Britannic (not the Titanic sister), which was sold in 1960 as scrap.
