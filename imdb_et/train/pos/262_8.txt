*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie "The Divers" is really interesting. I knew it would include Nazi history, underwater scenes, and everything in Danish. But I decided to review it for one reason, the fact that the story evolves around the sunken WWII German submarine. I have a fetish for German slaves, especially wrecks that can be broken. So I was a little skeptical about the part of Denmark, but I argued that this part could consider this part. Knowing that Nordic films are not always so good and not sure about the size of the budget, I was at least skeptical. <br /> <br /> While watching, I was ... surprised. <br /> <br /> I had thoughts about the participants being inadequate, seeing how some are very young, especially the two main players. It wasn't an issue, they both worked very well. Like other participants, mostly composed of 50s and more. This makes some interesting interaction between the young and the old, which is not often seen on the screen. In no case is it unique but somewhat rare. And that's all good. <br /> <br /> Danish is almost impossible to understand. But it wasn't a problem, it was subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspected that both the submarine's interior images and underwater images. Having decided that the budget is small, I thought it might be the best and the lowest of the best terrible when it was the worst. Again, I was surprised that the wreckage's exterior shapes are beautiful and the inner scenes are very realistic. Being a fetish for the Germans, I knew what that subunit would look like, especially inside, and was not allowed. The team has done some serious research. It's all good. <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than I watch this movie to see some sub-prints, so I think I have to issue a "warning". The movie submarine is not a real model during the war. This is a special purpose item. However, in order to give you a hint of what to expect, this is a cross between Type VII, Type IX, and Japan, similar to I-52. It's a god of good design and makes a nice wreck. <br /> <br /> The device is on a Danish island or peninsula, I can't remember. Summer time and two brothers are traveling with their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year. Their grandfather is a kind of sailor. Cinematic art is pretty nice, many of the island's docks have beautiful summer scenes, some renewed teenage love, nice diving and a general "perfect" feeling. What's more, it's all good. <br /> <br /> There are some suspects on the island, men are gathering a boat, an old miner and his team. One of the visitors, a man in his 50's, is tattooed by a German eagle and swastika. The elders of the island speak of everything when, at the end of the Second World War, a German u-boat sank and since then the gold of the Nazis has been more profoundly heard. The grandfather was one of the young men who immediately searched for the sunken U-boat after the German bodies began to swim to the shore in 1945. No submarine found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO TAKE <br /> /> The main elements are Nazi trials, Nazi history, treasure hunt, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy and ... surprise. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I wasn't expecting some supernatural elements to appear in this movie and it was trying to get me out of the guard. This is not a big fan of supernatural events, but it did fit the story well and did not cause any problems. It's not like "From the Twilight Space", where everyone eventually becomes vampires. That's a bit thinner. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: Really good movie, I gave it to 8. Some thanks to the fact that it's not an unlimited resource for a Hollywood movie. Later I learned that he had a fair budget and that some of the actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if it was a Hollywood production, I'd give it 7 or 8. Certainly it will cost your time. Yes, the child's story so, but then the ripe story again. It has a lot of tension and adventure, which I found very tempting. And again, cinema is really nice. <br /> <br /> Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
