I loved this movie from the opening to the end. I found that the style of the director / actor is very interesting to me / the audience. <br /> <br /> The most exciting and refreshing thing about this movie was that it was a disregard for gender and class stereotypes. The peculiarity of the characters is depicted as strengths, and the lack of judgment - and the acceptance of the characters themselves and each other - allowed me to embrace them and let themselves be drawn into my world. Without preaching and intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this film has the potential to open up new opportunities and hope for a world where people see and accept each other as unique and valuable people. Look forward to the offers of this creative and talented director.
