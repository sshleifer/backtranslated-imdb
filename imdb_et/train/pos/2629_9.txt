I wasn't sure when I heard about it. I was wondering how Disney is. I was wrong. I found it to be very good. I mean, it's not a Lion King, but it's cool to see you from the other side. It was very funny. It wasn't one of those nervous Disney lakes where animation sucks, like Lion King's animation. The only thing that bothered me was making the whole movie through the movie. Nothing to give, but you know what I'm talking about. I also know that it was cool when most of the cast was back from the original. It was a very good movie for everyone.
