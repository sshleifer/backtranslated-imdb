This is the latest addition to the new wave of educational documents, such as "The Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11". Its commentary is clear and steadfast if it is an amazing filmmaking feature of this well-designed feature. In the film, we can make a strong sense of how our world is insecure as we rush towards a green future at lightning speed - showing us our scary beauty for our progress. <br /> <br /> A really remarkable achievement for everyone who cares about the world we are leaving for our children. Bravo! <br /> <br /> NB! This is also the only movie (of 8) in Varsity theaters (Toronto) that has a sticky tag that reads ... "To organize group views, contact ...." ... additional proof of the gem's popularity and importance. <br /> <br /> My contribution ... The Academy Award nomination for the best documentary film. <br /> <br /> OB101
