I've been a fan of this movie for years and years. Because of Teri Hatchers, I was at the forefront, I had to look at the film from the shelf and watch it. Why didn't people see in 1991 how wonderful this movie was inside me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are fabulous. Although I never see a daily soap opera, this movie kills me every time I watch it. Actors are second in comedy and writing is so smart. I suggest you look at it if you haven't already. You can see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher to name a few ... all give great shows.
