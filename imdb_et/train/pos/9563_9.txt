First of all I would like to say that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee is looking much better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original films I've ever seen; Shows Cambodia's Poverty Lifestyle Background. Cambodia (Edison aka Pang) kills people to survive. has done it all his life. Sam Lee (Wai) is committed to catching up with Cambodia. There are many violent activities, but it has a good story. The film shows the struggles between the two characters; they both beat each other like an angry dog. Go and see the PPL ... ATTENTION! (GO HK FILMS)
