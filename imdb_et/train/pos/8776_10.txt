Just mention another thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the evaluations that make it one of Errol Flynn's biggest excursions during his great excursion career. I think this role plays the boxer Jim Corbett's rather real personality than the swashbucklers he had written. Flynn seemed to be a party to his memories and was a man whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. The additional thing I would like to mention is to note the great editing, transitions and still additions to the movies. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent partner with Flynn with Sid Hickox, the editing was compiled by a future editor named Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel went back so far, but he's been listed correctly. He went to great careers as Managing Director himself.
