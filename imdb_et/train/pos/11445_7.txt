A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides allow fans to see their work underway. Looking at Goldsworthy by building his pieces, he develops every stone, sheet and thorn used. Goldsworthy describes how life, rivers and tides inspire and influence his work. Although I was pleased that the film included most of the Goldsworthy pieces (snowballs), I felt that it was a bit long. The filmmakers did a great job of bringing Goldsworthy to work and creating a beautiful movie that was a joy to watch.
