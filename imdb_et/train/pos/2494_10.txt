The first two seasons of the comedy series were very strange and they weren't very funny and had a drama element where Bill (mother) struggled with all the common life problems, but this element was a bit frustrating and did not blend well with comedy elements that are probably the cause. After that, one of the funniest comedy magazines the BBC has ever done! The chemistry between Bill and Ben's character was very funny and there were always so many great and memorable sketches in each series. Christmas specials were fun and powerful.
