First of all, I would like to make a second review of this film, which said that the latest music won the Gigi Award for Best Picture Academy in 1958. This is false information when "West Side Story" won in 1962, "My Fair Lady" won in 1965, and the following year won "Sound of Music". This means that this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story of the novel has changed somewhat, but it is more due to the constraints they had at the stage they just didn't change for the filmed version. But I don't mind. In fact, I think that all the production flows better than the novel. I like Nancy, who brings a bridge to Oliver and kills her instead of a later apartment. The fine things in this movie are the ones that make me laugh. I love the moment when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble first come out of the governor's office. This moment's emphasis is great. My three favorite films for this film were Jack Wild, who plays Ron Moody, the most playful and humorous Fagin in the movie's most film format (this sign has been developed much better than he's in the book) and Shani Wallis, Nancy's strongest and most difficult version. The only reason I give 9 instead of 10 to this movie is due to two big product numbers, "Concider Yourself" and "Who Buy". I always hate to see musical choreography like people doing daily work and jobs. It looks terrible and cheesy, especially when they dance in a London meat product. They should have choreographed regularly for these scenes. But this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully forever.
