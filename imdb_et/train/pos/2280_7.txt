It's hard to categorize a movie - maybe it's an avant-garde spy thriller? Mother's Day is a very good Vonnegut novel, which is definitely one of her most simple novels to adapt to a long film. Customizing a movie is very loyal to the original book. The "Indie" approach to this film is probably more effective than financing a large Hollywood studio. These days, I doubt that an intelligent novel, like Mother's Day, would get a green light from a big Hollywood floor. And usually it is too bad, but not in this case. Mother's evening has a dense direction and a solid part. Nick Nolte, who seems to have better roles among older people, is still the "everyman" person who allows him to take different letters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and wonderful as always. I always thought he deserved better than the entertainment sector. I think making your own debut as a Twin Peaks with little air time is not an option, even if the TV show becomes a small phenomenon. Anyway, this movie is very enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may emerge, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history are confused by the events that occur (I am telling you, fellow students who are students and appreciate the lowest) in the geography, history and master of the industrial world knows what other items!).
