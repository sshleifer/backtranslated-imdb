Vladimir Navokov's literary genius is once again displayed and many people in the cultural world mark it. The director puts us in control of the story of Alexander, a chaplinesque study on German dependence. Nastasya is on vacation in a marble column where chess is hosted. She meets Alexander, picking up the queen's piece she falls into. Magnetic attraction is evolving, which is why he will propose the next day that his mother worried about the man's telegrams. He arrives and interviews Alexander to make them a thing of the past, the area of ​​godfather II, where we see a young Alexander, the child's miracle. She has been taken under the school teacher wing and is using her genius for 10 years, making big sums. Thinking that Alexander reached his top he would give up, but would become a legend. The old teacher returns, causing damage, trying to win the victory of Alexander's old rival. In a serious chess game where the World Chess Champion wins one way to immortality, chess ticks will end the day the next day. This day is Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher intervenes and Alexander is sent to a nervous division. Nastasya, holding her belly and looking through her hair with love, finds her strategy for the competition and follows the movements. Though the film is slipping off its Russian roots, its low back dresses are beautiful, Alexander plays his role extremely low. opponents king with his 3 paws and kings, sacrificing mate castle. Nastasya is a great game, but I feel its conclusion deserves more intensity, but perhaps emotions have been properly controlled when chess meant more to her than her. The Luzhini Ministry of Defense elegantly gives Navokov a glory, the complexity of his pictures is a world event that must not be missed.
