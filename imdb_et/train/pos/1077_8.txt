It is a comedy once it was and it was compared with two transformations - MONEY PIT and WE HAVE USED - but rather more about how 40 filmmakers had the pleasure of comedy that has disappeared since then. <br /> <br /> I was 15 when I first saw it and even in this delicate age I had a lot of laughter. Now, of course, the familiar adult frustrations, I see all that I miss the youth. <br /> <br /> Three main players ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... communicated perfectly, but the core of the film lies in the disappointments that have come to the dream. It is never as simple and free of invisible complications as one's imagination. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a classic comedy that still tries to do it.
