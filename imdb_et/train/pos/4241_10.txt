I loved this movie !!! The characters were the people you knew. A young man back from the service who still loved the girl he was left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect for both romantic and Donna Reed as his life's love. He seems to give him as if he was hungry for his eyes, as well as his hesitation and confusion, because his feelings were also played very well. The rest of the fashionable characters were perfect when they tried to put them together. The most touching scene, however, was the young couple's grandfather's home. I laughed in parts, shouted in some and enjoyed watching this movie. In fact, I've looked at it about 5 times. You must see the whole romantic.
