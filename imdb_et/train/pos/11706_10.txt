For all reviewers of this page, I have to say that this movie is worth it. So it was done in 1972, so what. The music in the movie was exactly the same time. People who haven't learned the culture of decades would think this film is a ball of cheese. Compared to the modern series "Left Behind", made for our time, it looks beautiful. But the only fun part of the movie is fashion, which was over 30 years ago. BUT. The message sent in this movie is very powerful and carefully preserved. There is so much to say, but I refuse to say so. (Fear of breaking it) So go out and watch this movie! If you don't like the message it sends, you have problems that need some attention!
