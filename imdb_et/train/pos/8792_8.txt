An entertaining kung fu film, where scenes that are cut from the middle chimney work, draw and fight. All cast is nice characters and skilled fighters. Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chani comedy is fun to watch and his harsh companion shows particularly impressive skills. For me, the only outstanding mistake in the film is cast - sometimes things get confused because film sticks and changes between different sub-blocks and some characters are not as perfect as you could <br /> <br /> But the kung fu movie must first be judged on the quality of the action and Surely by the Shaolin temple with this list. The film tends to have a high-quality battle that allows each character to show his skill against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> In general, the Shaolin temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu movie. Not up to a good Jet Li movie quality, but definitely worth looking for genre fans. My Rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Various Comments: The 1987 Warner Home Video Edition I saw was (predictably) poorly duplicated and had no fully cast and team credits.
