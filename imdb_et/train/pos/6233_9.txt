Speaking musically, Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers a new hat after Top Hat, if possible. While in the case of Jerome Kern's Roberta they were, follow the fleet with Randolph Scott with another singer, this time with Harriet Hilliard. Randolph Scott is a career-navy CPO, and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudevillian, who is colored by the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers as his former partner. But now these two shore holidays. Fred and Ginger come where they left, and Randy accidentally meets Ginger's brilliant sister Harriet, who is booming in true beauty. But Randy is a typical love and to leave his sailor. <br /> <br /> Again, Irving wrote a hit on Berlin, where he carefully monitored the production. Ginger can make truly outstanding voices with Let Yourself Go, which he and Fred dance later. The real hit of the show is Let's Face the Music and Dance, a number made in the Navy show. Step into the first Astaire and later danced by the couple, let's say that music and dance are one of the greatest romantic numbers ever written on the screen. Dancing on it is an absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I'm sure if I mention Harriet Hilliard, some young people might ask who it was. But they know as soon as I mention her with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. That's right for Ozzie and Harriet. This is a mysterious thing to me, why Harriet stopped singing when he just became David and Ricky's mother on television. Then he didn't even keep his name. <br /> <br /> Ozzie and Harriet didn't sing on television. As a singer, Ozzie was a bright imitation of Rudy Vallee, but Harriet could really bring it. She sings you Satan and the Moon and I'm here, but where you are, with both real hours and class. I suggest you see that you follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear Harriet Hilliard's incredibly forgotten today.
