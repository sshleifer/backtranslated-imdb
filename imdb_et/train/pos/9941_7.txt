You know this story - a group of happy non-hopes will enter the competition, which seems to have no chance of winning - this is the story Hollywood has done to death (bring it in, karate boy, escape wins, best) Best etc). Now Korea is giving it together with the Taekwondo team, who is fighting for glory? and guess what ??? the result is predictable but ultimately satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film doesn't fall on your face is cast by talented young people. you look to the end. <br /> <br /> Can fans of your typical martial arts film be disappointed? Taekwondo does not provide most of the movements and acrobatics seen in Kung Fu films; the action is limited (though impressive) to the hit and the accidental blow. This is not important, because it is the interaction between characters and their struggle to do something that makes this film a success.
