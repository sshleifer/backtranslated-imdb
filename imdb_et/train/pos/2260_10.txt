COUNCIL GOOD MOVIE! One that is seriously underestimated. The songs the children sing in the film gave me a feeling of pain, but also hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg brings a good result here, but the best result of the whole movie is what plays the character of the title. I wish she was more in the movies. <br /> <br /> This movie should be higher. I will give it a 10/10.
