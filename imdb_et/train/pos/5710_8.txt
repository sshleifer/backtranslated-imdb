Revolutionary music by Rene Clairi. If you want to see where the songs were for the first time, this is the place. This is the story of a hungry young artist who believes he has won a lottery like his creditors. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in his girlfriend's apartment and given to the current convict, who ... oh, but it says. <br /> <br /> It's a light and frothy story where a lot of dialogue is sung (most people think it didn't happen before Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). This is a movie they no longer do and rarely did. Its sound is a movie from the first days of playing a movie five or six years later. Clair moves his camera in a way that has not even been made by Busby Berkeley (although it is fair to compare two filmmakers is unfair because Berkeley basically made the dance tracks on the stage and Clair moved the camera through the "real world"). This is an amazing little movie. and its a charming movie that just smiles at you. It's just fluffy joy. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can't say more. It's just a nice little movie and it's really all you need to know.
