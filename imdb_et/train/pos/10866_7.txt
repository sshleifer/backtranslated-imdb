Johnnie To's election also features a cool music opening credit and a nice opening credit design, a Chinese alphabet of kaleidoscopes, and those Asian mobiles who constantly swear or give some sacred things; In fact, the whole glow is nice. I found about To Bishop Seraphim Sigismund and was quite eager to see the To To movie. What I started choosing is exciting and interesting, and according to today's standards, it is violently and violently violent; The story of the Asian godfather scheme, he uses elements of puzzle, violent facts about mobstri life, skepticism, true details and, as with Coppola, it is assumed that some morally glamorous mobsters are right and nice and pleasant. The performances are reasonably amusing and colorful. <br /> <br /> SELECTION is well-made in Hong Kong's pleasant, somewhat careless style; the end is bitter, real, straight and scares children.
