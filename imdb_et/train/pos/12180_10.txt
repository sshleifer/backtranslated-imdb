In my opinion, GUY THING is a fun, witty, sexy, romantic and absolutely beautiful chick flick that boys enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles were dazzled by the astonished groom and his soon-to-be-sexy sister. If you ask me, they ignited the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I sealed it up, I would like to say that the performances were top-notch, the direction was flawless, the production design was nice, the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles. You're a lot of laugh and excitement, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, get back with a friend and see it.
