Scots stand out with storytelling. Traditional variety. Many years after the event, I can see in my eyes the battle between my older wife, my friend's mother, Culloden. He makes the characters alive. His passion is the witness of the eye. One of the events that has lived a few miles or far from where he lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, it happened many years before he was born, but you don't think he's talking about it. The same story is also said about the length and breadth of Scotland. When I discussed this with a one-night friend in Mallaigi, local cutting to give my version. The discussion continued until the closure. <br /> <br /> Such stories have become part of our nature. Who doesn't remember the stories our parents told us when we were kids? They become our invisible world. And when we get older, they can still be an inspiration or an emotional reservoir. Fact and fiction are mixed with aspiration, role models. Warning Stories. Archetypes. Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, like my grandfather and his grandfather before him." Our protagonist introduces us to us. It also introduces a story that extends to generations. It produces stories inside the stories. The stories that create the impenetrable miracle of Scotland, its harsh hills hiding the fog. Legend of stuff. But Seach is actually rooted. It gives him a special charm. It has a harsh beauty and authenticity that has been hardened with some of the best gels. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) will visit his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death. He's burning with frustration. Some of him want to be in the twenty-first century to hang in Glasgow. But he has been raised on the west coast among the Gaelic community. <br /> <br /> However, he has a deeper conflict. He wants to know the truth. The truth behind his grandfather's old stories. Where does fiction end? And he wants to know the truth behind his parents' death. <br /> <br /> He has pulled the last fateful journey to the summit of one of Scotland's most inaccessible mountains. Can the truth be said? Or is it all in the stories? <br /> <br /> In this story, we look again at the bloody battles, the poisoned lovers, the accepted truths of old folklore and sometimes deceptive folklore. By doing this, we connect every Angus as he lives the story of his life. <br /> <br /> Seachd: Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest, modest and truly beautiful Scottish movie. Like Angus, I got a little bit of anxiety to hang the story for more stories. But like Angus, I gave it when I saw a "bigger picture". Forget about Braveheart's and its similar boxes. You might even give up the famous drama of The Wicker Man. For Scotland to see the right movie, it's probably unique. If you may think about it deep enough, you can even reassess the power of storytelling and an aging question, whether there are some truths that cannot be said, but only to experience.
