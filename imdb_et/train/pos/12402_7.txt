** Warning! Spoiler Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> This short is part of two, which explains the short part of "Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix came. Because we already know the story, the plot itself is not surprising; and short is not as fun as informative. But this is the way it is in the historical archives. Visuals are better than average and generally cold colors will help you achieve a short goal. <br /> <br /> A couple of problems. The story of violence is a bit free and combined with a random dose of political correctness (UN scenes), which reduces the short straight narrative. In addition, it must be seen with the other part to be complete. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is brilliant and, despite some problems, it still serves its purpose. It would not suit style, content or flow to the original film. This is the ideal method for presenting history. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: good information. You could say a little bit better, but still solid 7 out of 10.
