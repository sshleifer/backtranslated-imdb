You must admit that Devil has eyes on beauty and talent. She gave a break to Zeena Aman, successful models and a former beauty contest winner, giving her a role that was tailored to her debut. His remarkable, stony appearance and the penetration of his hypnotizing music made him an immediate exponent. This film is a fondness for the eyes, it is a picturesque place, ethnic people, those Buddha temples and a passionate, naughty Mumtaz, who looks pretty attractive in terms of ethnic wear and dance skills. Dev is naturally divine and is one of his commercially successful achievements. Hare Rama manages to keep an interest in interest, a carefully written script, editing and enchanting music. Like Des Pardes, his second film, Anand has dealt with the issue of young people who have become addicted to drugs, and their theories that come from disturbed families and from a difficult childhood are quite plausible. A good entertainer, this movie keeps freshness till date!
