Man, I loved this movie! It takes me back when I was a child. These were the days when teachers were still showing reel-to-line movies in the classroom, and if you were good, they would turn the movie back slowly so you could look back. I still remember one of the lines that open ... "Tutazema was his name and he was an orphan. He lived with his sister in the village." It's a great movie for kids and lasting like a red balloon. Finally, other boys in the Indian village affirm feathers with Tutazema and become the eagle himself. He can live the way he always wanted. He can breathe heaven.
