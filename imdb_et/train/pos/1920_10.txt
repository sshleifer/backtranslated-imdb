Paul Hennessy and his wife Cate have to deal with their two teenage daughters and a strange son ... But after John Ritter's premature end, the exhibition began to cope with the disappearance of a loved one ... <br /> <br /> I found this show through channels one afternoon and i have to say that i smiled myself until my ribs hurt, just in the range of characters; spiritual traits and the situation that Paul found mostly with his daughters ... Since then, I hit the rest of the show when I was free, and I have to say that writing was very good. John Ritter's Death ... Shortly thereafter, I looked at "Goodbye" part 2 and I have to say that I was almost in tears looking at the characters' emotions, losing a loved one ... How Rory hits the wall with anger and frustration. ..How does Cate work alone to sleep on her bed ... Briget and Kerry talk about what they should have done. <br /> <br /> The show is moving forward, bringing Jim Egan and CJ Barnes to the big smile, as Cate's father tries to protect his family and give Rory a "human challenge" ... But the real pearl is CJ ... who is absolutely fun as a wild cousin. <br /> <br /> It's always John Ritter's masterpiece.
