Jeopardy feels like it is a stock movie, one of the films pumped out between the big budgets / offices. It's just 70 minutes and it doesn't contain many sets and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is once again a tough lady when she escaped a conviction, seeking help for her trapped man in the Mexican desert. Most of the film is focused on how he deals with his captain, who wants him in return for help. Some psychological struggles there. <br /> <br /> This is a surprisingly effective little film - its short length makes it tough and Stanwyck is great to go without mentioning (but I always praise him every time).
