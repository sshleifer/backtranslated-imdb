Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Big movies. But nothing, and I mean, nothing is living with the most powerful Christmas movie, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The film is so big and has so many messages, I cried watching it. Seriously, this is one of those movies you have to watch 10 times. When we see that Pitch is told he has to eat ice cream, we see sadness in his eyes and we feel deep sorrow and then think ... what is that ice cream so bad? Does that mean we as people treat ice cream as good as everything that is, makes us evil? Think about the way you think about the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is best for Santa Claus. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see her capturing children and spying on children dreams and we wonder; Do we really believe that Santa is so good? This Santa also mentions Christ, all meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You are indebted to this cinematic masterpiece. We should just stop making movies and air, but it's epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Who says this movie is bad is an unknown stupid.
