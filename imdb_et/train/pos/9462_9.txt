Clean up a family-oriented movie. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried that I wouldn't see Steve Carrell as anything other than the office bull Michael. Boy, I was wrong. He should win the Oscar. I will definitely buy it from the DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and he's not in this type of movie. I saw it with two other pairs in the 30-year range and we all agreed that it was the best film we saw for a long time and certainly the cleanest. Only one cuss word! Not even sure why it was PG13. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, drama, romance and more!
