Many people appreciate it as a fan service movie because there are many superstars in this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom are very famous singers in Japan). But don't think about it before you look, that's what I'm saying. Gackt and the staff are very serious about making this movie and they worked so hard. This is a good movie with a meaningful story. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. They did as good as I couldn't look at it again. <br /> <br /> The story has written quite well, but I admit that their act is disappointing. This is especially true for Hyde because his skills to act are below others and it is strange to hear the way he speaks other languages ​​except his native language (Japan). But it is understandable because it is their first time to act in the film. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us how someone can be as weak as they lose the most important person in their lives. When Toshi was killed when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che into a similar vampire because he wouldn't let him die when Sho's brother died, Kei Shoot Son dies and the best and most beautiful scene is when Sho goes away. even i said Hyde's skill is still weird, but i'll give him two scenes in this scene! <br /> <br /> There is a time when the plot moves too fast, as they didn't say why the Son can join a local mafia and be Sho's enemy because they are a good friend in the past and the Son is Sho's legal brother. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I love this movie ~ (very much ^ ^). <br /> <br /> This is a fascinating beautiful story.
