I feel confused and different personal taste in the reactions of this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, here are the scientific stereotypes. Even martial arts stereotypes. Everything well and good and sure, not all completely ready. But I feel that one important point in this film is neglected ... the cultural importance of this location. The film is placed in Florida Pensacola and does not try to say it. In today's world of film, it is a bold move and a rare treatment for film fans. And indeed, it may not be the last. Pensacola is world-renowned as a naval city, a city of aviation, lumber, and sometimes even political contradiction. It is rarely seen as a growing movie town. But it all changes now. More movie companies are coming to shoot. And more native Pensacollas discover the power of cinema. This film is part of the growing trend of Pensacola-based indy films and is still on the way. Pensacola makes a big noise in the global film community and the world takes more attention. Look and listen to the world. Penschaids are coming. Like a virus.
