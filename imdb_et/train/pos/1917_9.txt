It was a wonderfully funny comedy with great pain. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were completely older, and the kids were also great. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, a sort of toned version of Kelly Bundy married with children. Writing and performances were both first class. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series and put things down. They had to change the show and bring in more cast members, and that was probably an awkward situation, but they did it well. James Garner was a good addition. It could have taken longer than Ritter lived. <br /> <br /> I loved it especially when they brought Ed O'Neill on the spot. It was great. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
