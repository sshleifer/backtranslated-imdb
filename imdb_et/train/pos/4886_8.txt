The Blond of the Bombshells is a fun rhinitis fluff. Judy Dench plays at the relaxed ends of Elizabeth's newborn wife. She has spent most of her life with a mandatory wife and mother, but has never been really happy. <br /> <br /> Just after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth regularly stays with her lunch. children when he places a street performer. It shines memories of being a member of the swing bands of all girls in London during World War II. We'll soon find out that the band wasn't exactly the girl, because the drummer was the man who dressed in the area of ​​the woman. Some like this hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth pulls out her scar (which she has been practicing secretly throughout her marriage)) and joins forces with a street musician playing guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than the guitarist and the money is starting to flow. He doesn't take the money because he's rich and doesn't need it. His playing is strictly artistic performance. <br /> <br /> One day, Elizabeth will see Patrick (Ian Holm), a band drummer-in-drag. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - pretty lady and Elizabeth - being only fifteen - was the only band member who didn't experience Patrick's "talents" after drumming. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to play with her granddaughter's school dance again. So the delightful journey on the memory card begins with the humorous journey of film - everything is a really good swing and blues. <br /> <br /> I think I'm at the age when I really enjoy older actors doing their things, and this movie is a treasure because it not only fills Judi Dench but is supported by no less than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron and many experienced British character actors. It's all with Cleo Laine's extraordinary voice. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is fluffy, but absolutely pleasant and extremely fun.
