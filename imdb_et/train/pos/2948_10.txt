With Eddie Murphy, this extremely funny stand display should be against the law. I've never seen anything like that before. <br /> <br /> Murphy goes for almost 70 minutes about dicks, pussy, tits and attacks by so many famous people, including his own "family". Among the people receiving this murphy are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I've never been so much laughing at what my whole life is like. I mean, if a person doesn't know who Mr. T is, but still laughs as much as Murphy as Mr. T, there's something. When I saw this example, I couldn't remember who Mr T. was, but still laughed. Now I know who he is and what makes it so fun. Because that's what Eddie does - he can make those impressions so good that it doesn't matter who the hell he's trying to do, it's still fun. And besides, we learn that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please check it out ..
