It is hard to imagine that this film is based on a real story and how Christy can achieve a miracle by mixing with the heart. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had made to create a disabled person. Watching the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, this story is confident and intriguing. Christians are not normal pristine, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of loneliness and painful strokes through his eyes. <br /> <br /> One important factor for Christy's success is his mother's support, which seems to be more relevant, and the unknown actor Brenda Fricker also deserves this Oscar for that role, this little fat middle-aged woman uses her all to make Christy dream. So happy Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also great as a young Christy, which is a presentation for kids! Christy's love story is very well done, reliable. Christy wants love and nothing gets her right to love, her drunken beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly Fiona Shaw, I have a deep impression of her role in the Harry Potter series, desperate aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really my mind, but anyway, every woman has her youth ...) is paranoid and offensive, I have compassion for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and torment are just next to everyone Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (America, BOXER, etc.), except GET RICH OR DIE Trying, God knows why he decided to drive this mess! Really a career for him, what a pity!
