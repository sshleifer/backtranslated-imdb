Wow, this film had a huge impact on me, it moved me. This is an amazing story about a Cambodian girl who is being trafficked into sex trade. I can no longer think about the fate of a girl named Holly. Setting up a movie is realistic, the film was an eye-opener, I can't imagine that someone would want to get away from it to help change that terrible problem that exists. <br /> <br /> The movie was very touching. This was one of the best films I saw this year. <br /> <br /> The girl who plays Holly is doing a fantastic job of its own. Ron Livinston gives an excellent result. The film brought me to tears, it says an important message that must be heard all over the world. Everyone should watch this movie. I think this movie makes a difference, I loved it!
