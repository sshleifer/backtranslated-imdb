I agree with what the "wine bugger" wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling you get at the end of this movie. I loved completely the locations that chose movies, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic loudness that Hans Matheson sings. It's trippy. Nighy was nail "nailed" in his role, Beano was a typical drummer, and Row kept it together. Bruce Robinson was awesome. Helena was a cute girlfriend. But I felt that Julia Aubrey's performance was great. Aubrey & Robinson's views killed me! Perfectly played and behind the music scene there was a spot! Not too many musicians have checked this movie too bad! They should have talked to all the friends of their musicians. high quotes Jimmy Nail's character: "It should be a rock & roll, not a f ***** g opera!"
