Richard Willaims is the God of animation. He prevented the producer from directing the film. The final product is a very uneven film with a very difficult story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins 'Greedy'). Also, Joe Raposo doesn't help with repetitive music. It was done on a widescreen, so VHS doesn't show it in all its glory, we hope we'll get a DVD with a letterbox one day. It's still worth seeing some striking animations.
