I loved "Pushing Daisies" instantly. This exhibition is able to smile on my face because it is a great storytelling, a clever dialogue and a wonderful act. But that's not all: it also manages to keep you going. The main idea of ​​the exhibition - The return of people with one touch, ending in a second with Undead status - is interesting and may be in later seasons. However, experience is added by seemingly murderous cases, the unique appearance of the exhibition and a very prevalent narrator. But "Daisies" pushing is more than its parts. It has a certain charm that I really enjoy, and I look forward to the world of Ned and Chuck the second time in the season.
