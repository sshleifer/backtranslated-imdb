Hitchcock was of the opinion that the audience is not really interested in what puts the protagonists at risk - only that they are in danger and must flee. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. Police believe Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime if he is obviously not. Trevor Howard decides his best course of action to run. And so, on the body of the film, we have our charismatic couple who give up on trains, buses and buses - jumping over rocks at the top of the rocks - scrambling over the roofs of the yards. <br /> <br /> All good exciting things - but I didn't think it was all unnecessary. They should have stayed. <br /> <br /> In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
