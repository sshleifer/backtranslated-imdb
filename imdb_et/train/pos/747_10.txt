Although I was born in the year when this movie came out and had never heard of it until I saw it in a younger high school year (1996), I was completely laughing and crying and knowing the characters because I and my friends had their hair, clothes and speech obsolete, but the emotions and despair of each situation were so familiar! I remember the idea of ​​how real it was and how I wanted them to make such movies. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this movie in the evening after I was on the crazy side (not as different as Jay's house), which was spoiled by what we thought was the loser hanging around our crowd. The world-class BS'er and the "responsible" type of mother figure that I immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also a car), although I also had a little Madge's insecurity, which included there. My best friend was Deidre and his good friend from childhood was our Annie. <br /> <br /> Looking at the scene when Jeanie is in school or where she and her boyfriend are attacking, and then she tells Madgee how much she loved her to feel like chats and the situations I had personally been. <br /> <br /> Now, at the age of 27, I saw the movie again and suddenly felt the emotions as it was like watching my own piece of youth (though none of my friends died). I think it must be 13 and more for all girls.
