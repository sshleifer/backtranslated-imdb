If the creators of this film had tried to introduce the plot to reality, it would have been another waste of time, money and creative work. Fortunately, they have created all the pretense of reality, they have created a comedic miracle. Who could let a movie where an alien pilot spends the whole movie like Jack Nicholson with the Lakers T-shirt. Don't leave this movie in the trash.
