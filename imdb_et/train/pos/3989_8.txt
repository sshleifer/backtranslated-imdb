"Mother" recently talks about a mother of two grown-up children (Reid) in the mid-1960s, who wakes up while her husband dies because she has a relationship with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married mistress. The film lives quietly with a passive mother, her weak relationship with her grown son and daughters, the quiet needs she is trying to relieve in bed with her younger lover, and the ensuing convulsions. Some somewhat antiseptic drama that despises psychodromatic sub-currents is doing a good job of actually dealing with uncomfortable problems while avoiding free sensation. Playing best in mature audiences, possibly women who can better deal with the central character, needs and problems. (B +)
