I was very moved by the story, and since I go through something like my parents, I'm really involved. It's so easy to forget that someone whose body failed was never lively and passionate. And then there are mistakes made and they have to live together. I loved Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? He's fantastic! Real find. The film has probably ever seen an erotic scene, but nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done. In general, the look and feel of the film was stunning, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this picture, he humanises down a spiral man. I liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just to grab us, but not enough to climb.
