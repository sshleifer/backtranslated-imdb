I went to Deathtrap, waiting for a well-organized and intriguing thriller; and though it is something this film is; I can't help but think it's just a poor man's dream. The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of land, but it is definitely also a performance. Choosing Michael Caine in the central role only confirms this. The film is based on a performance by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's baby and Stepford women) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind her. After his latest game bomb, Sidney finds himself low; and it won't help if it's called Deathtrap; written by an amateur, whom he taught, arrives at his fingertips. Deathtrap is a guaranteed business success, and Sidney will soon bury its own plot; which involves calling an invitation to a circle, killing, and then passing Deathtrap to work. <br /> <br /> Despite all your smart turns; Deathtrap falls on one primary element and is characters. The film does not offer any pleasant character and it is very difficult to take care of this story if you are not rooted for any player. This is not helped by the actor. Michael Caine puts good and entertaining in the way you expect, but no one else is proud. Christopher Reeve is uncomfortable in his role, while Dyan Cannon can somehow change a unique pleasant character that is honestly irritating. It's happy that the story is good; and it's pretty good enough to record a movie. The plot has many turns; some work better than others, but there is always enough work to ensure the film's interesting interest. Director Sidney Lumet also deserves credit because the film's style is another big plus. The central location is interesting in itself and the cinema is well suited to the film. In general, I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie; but it could have been much better.
