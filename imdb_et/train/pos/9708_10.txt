I never really saw this program before my family members strongly suggested it. Well, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (filming site) and she first noted some landmarks when she first visited. <br /> <br /> It was my interest to buy the first series of video and sat down. In addition to recognizing some of the locations, I didn't find myself the least surprised. The BBC was again responsible for a new example of the world's best comedies. TLOG rises easily where there are probably the best red dwarfs, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that I am now involved with the program. The characters are excellent and show abnormal depth while rarely retaining a realistic edge. The look and feel of the program is perfect and sometimes reflects a deep North feeling (there is no respect for Hadfield that I found in a very friendly and warm place). <br /> <br /> I hope that this will continue to be an originality throughout its lifetime (based on the second series that ended last night's reboot in the UK). <br /> <br /> Well done BBC!
