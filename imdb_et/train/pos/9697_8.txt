This is really a warm-hearted family film. It also has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can name it) (think about the dog "How Grinch stole Christmas" ... it was just bad training). Paulie's story is extremely well done, well-reproduced and generally well-designed. No more to say except it is a big movie! <br /> <br /> My Ratings: 8.5 / 10, 7.5 / 10, Animals + FX 8.5 / 10, Cinematography 8/10. <br /> <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - GREAT MOVEMENT AND VERY HIGH PLAY!
