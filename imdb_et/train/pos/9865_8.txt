I saw a movie with two grown children. Although it wasn't as smart as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. There was no sound in the cinema surrounded by the children that had spring out in the spring, so I know all the kids liked it. Parents also seemed there. The death of the characters and the obvious death caused appropriate shocks and comments. Hopefully, people will understand this movie for kids. As such, it was successful, even though I liked it. Personally, I liked Scrat!
