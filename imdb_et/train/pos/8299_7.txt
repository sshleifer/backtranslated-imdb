When a scientist and host Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally adopts an invitation to work on Micro-Digitech Corporation's space wash project, he moves between his beloved wife, Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son, Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter. Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) is a large modern company in the company community. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family, fully adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom is trying to attract Matti that every club member has a meteoric professional rise in Micro-Digitech, but Matt does not offer. He is later introduced to the club's director, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who interacts with her friends with Patricia and persuades her to join the club with her children. Matt knows the changes in his family's behavior and decides to explore the club, find the secret of Jessica and its members. <br /> <br /> In the 80s, when I saw "Invitation to Hell", I liked this film, which partly resembles "Stepford Women", where people exchange the behavior of a suburban compound. I saw it today and found a great metaphoric message against big companies when people literally sell to the devil to climb positions and earn higher wages. I'm not sure if the author was going to give that interpretation, but I believe it fits perfectly. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
