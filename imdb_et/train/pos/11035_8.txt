Four prisoners share one cell: the dominant transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus's idiotic brilliant friend Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who eats everything, including pocket watches, cockroaches and her little sister; Slowly (Philippe Laudenbach), an intelligent librarian who killed his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), a new boy who has been hit by the company and is now focusing on escape. After the brick fell from the cell wall, men discover a hidden magazine written by "The Young Fountain" - an assassinated serum killer who occupied the 1920s. Is this magazine the secret of their escape? Or is it much more exhausting behind it? <br /> <br /> I was a little tired of getting into this movie because the only other experience with Eric Valette was the terrible One Missed Call (2008), which I think is the worst theater release I've ever seen. But much of what was wrong with the missed call could probably be due to Klavan's terrible script, because (as I remember) the direction of Valette was not the worst part of the film (if she didn't decide to involve the child). Anyway, Maléfique was a good way to get her respect back. . . this is a French movie (obviously I like it) and it takes place in prison (which is my second favorite horror device after asylums). So this is two points before the movie even starts. Fortunately, Valette was after me, too. Maléfique is a fairly deep, rather complicated and quite convincing story of obsession and despair. . . desire and need to bring fantasies to reality. While this is not a frightening film in the traditional sense, this power makes it strange. The period between the peak and the summary was one of the best films I've seen for some time and I would like to hear it from everyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with a pretty cool gore. <br /> <br /> Final decision: 8.5 / 10. Valette earned quite a lot of respect. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount has the right to make an American remake (surprise surprise). This was done in 2009. I am not sure why to be honest because it does not seem to be something that would be a big money issue in these countries. But I'm surprised before. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
