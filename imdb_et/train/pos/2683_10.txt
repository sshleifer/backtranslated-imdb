Franco proves once again that he is a prince of surreal and erotic cinema. True, much of his work can be seen as entertaining, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he can really do by letting his twisted creativity rebellion and giving us both a hypnotic and a mysterious film. erotica in his work. Jerry Van Rooyen's excellent score pulsates when the viewer is thrown from one odd scenario to another, if we follow the challenges of a stripper (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic or may (like one mysterious country of character) be a hell, try to meet the world where he lives. Beautiful and enigmatic cinema is highly recommended for anyone who has an interesting interest in alternative cinema.
