I happened to have got this movie screened in Brooklyn - it is difficult to describe the plot; it has a lot of unpleasant signs, but let's just say I have a hard time choosing which one to make the most difficult for me, I don't know where to start. Even peripheral roles are well written and well-functioning. <br /> <br /> There are many small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable, with some "devices" that open up and add another fun layer. It's a refreshing look; not some recycled things I saw many times before. If this film reaches a wider audience, I am sure it would be a true crowd entertainment, this story is both original and cordial. <br /> <br /> Here's a lot to like, funny story, failures and misunderstandings that created the final act and the dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a lot of heart; This is a touching story with fast paced comedy. Definitely worth seeing!
