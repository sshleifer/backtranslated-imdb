"College Girls Murder" is my first acquaintance with Edgar Wallace's writing work? and generally my first true acquaintance with "Crimea" movies in general? and I can say that I have moderately impressed. This stuff is really fun, though I never expected it? tobe! The film has an exhilarating and nicely twisted plot with a healthy dose of humor, amazing appeal and pretty ingenious killings. There's some James Bond type of bad mastermind? who always sits in front of a shadow and a big monitor - recruits inmates to kill certain girls at a particular college with a new poison. There is also a poor dick who has a whip, dressed as a member of the Communist FAQ, getting rid of the remaining characters, such as too curious teachers and such, as well as a kooky police chief who continues to deal with the case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I had previously known that these Crimean films were so colorful and crazy, I would have already bought their set. The dirty plot really raises more questions than the end, and the overwhelming comic tricks of Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins are sometimes a little swallowed, but I don't care because it was superb entertainment. Even the funky 60 soundtrack remained in my head for a long time. It's like the Italian Giallo variant, but with tiny elements.
