John Water ("Pink Flamingos") "Pecker" is the best film I've ever seen. It gives the viewer a heartfelt picture of Baltimore's life (I live in nearby Washington) with the use of Warhol's color, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker gets bigger when his city can cope, and he is separated from his loved ones (including sexy Ricci) by his loving art director. The picture remained in my mouth for a refreshing taste - like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although it was quite flat and simplified, it made the whole thing deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of the right to life, freedom and arms ... and all that this country is celebrating. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
