Although I disagree with Bob and Tammy's decision to give up the child from Jesse, and this is something I never did, they tried to do what was best for the child. How this film is written will see you changing the story and asking yourself what you really believe in all the different aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost unknown, as far as I'm concerned. But during the movie he really convinces you that he is psychotic or at least that he is serious about something wrong. His character is "emotionally disturbed". The film seems to end soon, leaving things somewhat unresolved. But besides, this movie is very big. It really makes you think. It's not watching a movie if you just want to come back and relax and watch something cute that makes you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to challenge your convictions, see things from the perspective of others, and discover something for yourself. Beware! You can even grow up while watching this movie! And it's all worth it, finally.
