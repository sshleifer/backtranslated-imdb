Stanwyck is a pre-coded stunner who plays a telling whore who sleeps on his way to the top. Indeed, these precursor chapters allow everyone to not imagine. Stanwyck is outstanding as Lilly's daughter with the speaker owner / father who sold her patrons (Johns) more than odd. After the old man's death (good!) Barb leads the big city for better things. She uses her female attributes to sleep on her way to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "comer" and proves that actors can do better with age and actor. I loved the scammer and the strong traits between the participants. I recommend this movie to all film fans and watch Stanwycki, who is big and beautiful like Lilly.
