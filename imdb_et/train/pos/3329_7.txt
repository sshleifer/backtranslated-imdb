The only reason I saw this movie was Jimmy Fallon, whom I have broken since the 9th grade, which was his first year of SNL. I'm a tough hard Yankees fan, and I didn't find the film painful until the last 15 minutes when they started showing ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make some noise so I shouldn't have heard of what shouldn't be heard, but otherwise it was completely tolerated. <br /> <br /> I thought Jimmy was playing a very good role because the character was to be nervous and peculiar and he was a nervous and peculiar man. I know it may not be the Academy's award winning stretch, but the film is just a light, fun and romantic comedy that is actually suitable for both women and men. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well and had a much better chemistry than the others in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in this stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career in front of him and thank you for the taxi could have killed it. I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot. Everyone has to stop critical criticism of their behavior because they are just starting out in the movies. I imagine it must be difficult and when you look at another big actor of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you see that they started to flop. Busom Buddies? Australian Soap Operations? Here Jimmy wants a successful career on the screen. I didn't want him to leave SNL, but what can you do?
