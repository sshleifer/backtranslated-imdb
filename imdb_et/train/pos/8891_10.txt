I can agree with other comments that the film did not have a huge history, but it was not a documentary! It was meant for entertainment and I think it did a great job. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. Their scenes seemed inappropriate. Like, suddenly, it was thrown out, but I didn't get that story and a link between the families later and found it pretty good. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it wasn't the 60s, when it brought about very large and important deadlines for a decade. I found it to be very fun and worth while watching.
