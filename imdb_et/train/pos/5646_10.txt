Recently, when I was buying, I saw an American Gothic box and I thought "I remember it!" I set up my disorder to back up and watch it when it was CH at 1.30 in 1996 (i was 14). I remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird, no one could ever be as scary as Lucas Buck (B!). <br /> <br /> What annoyed me was that they made the box with the same setting as on television. Funny episodes wondering when Dr. Matt is leaving? - They were so confused. <br /> <br /> But it's not writers, manufacturers, or drivers' guilt (money makers with this TV background are still doing the same - just look at exhibitions like Carnivale and Farscape, which they don't like in the studio's originality) !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Finish - if you haven't seen it and you call yourself a Sci-Fi fantasy, horror, supernatural drama..Fan = OTHER. They even told SFX when they looked over the box set.
