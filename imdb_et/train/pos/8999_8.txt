These films do not make an embarrassing effort to hide their true genre - the campy B movie. This is for sure by telling you at the beginning of the campy definition. He should also have given the adjective of the cheese. But these two gather in this movie in a way that makes you go, "Hmmmmm ... it's so stupid!" and then you laugh. For example, "Japan of the 16th Century", which shows a couple of samurai who attend the front of the temple. In the background of the temple, there are several tourists looking at slippers and shorts at a distance. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I couldn't finish laughing. And the actor goes well, tolerated, oh Lord, but it makes it funny. You will see some decent participants and you will find others really terrible. However, I have to cut back a bit because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in many games and she's fantastic. His air time in the film was quite short. I have seen Bryan Yamasak during games on several islands and he is also better in theater than in this movie. Anyway, it's an entertaining movie if you don't have anything to do on the day of the week.
