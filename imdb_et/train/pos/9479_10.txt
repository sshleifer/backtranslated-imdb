Tian's remake isn't good at all. I just click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actor back in the classic 1948 movie, say a few words to the team. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after showing Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in Hong Kong's film achievement. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, his fire in Hong Kong films is always a surprise to his fans. This year's Hong Kong Film Festival has a special program dedicated to Fei Mu, the director of this epic film, and Wei Wei's film is still photographed in Hong Kong. My son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised that Wei Wei was so beautiful.
