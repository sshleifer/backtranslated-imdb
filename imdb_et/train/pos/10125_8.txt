This film is the first trilogy of the Trichet society of Trinity and the trilogy starts from the very beginning. The trilogy films are only thematically related and these themes are actually visible in all of his films when you look close enough. The Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman who is trying to prevent his child's brother from having too many strangers fighting at the yakuza peak in Tokyo. The parent is an attorney and the trio of gang needs more and more as the movie progresses. The film takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore quite violent and harsh. Mike is worse, but because it is a serious movie, it hits you very much. As usual, there is also a lot of perverse sex, mostly homosexual. The film is a typical gangster movie in many ways, but a great ride and a real grit. If you've only seen Miike's far-sighted movies (Ichi killer, Fudoh, etc.), it's worth looking at, as it is a kind of compromise between his aggressive top style shown in these films, and his more serious aspect like trilogy from other movies. And as always with Miike, it has at least two scenes that you should never forget (see it and find out for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
