I already loved "How Grinch stole Christmas" when it appeared and I'm still loving, 5 years later. Still, it seems that many people disagree with my opinion, and this movie was never really a lot of love. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is general and campy, but the same is the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All the kits, costumes and characters are made fun to the top without becoming really ridiculous. This is a visually remarkable movie to watch. This is a campy movie that does its best! Director Ron Howard really surprises this fun little Christmas card. <br /> <br /> The main reason why a movie works and why it's so fun to watch is Jim Carrey as Grinch. She really carries the movie with her good and fun. Of course, he is helped by a convincing make-up, which also received the Academy Award. Of course, if you're Jim Carrey, you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and he makes it work and fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. Perhaps this is because I am Dutch and we do not mean Christmas, which is enthusiastic and great here, as in the United States or England. For me, the movie was just fun and entertaining, and the morale was quite cold for me to be honest. it all works great for a movie and contributes to a scene. <br /> <br /> Perfect for Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
