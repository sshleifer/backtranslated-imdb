God bless the 80's movie. It's a fun and fun movie. That's what the movies are all about. Now I'm not saying horror movies, just movies. It goes like this: All these foolish puss and cheerleaders choose a high school nun, and one of their worshipers goes awfully wrong. Marty starts killing these teenagers one year later, after she succeeds in believing that their old abandoned high school is a joker / jester mask (pretty creepy, maybe I'll add). reunification. Is it basically a plot? What's wrong with that? This is the beauty of 80's movies, most of which I would say. Many things could be so ridiculous, but they keep you more than they go. Especially this movie. <br /> <br /> It contains some embarrassing killings and some are quite creative. (Beer poisoning, acid bath, I don't remember somewhere else used elsewhere). It's a really fun and fun movie. It's all that. Certainly, this does not mean that the characters are complete idiots, never think of their stupidity and never think of the terrible random things of this film. Like lights that can be controlled by the killer (even if it doesn't even turn on any button you see) and toilets that can bleed blood, baths can get out of acid, just use it as part of entertainment! Because that's what really makes it fun. Never could such movies do, you know why? It's no longer 80 years old. That's why you should just cherish what they are, fun! I would recommend this movie if you are a Slahser hardcore fan, for example Friday 13. <br /> <br /> One last remark is that this film also had a kick ass rally, Marty Rantzen. Uneven, the nerd who kills all his old enemies in a horrible mask. A good scorer is a good hit. Simon Scuddamore, who played Marty, obviously committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released. This alone adds something horrible to the film and sticks to it, and it even makes you feel Marty's character. All in all, fun 80's slashers! It's a shame that it's never the same ...
