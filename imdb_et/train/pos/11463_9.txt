I saw this movie at Rhode Island International Film Festival and it was completely blown up. The film's structure and execution was fantastic ... I know it's not, but it really deserves the Oscar arrow. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as two disrupted classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial and I see many people who have a lot of problems with it because it deals with school learning and especially makes you identify with killers. But despite its harsh and dull themes, Zero Day is worth seeing. I expect it to come out of the video so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... ending the shooting order leaves you in the word because it is almost too realistic. Their insecurity, "recordings", student footage, and panic are completely inexplicable. I really hope it deserves the attention it deserves. It's done in the same way as the Blair Witch Project, a hand-held camera designed to appear as a documentary for a true home video, but God is NOTING better. Very impressive, hats for all involved people. If you have a chance, then you should see it.
