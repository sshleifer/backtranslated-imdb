In my opinion, my LEFT FOOT is an excellent biopsy of one of the world's most talented authors and painters. The performances were broken, the soundtrack was excellent and the casting was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented person, although I didn't understand what he was talking about. In addition, when he was beaten, I got a little scared. It is just as sad that it suffers from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a solid fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or a similar biopsy, I recommend this great biology for one of the world's most talented authors and painters. You're a real treat and a good time so don't miss it.
