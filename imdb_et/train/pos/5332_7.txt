In the light of poor judgment - or in the case of car accidents - I feel I have managed to go and make a transfer in order to earn merit, if appropriate, and service. I'm not sure people have a license to say it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> The film rarely has SUSPENSE. This film kept me all the length, despite any errors. How many movies can I say? Not even great. Because of the simple assumption, you do not know whether people are getting into a life-threatening situation that lasts throughout the film. Yes, the suspension was tight and some of the shocks were their shocks. It's not just a TV movie, it's all kind of movie; there is no point where it stops or deviates or becomes eloquent. It would always be difficult to make such a movie, always on the road. Only Duel or Speed ​​is what I remember. The best of them was the constant tension. <br /> <br /> ACTING is not bad: the judge is as good as ever and others are. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury is whether it can sometimes be - or it seems to be - a little terrible. What seems unreal may not be so. Your first judgments are not always correct, but I think the leading player was in that movie. <br /> <br /> STUNTS is usually terrible, especially for TV shows. Their only failure can be noticeable and again obvious, slow speed. But we all know how slow the slow Grand Prix cars might be. <br /> <br /> I liked that THE BEGINNING said, "It looks like a real story. So you're not going to go, how much is it true? maybe it should be true. Strangely enough, they didn't call an auto expert - or an auto-electrician or a mechanic - to see if there was a way or at least a neutral one. The life-saving idea was somewhat funny in the conversation wisely, to dazzle it, and I think we know why. End of the movie.
