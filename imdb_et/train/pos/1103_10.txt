This movie has one of the biggest comic and memorable quotes ever put together in one movie! The plot is somewhat incomplete, but the delightful peaks are enough to make the difference. This is a timeless film of all ages that would definitely be like. It's a lot of fun in the form of cinematic art; and in big letters like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong? <br /> <br /> Comedic dialogue and timing as it has long been underestimated and very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is to see the film "Money Pit" with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talents and physical comedies of these stars, the film received and received bad comments and comments from the viewer. Real comedy dialogue is an art.
