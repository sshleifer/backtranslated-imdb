In this Muppet movie is Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot College graduates who decide to bring their successful college music to Manhattan Melodiad Broadway. Unfortunately, no manufacturer is dealing with Muppet. After denying too many manufacturers, Scooter suggests that Muppets decides to move on their own. However, Kermit believes that she will get her show on Broadway, but after she does and let everyone know she sold the show, Kermit sends amnesia and others don't know where she is. <br /> <br /> It contains many great scenes, including a series of live actions that introduced Muppet babies, a wedding sequence full of Muppets, including Sesame Street cast and Traveling Matt (Fraggle Rock), Scooter as movie theater secret and scene where Rizzo and other rats prepare breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that there were no more characters left. Of course, many of them will appear at weddings, but Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard, and Sweetums should have been important, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem as he was in the last season of the Muppet Show and the Great Muppet Caper and Miss Piggys Dog Foo Foo should have to be with him (Rizzo The Rat, also featured in Steve Whitmire, was a big part of this film and he was not very well known at that time).
