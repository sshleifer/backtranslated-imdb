This exhibition was Fabulous. It was complicated and well written and all the characters she liked were terribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake, who was a Philandering boy, was pleasant. Since our waves are full of jokes like American Idol and Dancing Stars, it was nice to see a drama that wasn't too soap opera. It was always intriguing to see how each character would relate to the following. It is really annoying that we finally get an exhibition that makes you think a little bit and that it is thrown out because of a mysterious number that most of us don't even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. This exhibition will miss if not many people, but some loyal fans.
