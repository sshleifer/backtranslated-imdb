Although the style of this film is not as underestimated and realistic as it probably was, it is still a very good film. In fact, this day was considered a great movie because it was nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar (losing to WINGS). I still consider WINGS to be the ultimate movie, but it is great, despite the exaggerated exaggeration, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a Tsarist Russian general who lives in his last days in the 20s for a few dollars as a Hollywood supplement. His happiness seems to have changed when he receives a call to play - to play the general Russian fight against communists during the revolution. Of course, it is not quite stretching, but the old man also thinks of the old days and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Exactly what happens next will leave you, but it's a pretty good movie - especially at the end. By the way, look at William Powell as a Russian director. Despite being in 1928, makeup doesn't look much younger than it did in many of his later films.
