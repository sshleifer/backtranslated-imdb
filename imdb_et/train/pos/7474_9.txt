This is one of those films that are difficult to watch without a plot. Suffice it to say that there are strange things and unexpected turns, after the initial surface of the "Tom Cruise Screws with Multiple Women" plot. <br /> <br /> Quality quality raises this movie above the norm and all cast is well suited to their parts: Cruise as an irritating smug playboy with it all - and then it all loses, Diaz as an attractive but slightly fallen jilted lover, Cruz as an exotic new girl at the event and Russell's father as a psychologist. The story includes romance, morality, murder mystery, temporary and sci-fi elements and is generally a fun journey. <br /> <br /> I add that photography is equally great, and entering different visual metaphors is beautiful when you understand what is going on. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy good-looking movies that are complicated and tense, and you're ready to accept a somewhat fantastic resolution from Philip K Dick's style, that's a must-have. <br /> <br /> 9/10
