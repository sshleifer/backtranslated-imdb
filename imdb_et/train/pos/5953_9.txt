I understand that Paramount wanted to film it with Rodgers and Hart, but was unable to develop copyright issues, so Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote the most Bing Crosby songs between them, produced a very good result. > <br /> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this movie "fits Crosby like a glove" and I couldn't make it better. No, it's not Mark Twain's satire, it's Bing Crosby's movie, and in 1949, Crosby's most financial star of Hollywood. One time Paramount used the technique and Rhonda Fleming was never the love of the screen. It was a woman who was invented by tehnicolor. <br /> <br /> William Bendix's Brooklyn origin stands out, but it is a good comic effect. The Crosby, Bendix, and Sir Cedric Hardwicke trio have a rolling time with busy making. Bing has one of his patented philosophical numbers when you Stub Your Toe on the Moon. The third song she sings and always with Rhonda Fleming. This song was chosen as the best song, but lost to Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> Also, Bing managed to record Decca's score with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwick. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows Crosby's comic talents without Bob Hope. I like tea pictures, but Bing was a comic talent, and this movie shows better than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his game.
