For anyone who doesn't know what was an actor's movie, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense. It's full of clich√© situations, hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy ... you call it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can do something convincing and this movie is no exception. Everyone turns to a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But this is Megastar, who overshadows everyone who has a higher presence. Without him, this movie would have been a non-starter ... The story is about separation / erroneous identity / misunderstanding / love / hatred / loyalty / good vs. evil - everything, really! Amitabh is a great reading for all the songs, otherwise in a silly movie! And did I mention that it was ridiculously funny?
