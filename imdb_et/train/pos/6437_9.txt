The famous conductor decides to go back to the village where he was born to live in a quiet life after a heart attack. There he is in a local church choir in Dutch, changing his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I first saw this movie; I like watching foreign films that are not English, and I've already seen a couple of Swedish films in my life, but it was still the best. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a jewel of many things, one of which is an outstanding act. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as a thoughtful, almost shy and dedicated conductor Daniel Daréus. Beautiful Frida Hallgren enchants her beautiful smile and subtle action. Choral members are all well-developed, interesting characters with their own story. <br /> <br /> This movie tells a story, a beautiful story about music, love, pain, memories, death, a person who devoted his life to music and trying to create a peaceful existence in the village where he was born, trying to make peace with the past and with it, how his life has been so far. Kay Pollack shows that Sweden is an outstanding filmmaker. Go see Så som i himmelen, this is a film that makes you think about life and love and it is somewhat comforting.
