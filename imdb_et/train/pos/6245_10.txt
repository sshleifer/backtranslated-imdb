"Hundstage" is the first fiction film in the silk (before that he directed great documentaries as "animal love" or "models". Seidl worked on this project for more than 3 years, but only cost $ 2 million. The actors are very good, especially non-professional actors, who almost played themselves. The whole movie is shockingly disturbing and some scenes may be too big for "normal" viewers, the film has a lot of sexual and violent, but also that people are lonely and unable to communicate with each other. has been one of the best and most rewarding Austrian films in recent years, please excuse my bad English. <br /> <br />
