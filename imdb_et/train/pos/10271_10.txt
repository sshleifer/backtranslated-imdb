This movie shouldn't be compared to "The Sting" or other capric / hero / con fiction films. This makes it a great film experience of what it has to say about relationships, deception and trust. It is also a rather cutting-edge criticism of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a contraction that is so easily deceived and then acts as a primitive in the final. Did Mr Mamet have an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly recommended!
