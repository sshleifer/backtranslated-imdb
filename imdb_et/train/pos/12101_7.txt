I remember seeing this movie at the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene in which Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin and the breathing body there, was for me a more frightening part, which was only reinforced by the darkness of the film. I also thought about people hanging at the end of the trees until I knew the part of the movie where Blackwood's surname changed from Blackblood because there was a character in the family's history who was known to hang many different people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to be adding to his family's deaths. I also noticed that when Foster first enters the cemetery gate, he is cautious when he notices the sharp object of the gate where he meets. I don't hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
