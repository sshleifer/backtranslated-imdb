DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is doing a remarkable job of playing with Christy Brown, a brain-grown artist, who managed to be productive in life, successfully working with his disability and respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The film is still very difficult to watch or even watch. Luckily, I had a headline function to catch every word I could say would have been impossible when I saw the movie in the theater. While I respect this as a bold job that deals with a complex subject, I can't say it's a movie I would like to see more than once. <br /> <br /> However, my attention-telling device, the setback that today's one sees, where we see that Christy is honored for his achievements, before we see his return to his youth and his struggles to communicate with the people around him definitely gave him loving care. br /> <br /> DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is definitely remarkable as a wizard who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), a lot of his mother's fear that if love is not interconnected, his heart is broken. The restaurant has a painfully long scene where she admits her love to others and then goes into crazy rage after too much drinking. <br /> <br /> BRENDA FRICKER is doing a great job when her mother and her siblings take care of her, trying to keep her on the roof until Day-Lewis begins to succeed. She complements the Day-Lewis performance with her warm-hearted mother and shares her many enjoyable moments with her. <br /> <br /> A richly detailed story about a family who, together with the most unusual circumstances, focused on the details of the period in the frame of each film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won the Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also great. O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is a father who spends too much time in a local pub but loves a boy. <br /> <br /> To sum up, Elmer Bernstein's music is a plus factor. Well-worthy, but definitely not everyone's movie.
