Welcome back to Kiefer Sutherland. it has been too long for you to have appeared in the movie and what the film was, whether it was 24 years old, but very intriguing, especially if the sample, like Michael Douglas, led like a hidden secret agent. Kiefer's character is Eva Longoria, Desperate houswife, sought after by Michael Douglas' entire Kiefer partner. wow he can actually act after flirting all day and looks good, i wish that Kim Bassinger had a bigger role but besides, i really think the whole movie was a blow from start to finish. This movie is what I consider to be a political thriller, everyone played their part in a hat. nothing appeared in the movie to keep you always dying. and I really think Kiefer did a job in this movie, but I think Michael Douglas was a performer a day, a little.
