The story is mostly placed in a small Polish village and one of the most memorable scenes is the village's reaction to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills), who is being raped by Wilhelm; treating Jewish villagers as they prepare to concentrate in camps; and church service, where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) condemns his Nazi upbringing for his girlfriend, Janina (Dorothy Morris), Mary's daughter, after she has shot the brothel. <br /> <br /> Knox is unique and very persuasive as a bitter, disgusting and evil person. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments that fit with him and Henry Travers is a very good priest. This movie offers an effective story that will end to you.
