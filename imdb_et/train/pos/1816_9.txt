Many reviews on this page suggest that this film is a little dark for children. It depends on the child. It's not a movie for 2-6 year olds; it is more targeted at the crowd of 8 years and older. I saw this movie when I was 10 years old, I loved it. At that time, most animated movies were a bit childish to my taste. This film deals with more serious problems and is therefore a little more emotional. The characters of this movie can be DIE and sent to HELL! It gives a little more emotional weight to scenes where characters risk their lives. Good guys are not always sweet and nice (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as vengeance and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Great movie
