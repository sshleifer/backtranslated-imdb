Eric Valette is obviously a talented filmmaker and so are two men who wrote the script. That's why Mal√©fique is a great flick that is made just a few bucks, but also a ton of imagination. Well, I'm a bit overwhelming, but I'm still sincere. So, if you like dark movies, go and see it. It's really worth it.
