Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece for transmitting messages in a little word. It's been one of my 10 favorite films because it has come out. Waiting, though less patiently, for the movie to go out in DVD format. Obviously I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If Amazon's parent listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this exhibition and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. The cast is remarkable, cinematography and direction are impeccable. The film is a sure keeper. Many have already asked. Add our names to the list.
