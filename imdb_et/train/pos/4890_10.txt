Excellent cast, please, please! <br /> <br /> If you get almost anything written by Plater (or those great actors). For anyone who does not know Plater in a real jazz sense, my suggestion is to see "Beiderbecke" trilogy whenever possible. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz - hot, cool and" what time does it start?
