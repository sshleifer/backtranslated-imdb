The no-nonsense inspector Hollaway (John Bennett's steady move) explores the disappearance of the famous soldier and exposes the old history of the horrible old house. The First and Most Visible Story "Murder Method" - Successful author Charles Hillyer (nicely played by Denholm Elliott) haunts images of a murderous fellow he writes in his latest book. Although this particular outing is too obvious and predictable to be something special, it still builds a truly truly surprise. The second and most spooky anecdote, "Waxworks" - Lonely Philip Grayson (always prominent Peter Cushing) and his equally lonely friend Neville Rogers (excellent Joss Ackland) are both admired by the beautiful but deadly murderous wax-like wax. Third and Coolest Vignette, "Sweets for Sweets" - quiet, reserved and secret widow John Reid (typical terrible Christopher Lee in a rare semi-sympathetic role) hires the nanny Ann Norton (fine Nyree Dawn Porter) to take care of his apparently cute and harmless daughter Jane (wonderful Chloe Frank's remarkably spooky and irritating performance). This extraordinary frightening episode is accompanied by a remarkable worrying act of talented child artist Franks, who is planning a truly amazing idea of ​​peaceful evil that lies precisely in a deceptively sweet and innocent angel plywood. The Fourth and Most Funny Yarn, "The Cloak" - The Pompous Horror movie star Paul Henderson (rejoicing at the essay of Jon Pertwee) buys a mysterious shade that makes him a vampire when he carries it. This product gives fun and silly fun, and even more useful is the beautiful Ingrid Pitt, who is the attractive vampire Carla. Director Peter Duffell, working on an amazingly spooky and witty script, spotted by spooky writer Robert Bloch, keeps a gentle pace all the time and makes an ace of work to create an appropriately awful atmosphere. Kudos also has Ray Parslow's crisp cinema and Michael Dress's shaky result. A highly recommended omnibus fear for fans.
