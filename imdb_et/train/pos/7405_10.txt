This movie is just wonderful! It's all: laughter, sadness, beauty, poetry, truth. Everything is a simple but intense story - like life! You can't get confused. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone tells Hollywood that you need a good story to make a good movie, and there are so many good stories.
