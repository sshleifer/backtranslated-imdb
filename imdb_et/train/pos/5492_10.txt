I have been impressed by Chavez's position against globalization for some time, but only when I saw the film at the Amsterdam Documentary Festival, I understand what he has actually achieved. This film tells the story of the coup / conspiracy story of Venezuelan elite, oil companies and oil-loving corrupt Western governments to remove democratically elected President Chavez and return to Venezuela for a brutal dictatorship. This movie must be for everyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I commend the Venezuelan people for having taken the matter and saving their country from the Halliburton and Bush regime.
