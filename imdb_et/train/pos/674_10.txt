For most people watching the film, this is a little interesting, but for many hundreds of films dealing with magic and occult in one form or another, it's probably the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> The Golemist Craft seems to be an endless topic for the film industry. Most movies about it do it childishly (for example, "Witchboard", a real eternal garbage scraper), taking either transcendental elements as cheap excuses for special effects of cheese or for cardboard dropouts (cf. Warlock). rarely seems to show at least some transient experience with magic, as practiced in real life, but the presentation of occultism in such films can at best be described as allegorical and not verbal or symbolic, or ... just not pretty right. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie again after many years. I had seen it in VHS, it's a dark, moody piece, and after watching a DVD, if you plan to watch this movie, watch it On a DVD, don't look at it in VHS. <br /> <br /> Blind s and mood are VHS strong, but the DVD is very different on the DVD. I think Weir deliberately pushed the dark aspect into style, but when the film becomes the bottom color of VHS, it goes over the edge. The DVD brings the movie back to life and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> Anyway, seeing it for the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic in this film is very good. Finding all the causes is difficult, I don't care about it for a while. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious if you want to see what is in real life This movie is just right for countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for someone who doesn't, you're really wasting a lot of time reading.
