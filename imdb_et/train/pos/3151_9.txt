I saw this example about 3-4 years ago. It was mom's funny! When I first saw it play on ETV (Eesti Televisioon). Too bad that this exhibition is a bad time for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes Frank Sinatra to sing! And he comes to foolish ideas. She got those glasses that were brown. I like it . And there is FeZ. Group Pervert. We all know what he does when he alone ..... He wants to put it down badly. He was even in one of his episodes with his boss. And there is Michael, a stuput guy in the whole group, probably in the stupas in town and his cop! He's so stupid that I remember: Hyde says: Did u call the police? - Michael is not coming and saying. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He's a city playboy. Then comes Jackie, who is a former Michael girlfriend and then she's a Hyde girlfriend. Then there is Eric Who's son, a homemade war veteran and Kitty's son. Her one big pussy. But she loves Donna, her girlfriend, with whom they're going to marry them. Donna is one hot girl. Hmm, what do I forget? ah Hyde lives in the basement.
