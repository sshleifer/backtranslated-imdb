The exhibition is really funny. Nice theme. Jokes and one lining are really good. With a little extra tuning it can be a very popular show. But the only big negative point in this exhibition is cast. David Spade does a good job like Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who the hell did Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. <br /> <br /> Russell and Jeff are the main characters in the show to make viewers look. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of disappointed family man, a relationship wiz ... with experience of all the problems a married couple interacts with. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - Doing terrible work like Jeff, he doesn't match that role at all. He's like a robot, literally not punch in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> Cast is really very important for viewers. Bad is definitely working downhill ...
