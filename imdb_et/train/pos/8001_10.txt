Definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. The subtle direction and smooth operation make it a very fun and often moving film. Denzel Washington still plays one of her most interesting and emotional roles and the rest is beautiful. Christopher Walken is, of course, excellent, although he didn't appear as often as I wanted. The story of ultimate greed is that the setbacks are compensated for by the child's innocence and love. It is also a movie for lovers of movies because it has a fair share of balls, rockets and revenge. The Mexican location adds a sense of seed and corruption, which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, it is a truly captivating film from start to finish. Highly recommended!
