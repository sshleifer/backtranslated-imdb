Well I don't like rap, but I still found fear in Black Hat. I'm sure I didn't get any jokes, but some I knew, and it was funny to just laugh at me after finishing with a laugh. I'm a big fan of the Spinal tap, so of course I had to go through it. It was derived from the fact that this is the backbone, although this film was still independent as an original, intelligent, and funny satire. My personal favorite: "Back at the slaves they had no hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired of rebellion. Now we have hats."
