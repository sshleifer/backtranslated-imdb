You saw it on Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and it's a bones-bones movie - it's really with me. Very intelligently adapted to what is probably a great novel, this is an uncommon-drama with fully rounded characters, a thoughtful memory of life choices and I'm not exaggerated. one of the greatest productions ever made during 100+ years of filmmaking. Wonderful work from everyone led by luminous Vanessa Redgrave as a deadly, deceived Newport matron and Claire Danes as her younger self. Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer is like Mama's real thing; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman in 1958 and does not take over the charm; and the joy of seeing such great directors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins, who produce sharp and detailed results. Hugh Dancy, also from the production, does not bring much of the cliché to the somewhat cliché of the unhappy unhappy rich waste, and family issues are likely to be solved in a cleaner way than real life would allow. But it is a deliberate pace, a visually proud meditation in real life, and you can call it and feel that you are being manipulated negligently. Also, which is the 1940s - 50s.
