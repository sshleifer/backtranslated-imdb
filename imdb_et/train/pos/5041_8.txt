Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information on the FBI-led killer of sera. When the agent arrives at Doyle's office, he tells him that the serum killer is indeed his dead brother. Agent Doyle requires some evidence and the man talks about his life, from childhood. They were a three-member family: his widow father, Bill Paxton, his brother and himself. One night his father collects two brothers and tells them that God's angel had just visited him and appointed his family to destroy demons. Next is one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie four months ago at VHS and yesterday I was watching again, now on DVD. Although it is a low budget movie, the scenario is sharp, without errors. The cast is outstanding, but I would like to emphasize Matt O'Leary's activities as a young Felton. A young teenager has a very difficult and difficult role. Bill Paxton's direction is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror film. Great debut behind the camera. I'm sorry for the title of this movie in Brazil: "A Mão do Diabo" (fucking hand). If it were at least "God's hand", it could be acceptable. However, naming this movie as a devil is really ridiculous. Scriptwriter Brent Hanley did not deserve this respect from the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("Fucking Hand")
