I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won the Best Actress Oscar for this film, which was split three times between Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone. But the informant is still a good movie because John Ford would not have received his first best director Oscar if it wasn't. The film and the story of Liam O'Flaherty, which is based on the fact that it is based, are related to a poor simpleto man named Gypo Nolan, who was once a member of the Irish Republic Army. He was taken out of it for some of the ghostly stunts he pulled and wanted back. He has reached his last pee and if he does not get back, he wants enough to go to America. There's twenty pounds of pays for information resulting in the arrest of former comrade Frankie McPhillip, played by Wallace Ford. At the moment of weakness, he goes to the Black and Tan staff and informs McPhillip. <br /> <br /> IRAs are very interested in finding out who McPhillip's bikes are and they are pretty sure it was McLaglen. He's not right to really cover his stories. He struggles to involve another man named Peter Mulligan, played by Donald Meek. He also picks J.M. Hanger hanging by Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The entire notifier's activities take place in Dublin in 1922, about six evenings until the beginning of the next morning. If necessary, it hits darkness and shadows, making it the first noir triller. If it had been done after World War II, the informant would have been ranked as a great classic, such as Odd Man Out or The Third Man, which has a lot of similarity. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this world very well. It took time during the rebellion and was at that time in Ireland and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name, before it was English, was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster is playing with IRA Commander Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is a heavier and more cunning man than Foster is here. I think John Ford wanted him to be a sympathetic character to give the film fans an interest. He makes it clear that Foster needs to lose the informer because Black and Dan are gripping him and sending him a lot more and putting the entire organization at risk. <br /> <br /> IRA is a highlight of the movie. If Foster asks Donald Meek if he admits his court power, Meek cannot say no. The king's justice and the letter are not here. It illustrates graphically at this point, despite the occupation of the military forces and the military, that the British are indeed losing their population. <br /> <br /> Of course, the informant has a rather grim story of John Ford's touch, but rather less than you expect. Even if McLaglen spends his money drunk, the IRA is constantly looking at his shadow and reading it somewhat. <br /> <br /> Informant is a story that has spoken well from Ireland's dirty and frustrated time.
