* SPOILERS * Four men, Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) decide to go on a rafting trip on the Cahulawassee River before it is flooded. > <br /> They wanted to have fun, a beautiful weekend in nature. <br /> <br /> But if two mountain men pass their way and rape one of them (Bobby), everyone will go to Hell's handbag and this "nice weekend" will cost even one in four lives ... <br /> <br /> 'Deliverance', which in Italian is foolishly titled 'Un Tranquillo Weekend Di Paura' ('A Calm Weekly Vote') is a feature of films like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Hills Have Eyes',' Wrong Turn ',' Last House On The Left and all other "Evil Nature / Revenge" subtitles movies. and one of the most frightening, right next to The Hills Have Eyes. <br /> <br /> James Dickey's book (which appears in Sheriff Bullard) is a cool story about how someone can go to a situation where he knows everything he's not. <br /> <br /> And a picture of a dead man who rises under water, or hands that hold a winch from one page, worship images that never leave. <br Expression: 9/10.
