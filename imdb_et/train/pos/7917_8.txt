After reading other gentle comments and comments, I felt I had to batima for this movie. <br /> <br /> Few movies tend to communicate with each other a little and expect it to be like the one you liked is probably a sign. <br /> <br /> This film is a thoughtful and unchanging look at religious faith. The only other film, as is his religious message, should be Tolkin's Rapture. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that someone could say that this story is confusing or supernatural. It's a simple film about Catholic faith, miracles and redemption - though you should never guess it. This is also the only movie I think whose resolution is literally red. <br /> <br /> Like a (happy) fallen Catholic, I know what film is and what I find love for my ultimate virginity between God and man. But if you do not know the theology underlying the film, then it will head towards you. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, not a story - "cold sky" is not groundbreaking. Although The Rapture is heavy with cinematic and cinematic images, Cold Heaven reduces its cinematic qualities. There are no amazing shots, no sharp effects, no attempts to match the content form. It's a laborious shooting, but weak. Nor does he have any dialogue or action to put it into a great drama class. It's a simple story that just comes up. It may seem strange; but finally the secret is revealed. It seems vague; but with one line, the vagueness of the Catholic dogma is lost. <br /> <br /> In this regard, the heart of the "cold sky" is exactly the same thing that drives a movie like "The Sting" or "Sixth Mind" or "Final Fall" or Polanski's "Pure Formality". All these are films with their sleeves. They can distract you, but they really have point-to-point, but the fun is at least partially taken. <br /> <br /> Still, even if it looks like it's a little more than a shaggy dog ​​story with a hit line, it's worth checking out how it directs and misdirects-you. Try it, especially if you are or have ever been Catholic.
