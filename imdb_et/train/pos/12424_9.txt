I always wanted David Duchovney to enter the film company and finally he did, and he made me proud. This movie lived what I was hoping for. Duchovney played his character very well, succeeding in maintaining something new instead of playing Agent Molder. That's why I give him extra credit for his role because I didn't see anyone else on that player. David was great but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. Great performance, not tired throughout the film, because it will never surprise you. He has weaknesses and strengths, making this story even more plausible. I also enjoyed a lot of story, it added a lot of story and was very memorable quotes that I still use all the time. This film also had an amazing score. I recommend it to anyone who loves drama and doesn't deserve blood.
