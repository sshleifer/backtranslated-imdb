Michigan, Edgar Allen Store, Toaster and Pan. . . If you don't mind the genre of psycho-thriller or horror movie and you have a special place in your heart twisted, it's a movie for you. The amazingly well-developed first film "The Minute of a Minute" has all the major shocks like "The Sheep Movement" and the cult classic as "The Army of Darkness". Editing and effects are well done, better than many genre films. Kallio weaves a complex story of torment based on the writings of both the Bible and the Poe. At a time when there is not much in the big budget, the content of large name films, the independent film has raised this dying character. If you love Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, see "Hate Me".
