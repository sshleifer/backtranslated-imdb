This documentary (now available for free on video.Google.Com) is a fantastic example of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone must see it. <br /> <br /> Chavez was chosen for the landslides in 1998. His platform was to divert a fantastic oil spill of 20% to the middle class 80% of the poor. He banned fishing for foreign driftnets in Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to slums to treat the sick for free. He destroyed illiteracy and set up new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30% tax on oil company profits he got from the Bush administration. In 2002, when Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain interviewed Chavez in the Presidential Palace on their social programs, a coup coupled with CIA support was launched. Chavez was pulled out and rolled out of the country when rolling the cameras. National television was reported to have "left". <br /> <br /> But the Venezuelan poor didn't believe the media. They went to the palace with millions and demanded that Chavez be returned. In front of such overwhelming numbers, the military coups turned to the US and plotters fled to the US. Chavez rescued the military helicopter and returned to the jubilee.
