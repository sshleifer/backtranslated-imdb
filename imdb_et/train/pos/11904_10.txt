I gave it to 10 because everyone else liked it and would have been tough. The reason I worry is to add a personal observation about Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I've seen "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (a version with a smart color sequence where everything except blood) is black and white a few times and "House Haunted Hill" several times. <br /> <br /> Even though I am not old enough to see them when the castle was up to his show-tricks, so I can appreciate them for their own achievements. And while most of them go to the second level, chocolate, tooth, etc., then I believe they will serve him. <br /> <br /> The Homicidal final sequence is GENEINELY shocking and works today - and the "Tingler" assumption, but stupid, was very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was TRIUMPH. Having used this Frank Lloyd Wright house as his outdoor environment, the great Vincent price and solid cast plus good result and output values ​​- when I first saw it in late night, which showed in the late sixties, this audience response I haven't seen before and haven't seen it before. <br /> <br /> It was a little where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading right now) and we look forward to hearing from the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> If a telegraph does not come from what is coming, the camera will pull back slowly, forcing COMPETITION to change its gaze ... I will say no more (the above spoiler declaration only covers this movie). </p> For Men!) The people were happy with the TEN-MINUTES. <br /> <br /> Now that it's a good movie. Perhaps it was a terrific showman, but "House" and the other two mentioned films were good movies. Castle may not be Hitchcock, but he was not Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> It's easy to focus on someone's inquiries and forget to explore their TALENT. So I hope this documentary admitted it. I look forward to seeing it.
