Anyway, with the usual grinder-stapled movies to watch this Halloween I've seen again and again, I took the chance to "The Sentinel", hoping it would be able to flow back into my horror. Remember that I had just seen how the dark castle remake of "The House on Haunted Hill" saw - complete and obedient. Fortunately, "Sentinel" BLEW ME AWAY! A cross story about the model that moves into the horrible building of Brooklyn Hights, the movie offered everything I hope to find a good movie - (1) Campy and fantastically succulent characters, exchanges and dialogue, including Christopher Walken's twilight genius Jeff Goldblum and especially Martin Balsam Missing Thinking Professor - (2) Terrifying Terror! Don't give a shot, but there are scenes in this movie that cooled me into my pancreas - (3) A fantastic gore from Michael Winner, a terrible make-up and a clever (as a very uneven) direction that flows into its unrealistic cure. If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this is your queen of favorites. Just to emphasize my love for this movie - after I first watched it, I cut my jaws, I turned it over again and looked at it again. Now this is one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
