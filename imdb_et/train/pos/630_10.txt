I didn't expect much of this movie. I was given a ticket for advanced screening. I was just out of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait 40 minutes in the film line and it seemed that there was no air flowing through the hallway. <br /> <br /> When sitting in the theater, the tired and frustrated movie started, I didn't know any of the participants at the beginning, but the stream of the film was perfect. From the very beginning, I started using the film, becoming more and more exciting every minute. I think this film is for fantasy / fairy tale. The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect and the end was magical.
