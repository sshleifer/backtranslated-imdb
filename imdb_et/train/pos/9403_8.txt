"White costume man" is the second closure of Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick (Whiskey Galore !, Sweet Smell of Success). The film's star is Alec Guinness (whose comedies are Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob). Guiness brings his usual class to the film and does it much more than the usual comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, comedy is not quite obvious. At the end of the picture, it has almost become a complete drama. This is a kind of comedy in Ealing Studio that doesn't take laughter, but a general feeling of entertainment, like the best British comedy of the time. <br /> <br /> The whole idea is not very original, but the way it is executed. The film is very original and recommended for all Guinness or Britshi comedy fans. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
