Ogre does not seem to have gained a very good reputation since its publication in 1988, and I think it may be due to the fact that he was given the subtitle 'Demons 3' to help sell it better. Well, the film is directed by Lamberto Bava; The first two demons and the ogres and demons are somewhat similar (in that they are both "monsters") ... but besides, this film has no relation to the other two films. However, this is pretty good! Italian filmmakers are known for ripping popular films, and although this is not entirely obvious; it seems to me that it has had a fair impact on Hellraiser. The plot focuses on the female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to the Italian castle. He haunts memories when he was a child and found Ogre living in his cellar. It is not long after the castle's movement before the return of these visions ... and it can be more than just a coincidence that he thinks a murderer ogre lives in the basement. <br /> <br /> The film was probably shot on a budget and it was made for Italian television, so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant; but what it is is definitely a very decent horror movie. Lamberto Bava may not be as sharp as his father Mario did; but it takes time to build up an unfortunate atmosphere that really applauds the film. A central place, a great castle, makes a perfect place for such a creature and Lamberto does the best; even if it involves ripping the excess films sometimes; such as Inferno-style pool scene. The plot itself is not as good as the atmosphere, because several scenes have been drawn for too long and the characters' relationship is rather strange (especially between the husband and wife). There is not much bloodshed, but Bava does some special effects. Ogre himself looks really silly and it's a good job that we don't see it very often. We boil it when it is very predictable, ends and generally I have to say that this film is much better than expected and recommended.
