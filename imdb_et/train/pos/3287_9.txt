My friend and I chose "Paperhouse" for a random movie collection on our weekly excursion to the Horror section - neither of us had heard of it, but the box was really promising. And the film wasn't disappointed, though I probably wouldn't call it just a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The 11-year-old Anna Madden pulls the house and visits it in her dreams. She will definitely fall asleep when she sees her house, but it is so real that it is almost like a completely separate reality. What, in the light of later events, does not seem far from the truth. Anyway, he thinks he can add a house, its contents and surroundings just by adding a picture. <br /> <br /> Although this is going on, Anna is getting more and more sick with the fever and, moreover, she has become completely obsessed with the house and her drawing. In addition, he also deals with his mother with his missing father; he has a job that leads him to a long stretch, though the impression is that the story is actually more. <br /> <br /> OK, so the drawing material sounds good - but to be honest, something is really dangerous. Dreamworld is nervously surreal - for example, the house is just in the middle of the gray ground. The filmmakers did a great job of making this alternative world / constant dream very uncomfortable ... <br /> <br /> One thing Anna adds to the house is the boy, Mark, who seems to be the same patient, he says doctor (I will not give it away, you know from the moment he seems to be the same child). In reality, Mark cannot walk because of illness; In Anna's drawing world she can't walk because she doesn't pull her legs. She blames herself for a real life illness and tries to improve the situation, but ... everything is getting strange. He even brings his missing father into a drawing with disastrous results. The bits with the father are really terrible. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give up, so I'll stop there ... There seems to be a lot in this movie. I'm sure you have the ball that analyzes this thing when you die with your palms after you look at it - is it a simple story like it seems, or are there really layers of meaning? I don't know, but in both cases it's quite exciting. There was "Nightmare On Elm Street", which is of high quality, because at a certain moment reality and dreams are intersecting. I love such things. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it seems to have ended several times, but no. I am pleased that it ended (some of your sensitive types could be handy for Kleenex!), Although it may have many conclusions. Anyway, it doesn't look exactly when it's actually over, but when you look and fade it still, it's a little nervous. <br /> <br /> Still, "Paperhouse" is really a good movie. It's well done and acting-- especially Charlotte Burke as Anna - is the top notch. Burke, who has never appeared in a movie before, is a real gem. I don't know why he never did anything else, but either he's really convincing and enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror movie, it's a kind of fantasy / intercourse / something other movie, at certain moments - but you can still watch it with your family and not worry that your little brother or grandmother will get blood spraying or something. <br /> <br /> Give her a chance, you won't regret it! And maybe you should read the book ...
