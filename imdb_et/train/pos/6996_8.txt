This movie was really great tricks for something that affects us all. I know that I have been personally involved several times. With goodness, Will Smith has jumped into the social question of text messaging while driving. People, don't do it. The hour and forty-five minutes are not due to enough time. Personally, I wanted to throw my mobile phone after the movie. I was pleased to see that other people in the theater saw this message and their phones were emptied of empty bags. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do so. If you care about your family, check out these important public service announcements while you are traveling, or they can kill seven people. Thank you for showing us.
