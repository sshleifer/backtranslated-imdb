I love this example! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode, I repeat this line and remind myself how good it is to show. I am a big sci-fi fan and this exhibition is the most important research (fiction?) In film / television history. There are so many theories about this universe where I could start a religion. Its amazing season after season shows better and better. <br /> <br /> I have been a MacGyver fan since I was 5 years old (19) and I find it so ironic that my two favorite TV shows all the time star Richard Dean Anderson. He is also interested in how each character is practically the opposite of another. <br /> <br /> Back when I first saw the Stargate movie, I liked it right now and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi clips, then I heard the TV show spin about it, I got really excited but didn't get showtime until the fifth The season was almost over. <br /> <br /> Although I'm disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make the film trilogy, but the studio chose a series instead. Id say that it turned out well. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is amazing and I hope it will never die. Atlantis here we come!
