I think James Cameron can be my favorite leader because it's my second film review. Anyway, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "painless" ... until April 1912. It was all the news and one of the greatest tragedies ever. Well, James Cameron decided to make a movie about it, but marks two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, after the main review, but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact, and the only fact that is present is the film event. <br /> <br /> So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They don't bother too much, but look at it and you'll find out why they might be annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain I think is bad luck, destiny, God's hand (no blasphemy) or just the usual Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Connect all the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story for a sinking boat. Supporting characters include: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (idk was so nice), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and more. We also have the modern treasure hunt Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is fantastic, especially on the other side, as well as drama. Finally, you can fall off your eyes with tears or rain. The story is simple and it works. The treasure hunt is looking for the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing this diamond. He calls and talks about his story about RMS Titanic. Two lovers who have been separated from the social class and the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few mistakes. I'm giving Titanic 86% awesome
