I enjoyed it whenever it came on television every year in the 1960s. This is a typical Hollywood history epic, dramatic, stylized and full of inaccuracies, but so, it's a fun movie and a good looking movie. Cecil B. DeMille is the successor of her 1938 film at the end of her life. His son's actor Anthony Quinn, who played a supporting role in the 38th film Beluche, is the director of the debut and songwriter, as he had never previously directed the film or ever. DeMille brought together a team that had recently worked with its ten commandments to help Quinn take it out, including the long-standing DeMille affiliate producer / actress Henry Wilcoxon, who followed the project. There are also 10 commands by screenwriter Jesse Lasky, operator Loyalk Griggs, director Francisco Day, head of department 2 Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, costume designers as a team, only Buccaneer's Oscar nomination was awarded. A great fight from DeMille, led by Yul Brynner, pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future president of General Jackson. Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. Just over two hours, it pulls in some places, but does it with amazing battle scenes. I'd give it to 7.5 out of 10.
