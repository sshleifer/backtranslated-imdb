The brutal, emotional Michael Myers is killing his sister for six years at Halloween night in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escaped a mental institution and founded a new fear of domination in his home town of Illinois, Haddonfield. He's always staying with a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how evil this young man is. <br /> <br /> It opens up a bang and creates a truly stopping and atmospheric cooler, which is actually better for many images that helped inspire. This is a subtle bleed from many of these following films; subtle and scary. It keeps the chance to jump even after repeated views. How many movies are there, which can be scary even after one of them has seen before? Not very much. <br /> <br /> Joy is great in what was probably the final role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis got her film debut after "Halloween" with the image of a bona fide laughing lady and some subsequent slasher, and is meant to be a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter, a writer / director, knows what works in this movie, using perfectly shadows and dark skies; note how most of the movie is set after the night. With this picture, he and his former co-author Debra Hill created a franchise that has created seven sequences, many imitators and coming to "recompose". <br /> <br /> This is a highly quotable one who could ever forget Dr. Loomis's (Pleasence) speech where he describes Michael Myers as a sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a trusted repertoire player in many of Carpenter's earlier works)? <br /> <br /> It's awesome and worth looking for. This is my favorite John Carpenter movie, which is all the time. <br /> <br /> It's not completely infallible - after all, it is a hole in the script, but in general it is certain. <br /> <br /> 9/10
