When I was young, I had seen very few movies. My parents rented it in their wisdom. I was very cautious about what the movie was, in fact, I didn't allow it to look. My brother and sister came, of course, and it made me very angry. What I did? Later at night I throw a videotape! Kicked the TV screen and called the police and reported vandals. Of course, I was arrested, I couldn't get out of the TV before the police arrived. I was given only the only times that spoke and went home. Of course, my parents justified me and worked for me to pay off the TV and videotape debts. It broke me, slave job really sucks, but I had to do it. All around the house. What happened at the end? We have a large screen TV, DVD player and surround sound system. How did I get the money? Just made my movies and sold them to Disney! Do you remember finding Neno? Well I wrote this movie and filmed my goldfish in my fish tanks! Of course, they wrote about the plot and did it in the CGI because they couldn't afford to be a real life picture like I had done! Finally, I never saw The Head, which didn't die, and the rating I gave is an estimate of my life! That's pretty good!
