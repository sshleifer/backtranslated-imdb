If you are in the right place at the right time. With an exciting movie. It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular with its people. He can do things. He's accessible. It is also easy to understand why the West hates him so much. It controls its state resources and returns people a profit. Mostly poor. And it's easy to see how TV stations can display misleading images to happen there. Just like the war in Iraq or the war with Terror. Or they are not weapons of mass destruction. Or how about the evil axis. People must wake up. And get different views. Stop neo beliefs against the world. Go watch this movie with an open mind. And make your mind up. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo: America: freedom for fascism. The problem is not American people. It's a government.
