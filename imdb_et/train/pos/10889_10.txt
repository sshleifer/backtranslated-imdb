What are all the negative comments? After seeing this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that it is a good holiday comedy, which is definitely a lonely day for a person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could finally spend his vacation, I wanted to cry. If you want to know why you want it, you have to see the movie. Even if I liked Tom (James Gandolfin) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, when you ask me, they were real snobs. But this film made me smile and feel good. Before licking it, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has won a clean holiday. Finally, I highly recommend this great holiday comedy that is sure that any individual day will brighten any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who hasn't seen it.
