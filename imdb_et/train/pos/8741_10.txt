"Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy bar - it's full of small bits that add something very tasty. <br /> <br /> The story couldn't be better; it's smart, "heart" (emotion) and every character is a nice "arc" (growth or change). For comparison, the only "Toy Story" characters in the "arc" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy and Woody, who crosses Buzz's resentment. "Bug's Life" has a lot of smiles and loves moments. All the actors turn to great voice and the animation, both movement and detail, is great. <br /> <br /> This serious movie buffer will not throw lightly into the "10", but this movie definitely deserves the "10" I gave.
