What can be said about Tara Fitzgerald's compelling results? He is completely believable because of injured Mrs Graham, a fortified experience, a sharp and strong will, but not immune to Mr Markham's passionate attitudes. Toby Stephens is a lord of every character with every glance of sight and every mild eye, with every moment of sight and facial expression. He is the force of passion and hope that restores Helen's injured spirit. Graves' Huntingdon is the perfect irregular rogue. However, despite everything he has done, it is indisputable human dignity when he refused to play a hypocrite at the end; he is at least aware of his shortcomings and how they have been destroyed. Helen's attempt to save her soul - after her departure and taking her child at a time when it was unsuccessful - is the triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of every human life and soul, which is, however, erroneous, but a sinner may be. The persistence of Markham can then be seen as his reward for his faith and moral character. Although the moral ideas so strongly expressed by the tenant seem outdated by today's standards, this story is full of integrity, passion and conviction that still affects. The tenant is much more plausible than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is the adaptation that makes the novel justice. I suggest you watch it!
