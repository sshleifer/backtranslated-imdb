De Grot is an excellent Dutch thriller based on a book written by Tim Krabbé. His second book, Het Gouden No, was made in 1988 as a great Dutch mystery thriller called "The Vanishing". It's not as good as this thriller (though much better than the American remake is also called "Vanishing"), but there are times when it's near. <br /> <br /> Especially opening moments are terrible. We see a man, later we learn his name Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt) who arrives from a Thai plane. When he takes the bags, it is quite clear that he smuggles something across the border. These scenes are perfectly targeted, captured and acted upon. A relationship is usually created that you would not normally have in such an opening state. Later, we see Egon doing his wife's wife in Thailand, so they never did anything like that. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, the movie is constantly bouncing back and forth. We see Egon still as a child (here playing Erik van der Horst) with friends called Axel (as a child of Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up with friends, sort of, and how Axel (Marcel Hensema played as an adult) became a criminal. Meanwhile, Egon goes to college and lives with a woman. About this time he sometimes meets Axel, but he doesn't want to do anything to him. <br /> <br /> The film is chronological. It shows Egon and Axel as children as students, young adults and mid-thirties. But from time to time, as I said, the movie goes back when they were kids and jumps again. Every time we see them as children, it explains something that happens when they're adults. <br /> <br /> Small spoilers here. <br /> <br /> The title means "cave" and this is the cave that gives the film a happy ending, although it is not so happy. Like the beginning, the end is terrible. The central part of the movie is entertaining and in a way that draws our attention to the first scenes, it is only at this point that we have to return. This is the editing that gives the film its happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is also happy.
