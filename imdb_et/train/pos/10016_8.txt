If there is one thing to recommend about this movie, it is interesting. It is certainly a prerequisite for the audience, because it is a mystery and the whole film has clues that there is something blind. However, there is not much tension, and Williams's easy way of portraying does not do much to associate us with his obsessed boy. <br /> <br /> Collect fares much better than a woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. Production seemed to have picked up and openings appeared. It certainly looks much more thorough and better in the preview. The book is probably better. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure: Taupin must have written something really good to inspire at least one commendable effort.
