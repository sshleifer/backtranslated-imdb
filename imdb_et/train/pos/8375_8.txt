<br /> <br /> Robot-jox is a very small movie ok, some kits are bad and the actors aren't so big, but the special effects are great for a movie of this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is now over ten years old and it was very cheap in 1st place so you can't get much worse about bad parts. So just sit back and watch a cool movie with big robots in it.
