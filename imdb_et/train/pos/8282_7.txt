** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of a movie that doesn't work is Wendigo, and if your title doesn't succeed, your movie is usually not behind it. The filmmakers' interpretation of Wendigo's form is interesting and can properly threaten with threatening - when a fleeing killer sees Wendigo as a flash in his rear view - and the fruit form was really good. However, as a monster, it never really comes to life. We do not get much explanation for our behavior and what we see from it does not tell the story itself or the Wendigo lore I have ever read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons why a monster fails is that it is not made in the movie. When you boil this film with your bones, it is that you have a temporary thriller with a little supernatural element instead of a monster movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is good, though slightly cheesy; filmmakers use the landscape, lighting and time to transmit the atmosphere and mood quite well. Otis's character is truly dangerous and unpredictable, making her a real monster in the movie. Perhaps it would have been more effective to explain his behavior if he had Wendigo's hungry spirit, which would also be a more accurate representation of the actual legend. <br /> <br /> I have heard unconfirmed reports (from the newsgroup) that Wendigo does not do much, that when a monster suit was built, he stopped so hard and inconvenience (in order to mimic its views on the cornea, the performer had to go to the toes) that it was almost impossible to do, walk or otherwise perform. Thus, many beings who stand still, and obviously raised, stand on film. I emphasize that these reports have not been approved.
