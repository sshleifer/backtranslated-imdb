Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was harassed and taken to high school. A group of children played several clusters with him and these worships were really bad. The last prank ended tragically. <br /> <br /> After five years. The congregation of the children will meet again. One of them set it up at the old high school. The school is now abandoned and they have to break in. For some reason, Janitor is still there, but he tells them that they go and have fun because they give him beer. <br /> <br /> They start partying and watch their old cabinets and they see something from Marty. One girl feels Marty is sorry, but another man soothes her. <br /> <br /> When the killings begin, it's great. Every killing is creative and gory. We see a tooth mask, hunting them one by one in the whole school. Marty seems to have returned. After killing the first person, it turns out that they are locked in school. They start looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> Now there are many illogical things in this movie. First of all, I don't know anyone who has a 5-year reunion. Second, after the first child dies, the girl gets blood all over her. They all flee in panic, but it runs in the bathroom and finds a bath. Mr. friend has just been killed and he decides to take a bath! More importantly, there is a bath in the bathroom of the school. Anyway, it seems the bath does not really work ... and he dies of the terrible death that is the film of the 80s. it's horror. WHO ARE GOODS IF IT HAS A FEW LEGAL PART. I do not want to. This movie really has great deaths. The end .... is the twist. Having recently seen Haute Tension, I can compare these two. The only way they are similar is that there is a twist, what left me disappointed ..... IF the film is big, if not the best to kill, after twisting. <br /> <br /> After the last killing, the killer looks at the screen and does something crazy and it was a great way to finish the movie. It's me "wow ..."
