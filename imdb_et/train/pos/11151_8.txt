The only reason I knew about Midnight Cowboy was because it was in AFI Critic's Top 100. For the Top 100, this is not a very well-known film; indeed, I had a hard time seeing the copy, the DVD version was about half the price. Surprisingly, only M15 + (uncut version) was rated. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many take note of this review (more like a comment) so I will do it briefly. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the strangest films I've seen, partly due to assembly, artistic filming (a very artistic building), and an unusual theme. There are many things in the film that I still don't understand (I've seen it twice), and that makes an emotionally confusing film. <br /> <br /> Filming and acting were great, and it's bigger than life signs that make this movie memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a Cowboy from Texas who moves into a male prostitute in New York. He will meet with the offender Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, of course, they will become friends who go through the usual escapades. What makes the movie interesting is the two characters that are so different. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film did not develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo, so that the audience would get a real emotional connection, although the end is certainly sad and tragic. You probably already know what's going on, reading the comments, but it's quite obvious from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I personally think the film looks beautifully and joyfully on its main topics. Deprivation of humanity (as evidenced by the darkness of the city streets, places of decay). Most movie characters exist outside the law (conman, giggolo.etc), but you can't like them. Joe Buck is loving because he is so naive and optimistic, while we know Ross after the movie later. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was so high because it was definitely a breakthrough in this period. At that time (and even now) it wasn't a typical film (quite an art house). At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns, musicals and dramas, the film, such as Midnight Cowboy, appears with such an unusual theme. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I have to say that I really liked the movie. The images gave a dream quality. I especially liked party, scene, music, pictures, etc. However, in the interests of entertainment, the film was somewhat lacking (not really the style of my movie) in the excitement. It is a more pleasant and appreciated film than a cheap action game. <br /> <br /> Although I hardly see it qualified to analyze the movie, the characters and their motives are quite interesting. What I understand about the setbacks, Joe Buck was sexually abused by her grandmother, although it still doesn't seem relevant to the story. He is a happy and happy young man who is suppressing his darker memories. The religious meanings of the film are also puzzling. Some have suggested a homosexual relationship between Buck and Ratso, although I can't figure out where they came from. The topic of gay-sexuality is generally more than in their conversation and later in Joe Buck's meeting with a lonely old, but the main story is little involved. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (with more than 70 years of feelings in the 1960s) is revolutionary to its time with the issues that some other films dared to do. Although it has a simple, sentimental story (hidden with a hard edge), the film's beauty is a strange, often psychedelic sequence.
