A typical De Palma film made of a lot of style and some scenes that will take you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Certainly, what makes this movie better than the average thriller is style. It has some superbly edited scene and some scenes that are really nervous that will take you to the edge of your seat. Best movie scene; The museum scene and the murder of the elevator. There are some mild erotic scenes, and the pace of movies may not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully understand this movie. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also pretty good, but it's the style that makes the movie work! It may happen that only fans, but also casual viewers, should evaluate the well-built tension of the film. <br /> <br /> A good costume is a nice character. Michael Caine is an interesting election choice and Angie Dickinson works as well as he looks good (not bad for a 49-year-old!). <br /> <br /> The musical result of Pino Donaggio is usually also De Palma likes and fits the movie very well, like his score for another De Palma movie "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Brilliant Nerve Crushing Thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
