For those who don't know Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "less" movies later in his career. And while this is not a great movie compared to many of his pictures, it is not bad and is a good passer-by, but not much more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York and for some unexplained reasons she decides to lie to poor Jimmy to fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and segregated Mrs. Novak will also love Stewart - and apparently, in the rules of witches, this is NOT NO! <br /> <br /> The film is strange for witches. They are not sacrifice or almighty power. Most of their magic is quite limited and pointless (for example, Jack Lemmon uses his powers to turn off street lights). And very strangely, the witches seem to be all bohemians hanging in the hip bars where you can find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz. Given what I mean by jazz, it really has to be the witch of the world of this movie! <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is quite romantic and slightly comic, but not something I would look at. The action is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough extraordinary movie that I got the movie almost 6 - it was really close.
