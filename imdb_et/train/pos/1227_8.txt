I caught this movie on my local movie channel and I rather enjoyed watching the movie. It has all the good elements of a teen film and much more - this film deals with the issue of steroid use by young people, with the exception of boy-girl relationships and sex and other similar activities. <br /> <br /> The film has this real life - it is not loud music, no special effects or embarrassing scenes - what was right for this movie. This feeling makes the movie easy to relate to the characters - some of which we probably know where we live. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a good movie, fun to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
