I found "Time At The Top" an entertaining and stimulating experience. Working, though not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. Like a film that is obviously aimed at younger demographics, it is certainly one of the better works of the genre (Children's Sci-Fi). I would usually say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for children, and "Time to Top" doesn't make this theory a discount! I don't think consistency and great action are important for younger people. For them, a good plot and imaginative scenario are much more important. Both are rich in this movie. Special effects are good without damaging the story or closing the viewers from their imagination. This movie would have been very easy to inject SFX overload, but it would have completely destroyed all of its Raison D'etre. <br /> <br /> The settings and camera work are very high in this movie and complement the beautiful wardrobe and historical precision. In general, this film is very satisfactory and I recommend it to all viewers who see the world through the eyes of the children or those who are trying, like me! Now, I have to read the original book as soon as possible.
