1.) This movie was amazing! I looked at it when I was next to the city where he grew up! I went and saw the buildings where the story took place. In general, I loved this movie, one of the best of Jake Gyllene !! My favorite things were also the truth of science and my father all the time. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream, and his father didn't seem to care in one way or another. This tagline is true. "Sometimes a dream is bright enough to burn in the sky." 2.) The way this film was taken was impeccable, it was all so believable that it could have been recorded in the 1950s. The dress was accurate and they also had a slang. We definitely recommend this movie!
