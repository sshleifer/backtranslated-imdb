Marlene Gorris is one of the world's greatest directors. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on Vladimir Nabokov's story and captures the blind irony of this writer well. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his best achievements (usually he is not his fan); and Emily Watson is also great. Worth a look.
