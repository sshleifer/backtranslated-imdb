The films of Alain Resnais are so unpleasant that they have not really been changed for the sake of consistency, but it seems that the picture ends where the memory is edited. Love for death is sometimes a quiet existential drama and a circular creative magical realistic film, and in both ways the audience treats the relationship of Eros / Thanatos to a whole new aspect ... or maybe it creates a new relationship that is Agape / Thanatos <br /> > The start is like a strange surreal horror movie. One woman desperately runs around the house when a man dies in her bed - did she kill her or what happened? Soon, the doctor will dissolve when the doctor gets him dead and pronounces, but from there a newer stranger begins: the man wakes up and, after death, the woman and the man fall in love with the tragic consequences. In the meantime, their friends who are both priests are watching and presenting their debate to the nature of love, faith, and dedication. <br /> <br /> She always seems to have some equipment to make such narratives and what is so amazing about her movies is that these devices always work. In this case, the Resnais cuts the scenes with a snow that falls on an attractive orchestral score that disappears and shoots in the following shots that continue the story. This elegantly excluded periodic film develops a rhythm that is not too different from an epic poem, and I got this strange odd rebound for Dante's divine comedy, despite the fact that there is no direct reference in the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but it extends to a past-shaped structure that forces the viewer to a certain degree of self-consciousness with the ability to bring some strange memories to the surface. Memory-narrative, Resnais creates. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
