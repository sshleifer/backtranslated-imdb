This expensive little comedy has so much love. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house or even an empty space finds that Mr Blanding.Melvyn Douglas, who has a great comic burn, is more than just the truth. and acts as Blandings lawyer and mind. Myrna Loy is also her best as a rather absent-minded but extremely patient woman. But the best result is Grant. He is an American, especially important at the time of the release of the film, when the people were in short supply after the end of the war. Topics are universal, lack of money, labor, fear of infidelity. Yes, it covers terribly well, but you have to remember that it was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending. It is still relevant today, and I have to go to the bad reviews that I prefer the dumbs of the current preference, the chosen comedies of the brand. The film's appearance is slippery and there are very big comedy bits, especially towards the beginning. Although it may have lost some of its social significance, it is still a pearl 60 years after its release.
