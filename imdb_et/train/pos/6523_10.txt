Of course, the history of this film was "Hollywoodized" - but it is by no means the only mass of history that has been rewritten for the mass. Lafitte joined the Americans because she considered herself French and hated the British, not because some countries knew about New Orleans over patriotism in just a short time; he broke his agreement and returned to the smuggling that led to his sailing Galveston; he was rather a small criminal and spooky than a hero * or * laughing. But who cares? This is one movie that is just entertainment - and we saw it, we all wanted Jean to go in a pinch rather than the governor's prudish daughter. Brynner rises again a mediocre letter to give an exciting result.
