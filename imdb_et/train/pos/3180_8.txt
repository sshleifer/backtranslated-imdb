The friend loaned me the DVD he received from the director during the festival. I was warned that some of the technical aspects of the film were a little trembling and the writing was good but not great. So maybe it painted my opinion, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Participants with participants. Youssef Kerkor was really good when Ernie, the main character, was kind of pathetic. Adam Jones (who also led) and Justin Lane were excellent as reptiles who led Ernie mad. Bill's character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of movies like a panda, was my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional and reminded me of the old college roommate so much that I called the boy after watching the DVD. Really pleasant and very funny. Some of the other actions were good, some were so, but none of them was bad. I also liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny. <br /> <br /> I give this one high mark, although it has some questions, because you can say when you look at these people taking care of their movie and making their own way. Well done to Adam Jones and the team.
