First of all, this movie was a wild race all the way. A story about training soldiers, fighting their bosses, and finally grouping. <br /> <br /> From start to finish. This is one of the warbooks worth seeing if you are in constant cussing (occasionally unreasonable) and the horrors of this box camp. and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) works with Paxton (Matthew Davis) for the whole story, camp for Tigerland and even finally for his help. movie taste. Constant movement, constant activity and just constant confusion. Sometimes it was helpful. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it was becoming more realistic. Some movie points (especially sexual scenes) seemed just too realistic, even though they added an effect to a film that wouldn't be there without them. it was a very sharp film, through and through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farre's better films (if not his top score). Action for every character was great. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
