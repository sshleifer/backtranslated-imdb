SPOILER ALERT! This film, zero-day, gives the lives of two students, Andrei and Calvin, who feel annoyed and hated about everyone and the schools involved. <br /> <br /> Discussion "Missions" All leading up to a huge mission that is zero day. The zero-day content is not set until the end of the movie. The viewer knows his serious and full of hatred, but is never quite sure before the end. <br /> <br /> Now we all know when the movie is based on the Columbine massacre, it is endlessly beautiful. And ending is no different than any other film about the attack, they go and kill many of the end of their fellow students. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies on this attack, and this movie on Far is my favorite and most abused. It gives the viewer and the inner viewer the lives of the two teenagers who hate life and, frankly, give the viewer some insight and the closing of a terrible event. <br /> <br /> Only 7-year Events that were played, I never knew the severity of the shootings until my English class was assigned to an essay or story from our generation. Well I knew everyone was choosing twin towers, but I wanted to be different because of course the twin towers are tragic and very defining, but I didn't think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way to do that because I was just In the 3rd grade, I had no idea what it all meant. But the shots left and affected. I remember interviews, school views, and thousands of people's eyes hurt and terror. <br /> <br /> This movie is convincing on the ground and a terrible masterpiece, and I would like to accept it for everyone.
