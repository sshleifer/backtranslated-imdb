Jack Frost is really a cool movie. I mean .... He's funny. His violent. and very pleasant. Most people say it's B, but it can't be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good performance. The only strange thing, of course, is the killer snowman. I think this movie was actually one of the best films of the nineties. Most of these days there are no films from the criteria of A Clive Barker Master Piece. This means you have to be original and give the viewer what they don't expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10 Rating: A +. Ed also recommends Movie Uncle Sam for Jack Frost fans.
