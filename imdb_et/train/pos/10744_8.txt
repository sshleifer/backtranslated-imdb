The events of September 11, 2001 do not require an additional human interest due to the training of a rookie firefighter or the progress of two French brothers. In my opinion, it would have been better to exclude it. I think the directors were trying too hard, maybe they thought the day's events needed a story. One policeman comment - "this a f fing ing Disneyworld" is appropriate. <br /> <br /> However, it is an interesting look at events. The filmmakers were in the right place at the right time, no other day's picture responded to their picture.
