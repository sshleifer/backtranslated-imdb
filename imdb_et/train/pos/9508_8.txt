In the poor village of Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luján) lives in his old house with his asthmatic wife, Lola (Marisa Paredes). Lola still kills his son, Augustin. For twenty-seven years, the Colonel has been awaiting his fighter for a war against the Catholic Church. For political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old struggle. Without any possession or money, but with a valuable gamecock, they are fighting for survival, awaiting a letter of confirmation from the government, recognizing the law and paying late pension. This slow and touching film reflects the social and financial situation of most older pensioners in third countries. In Brazil, most retired people have to live around $ 80.00 a month. The story of the Colonel's debt paid to his son for the graveyard, otherwise he would be buried forever. Outstanding results are a very sad story, a reality in poor countries. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): ("Não se Escreve ao Coronel") (don't write to the colonel) <br /> <br />
