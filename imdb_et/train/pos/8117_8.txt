For the first time I saw this movie 40 years ago by N.Y. on television and thought it was a frustrating look to the future. Wells sees a restriction on private freedoms. The 30 years plus war in the movie was the reason why this movie was not shown to warriors by British movie visitors. Future Concept and Repeat Concept for Cars. The future is the real stars of the film, the best actors are Ralph Richardson as Boss, the combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from absolutely fabulous comedy, which is interesting to note that Boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to the time of Churchill.
