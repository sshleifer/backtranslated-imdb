I watched this movie over 100-200 times and I love it every time I watched it. Yes, it can be very horny, but it is also very funny and enjoyable. The camp shown in the film is a real camp, where I actually attended for 7 years and depicted as a camp that is a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who has ever gone to camp, wanted to go to the camp or sent the child to the camp, should see this film because it will bring you and your children a pleasant memory.
