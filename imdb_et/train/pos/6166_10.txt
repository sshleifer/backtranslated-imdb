Bill was basically a cultural fountain that created a beautiful rainbow-social-spiritual rainbow that inspired famous derivatives such as Cop Land, The Departed, The Godfather 3, and most recently The Wire. /> Versatile characters and story lines that are described as "4-dimensional Shakespeare", Bill grabbed you collars from the episode one and just didn't let you go. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is covered, expected and even occasionally caused by all the major global events from 1984 to 2010. The most famous in history is the 5th episode 19, which was presented on the eve of the Second Persian Gulf War. Detective Jim Carver's misleading - and ultimately - end of career - drug attack on Craig 'Fun Boy' Richardson's apartment at Jasmine Allen's building in early 2003 was widely regarded as a predictive allegory that the coalition did not find weapons of mass destruction after the invasion of Iraq several months later. <br /> <br /> But this was the job Bill did to highlight some of the lesser-known problems that police officers most praised. It was a sympathetic drama involving sensitive areas such as helmet-phobia, inadequate cross-coverage, obsolete homosexuality, lost trophies, casual drunkenness (regretted), siren reluctance syndrome (SAS), strangulation caused by the search for a suspect, carrying them too much with starch and many, many problems that still struggle, annoy, haunt and encourage officers to this day. <br /> <br /> The last word should go to one of Bill's most famous fans, Nelson Mandela: "It is no exaggeration to say that I would not have done it in the darkness of loneliness, which took his last years of imprisonment on Robben Island if it was not Reg Hollis heart-warming, casual holiday.
