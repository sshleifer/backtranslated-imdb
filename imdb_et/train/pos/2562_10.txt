This is one of the greatest love story films I've ever seen. Yes, I agree that some parts may seem dated, but it doesn't pull the movie. Over time, efforts should be made to monitor, criticize and enjoy any form of art. It is clear that Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring in "Sex in the City" standards. However, he was fantastic when he assessed the prospect of America in 1925. Similarly, Sayonara is a breakthrough film that looks at the combination of racial love, the arrogance and prejudice of America's "apparent destiny", and the complexity of different cultures. Such a film is a natural next step as a gentleman. However, it was not just a social comment, but it was fun and enjoyable, with countless lines that you just don't forget. <br /> <br /> But even if it's just a love story, it's terrible. Although some of the attacks on Brando's accent, he has the best in nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umek (both winning Oscarei) and other supporting casts added a lot more to the movie. while he is against his duty and loyalty. His speech, when he first meets and talks to Brando, is a classic and rarely a cinema ever. Likewise, the dialogue between Taka and Brando in the Tokyo dressing room is also good. Of course, it has not been sucking, spitting and getting worse, which illustrates love in today's movies, but it makes it even better. It represents true love and passion, not just "warmth". If this film doesn't touch you, you're just too young, too cynical or dead.
