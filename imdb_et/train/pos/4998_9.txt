Shannon Lee, the daughter of Bruce Lee, offers a struggle for attack in this exhilarating Hong Kong film that proves that, like his late brother Brandon, he is a real chip from his old block. In this fast-paced flick, high-tech stuntwork dies and Bond filmmakers should see if they want to increase the distribution of the next 007 adventure activities, because there are many innovative things with fresh and fresh. the original second unit is working to strengthen the already high level of content "AND NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN". When you watch the movie at a fast pace and entertain, you will wonder how the cinema itself is alive before the creation of the martial arts genre. I really believe that films in general and films in particular were the first Kung fu films debuted. Bruce Lee was the father of a contemporary cinema, and his legal surviving successor, Shannon, does not let the surname go here. Although this movie has a number of pleasant performances (Michel Wong to one), it is Shannon Lee, whom you remember a truly remarkable result as Mandy hitgirl supreme.Hell, you might come off whistling your struggles!
