This movie is one of my great favorites. It's hard to explain why. Perhaps it is Corin Nemec's innocence and his clumsiness with Cheryl Pollak's courage, but it certainly has something to do with it. Some characters have little lines or movements or moments that are fun and in themselves. Finally, this is a story that always draws my hearts and the last scene is so bitter. All in all, I love this movie; this is the perfect boy, the sentimental night of girls.
