This film was made in 1943 when I thought Judy was at her top (looks smart). In his previous film For Me and My Gal, they often say he looks silent. Well this movie looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows she has an elegant comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is fun, especially at the beginning when trying to conduct an audit with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes in my opinion is the transfer of Judy Lady Macbeth and when John is looking for him at the party to give him a quick (Lol). <br /> <br /> One criticism is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, one minute he despises him and the next they go out on the date, next time they meet after that date they're in love. . If I was Lily, I would be furious about John, but he is not ... it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> But all I have to give this movie to 10 is because it's just wonderful and almost perfect.
