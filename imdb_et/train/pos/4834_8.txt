Anyone who wants to get an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russian history is a monumental film of treasure. The story begins at the beginning of the century (1900) with the yellowish sepia colors of old photographs, which improve mid-century black-and-white and full color when the story approaches today's times (ie 1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on the boy in the far village of Siberia, which is characterized by the arrival and arrest of the anarchist during the Tsarist era. Later he joined the Bolshevik after the revolution and brought Soviet communism to his village. His son, due to local beauty, fights with the Germans during World War II. When he returns to the village, the oil industry starts to go out and is treated with some Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow but perfectly logical and well done. This can be seen in three parts.
