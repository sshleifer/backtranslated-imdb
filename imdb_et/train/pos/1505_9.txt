"The House That Dripped Blood" is one of the best antology films of the time period. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Tracking the missing movie star, Inspector Holloway, (John Bennett) finds the last reported observation in a rural mansion. Looking through the house, he speaks of four different readings from past house residents. <br /> <br /> Good Story (s): Murders Method Mysterious mansion moves to get peace and quiet, while Charles writes his latest masterpieces, Horror's writer Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice (Joanna Dunham) are a story about focusing on the Dominic series. After many strange accidents and experiences in the house, Charles believes that the work I have in life is alive and worshiping him and his wife. Probably one of the best entries in the movie, it's the toughest. Such an atmosphere distinguishes it. Scenes of a fictional nature are really horrible, its surrounding secret is really effective and there is always a classic sliding time. The classic moment is killing in a psychiatrist's office, the highest fear of all time. Its structure, with sounds, fast flashes of mysterious nature, and thunderstorms, and lightning work well for it. <br /> <br /> Sweets for a new home for sweet movements, widow John Reid (Christopher Lee) hires former school teacher Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) for his young daughter Jane (Chloe Franks) when she is in business. Ann gradually darkens Jane's dark secret that John negatively denies. When he learns what has happened, it is much more shocking than he might have thought. This is an extremely pleasant entry if it is the most striking and perfect story. The mystery of the family is perfectly played, with small amounts of clues put together here and there, and the ultimate revelation is even anti-nervous. This part alone is the main reason why it works, and Lee doesn't hurt it either. <br /> <br /> Bad story: Waxwork-tortured memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) are both enthusiastic about the shape of a woman at Wax Museum because she takes over life, they discover the shocking mystery of both haunting museums. Here's a clever assumption, and it's an excuse to spend time in a wax museum that's always horrible. This is no exception, and it seems terrifying, as the fluorescent lighting displayed on the sculpture helps. The sequence of dreams provides an excellent snapshot, but what ultimately kills is a slow pace. It takes time for events to go out and most of the time it takes to expose. It is also based on the shock that is visible from miles away. They are indeed smaller. If the twist had changed, it would have been higher, the rest was acceptable. <br /> <br /> Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), an actor on the horror of hidden veterans, is irritating to the lack of reality in his new film, extinguishes and buys a new vampire from the shade store. The shelter will soon turn him into a vampire that goes crazy with a set of characters like Carla, Ingrid Pitt, and other vampires at home. Unconvinced that hiding is the cause, he does everything he can to prove that it is just his imagination. It has a pretty good premise and there are many options for some decent fears, but there are several factors that sink. First, it's too good if it's good. Plot twisting is a perfect example, which is so superfluous that it is not a shock, and just comes up just as silly. There are so few scenes of fear or trying to scare that it is just drilled to sit down. It's the weakest film. <br /> <br /> Final Decision: A fairly decent omnibus movie, some small issues between each couple's story that make it less than a perfect but still very observable movie. Recommended for those who enter similar movies at the same time or who enjoy British horror movies. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG-13: Violence
