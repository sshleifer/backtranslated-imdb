What a great example of "less is more ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines and 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black-and-white photo, if your thoughts are to be filled with blanks, facial expressions, physical drama, emotional gesture, everything is stronger. This is one of the 5 best films I can't live without, just like the classic like Road Warrior. If you liked it, check out Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior and Braveheart, both playing Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen, who was also a soldier. "Thirteen Warrior", playing Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" starring Harrison Ford.
