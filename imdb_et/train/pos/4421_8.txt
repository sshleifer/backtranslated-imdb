Gojoe is part of the new Japanese cinema waves, taking in very creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historical themes by the Japanese "periods". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows us to look at the traditional beliefs of shamanism, demons and occultists, which were certainly part of their ancient culture, but which were not actually studied in the Kurosawa samurai epic or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I put director Sogo Ichii into one of the most exciting and creative Japanese wave leaders. Other recent Japanese periods I would like to highly recommend are Yomada Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
