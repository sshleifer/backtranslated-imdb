I'm a big fan of Woody Allen and so when I saw it playing in the cinema, I couldn't help myself. I wanted to see how Allen watches her great movie Match Point because it's one of her films filmed by G.B. (which is unique between Allen's work) with what appears to be her new museum, Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and humor is Scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a student of journalism) who gets a hint of a hot story outside the grave. He falls in love with a suspect killer (Jackman) and he has to decide if the truth is worth it. Oh, and all this is done with a ghostly wizard who turned to Allen's detective. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I enjoyed Johanson's performance thoroughly, but I am a bit biased, I could watch three hours with Johanson ever and still be fascinated. He plays ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart, which is a kind of variation due to Allen's stereotypical neurosis. He adds a body language that fits the comic. Needless to say, almost anyone who sees it will find Johanson's character gently cute and that is a plus. <br /> <br /> Allen is Allen ... He still plays the same character as Chaplin and his little trampoline. Something that happens in this movie makes me wonder if I can see the neurotic little hypochondria. She hasn't cast her next picture and has spent more time just behind the camera late ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also enjoyable because he is a dirty, suspect of millionaires murder. I can't say Jackman does his role to fill him, but he still fits his character. <br /> <br /> I can't help but feel it is fresh ... In fact, it smells of Jade Scorpion's curse. Johanson and Allen are more than detective. But I have to admit Allen to its end because it is a bit smarter than your typical Hollywood version of this movie. Instead of being black and white, things are colored in gray. Being completely innocent is not a related or unequivocal fault. Although the plot seemed old, Woody had another lining. I found my hints interesting to my last movie ... Come to humor, laugh and be happy. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you enjoy Allen's work, look at it. Not seeing anything else ...
