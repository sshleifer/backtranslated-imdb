I met Cracker Bug viewing last night before Disney's hole preview. I don't know who decided to show it, but I'm very glad they did it. The Cracker Bag is an absolute pearl, a snapshot of Australia in the early 80s, as seen by the child. The conversations between Eddie and her brother were fun and, as in the rest of the movie, alive. Each shot brought a great nostalgic feeling because it reminded me of my childhood (the same age as the director probably helps a bit) and the sound multiplied for hours. I just hope I can see Cracker Bug in a few days.
