Heart warming film. The usual great actor John Thaw, who recently passed. A man who was always so modest. He was one of my top 10 actors in England. <br /> <br /> He is remembered for his famous inspector Morse role. Like Jack Regan in the 1970s, Sweeney and Barrister Kavanah QC hit the TV series. Must see an excellent DVD for the whole family and for my collection. Filming brings back some of the memories of people who remember Britain during the war and certainly those who were evacuated from London to escape the German bombings. Communication between the two main characters.We and our boy William were really good and true to Michelle Magoria's book.
