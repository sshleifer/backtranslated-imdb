a bit slow and boring, a story of an old man and his wife living in a dead-built building and communicating with fixed characters like the postman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the prosperous cigar smoker. River photography is wonderful as well as interior period decoration. If you like decorating the banana shops, it is a must.
