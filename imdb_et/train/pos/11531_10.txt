I remember being a child when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror film (maybe that's why I remember some of its parts). I don't remember much about acting, submissive scenes, or other things, but remember that a man is blown up with a grenade, a man who is crushed over a tree, and a man who drives off a truck and shot a head :) (Todd Schaefer Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister cut off the killer's stomach to get the keys to the truck. This is a movie that gives you a slip and worth a look. But where do I find it? How do I download it?
