The casting of Jack Cassidy as Ken Frank had a beautiful shine. Cassidy's personalized arrogance, self-confidence, charm and wit - all that burns, a bad little smile on her face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best murderer (three times) in the Columbo series. This particular (and first) performance is my favorite Columbo episode - hands down. The fresh face of Steven Spielberg did amazing camera work (yes, at times there were a couple of camera-actresses) that took shades and embarrassment between Columbus and Franklin at different and intriguing angles. There was also a great career in panoramic and dense footage with a very spectacular effect on Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin Cabin). <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this episode yet, you owe it yourself. this is a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was very contagious. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was very sad and really very tragic - he certainly had his best year before him. Rest in peace Jack, you live forever through your great work.
