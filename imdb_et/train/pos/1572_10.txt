If you read a review from another user saying that it is a terrible game, I couldn't stop and do anything! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is great, from news clips (with two real people, full of humor and credibility!), story, I find it very good! I only complain that the enemies are flashing when they die until they disappear; LEILA VR missions, here and there, have some frustrating situations ... <br /> <br /> Except this, it's a great game with great story, good graphics, great characters, great soundtrack ... Ma recommend it! Definitely! It may be a bit old but still enjoyable! At least in Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version has to be the same.
