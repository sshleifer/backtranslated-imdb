CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. Part of NYC's political life vignettes and part of the moral story. Al Pacino, Dukakis-esque Boss, with the President's dreams, often produces trivial or modest performance. There are a few times when he looks at the landscape, and in the case of CITY HALL it is where he looks. John Cusack gives a modest and generally flawless performance without getting into the New Orleans dialect or sliding the melodrama to the top of the movies. Danny Aiello is also a very good political leader. I also love showtunes. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with CITY HALL and it's a good movie in many ways is the general feeling that there is no momentum. It's a documentary rather than a movie. We see the action or follow the story from the separated perspective and of course the viewer does not participate. If the viewer does not participate to a certain extent, they become apathetic and eventually plot. <br /> <br /> It tends to alienate and should have been riveting, a detailed disclosure finale, came as "Hmmm ... uh ... okay." They say "you can't fight the town hall," as a wear-resistant clich√© goes. However, it cannot prevent you from thinking about what might have been if they had been struggling with this film scenario and temple.
