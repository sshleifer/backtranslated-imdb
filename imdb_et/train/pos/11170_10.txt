Pet Sematary is something I never knew. Maybe I was a kid when I first looked at this experience making it so memorable. But when I look at it again and again, it never gets old and I will never forget. Opening credit and its horrible opening song until the very chaotic end is something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and it keeps your head ringing: sometimes dead better! <br /> <br /> I don't think it would be useful to re-associate the whole story. Everything you need to know begins with point A (the most appropriate situation for a happy American family) and step by step in step B (which is, believe me, the end of all the joy). Music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool and Pet Sematary is the last place on earth. As I said, sometimes dead better!
