As a community theater actor who works hard for that but doesn't take too much action, I've always been entertained by those who treat it as great art. This movie is concealed by "Actor's Handcraft" mercilessly, trying to laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> The cinema actor's movie location is similar to a dictator. If the dictator dies too much of the drink and food due to a heart attack, the actor is kidnapped and forced by the head of the neo-Nazi secret service to "play a part in life". He plays it on the hook, the dictator's girlfriend can fall in love with her and vice versa and hits the prisoners beautifully. <br /> <br /> A lot of big bucks run by managers, a lot of good work for some unknown supporters, especially household workers and two palace guard members, and fun little fires. Sammy Davis Jr. makes himself light, Jonathan Winters plays a half-retired American businessman with something else, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and above all Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a dark movie, but it has many beautiful places (in Brazil), a humorous script, and good actors who do their thing and look like they're really entertaining and don't go to the usual existential angst about what is just play!
