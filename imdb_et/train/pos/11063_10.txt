I was completely impressed by Shelley Adrienne's "Waitress" (2007). This film only confirms what was clear from this film. Adrienne was a wonderfully talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. He managed to show the suffering of everyday life with absurd humor and a true warm, optimistic and humanistic tendency. Ally Sheedy steals this movie terribly like a woman who has fallen over the edge. Regent Reg Rodgers, looking like Judd Nelson, is good. Ben Vereen also has a big fire. The song at the end of Adrienne's "The Bastard Song" may be his optimistic horror: <br /> <br /> "It's a world of suffering, <br /> <br /> pain, <br /> <br /> No matter how much sun you get, <br /> <br /> You're under the rain ... <br /> <br /> Don't let your heart dont let you down, <br /> <br /> Don't greet Heartbeat in front of your door, <br /> <br /> Don't live in the heartless
