The last time I saw a movie that was about seven years, so my opinions can be closed over time. At that time, I enjoyed filming between film and live action. At that time, I felt sad about the blue camel and his sad life. I also felt a bow, when the heroine's (princess or toy sheepdog) tables, which she was given, were robbed after her master's contagion. Unfortunately, the producers did not decide to transfer this movie to VHS, so I have 20 years old memories. I'm sure when I saw the movie again, I find it tough and delicate, but I really enjoyed this movie.
