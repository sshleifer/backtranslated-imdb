The exhibition is about two sisters living together. Being younger, teenagers have some teenage problems, on the other hand, his sister Val has a job, a boyfriend, a French problem like most women on the planet. They try to support each other, they sometimes make mistakes, but they do not give up or continue. And it's also friendship. Life priorities. I loved this example so much. It's funny and the actors are so good. I'm really sad that the show is over. I'm still watching from time to time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth can be a new comedy, but he really plays well. She's one of the actors she likes. I like the relationship between Vince and Holly, which is very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time she appears. Tina Holly found a real friend and I really like them hanging. Lauren's character is so funny and he is a natural talent. I'd like to see her more. This show really takes you and makes you laugh. I wish the show wouldn't end.
