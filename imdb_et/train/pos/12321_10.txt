I saw this movie in childhood. And after 10 years I didn't remember anything about this movie, but I found that I didn't know how to find out about this movie. It's my life. My favorite movie all the time. My words don't match what I have for this movie. I'm watching this movie. It is fantastic, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, scary and martial arts. The story of the power of love is quite touching and warm. This is a Hong Kong cinema masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Sinnui Yauman is undoubtedly one of the best staples ever made for film. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, China's Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man who is lucky enough to look for a monastery in the woods, a place where villagers go very close. The trek alone is dangerous to wolves, and the crazy Taoist mung lives at the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi responds to Zinc, a beautiful and mysterious young girl who lives also in an abandoned temple. He is forced to attract men for his evil mistress, but when he meets innocent Ling Choi Sin, they love it. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a kind of fool, but his heart is in the right place when Tsing tries to protect him from the spirits of other forests, he is trying to protect him from the monk who tries to kill spirits in the forest. There are great martial arts, even a monk that breaks into a drunken song when it performs ritual tao-sword forms. In the film, many traditional old martial arts films are made through acrobatics, magic and air, jumping from a wooden tree to elegant long bathrobes and scarves, but the film really flows and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> Tsing is married to an evil tree monster that can't be good, and we know his gravity in his home, where we meet his sisters and stepmother who is really not nice. <br /> <br /> They have to fight a deadly tree with a witch and go to the heart of hell with Yin to fight a thousand-year-old evil to save her souls and bring Ling's ashes back to her home so she can get the right burial so she can would be able to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really pays attention to detail. This film is touched in many ways, you laugh, cry and just have fun with martial arts and cinematography. And while at the end, Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride under the fascinating rainbow of morning sun, we never know whether Zinc was given a reincarnation, but we know him.
