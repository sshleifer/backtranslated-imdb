Yes, I call it a perfect movie. Not one boring second, fantastic majority of little-known actors and actors, a large number of characters that are all well-defined and all have understandable motifs, can bring perfect lighting, crisp black-and-white photography, a suitable soundtrack, intelligent and harmonious design and story that is interesting and works. This is one of the main high-quality pictures that all Hollywood pride should rest on, everybody should try to reach the mark. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is just stunning. This actor had nothing, and on the melodramatic side he was always easy. There are no hysterical outbreaks with this lady - I thought she was a better actor than the goddess of the screen like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as harsh as nails and at the same time real feelings. It is fair to add that he also got many good parts during his long career and that is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits well with this movie. These are wishes, people's wishes, which I think everyone understands. In fact, nobody seems to feel that in this movie, all the characters act on impulse, everyone wants to be happy without anyone else suffering. The sad fact that this often causes complications changes the dramatic content I don't go to here. <br /> <br /> I liked what this film has to say about young people, maturation and necessity. compromise. The film that I associate the most with is the shadow of Alfred Hitchcock, creating the same atmosphere as the ideal and at the same time caricatured in the small town of America. The story is similar to Fritz Lang's much tougher movie Clash by Night, which was made a year ago, where Stanywck marks a similar part. I can also recommend it.
