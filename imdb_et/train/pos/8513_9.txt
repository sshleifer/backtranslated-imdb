I've always had the philosophy that every person has different tastes, I found this movie fantastic and I think every college student can agree with me. Despite this, it is not a "film plot", its actual boys and some "problem" they are facing. I found the movie in a fun way (especially the parts they played with each other in practical jokes). Simply put, if you're the same "wave length" as these people, you'll find this movie amazingly. I don't think it's going to win gold globes or oscars or people in this movie will become Hollywood stars for the future, but they have some sort of "cult classic" among young people who might be related to their experiences. For me, the most prominent man, Hans, is a Scandinavian man who, according to him, is not a spectator, but receives all (or some) chicks. "Small people" also play a big role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I go on, I can offer a spoiler and I don't want to do it, just go and get a movie and you won't regret it. I'll give him 8/10
