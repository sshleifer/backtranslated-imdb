I came to Nancy Drew, who is waiting for the worst ... because everyone else has bad comments. I thought: Although I don't read books, it doesn't see anything like Nancy Drew I've heard. But I was wrong. Of course, this was not a carbon copy of the books, but if you do something out of the movie, you need to change it to get a big screen for entertainment. The plot was enjoyable and exciting with many real fears, and I thought Emma Roberts was truly believable by portraying her classic character. There were several funny moments and, unlike many statements, Nancy wouldn't come out at some point. He was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. One thing this film did well was the whole thing balanced with comedy, romance, breaks and a heartfelt moment. I loved this movie. What a flick that flick! And if you are smart and decide to trust me and go see it, be prepared for some SCARY like hell moments, because I was, for example, amazing! Take a look at it or stay out of the dust and let other people decide what you think of this movie ... a mistake I almost did. I love it, I want to have this movie! I also love Emma Roberts. He's like a DH mini-Bree Van De Kamp. Love it, love it.
