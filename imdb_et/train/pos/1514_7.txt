In all the stars of the Hammer, this is a highly effective part of the British horror around the house and the fate of its earlier tenants, whose stories are told to the Scottish yard detective, looking for the missing actor. <br /> The track number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, deals with the writer and his wife who have just moved in the house and intend to stay for a short time to write one of his horror novels. He creates a dementia character, Dominic, who is very strange when looking at a stranger and soon finds himself crazy when he sees this beast-looking man everywhere. After her wife persuades her to seek psychiatric help, a sub-section is introduced that, frankly, doesn't work for me. I won't break it for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best in my opinion) marks a wonderful Peter Cushing as Philip Grayson, a man who moved home to his retirement age and soon he will go to a nearby wax museum (dealing with macabre) where he is very Surprised to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman in her past. Shortly thereafter, an old friend (who also has a history with this woman) is in business and falls to see her. Two men are threatening to wake up because they will soon discover that this woman is more than an eye. <br /> <br /> The story of a three star one of my favorites ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After arriving home with her peculiar daughter Jane, the babysitter she hires becomes terribly suspicious of how Reid is suppressing her daughter. Well, to find out ... if he knew what Lee did, he would have understood. <br /> <br /> The final story is a rather light-colored vampire story that marks John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson found himself becoming a very created creature, which he represents several times during his career. <br /> <br /> Overall, the pace and direction were very good, as it was most of the performances. Here and there was the result of a wonderful Gothic style and atmosphere. It is an upright holder and is highly recommended.
