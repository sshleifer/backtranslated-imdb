I was glad to see that he has black hair! I've been a fan for about 30 years and have been sorry for the two previous events to film movies. <br /> <br /> I was delighted that scriptwriters updated their computer add-on period. t do not spoil it at all. In fact, I watched the movie twice in one day, which is a sure sign that it was standard. That's what I do with books I like. <br /> <br /> I thought all the characters were well represented and represented Modesty Blaise in the early days as a book and a comic book. I should also not accept the comment of the previous reviewer regarding the bad guys who have to be ugly. Has he actually read the books? <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie and I look forward to the results.
