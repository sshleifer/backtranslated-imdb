I really have to say that it was always my favorite when I went to my grandmother. And it's still there. It's very close to the book. How it was filmed and the players were just great! I have to recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. Almost everyone I talk about hate TV movies, but it was really great! I gave it to 10/10.
