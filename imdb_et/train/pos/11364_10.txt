Row, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (small role) are excellent in their performances. Sutherland has a particular role to play in depicting a character whose morality is initially uncertain to the public. As is often the case with Sutherland characters, we have to ask, "Is he a wool [in this case a minor] or a hero?" <br /> <br /> This is an annoying story, to put it mildly, in the old Soviet incompetence and purely bureaucratic obstacles that prevented the efforts of highly competent people. As the character of Sutherland notes, "The dimension of bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions". The "Committee meeting" (between Row and Sutherland characters) after the perestroika comes into force with this revelation has a tremendous emotional impact. You may feel the suffering of dedicated people who worked in this system. <br /> <br /> The dramatic scene depicting family members of the iceberg adds an emotional resonance to the story. This is a rare phenomenon for the film with this diseased substance, but reminds us that the victims lived and were loved. <br /> <br /> This is a sad, but very important film that deserves its exhibition.
