This is a movie I've seen more than any other (I think I saw it on average once a year after its release). And every time I see it, it's just as fantastic and always shows me something new. Most probably the best combinations of former Yu cinematography were. This film is absolutely necessary for every lover of self-respecting film. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom. This is a movie movie that everyone should have in their private video collection.
