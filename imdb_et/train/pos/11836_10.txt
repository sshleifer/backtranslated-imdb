This animated movie is a masterpiece! Story, music, animation and storyline, where everything is remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw it for the second time and got more information about it. We called a couple of friends to see the Spirit and they really enjoyed it. When I asked them to see it, they thought it was a horses movie, but after that they realized it was more. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek, who reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who smiles with wolves. The Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found to be amplifying and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit for the third time and want to see it again. I liked the "Spirit" enormously, because the depiction of this American Indians is realistic, dignified and non-stereotypical, unlike the movie "The Way to El Dorado", which was a complete farce, because it depicted American Indians disrespectfully and stereotyped. But Dreamworks has redeemed itself, making the Spirit a great movie that I found acceptable! I hope they will continue to play more animated films like the Spirit, and I would like to see the after-effects or spinoff of Spirit if it were respected and without the American Indian stereotype. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see the Spirit: a Cimarron slave.
