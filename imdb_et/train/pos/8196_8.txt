I don't know why people think it's a bad movie. It got a pretty good plot, some good activities and a change in Harry's location is not painful. Of course, some are offensive and free, but this is not the only such movie. Eastwood is in good shape as Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hing in this movie as a small town policeman. If you liked DIRTY HARRY then you should see it, it's much better than DEAD POOL. 4/5
