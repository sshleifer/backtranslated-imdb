It's kind of crazy, but I recorded both TCM and its German version of Anna Christie MGM and English ... but I saw it first, "I heard many people thought many people thought it was better than in English. <br /> <br /> You didn't see one, I can't compare them, but anyway, this is a great early talk that Garbo has come straight from his heart, he looks very beautiful in this movie, his face shining all the time especially when cameraman William Daniels gets these great close-ups. big French director Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who had led Garbot in "Kissing" in 1929. <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is great and gives an absolutely unbelievable presentation when Anna sweetheart boiled, tough, a sailor who is just a guy's body boy. Hans Junkermann also gives a very good idea, as does Anna's alcoholic father and Salka Viertel, how good-hearted the old cheap floozie. <br /> <br /> Very big experience because it's the only movie you listen to in Garbole to speak a foreign language ... "All the other movies he did in Sweden or Germany were in Silent Era. <br /> <br /> Serious flick.
