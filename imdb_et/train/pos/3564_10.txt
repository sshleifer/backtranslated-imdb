{Possible spoilers coming ... you have been warned beforehand.} <br /> <br /> This is one of my all-time favorite music and movie music! (The second is fucking Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, the shining of the show (not to mention the songs) disappears from its transition from screen to screen. This is mostly STOP here is not. <br /> <br /> Sets are divine, light and colorful, characters are bigger than life, and you can't help them, but Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (So ​​glad to know that they used the original Broadway choreographer). <br /> <br /> All actors "hit the ball" (ie, have the best chemistry) in this movie. Frank and Marlon are absolutely unbelievable as the owner of the oldest floating crap game in New York, and the most notorious gambler, who even invests the least in things - like his fever up to 104 when he doesn't take penicillin. Sweet, fresh face Jean Simmons is perfect for Sarah's role (although this is true, her song tubes are not as prominent as Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - Mission Clock Golden Heart and Ride Heal All. And last but not least (in my list) is Miss Vivian Blaine, who repeats her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide - Hot Box singer and dancer who would like to end her 14-year-old involvement with Nathan in marriage and get rid of her psychosomatic the cold he gave him. <br /> <br /> First of all, worship Stubby Kay and BS Pulley as they repeat their Broadway roles like Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. These men never had two more loved players. <br /> <br /> Brando is great, as usual, and although he did not get the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget it - as he has the firm desire to bring everything he can into the role of Sky Masterson. "Luck Be A Lady" gives me chills every time I see her. It is especially enjoyable to hear that he says, "Father ... I have a cider in my ear." <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and pleasing to your looks, voice and your own wear. You're so precious that he doesn't just win from heaven (or eventually believe him) but helps people overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins and live with God. His transfer to "When I was a Bell Tower" is very nice, <br /> <br /> Sinatra is a man. He's so perfect for Nathan Detroit's role - and here he sings parts that Sam Levene didn't get from Broadway (terrible actor, but the trap was a tone for the deaf ... go figure). I really enjoyed adding the song "Adelaide" ... I want someone to sing to me that way. Frankie's cool and slippery behavior goes beyond the limits of this film. But most importantly, you want her to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is perfect in this role. From the lifting of Adelide's Lament, she is just terrible. And he's also my favorite in the movie. She really knows you about Adelaide ... especially if she shouts right before and then again during "Sue Me". I have not yet decided whether I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and Peck" ... maybe I like them equally. Either way, he's fantastic with both them and Take Your Mink. (I'm sorry they'd "Hollanderize" the movie ...) She's completely MARVELOUS, not to mention fun and my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is their lingo. It is a mixture of high class and street slang. They never use "It", "I" or "It's". It's always "It's", "I want" and "It's". In general, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite music and music, and that's one you should look at every time it comes. My only complaint? No "Marry a man today". Now it's a good song.
