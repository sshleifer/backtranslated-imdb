I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love Broadway music and I love the movie. I watched the movie as it wasn't related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they have become films, so I really developed philosophy early. Suppose a movie is based on this book (or musical case), but although the story may be similar, it's not the same, it's not the same, it's different to look at what it is. <Br>> <br /> I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice. I was a good dancer (making choirs in local products as a child, etc.) but I wasn't super talented. However, I was very talented as an actor. My dance teacher and my trainer (who I spent several months a year on my farm) said I had to make a choice when I turned 14 times. days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. and dedicate to one or the other. So I love dancing and I love this movie and many other ballet and dance films. I just decided to watch this movie for what it is, it's a great movie about raw emotion and people's interaction. It is about waiting and heartbreak if you really work hard to get something you want, and you just don't get it. I love the movie. I love Broadway music.
