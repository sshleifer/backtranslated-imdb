There are several things in this film. This is a "good feeling" story. Characters and actors are pleasant, realistic and beautiful. I think the most important thing is that Dennis Quaid knows baseball grip and throw. Robert Redford looked good at both throwing and bats "The Naturalis" and so did Kevin Costner's "Game of Love" and "Bull Durham". "Major League" showed Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen that they knew what they were doing, but many others were not, and that picture was pure stupidity - and not very funny. <br /> <br /> So many earlier baseball films, even if the stories were interesting, made such a lack of baseball capability for leaders, they were ridiculous in this respect: "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command" looked at Jimmy Stewart incredibly as a professional baseball player, if your obesity, not athletic, the elderly in the Uncle's softball game family reunion, other viral and physically strong stars (eg Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also showed baseball capability , which put them in a late round when they picked up Sunday to play on a picnic (even if it was accompanied and even when your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> The Quaid high school team's scenes he was in charge of were those where he was in his trial conversation with Devil Rays, and those who play with him in two smaller leagues and the American League are all true. Participants are credible and capable. In addition, he is an attractive actor who always gives talented and relevant characterization (except to some extent some of his "superficial" scenes and his forced accent to depict Jerry Lee Lewis). But he is definitely a target here, and this movie is "9" as good or better than the others in this genre, except "Natural".
