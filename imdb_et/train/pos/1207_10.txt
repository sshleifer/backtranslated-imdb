I still love it 17 or so years after I first saw it, I actually discovered that I lost a copy and was very upset. Although not related to the original (which I never noticed as a child, and if an adult is not interested), such cartoons should be *. Just in the dark to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone. I am more than happy that my parents brought me to such a thing, not the cartoons we see today, that nothing is taught to our children. The music is great and stays with the head forever ... I've downloaded the whole soundtrack at one time or another.
