On December 28, 1895, the history of the film in the Grand Café of Paris was written on its own, while Louis Lumière showed his short films, all single shots, to the paying audience. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" was the first playable film and I wanted to be there, not only to see the movie, but also to the audience's reactions. <br /> <br /> Let's start with closed doors at the Lumière factory. Obviously, because the picture seems to be a photo, people thought they would just see a slide show, not something they hoped for. But then the doors open and people move out, directing home. First of all, a lot of women, some men and one man with a big dog. If they all shut the door again, whether it is the first movie or not (some say that L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat was the first film in Lumière), it is an impressive part of the early cinema. Because of this, for many reasons, boring is almost impossible. One simple reason: it's just fifty seconds. But for people who usually only want special feature films, there must be something interesting here; you can't see such historical things every day.
