An excellent film about the trials and tribulations of the 11th World War in England. What makes this movie so good is touching the human element. This film is definitely a tradition of British classics such as Mr Miniver and Hope and Glory. As with this movie, we see human despair during the war. <br /> <br /> The performances here are exceptionally prominent by John Thawi, a child who has been evacuated by London bombing. <br /> <br /> We will soon see why this baby is moisturizing his bed. She comes from a frantic mother who has been abusing her. <br /> <br /> The old man takes the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When a child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and finds him only to find the tragedy. He literally kidnaps the boy and can convince the higher up that the child is better with him than the boy at home. <br /> <br /> Image is so good because it deals with and relies on loving relationships.
