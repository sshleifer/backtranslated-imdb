This 1991 NBC-TV movie was released six months before John Goodman's big-screen version of Babe Ruth's life. There is no comparison between the two for my money. TV production is not perfect, but it gives Babe a deeper and more complex story than Goodman's one-dimensional message. I especially liked the portrayal of a movie about the complicated love-hate relationship that Ruth had with Yankee leader Miller Huggins, who always understood his starry glitter and tried to emphasize why Ruthi's own shortcomings never allowed him to become a leader or leader. The TV movie correctly shows how Ruth did not fulfill his dreams because of his mistakes due to the management of the Yankees, while the terrible version of Goodman tries to push the lie that Ruth was denied what he should have taken for him. <br /> <br /> This movie makes a great companion to "Eight Men Out" because the story begins with the arrival of Ruth in New York in 1920, one year after the Black Sox scandal, and when his domestic run destroys literally the recorded baseball. Indeed, the continuity of the two films has even been emphasized when John Anderson reiterates his role as "eight men" as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Land.
