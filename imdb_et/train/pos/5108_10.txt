This is my MOST time magazine. It used to be my Friday night with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was alone. I saw this movie for the first time with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity. I was in 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend. I've read a lot of comments about why Bud left Sissy and how Sissy needs to "marry." But let's go back and see it for the second time: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie, not when I was eight, is the worst of Bud & Sissy's relationship, because he makes him stupid when driving Gilley. They get a great fight. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous, asking Pam to dance. Then Sissy thinks the two are wrong and Wes asks if he needs any help. They're all on the dance floor, acting like fools, when Bud asks Pam, "When would you take me home and rap me?" Pam replies, "If you're Cowboy ready". Bud goes to Pam in his building in downtown Houston. Which father has bought his oil for the money and "all that means". Bud is the one who cheats Sissy. Sissy waits for Buda when he returns home the next day. Sissy is the one who leaves Buddha. Then Budil has to prove to Siss that he is a true cowboy and win him back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is my interpretation. Everyone is sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I got a REAL cowboy! I love her too! :)
