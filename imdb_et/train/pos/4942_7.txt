I have to admit that in the first semester of this movie I was basically lost. There was some fun humor, but at best a barebone plot and a general senseless feeling that made me think I was wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I enjoyed it. There were no dazzling moments of realization and not a sudden dramatic scene that grabbed me. In fact, there is nothing very exciting about the whole movie. Just as suddenly I realized that the film was meant to be largely meaningless - and its very nonsense was its charm. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman celebrated as an unnamed actor who finds a small project to start his career. He starts playing the supermarket manager and spends the day in a neighboring supermarket to explore the role. Although he meets and connects with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a cashier who wants more life. She helps her prepare for a job interview when she listens to her role while she introduces her to real life. This is a really funny "looking at him" (because this is how the badges are identified) when visiting a local Target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were great combined, strange but fully believable combined romantic but father-daughter chemistry. If you feel lost at first, hold it. Finally, it turns out to be a pleasantly charming movie. 7/10
