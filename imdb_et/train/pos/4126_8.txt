Which night. Perry Mason, Will Gun, Will Travel, followed by Gunsmoke (if it was half an hour) and finally at 22.30 came 'Sea Hunt' with its excellent opening theme music and Mike's boat that drove out to new adventures. Amazing .. Whatever the story, it was Lloyd Bridges' leading character, strong, honest and sincere. Man's husband and boy's man. This was of interest for years of boats. Why don't they show or not have access to the video, no idea .. Too bad.
