Very funny movie. The classic film of funny Eddie Murphy in the 80s. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony fails, the movie is funny, well done. In the 1980s, Murphy did a lot of activities that represented him in a way to make fun of everything that was dangerous. There are only a few results that can be judged, but ii movies since 1986 until today have changed. The atmosphere of this time film is good and special effects are good for the film of the period. A nice movie that sees and enjoys evaluating the lost actress, the irony of Murphy today. The final part is anthologies, a pleasant actor who plays the part of the Tibetan monk. That's it.
