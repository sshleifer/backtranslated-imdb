This mini-series has been around for a long time and I am happy to say that its memories have passed the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most A Perfect Spy components, LeCarré's best novel customization, I think is the top drawer. Its remarkable aspects are the musical result and the masterful scenario written by Arthur Hopcraft, who, in my opinion, was a "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" screenwriter with Alec Guinness a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The actors are usually very good, some great, like Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is interesting to watch because his face changes at each camera angle. The passage of time and the impact on the physical presence of the characters is very likely done. So much so I was thinking exactly how old Peter Egan was while filming. The only hit is after Magnus Pym's character has been transferred from the powerful hands of young actor Benedict Taylor to far too old Peter Egan, who has just emerged from Oxford. However, this is an insignificant and irrelevant seam throughout. <br /> <br /> Egan has difficulties only when the text becomes melodramatic and he has to be emotionally nervous, that is, cry. No actress is very easy with these moments, except for the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for her entire value and steals the episode easily. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym. She has a part of her under-skin character, but she often shows an amateur embarrassment that diminishes her as a serious cook diplomatic housewife, Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang is great as Axel, fun, ironic and brilliant. I liked the Sarah Badel camp as a baroness. <br /> <br /> The British view of the Americans is lively in some dry fun scene. When the Janki came to a foreign country with Bo Brammell (head of MI6), the American contingent is depicted as empty buffaloes who seem to have remembered the dictionary for many long words and spelled them liberally with American jargon and psycho bombs, a lot of English puzzling. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness mix up fine. LeCarré has the ability to mix different elements in his stories and Hopcraft has perfectly captured the original melancholic, yet delightful atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not the perfect production (what is it?) and yet the best LeCarré customization for movie or television so far. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for all spy thriller lovers and especially for LeCarré fans. DVD is available from Acorn.
