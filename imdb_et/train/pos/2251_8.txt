I find Alan Jacobs looking at the movie very accurately, but I was able to hire a DVD blocker with commentary from BYU curator, Motion Picture Archives by James D'Arc. At that time, the LDS prophet Heber J. Grant praised the film to understand deviations from historical content for dramatic expression and telescopic events. For example, Joseph Smith's trial showed the film. in spite of Brigham Young's big oral defense of Joseph Smith, he was convicted in any case. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith was never convicted. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, both of whom killed before the trial.
