IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in the company with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first to make a professional killer ANISIO death ESTEVÃO (at least in the beginning, plot), t explain very well why)). The boy does this and, after receiving the money, he starts to expel both partners in his company and says he wants to work there (as a supervisor or something?). At the same time, she meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVÃO and starts to meet her! In a story where crime, corruption, betrayal and extortion go hand in hand, no one is innocent or victim, with the exception of MARINA, the only person who doesn't know what's going on and didn't betray anyone? <br /> <br /> This film represents the sad and cruel reality of sarcasm that exists in a big city like São Paulo, where crime is every day. We may feel irony, but also the truthfulness of such characters as ANISIO (played well by Paulo Miklos), which blackmails the men who paid him without any disruption, and even flirt with the boy's daughter he killed! He really has to be a monster to do something, but of course I know there are people like Brazil or some other place? <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie, cruel but true, sad about reality? Operation is great and also a soundtrack.
