For the first time I was watching the movie when I was a kid, and I'm the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands on my face and eyes in one particular scene. I remembered it again with my unique friends and bought it right now with a great deal of hesitation in the video that I can add (to my surprise I found it only on the web in the Member States when it was made in England!) When I followed my reaction again and surprise was almost the same, fear and surprise fear and my heart have never beaten so much. This is in my opinion a SCARIEST movie ever made, Hollywood movies seem tame compared to and a bit of Pony and Trap (crap), a mercy pun. What's amazing, though, is this movie and sleep, if you look at it with about twenty of my companions I've never heard of so many screams, it's also blocking! Even seeing a video brings me the fear of God for this particular scene and made me feel like I never ever go in the dark!
