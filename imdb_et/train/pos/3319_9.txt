As a long time Red Sox fan, I just had to go to the movie. It was great! Although the miracle of the 2004 Red Sox season can never be saved in real time, some of my favorite Red Sox players were great shots. Although the film is definitely a chick flick, this amazing return of the 2004 Red Sox has enough baseball material to make it one of my top ten films. I especially liked Red Sox fans who were part of the Ben baseball family. The scene where Ben meets his friends on the agenda to make sure who gets a seat for certain games is fun! Must see if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch your spouse, date or other important movie, especially if you're a baseball fan ... and especially if you're a Red Sox fan !!!
