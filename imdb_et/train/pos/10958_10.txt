This show is so incredibly fun that I couldn't look at the marathon in the middle of the comedy tonight (despite having seen all the episodes before). I have always considered Silverman to be a huge talent and this is finally the talent that is available to a wide audience. I look at this example and I laugh very much of the time ... I can't say that many TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (most importantly) funny! This is an exhibition I will never miss and this is the one I buy from a DVD as soon as it comes out. You have to owe yourself to this exhibition ... I predict this series for a long time ... And just to be clear that the people who are offended by this exhibition will not get it ... an understanding of it ... they should stop fools making, attacking something they don't understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in connection with Silverman, or who says he only wants to "shock" ... is out of the mark ... He's exactly the opposite; just google him and you can quickly see that he is a huge proponent of civil rights etc etc. If you do not know that he is ironically embracing all these outrageous views, you will not get it. And if you don't get it, make the rest of us useful and keep quiet about it so that we can all enjoy it ...
