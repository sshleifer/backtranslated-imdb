I saw it on my last day at the festival and I was glad that I was sitting around for a couple of days. Poetic, moving and surprisingly funny, in its own way. It is so rare to see that directors work in a style that is able to find real oddity and humor in a hyperrealist world without being valuable or counterbalanced. It may seem both improvised and fully controlled. I hesitated to compare because these filmmakers have indeed digested their effects (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... ordinary suspects) and found their unique style, but if you like the modern leaders of this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), you you are a true treat. This is a great movie and I hope more people can see it. When this movie plays at your city festival, go! go! go!
