Best Cheech and Chong movie so far! Cheech and Chong are the best of all. I think I've seen them at least twelve times and I love them all. But that's definitely the best. Compared to others, it covers many topics and gives you a lot of good laughs. Some of the texts are still part of our language after 25 years. I hope that one day they will get another one because they are still big comedians. I heard they write a new script, so who knows ... I think these guys are the only ones who managed to make decent movies in this genre. I don't know if John Ashcroft ever looked at one of them ...
