This is a very early Bugs Bunny comic. As a result, the character is still in transition - he is not as elongated as he was later and his voice is not quite right. In addition, Elmer and Bugs chemistry is somewhat unusual. Elmer is a bad juice that buys bugs from a pet shop - there is no weapon and no desire for his brutal burst! Nevertheless, it is still a very enjoyable movie. The earlier mistakes were certainly more dirty and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films, he was confused with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it - they interfered with the rabbit. But in this movie he is much more like the late 30s and early 40s Daffy Duck, who loves to irritate others! True "anarchist" instead of the later cartoon hero. Although this is not one of the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it is sure to see and see how much it has changed over the years.
