La Coda Dello Scorpione (Scorpion's tail case) was a follow-up by director Sergio Martino for a wonderful Strano vision della Signora Wardh. It is the main giallo with all the genre fans who have felt and loved. Twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades, and a little gore all come together to make one piece of Italian abuse. <br /> <br /> A group of giall favorites, both front and rear, work to make it one of the best non-Argento gials. The above-mentioned Martino adds his touch as director, giallo great as Ernesto Gastald as a writer, Bruno Nicolai's music creation, and actor Luigi Pistilli, an actor of the character of a number of giallo stars and stars such as George Hilton, and Anita Strindberg. br /> <br /> Is Scorpione behind all this talent? You wish. The film works on several levels. It's an exciting murder mystery, a tense and violent horror movie and a stopping thriller. All in all, one of the best gials is. <br /> <br /> Martino knows for sure what fans want for gialli. At some points in the film, he seems to be almost directing Argento to his approach. For example, a bird is being blasted directly with Crystal Plumage, where the killer tries to break through the door, which actually crosses the Argento flick. <br /> <br /> Are there problems with flick? Hmmm ... only small. First of all, all scenarios that do not track down the murders or the romance that begins between the two leaders will begin to emerge. But just before you fall asleep, the killer kills somewhere and you're in the swing of things right now. <br /> <br /> The twists also end up being a bit odd. I mean, for what purpose scorpion pins really served? If you don't pay much attention to the dialogue, you can easily lose the twist due to the story of knitting. <br /> <br /> But these small prisoners are being abandoned, La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense, stopping, stylish and all-round giallo fans entertaining movie. Get it!
