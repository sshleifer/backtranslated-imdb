True and true writing is difficult. Knowing how to shoot and assemble it without being trivial is even better. Ishai Setton's film is one of those places where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I've been touched by "The Big Bad Swim" and now I will promote it as much as possible. It's just a shame that I can't show anything to my friends (you know, like a DVD?), Because talking is good ... but seeing something is better. Everyone can't go to the festival to discover such pearls and this movie is really worth it! LARGE YOU for the workers of this masterpiece, and I'm looking forward to distributing it.
