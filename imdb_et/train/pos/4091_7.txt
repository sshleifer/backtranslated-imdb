I saw this movie in London in 1975 and haven't seen it. I found it fun. I loved its originality. It's rare that someone makes such a movie - and that's sad. <br /> <br /> I mean, I always read "The Black Hotel" and as a movie fan, "images in movies. Kinda" customize them, you know? But when I read it, I thought it would make a great movie, but of course it should be "custom" - to the point where it is relatively unrelated to the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought WHY? Of course, it will never be shown on Sunday afternoon on television, but provided it was shown in cinemas ADULTS, who knew what it was, where is HARM? Damn, my civic rights were broken here. The director should be able to customize the "Black Hotel" movie. <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, censorship of adult movies should not be But unfortunately, although I agree with the fact that INTELLIGENT with adults may have such freedom to be harmless, there would always be those who would not have the rationality to distinguish between fantasy and reality and who could be found guilty. n hard to understand how "La Bete" belongs to this category. <br /> <br /> The British censor who appeared in England ruled out this hand. Regardless of 69 relaxation nudity, taking into account the theoretical theme of the film, if censorship is NEXT, he would have sought a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> IF ... these days there was an alternative. G.L.C. It was a local city council, whose department was only able to pass the film to London, where the audience was considered "more complicated" than those who lived on the pole. <br /> <br /> The film was properly presented and PASSED. Later it became clear that the "board" consisted of only four people - three who voted and the "chairman". And the day was one of the voters sick. Consequently, the other two voters and the chairman sat at "La Bete". <br /> <br /> One of these voters, like me, thought the movie was fun and probably wouldn't encourage ANYONE to do wrong. Another lack of imagination and just thought the piece was nasty. And the chairman did not understand it, so FREEDOM decided to make a mistake on the side. <br /> <br /> When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they also thought it was nasty, but it was too late! The film got its "X-London" certificate and opened a mixed reaction. G.L.C. the censorship board of the film was soon liquidated! So La Bete opened only in London what could best be called FLUKE! But I'm glad it was. It's great! If you haven't seen it, do it. It's FANTASY and as such it is much less annoying than most of the things you see these days ...
