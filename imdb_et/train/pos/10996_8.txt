Who can watch the movie, watch Lucy Liu and not be happy. This woman is an amazingly beautiful and talented actor. It's a difficult combination to find the days now. And Jeremy Northam. I heard her name many times but I never noticed her. My advice to Hollywood is to "use her more". <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: I watched it with my cemetery exchange. I don't recommend it to anyone. This is a bit complicated and mysterious. I still can't believe I didn't see the ending coming. I'm not saying the reason why it lootes the movie. although it is said to be sufficiently corrupted. <br /> <br /> I think I can vote on this movie. I love the dark mystical story, the actors did a good job and I love the leaders (natali) in the past. There is no big audience for such a thing, it is also quite risky. you know what, I give this job 8 because everyone should see it. Then there is a 1 point deduction reason that there is always room for improvement.
