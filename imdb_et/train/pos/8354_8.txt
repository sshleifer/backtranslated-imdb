Originally, I saw this movie one year ago on Cinemax Friday after a dark series (back when the cable box was built as a keyboard) and it interested me. Although the film has a pointless point, it has worked well. Depardieu & Dewaere shows are very enjoyable. They have good chemistry and Miou-Miou breathes pink hair. these politically correct times (at least not in the US) because it seems to make things such as violence, robbery and random sex sensitive. This movie proves that a talented cast & gifted talented staging of a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject. It grieved me to find out Patrick Dewaere committed suicide and in the near future I will check it out with Depardieu & Miou -Miou Get Out Your Hankerchief .
