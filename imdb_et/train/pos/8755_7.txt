Although I don't think it was perfect 10, I agree it was over 6, which is rated here. No, the Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it has been tried many times. This does not mean that it should not be done again if it is well done and I think this film has some strong moments. Claire Danes's action, as has been mentioned several times, was flawless, as was Kate Beckinsell and I think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrible, as supportive performances (Pullman's husband, a curious cop, a skip or a trip or whatever his name is). Cinematography was also beautifully filmed, this film had many good things, even if there were some negative ones (three larger ones found). <br /> <br /> Here's what I didn't like is the friendship between the girls - In fact, the girls did not develop their own individual personalities until the late mid-picture. It would have been unlikely that you would lose this interest before, because despite the positive aspects, more character development should have been done and certain scenes, as girls were initially arrested, were almost glossy, so there was a bit of a jump without the character and the development of the scene. suitable for the film. But this is not my big problem. AND WARNING-SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> The end, as mentioned dozens of times ago, was AUS. It was terrible in two ways. First, although it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! Yes, it was an emotional and powerful end, but in such a film there is a sense that justice is earned and I sat through it to see it. I was really shocked at the end and it was with all the participants, but I think both girls should have stepped out or not, at least the policeman should have come to him. I mean, nothing happens to the bad guys, they all get away from it. Very disturbing. <br /> <br /> I also don't understand the lack of clarity. I understand the end that is inspired to think, but it was not a mystery or "Clue" type of film we look at, and I would have wanted to know something that really happened, who was guilty, and so on. I left to decide for myself, but since I have some doubt that there is a sequel, I didn't want to be guessing. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was a lot of fun and the actor is definitely at the top of the list, I would appreciate it 7.5 and say it's definitely worth it.
