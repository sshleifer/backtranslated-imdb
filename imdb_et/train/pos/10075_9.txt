"Masks" is a moving film that works on multiple levels. In the simplest way, this street performer is a haunting story that binds a small child in an attempt to move on to his next generation of creative art (masks). Although sometimes the story turns the work of an old man, it is so well designed (written, acted, focused, wonderful product values), it is easy to move beyond your situation. And when you hang with it, the movie is ultimately very sweet and exhilarating. Tissue around. This is a great movie for both kids and adults. The trick is how to get Americans who don't like foreign language movies to see it!
