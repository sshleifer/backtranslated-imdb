When I saw this example for the first time, I thought it seemed interesting. I looked at it, saw it rotate around Sarah, as the figure sees the world ... around her. I got it, but didn't laugh very much. <br /> <br /> On stage and in his show, he is racist, crude, unknown and very self-centered. I didn't get him initially and took it all at face value. Then I saw my movie, Jesus is magic. I think it was for me the plot of Sarah Silverman, just telling me what she was talking about. He's like Marilyn Manson, who works so hard to give us a terrible idea and pictures, but you finally realize it's not an attack, it's a statement. And if you understand that, you will find that you are happy that someone will finally give it directly to you. your idiocy. Although I like many "smart" exhibitions, I still don't see Curb Your Enthusiasm humor today. I have the impression it's good, but I just can't get it. Many people will never get Sarah Silverman's program, but I'm glad that I finally got it around. songs or dream sequences, product numbers. These people do nothing to fill the time slot and ask the advertisers that they seem to be on a mission to make the best shows they can put together. If I wanted to predict the future of this exhibition, I would say that it is arrested by Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled before it is time and live on the fans' hearts and DVDs. But take your heart, the creators of SSP, the audience is there, and we look as long as they let you show.
