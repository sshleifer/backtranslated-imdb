An example of making World War II documentaries using real forces and civilians who took part in this terrible conflict, and archived film material that has been collected all the time. one and a half years ago, without knowing the Second World War at that time, but it wrapped me up, and now I consider myself to be a buffer for the Second World War, watching and reading everything and everything I find about it, but there's nothing worthwhile to buy near this landmark documentary ............. <br /> <br /> It's just the highest standard of documentary.
