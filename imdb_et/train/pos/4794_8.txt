Going through the eccentric David Lynch takes patience, but for the change, the Alvin Straight journey confirms his life, but stick to it. While it moves as fast as John Straight, when he meets strangers like his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, the painful regrets and secrets, and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth screams with the most realistic performance of his career year, sad and poetic, flinty and caring. And Sissy Spacek suits her with her "slow" daughter Rose, who takes care of her father's care of her father. Rarely is modern film so positive about the family.
