This is the picture John Lassiter is doing today if it was not for CGI's progress. And it's just to say that he would also have forgotten if technology hadn't made things sexy and kewl since 1983. _Twice ..._ has the same sense of perception, imagination, and real excitement that you find on the Pixari flick, which is filled only by the limitations of the medium media. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and great voice to produce a film that invites many levels. It should be spoken in the same breath as _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
