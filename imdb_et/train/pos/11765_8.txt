This film surprised me, it was good with one liner and laughs, + a nonstop-packed story about tons of weapons and explosions. There were surprisingly many good turns in this film. The plot is strong, no matter what others think, it keeps me interested all the time until the end. In conclusion; this is a great way to spend your leisure time.
