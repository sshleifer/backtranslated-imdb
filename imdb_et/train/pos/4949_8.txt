10 POINTS OR LESS one is one of those radar images steeped in the simplicity most of the independent films have: honest, ad hoc presentations by its two leaders - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, who create a rather extra than unlikely duo. The big thing is that all this film seems unlikely despite the roots of its "road view". How Morgan Freeman's unnamed psychologically (not physically) arrives, where he meets this jaded check-out girl who has an unhealthy relationship with his current tutor (who also starts with his philanthropic spouse who plays Bobby Cannava in a small role) has somehow left us with a testimony more than conclusions and their witty fraud - two people on the opposite side of society coin - are deceptively simple. So, briefly, while there is no bang! The moments of bursting revelations, this film is a peculiar little mood that probably disappeared in the indies that came out in 2006, but it is worth seeing, just for that honesty.
