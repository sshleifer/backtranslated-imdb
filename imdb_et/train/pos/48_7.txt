I'm from Belgium and that's why writing my English is pretty poor, sorry for that ... <br /> <br /> It's one of those little-known movies that only plays once on TV and looks like thin air. I was browsing my old VHS video library and found its title, I looked it up and its IMDb score was over 7/10, it's pretty decent. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that this is a very well-assembled film and that's why I'm confused. This is the only film made by this director ...? How did he not do that good enough for a movie ...? Someone with so many options should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really want to see that he pulls his action together and makes another good movie like this is. .....?
