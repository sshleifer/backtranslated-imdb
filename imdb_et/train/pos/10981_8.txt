Hey now, yours really, TheatreX, found it when you cut through the market for letters, almost in a new situation, and reading in the back of the box that it was somewhat "a cult hit", so of course it came home to me. <br /> <br /> What is a strange film. The former lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis's aunt and cousin live in this decaying 28-seater house in Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eye!) And who knows what else. Suffolk Co. there was a place in them all where dirty and old Jackie himself came to set things right. Anyway, this is one strange couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (daughter) always carries something over her head and dances, sings and gives little to a camera that rarely makes sense. Big Edie (mother, 79 years old) apparently likes to ride naked and even though we get some tips on what might seem lucky, it was tastefully (?) Made at the point where we are savvy about it. These women speak and speak, mostly in the past, and do not make much sense except to them. They live in absolute unclean, cats do their business everywhere ("Look, this cat goes in the bathroom behind my portrait!") And one bedroom seems to be at their center. When I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice, he reminds me very much of his later aunt, who was in the region of that country and who had this Lawn Guyland accent. In one scene, a little Edie, who puts fleas out of control, cute, you can see all the cats that scratch all the time so the place must be infected. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and I have to say that in this case it is just euphemism "spoken out of their gourbs", but this film is not without the moment you really know them. It is the equal parts of horrible, sad and disgusting, but I couldn't start watching. It's not my "ordinary" type of flick, but I found it to be somewhat exciting. It's not guaranteed for everyone, guaranteed.
