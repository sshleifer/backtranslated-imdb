I had low expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something indisputable for the evening. I went out of the theater very cheerfully and somewhat surprised. This is a very subtle baseball honor film and a nice lesson about continuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role and was touched by his performance. Be sure to pay a fare and a few hours of your time!
