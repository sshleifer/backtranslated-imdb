I enjoyed this movie. Unlike pumped steroids, the steroid trash, which is activated as a film, is a simple and realistic game of God, with credible characters, non-uplifting activities, and sufficient turns to keep you interesting until the end. <br /> <br /> A well-managed, well-functioning and good story.
