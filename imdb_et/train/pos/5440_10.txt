British soldiers trio, British army, sergeant and scares his way across Imperial India. Tightly loyal to each other, they meet their greatest and most deadly challenge when they come across a culture of stupidity and the revival of its demented, unbeatable guru. Now they have to rely on the GUNGA DIN, the lowest servant of the regiment, to save the queen of soldiers from a mass murder. <br /> <br /> It is based more on the Musketeers than on the Kipling classic poem. Wonderful Adventure Shot - A Worthy Entry to the Hollywood Golden Year of 1939 Filled with space and humor while keeping romantic gaps to a minimum, it captures the viewer's interest and keeps it up to the (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> It is practically fruitless to discuss three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. performance nuances because they are really all third in one organism - inseparable and for all purposes & goals, indistinguishable. But it does not diminish anything very fun, just by looking at them in glorious time. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note that McLaglen had a proud special world war military career; Fairbanks would have a World War II record - mostly in secret matters and after serving a conflict no less than 4 honorary knights, while Grant worked for British Intelligence " for secretly watching the Hollywood Nazi fans.) <br /> <br /> The true actors here should go to Sam Jaffe, who is in the title. He puts the humble person in a brilliant dignity and immense courage, making Kipling's last poetry real. She's unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague's love is decent as a regiment, while Eduardo Ciannelli is badly incarnated as a Thuggee guru. The rest, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective, but they have little to do. Movie mavens recognizes Cecil Kellaway's role as Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The film chooses its own villain. The demonic cult of Thuggee, the stupid, blood-moistened Kali, the goddess of price destruction, the worshipers of India for two centuries, ritually strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840, the British soldier eventually managed to suppress religion in cooperation with many princes. In the future it will be a matter of novels and nightmares.
