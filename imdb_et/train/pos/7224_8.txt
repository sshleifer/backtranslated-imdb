When DEATHTRAP was first released, the poster, reproduced on this DVD, offered graphics similar to the Rubik's Cube. This is a good picture: originally written on stage by Ira Levin, who has written such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and STEPFORD WIVES, it was one of Broadway's most famous twists and under Sidney Lumet's direction he understood the screen very well <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is One of those films that is very difficult to discuss because it gives away as much detail the plot of land for which it is famous. But the assumption that is being opened is extremely wise: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a famous mysterious author of games, but today he seems to have touched. After a particularly brutal opening night, the old student Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him the script he has written. It's called "Deathtrap" and Sidney admits it as a definite result. Just a blow that would revive his career ... indeed, hit by death. And when Clifford's visits to the game are discussed, the events suddenly turn up suddenly. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shaffer's equally complicated SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home than a screen - to get the full power it needs to be live. Still, under the guidance of director Sidney Lumet, it shows more than respectful on the screen. Much of this is due to pain, which is remarkably good. Michael Caine delivers truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and loving when Sidney's inadvertently anxious woman and Christopher Reeve give the best result to her disadvantage during a short acting career. If you don't see it in first-class theater production, it's more than one until it arrives. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
