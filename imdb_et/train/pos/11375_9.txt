This film speaks of amazing history and compassion. You can be entranced by careful descriptions of the scenes of the criminals against the mental health of the leading scientist. This is an absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol's relations and cooperation between agencies are also great. It's not too done too. I also recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history. How the police work with the party, what it was ... It's really exciting and frustrating. Settings are beautiful. It has been a while since I saw this movie for the first time. It does not reduce its impact. Not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough imagination, well, you see.
