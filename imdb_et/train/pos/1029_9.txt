I would have appreciated the series for the perfect 10 great and consistently high-quality story and character if it wasn't the last episode of the 10th season! <br /> <br /> The last episode of the 10th season "Unfinished", where (certainly it seems) Asgard has been killed very quickly, convincingly and in a very vague way, left me incredible! <br /> <br /> From the extreme end of the series, it is obvious that many animal archives were originally designed for at least one season. I think they quickly accelerated these stories to put the Stargate SG-1 franchise on the move to two upcoming live DVDs! <br /> <br /> If Asgard does not come in the upcoming SG-1 movie (with a very clear explanation of "obvious" extinction), I think fans are disappointed with loose end cleaning. <br /> <br /> Poor end for otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.
