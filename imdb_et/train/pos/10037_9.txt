The ship may be sunk, but the movie was not !!! Director James Cameron "From the Terminator" did this again with an amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is "The Dinner table" scene where Rose's family and friends meet Jack after his rescue. Rose has a face that every woman should have when you meet "ONE" ... I hope I have this look when I'm in the room with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose are the connection that is “MOVIE STUFF”, but it's a good movie. We have a greedy mother and all her elites are close to her associates living in the wealth of their spouses. Rose almost suicides, but Gilbert Grape star rescues him. I really liked hanging the boat scene. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The movie is long but it's fantastic !!! Good story, good stream, good actors !!! Look at it twice if you want it, it's worth it!
