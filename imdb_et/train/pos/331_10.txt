This 370-minute film came from Italian public television in the early 1970s. It tells you the myth that has been assigned to Homer at Odysseus's home after Troy's war. This is an epic story of the ancient civilizations of Minoan and Mycenae, which is 500 years after these events on the list of about 1100 BC. It was found that the sound is just mono and there is no language other than Italian, even the tight title is in Italian. Damage. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if they had English subtitles. But if this is not a problem for you, I suggest you watch this movie.
