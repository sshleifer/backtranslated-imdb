Old saying "If you think you have problems, visit the hospital." It's been updated in recent years "If you think you have a problem, check out the TV show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of those that is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave her seven-that's fine, but not big. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes, just like a daily chat show is advertised as "an hour of your life that you never get back!" All the familiar topics are ... unfaithful husband / boyfriend, the most sharp audience on television, women blinking with Jerry, etc. The shocker looked at Molly Hagan, who usually plays sweet signs ("Seinfeld" and "Herman Head") playing trailer-trash mother and Jaime Pressly ("My name is Earl") for her equal trashy daughter, performing sexual favors for almost every man with whom they came together. Men (including the personnel producer) were presented as the main lunkheads who deserved what they got. I don't want to spoil or open everything, but the movie plays like every day. Here in Phoenix, it is shown every morning two hours ago and after that it seems that everything else looks like. Again, I give this movie seven ... it's good, but not big. Jerry Springer is best taken in small one-hour doses.
