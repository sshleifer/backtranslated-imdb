I didn't set very high expectations for this movie, which was pleasantly surprised to me. The story is sometimes a bit strange, but in general I think it has acceptable credibility. Active scenes are pretty nice and the accompanying music is used to induce common patriotic feelings of US films. It may not be the best movie ever, but it is rare for Sweden and I hope we will see more in the future.
