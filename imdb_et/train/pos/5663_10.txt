14 years after this show and it's still the best show ever made. Writing was 1st class and production second. This example is never done today and it is a shame. I hope you think about finding this exhibition so you can see it. <br /> <br /> AG came out when I left high school while my fav TV was an x-file that gives you an idea of ​​why I got it for the first time. AG was a much better program for better writing, but got just one reason? I know it's not the only program to get just one season. Another example that comes to mind is a single gunman (x files spin off) that had good writing and that was funny, but also got just one season. It doesn't seem right! We must also remember that this exhibition was before the dark show in darkness that it was "cool", so I think it can also show you going down the hill. <br /> <br /> See this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
