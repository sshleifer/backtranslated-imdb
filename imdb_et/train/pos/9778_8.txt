It is a trio of stories, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali", an experimental community (or some of those things) called the Taylor-Eriksson Group, who took people inside and among them. unknown and stayed here and a little bit of damage, I'd say. Many years later, some of this damage is still waiting and waiting for the right moment to show you. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact she was broken and the suspect was a man who might not exist. It seems that this woman can imagine some inner demon, or a man who was killed when she tries to talk to this woman as a reporter. Devi tells a story about a young man who wants to "jump out of the skin". She is a skinhead, a speedbuster and sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of that art, resulting in a good doctor who helps young people to realize their desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali talks about a healer who is trying to "heal" the woman who was part of that community and loses some kind of demon that has lived in this woman, but wonders if she did it or if she got it down because she couldn't live it anymore stay. All these three stories are quite creepy and tense, because you are never sure what to expect, and the premise and settings are so different from the usual horror movies he adds to strangeness. It is a kind of low-budget look and feel, but at the same time it delivers a more creepy atmosphere for your entire credit. I looked at it by hanging my mouth to open up a good part of the time and when the real fears (and gore) came, it was quite difficult. I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing movie and I liked it a lot. Good little find, this one, I'd give it from 8 to 10.
