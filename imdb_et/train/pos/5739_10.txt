Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this example of a woman's love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick (Nicky) a lightly mentally handicapped man who puts his 12-minute younger, twin brother Liotta, playing through the Eugene Medical School. It is located in Baltimore and deals with brothers' rivalry, twin unbreakable bond, child abuse and goodness that always wins over evil. It's exciting and full of laughter and tears. If you haven't seen this movie yet, please let it rent, I promise you will wonder how such a wonderful movie will not notice.
