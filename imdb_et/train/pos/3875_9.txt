This film was made by one of Canada's most absurd humorists, Yves P. Pelletier. For the second time, I was shocked that he did a ROMANTIC comedy, but knowing that he was serious, appeared in every local festival and local cinema, I had a positive feel for this film. <br /> <br /> Hell, I was right. From the right side, the scenario (written by Pelletier itself) is a little twisted and tricky, but Pelletier's fashion is one-on-one 90-minute jack-in-the-box. <br /> <br /> Loosely inspired and mostly redesigned tips for Laclos's dangerous contacts "Les Aimants" consists of a twisted game that writes notes on the refrigerator. Throughout the film, you get the chance to find out who is who and who writes who is at the goddess of the goddess ... that jumps in interesting love. <br /> <br /> Great story, great photography, big quotes from other movies. Should we ask more about the first movie?
