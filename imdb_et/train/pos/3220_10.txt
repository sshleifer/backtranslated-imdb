The soldier may not have academic or Lucas special effects, but it certainly does for me. I'm not telling you what it is, I'm sure you've already read the summary. It is a great destruction for the film of future-action / scientific literature. Kurt Russell doesn't say much, he usually has a face that looks like a terrible or drone, but it fits the character. There are great action and fighting scenes; some scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood believes that we should flee our normal lives. I haven't seen a soldier 2, but it's one of my favorites. I am fortunate to have a woman who digs dude films; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes a tough guy / sci-fi movie.
