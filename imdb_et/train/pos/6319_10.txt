Taking the opportunity to watch some movies in the Slavic Village-Broadway area, I couldn't wait to see its final copy. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie in Cleveland Premier last Friday, I'm not laughing for a long time in comedy! It's a great hit. Russo Brothers did a good job. Whole cast performs his best comic act ... Not as a slow or dry segment ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actresses and he's great because this flick is a dirty safe interrupter. I was most discovered by William H. Macy as "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto", which they keep you "sewn". I believe they have more fun roles in the film.
