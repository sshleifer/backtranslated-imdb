My comment would be added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I couldn't find it. I was really surprised that this film was released in the US in February 1955. I saw it in a "first-rate" theater in Washington, March 1958. \ t Wonder whether it was a reissued or a problem? In my opinion, this film is very light entertainment but has some classic signs. John McIntyre is a former judge / entrepreneur / thief in corruption. Walter Brennan basically plays the same role he did in Red River years ago. And, in my opinion, James Stewart is giving a fine as never before. I've seen this movie 1.5 times or more and never wanted to see it again. Photography and landscapes are excellent and offer significant entertainment for one hour and thirty-six minutes.
