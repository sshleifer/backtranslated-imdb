Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (though it won't be published years later), it's worth it. The role of De Niro is not great, but amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent the marriage of other friends only when he is forced to force him again. Any deadly fan of De Niro will get an early result that is the best actor today.
