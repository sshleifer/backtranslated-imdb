Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters her life, she tells her that she has been chosen and has to find the Golden Child. Skeptical and lustful and intrigued, Jarrell is involved, not knowing that he is going to start a fantastic journey that involves danger and worst, demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Did the golden child be the popularity of Eddie Murphy and Golden Child, which was exclusive until the late 1980s? Because I remember lively how much this movie made for a decade of entertainment, it was $ 79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest employee in 1986, but since the memory has disappeared in the 80s, Eddie Murphy has taken pictures. the comedy praise they really had. The Golden Child is no longer accepted with 80's Murphy images such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but when I watch the movie recently, I personally find that it contains Murphy with his unfortunate, screaming and charming best! > <br /> The growing fantasy formula that was reused and spent by the Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, the golden child hits all the necessary buttons in the genre. Pretty girl, bold reluctant hero in her armament, tempting villain {Charles Dance so English I can kiss her, wonderful color and lovely boy with mystical powers, the film asks you to just have fun, not break and cut your value as a picture of cranial fantasy. Yes, the CGI demon now looks blunt and the genre has much better images in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but if you agree with the shameful 5 of this site, you can just take that genre seriously, serious. 7/10
