The original film Odd Couple has some great comics. The whole world seems to know the neurotic pure frieze Felix Hungary and the story of Oscar Madison, funny, unpleasant. This composition of inappropriate roommates created one of the most successful TV channels all the time, as well as countless, not near imitations. <br /> <br /> The odd pair of movies has some wonderful jokes about the Oscar apartment and his sloppy habits. He says, "Who wants food?" One of the friends of his poker players asks, "What do you have?" Oscar says, "I have brown sandwiches and green sandwiches." "What is brown?" It's either very new cheese or very old meat! "I also love this line about the Oscar Refrigerator:" It has been a failure in two weeks, I saw milk that wasn't even in the bottle! "that Walter Matthau Oscar Madison is a joy to watch the screen, he's almost as good as Jack Klugman's version of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is Jack Lemmon's Felix Ungar. The problem is that he makes Felix SO depressing and retreating to become irritating as comic, Tony Randall's show in the series, brought Felix's character such humor, warmth and sensitivity to Tony's Felix Unger apparently to be somewhat annoying, but in the TV series it was related to specific situations where confusion was needed in the event environment, Jack's Felix Ungar , it looks like the movie is never happy, fun or interplaying. ‚ÄùFelix Ungar is a roommate who keeps you up all the time. <br /> <br /> The film still has great moments that endure testing time," "The flesh fight is one of the biggest scenes ever!

It looks rather frustrating than comic. br /> <br /> Maybe there was not enough time to see the brighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable. The start of 20 minutes is very boring. The same problem exists with Felix's conversation with Pidgeon's sisters. The end of the movie is predictable and too much. Others have very little care or compassion for everyone. The result is that the darker side of the film brings a lot of depression and anger, not comedy if you don't look at the great scenes mentioned above. It seems that Jack Lemmon's Felix monotonous person brings the film down, not increasing or capturing comedy between characters. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it took the 1970s TV series to make the odd couple the best. watch out. The original film is still very good. However, the TV series is much better.
