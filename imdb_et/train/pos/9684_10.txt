This film brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to look at the hearts of the spectators, drawing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through Paulie's spirit and heart. From time to time, we discover with the help of sensitive and talented leaders like John that even small beings like Paulie are the heart. I just couldn't stop my tears, even though the film has a happy ending. It's nice, after thousands of movies I've seen through my life, "Paulie" touched me deeply. This is after the "Ugly Duckling" - another picture that really turned me upside down.
