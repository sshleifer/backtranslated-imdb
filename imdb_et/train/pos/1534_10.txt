I love this example because it is full of adventure, love and intrigue. Well sometimes I love it! It is so good to see a show where all the characters work well and treat each other with respect. It is also very good for Dick Van Dyke in television as I have only seen him in Mary Poppins. The main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve, are very busy with the audience. This is a show you have to watch!
