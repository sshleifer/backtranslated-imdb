I'm on the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I don't think it was supposed to be a straight line "Jerk". I mean, it's not called "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too," which makes me believe that although many of the character names are the same, it revolves around another person. /> <br /> Think about it: practically no relation to the previous movie, except for the name of the characters; a completely different story; different cast; and the fact that it is a partial musical. <br /> <br /> I say I give credit to this movie. There's a lot to laugh about ... Mark Blankfield is his prime minister.
