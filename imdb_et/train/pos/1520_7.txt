The four stories written by Robert Bloch from different people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them. The first is Denholm Elliott, a writer who sees the killer he writes to life. Some spooky moments and twisting at the end were good. The second one is like a shrinkage of a dead woman, obsessed with Peter Cushing. The third is Christopher Lee, who has a child (Chloe Franks) and he is afraid of him. It all leads to a pretty scary ending (though the story ended much worse). The latter is out and comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (chewing the landscape) as well as the kitchen that makes people vampires! There is also a lovely line for Christopher Lee who plays Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good horror anthology - nothing is terrible, but the first and third graduation gave me some pleasant little chills. Also the fourth is really funny and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! The house also looks beautiful ... and very horrible. It is well targeted by touching some nice atmosphere. Very good and unusual movie result. All in all, it is worth looking for a good little horror anthology. Try this on DVD - Lions Gate is fantastic, strong colors and great sound.
