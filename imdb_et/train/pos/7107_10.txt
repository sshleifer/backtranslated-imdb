You can call it a mystery, maybe a small thriller or an intelligent movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes you through a person's life who has lost his life and wants to be restored. <Br>> <br /> I have to say that I was quite surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. Usually this is not the genre I care about, but the characters quickly became people for me and wanted to know what they were and what happened to them. <br /> <br /> Like many French movies in English, we can learn more about the nature and impact of our surroundings on our person. This movie is character driven and doesn't disappoint!
