One of my favorite movies I saw in Seattle. Tom Hulce was amazing because the words could convey his feelings / thoughts. I sent some donations to Mike Ferrell to help distribute the film. This is good. The system says I need more lines, but I don't want to give up the plot. I was at the audience in Seattle with Hulce and the director, the writer, and Mike Ferrell. They talked about an hour after that. Not very dry in the house. Why Hollywood is still a stupid thing I don't know. (Actually, I know it's our fault, see what we look at) Well, you get what you pay for the payments. Get it and watch it for someone special. It's a pearl.
