More than just a "children's movie", "holes" look at how past incidents affect us, whether we know them or not. When a teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp, where he is forced to dig all day, he discovers a number of things about his camp and his personal relationship with it. Through returns, we learn that several things are closer than we understand (when you see a movie, you understand it better). LeBoeuf does a good job, as do other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Nelson Tim Blake, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. Very interesting movie.
