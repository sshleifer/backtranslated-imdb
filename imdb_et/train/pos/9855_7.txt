It's my first CG animated movie I've ever seen. Usually the appearance of other animated films made me modest to see them. Not an ice age. I wanted to see it in a moment when I saw a fun carving squirrel with Scrat as a caravan. <br /> <br /> Ice Age was a casual and funny fun movie. The story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby that has been 20,000 years ago. The visuals were great. Just beautiful. One thing is creating a convincing anina, this is another thing to create visually arresting things, and it is good to see your stylized visuals. Blue Sky Studios is a company that will look out for the future.
