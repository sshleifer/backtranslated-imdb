I loved this movie. This is a solid inspiring film. It will take you proudly. This movie is worth renting or worth it. It should be at home. The best movie I've seen for a long time. It makes you crazy because everything is so meaningful to Carl Brashear, but it will eventually improve. It's a story of romance, drama, action, and lots of funny lines that keep you tuned. I love lots of quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on the job. It shows that everyone can achieve their dreams, everything they need to do is work for it. It's a long movie, but every time I watch it, I don't notice it is as long as it is. I'm putting it in so quickly. I love this movie. I look at it whenever I can.
