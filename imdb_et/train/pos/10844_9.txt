It reminded me of Spinal Tapi more seriously. This is a story of a band that makes a reunion, but things are not harmonious between them. I was particularly impressed that Bill Nighy as Ray. You felt sorry for him, but he had some fear of him. This is a great movie to watch if you've ever seen your favorite band wrinkle, old and pathetic.
