Yes it is. In fact, it's somewhere in its top 20 favorite movies. Number 15 guess. Anyway, I'm not usually one for plots, but I think the plots work better in anime and RPG video games (like Final Fantasy 7) and not in movies. But that's all. Living drawings planets, stars, very well written scenario. Although it is not really for children, they can still look at it, it does not contain graphical blood, intestines and silicone. But I don't think they understand it.
