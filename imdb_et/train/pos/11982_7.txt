This is the way I feel about the show. <br /> I hate MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS! <br /> <br /> Stealing old TV shows. They even stole "The Partirdge Family". Then I mentioned the episode "The Partridge Family". MTV Martha Quinn is the most remarkable, especially when he played in 1 episode. jokes by them. <br /> <br /> Story lines that came and went into 1 episode. Joey got a TV show with Frankie & Annette. Suddenly Danny played the guitar. 1 episode he guides in football, 1 episode, he instructs softball / baseball. 1 game and are you out of Danny? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only TV show. <br /> <br /> I liked D.J. & Stephanie characters. Wish Jodie Sweet could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure and had pure NON drug for adult life.
