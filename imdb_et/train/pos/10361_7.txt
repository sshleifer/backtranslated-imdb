If you choose your jaw from the floor, knowing that they ... somehow ... managed to put this thing so quickly that it appeared in the year when the incident ended, you find that it's not half bad. The plot is tempting and interesting, and this pace is fast, so it involves many situations and often jumps quickly to the next line or two. If it really looks, action is. The performances are great. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It is also cool to hear as many Australians talking about a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not come naturally, at least try to accent. Movie art and editing are pretty nice, but they don't really go beyond the usual. The story of this film is convincing and the fact that it is authentic makes it even colder. Although I have not read a novel or heard about what happened outside this picture, I understand that it is close to the truth. It has some moderate to strong language and disturbing content. This is sometimes a great courtroom drama. I recommend it to the fan of any such man. 7/10
