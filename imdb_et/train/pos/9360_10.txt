Let me start at the age of 34 to suddenly widow. I was devastated because he wasn't sick - he died unexpectedly from the coronary - his carotenes blew - he died behind our house. The police had a lot of speculation because he fell off and collided with his head. I was suspected of murder until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My kids were as traumatized as me, so in love with a good father. I had three small children, no education, financial support. I took it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> In two years, my laws attacked me orally, physically, emotionally, and mentally, so I didn't go before the children and put on the masks and show the people what they wanted to see, not show them off during my vacation. .. No one stood for me and my choice to sit on one vacation, except, of course, the sad therapist I saw, which had recommended me to follow my heart and soul. My laws didn't get it! That made FOREVER my relationship with them and I've never been on vacation. This is just one example of how my grief was paralyzed! My (new) husband has seen me falling apart, talking about trauma when I share my soul. I collapse, can't breathe, hyperventilate, and in general I have been a few days past when I even try to transmit hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul was shattered by my heart. My fears and pain were repeated from the real demons that this movie offers; how one worships compared to how others wait for us and demons. Adam Sandler portrayed the terrifying embarrassment you face, win and most importantly, work yourself! This film deepened all the pain that I have tried over the years. If you see how your soul is so deeply damaged that it deepens that all that comes out of your mouth in your minds, you cannot handle it without wanting to be dead and dead through life. The Bible is a scripture, Romans 8:26 that I have kept, that if my mouth and soul know not what to pray, that the Holy Spirit of God bears this embarrassment on the feet of God. - I don't have to talk. Sandler imagined it perfectly! <br /> <br /> There is a scene where he has put himself in court for the purpose of devoting mental health, and he goes back to his in-law --- (familiar to me) --- and he tells them the stunning truths, that he has been about not being overcome. It is a powerful and powerful force. I started to scare and I had a hard time after the wards came up to walk out of the theater and felt my legs were too weak for that. My son was with me and saw it for the first time, my exact movements, trying to save it all; a lesson for him, my youngest, barely remembering his father. For me it has been 13 years, but this movie brought me back to the point when I lost my laws forever, when they insisted on my emotional mask and abandoned their desires instead of respecting my own. I am writing this so that if you're grieve, you're ready for this movie, but we recommend it in the 1000-star Sandler. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet crowded, please take a lesson from your movie and just listen and accept people's choices with their grief, allowing them to find the peace of their time! Sometimes the words of the soul cannot pass on our pain. <br /> <br /> Go look at this movie's tissue and not without it ... your soul!
