I really think people are taking the wrong approach in this regard. First of all, I find this short film to be very fun and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think intercourse and mystery are a call to the spectator. Another thing I was trying to do in my fantasy was to get along with the viewer, although there is no clear story, just clues and pauses, and the emotions that such characters give you the impression that everyone has a story to go on. No one else could have done better than Lynch. This is the very essence of lynxism. Of course, I agree with everyone that people who look at it with a desire for entertainment without the real imagination of the viewer find themselves frustrated. And good. Lynch is not talking about that. At least this is not the Lynch side. That's what helped the lost road / dr. There is a tendency here to deviate completely, and people who are just waiting to be entertained as they look at something just don't get what it is. My opinion is that Darkened Room is the core of your animals, your instinctive self, giving you the tools (picture, sound, situation) you instinctively respond to. This is not a joy, it is to get the reaction you want. And this, my friend, is pure art.
