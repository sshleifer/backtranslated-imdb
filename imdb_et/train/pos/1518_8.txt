HOUSE COLORED COLOR is the third of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If MONSTER CLUB is part of a series, it would be eight films. Although this movie is very different from others. <br /> <br /> I look at Amicus anthologies with great memories when I loved them when I was in their teens. My feelings for them are just as strong today. <br /> <br /> I spent years watching this movie. The synopses of nature were so tempting that I paid a considerable sum for it, when I finally found a copy. Like the film, I was finally disappointed. It wasn't quite as good as I believed. Although it is better than its two predecessors, it is almost as good as its four successors as I show. house. His journey begins with a local police station where he learns the stories of previous riders. Later, the story goes to visit a real estate agent selling a house. Although it seems tempting on paper, it is practically flat and lifeless, which is the weakest of any Amicus anthology. I couldn't feel that John Bennett was a poor man's version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I'd rather have seen one of the two above mentioned actors in their role. We could have been both here - one as a police inspector and another as a real estate agent. They could, and I believe, made the life of the weak element of this movie much better. <br /> <br /> There are four stories in the movie, each focusing on the house owner. <br /> <br /> The first story is Denholm Elliotti's writer of criminals. He is absorbed into an exciting story of a stranger, even when he draws a scheme to help him write. Soon he will see the vision of his creation. Peter Duffell's some great direction, especially the choice of camera corners, helps to limit the prisoner's script. Elliott's performance is excellent as a tortured writer and she also helps to raise the story. The story ends with a semicircle, but I couldn't get a sense of a script that didn't allow it to fulfill its potential. <br /> <br /> Another story sees Peter Cushing's movement in the house. He is a lonely man who still beautifies a beautiful young woman who once accepted her and who is taking pictures of her. Cushing's presentation really brings about this emotionally moving story. He is a director who is determined to focus on Cushing's loneliness. This is taken forward with a great hallucination environment that helps us see Cushing's mind. Anyway, Cushing sees vision in a nearby wax museum that looks like her girlfriend. Of course, his obsession grows, but this seemingly romantic story ends in the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival, but his momentum is overshadowed by late Peter Cushing. his daughter. Mr. Lee gives his perfect ice-cold performance here. She doesn't show her daughter's love or attention at all. He even brings the headmaster to educate him. The organizer, played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another great performance, is trying to find out what is wrong. Without giving too much, I can show that sorcery plays a role. The presence of Christopher Lee is truly electrifying in every scene where he is. Chloe Franks deserves special praise for his massively underrated performance as a little girl who is easily the most frightening of the film. The film is worth seeing even to see one story. <br /> <br /> The final story is almost completely laughing, but it is definitely fun and it is important. Jon Pertwee plays a horror actor who moves into the house. She is very pleased that her producers are approaching movies, seeing everything as cheap as fake, especially costumes. So he decides to buy his last authentic vampire-like concealment. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent sales representative who sells ancient cuisine to Pertwee. When Pertwee puts on clothing, he starts developing the fange and basically turns into a vampire. The Pertwee performance must be considered credible. It's really fun. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story, but his talent is wasted in a role that should have been much greater. <br /> <br /> The unifying story ends the final story of an endless relationship. This is especially suitable because the inspector was looking for Pertwee and decided to go to the house, of course. The rest you can develop yourself. As weak as the link story, it is decent if it is somewhat unintentionally comic. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the guilt for the real flaws that should have been a really great movie is not directed by Peter Duffell, who really does his best. I think the script was just too restrained and lacked the ambition that can be found in the four later films. Amicus anthologies, fans of other Amicus films or fans of portable horror movies. If my summary gives the film a conspicuous look, check it out. You enjoy it!
