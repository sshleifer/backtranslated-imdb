When the movie was seen again, this time it seemed to be better than in previous times. Action is amazingly amazing. The characters are clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is just great as a rebellious son. Other actors and actors are equally good in every sense. Robert Redford creates a great period of pieces from the 1920s. The landscape is incredibly beautiful in the mountains and streams of West Montana. All in all, this is one of the best films from the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie. <br /> <br />
