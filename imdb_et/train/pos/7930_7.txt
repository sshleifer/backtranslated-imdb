I'm honest. I got this movie to make fun of it. I mean, come, "Dead Life"? What other reaction would I have? The thing is, however, that the film (and its creators) decided not to do it. Instead, he tried his best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And what do you know? It was awfully close. Slightly less cheese in casual music, a bit more professional in photography, actor, casual (like props - love the Best Buy bag) ... well, it's not a classic zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty little movie. Action, writing and stimulation are all surprisingly better than I would have expected. There's even some decent humor because two of our leaders are discussing how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you do not forget a small budget (which leaves your fingerprints all, unfortunately) and almost constant contempt, it may be a fun time in movies. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the actors, the actors, the team, they all tried to make a good movie (instead of camp classics) and it reads a lot. Campy zombie movies line is a mile long and thank you guys for not adding it. <br /> <br /> The Kudos Quiroz Brothers. I'd like to see what they do next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
