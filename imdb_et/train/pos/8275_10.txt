Wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, with some great drama characters and some scary scenes. Action is good, characters act like a normal family. Wendigo's effects are good, Deer Form reminded me a little about Donnie Darko's rabbit. <br /> <br /> The film shows that the family will stay in the house for a while, but the deer hit by accident, a group of hunters come and one of the hunters named Otis will start to argue with his father, George, after the car is lifted to. Son Miles is a little frightening for deer, but his parents are trying to tell him that it is natural that such things happen. That night, when he is in bed, he starts to see strange things in the bedroom. The next day they go to town and Miles meets a man who gives him a little Wendigo shape when Miles shows Kim and tells him that the counter gave him the hand, says the owner that he only works there. When he returns home, George takes his son to slip, and although he slips down from there and Miles runs through the wind, they get short, looking for George. Hospital Kim tells Sheriff that Otis has shot him down, Shrieff goes to Otis, where he has a hammer over his head when Otis travels down the road he thinks Wendigo is after. > Wendigo is a pretty good thriller with some cool moments. Look at this. 10/10
