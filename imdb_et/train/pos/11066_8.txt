For a long time, it seemed that all the good Canadian actors were south-bound and (all thought) that all second-rank ranks filled top slots and dropped the drudges for sex comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a real surprise: in spite of the extreme plots that are typical of quarries, the actors seemed to be trying to make something of their own character and what we, the viewer, got back, was almost a real suspicion of beliefs. When the music video extras attacked the evicting police, you almost believed it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of some of the best sexes (Canada or not), you should definitely look for it. And a big surprise, this sex farce is also full of very good nudity.
