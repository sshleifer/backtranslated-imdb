This is really a well made film. Sumitra Bhave has always made a reasonable cinema and this is my favorite movie. This film should have won the National Award and would have been my choice to represent India on the Oscar. It's at least a thousand times better than Shaaws, which goes to Oscar this year in India. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that information about it (and all other Indian films)) IMDb is missing and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this film and is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the majority and the team are not mentioned at all. The prizes and candidates for this film will not be awarded even if Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There was no voice for "Doghi". <br /> <br /> Doghi is not a Hindi film. It's Marathi and luckily escapes from the song and dance series, not in the glittering glamor and half-hearted designers. It is a real life, a spiritual story that is made with a rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> Doghi, which can be interpreted as "two women," is the story of two sisters, Gauri and Kuri and story. In fact, this is a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not believe in many subcategories and makes it a very difficult film. The entire film is placed in an unspoken remote village in Maharashtra, and the screen is rarely far from the house of two female protagonists. There are no aesthetic sunsets in it. <br /> <br /> The film opens and introduces the whole house that is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Kishnana's father is a hard working farmer, the house is full and happy; their simple life has nothing to do. On the eve of the wedding, Gauri's husband will meet the death accident. Gauri's father is unable to carry tragic news and has a big stroke. Without a strong and working member, the house could have left, but Gauri's mother should be responsible. She works the way she can, but she can't come together. But his life is even easier than Gauri. The superstitions that people neglect to neglect, make Gaurist an evil gambler. He's out of society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes to her brother. She desperately agrees with her proposal. She takes Gauri to Mumbai where she works in brothels. Gauri sends home the money he earns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives his life to his family. <br /> <br /> But when Gauri returns to Knana's weddinga weddings, her mother won't meet her. She doesn't allow Krishna near her and doesn't allow Gaur in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but fears Kishnana's life. It crushes Gauri completely and he decides to return to his regrettable life. But Kishnanaa runs out and holds Gauri. She asks her beloved sister back. Kishnaesa promises she's standing. Promises that they stand in front of the world? together. <br /> <br /> There is no need for this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai, but what does he do? subtle dialogues tell us what needs to be known. It's just a bare story that is deep in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> Doghi is a responsible cinema. It is respectful of the object he is dealing with. Does it respect your audience? he doesn't think they would have a four year old spiritual ability. <br /> <br /> Operation is first-rate. Is the direction wonderful? silence passes the story without words. The script is well researched. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like "Doghi".
