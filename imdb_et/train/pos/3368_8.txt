Hitler's visit to Rome is the background to the offer of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays a housewife and a mother of six, who is at home when her whole family goes to military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay home because the family can't serve her. He would have wanted to go if he was an avid admirer of Il Duce with the entire residential complex he lives in. <br /> <br /> However, there is one exception. Over the yard, Marcello Mastroianni sits under his chair, who is considering suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and has recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really rises when these two people get into the random. Mastroian is a desperate and badly needed friend. Loren, who is frustrated by his cheating spouse, understands Mastroian's wrong and masterly shot, directed and behaved scene on the roof of the building, offering him only to reject his body. The initial chuck will soon be replaced by this man's hunger, this fascist, that homosexual, the other world who is so willing to give him everything he wants. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully made with two of the most talented actors in the movie. Loren proves here that he is a well-oriented caliber actor. It is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite its sad end, a glimpse of the hope that is changing, things are changing, someone has understood it.
