I just started watching the TV series "What I like about you" and I have to say it's a pleasure to watch. I always like to see that the new exhibitions are going well, given that many exhibitions go out before you really know them. I've been watching that Amanda Bynes is "all this" that she is a really funny girl that is the best for her comedy, that it is so natural and what I mean about it, it's something a man could be the best friend here to say here, not practiced. <br /> <br /> I recently started an exhibition and am in love. I'm looking at it right now, but I'm looking forward to the next season. All the characters in the show give a whole story. It's nice to see some old faces from other shows I enjoyed in the past like Jennie Garth from "90210", Leslie Grossman's "popular" and Wesley Jonathan "City Guys". The New Character is also very talented, Nick Zanol is the charm that makes you love him even when he does something wrong with holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Generally, this exhibition is the right ingredient to be successful, I look forward to seeing it.
