... I saw this cable in the late 1980s because I was a great wrestling fan since 1986. I saw it for sale in VHS and bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, as a wrestler, I started training after the Air Force and always look at it to see how this was a very accurate idea of ​​people involved in wrestling (families and friends who don't understand us, traveling , heartache, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to see, because no one else understands what the genius is creatively. A great way to separate yourself from the Fonzi character he played on happy days. And look, William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice) and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have a chance, look at it.
