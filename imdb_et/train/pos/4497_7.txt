I only saw the first part of this series when he debuted at the end of the 90s and recently got the chance to watch all three parts through Netflix (otherwise convenient service). All in all, I liked this lightweight, sometimes genre-challenged mini-series. The story of a younger man who falls to an older woman seems to be working and the actors are all right. Yes, he has some romantic clubs where you can jump into the rain or train station, but characters can be explored so it doesn't seem cheesy as if it were a Tom Hanks or similar vehicle. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of a divorced birthday, Scott Bakula, does a good job of someone who is in love with love and the desire and rejection of momentum and momentum, linking the series to a guarded price. Personally, I think the series could have been done with two episodes, but I think it's a discussion. Obviously there is a sequel and it should be coming tomorrow through Netflix.
