* May include spoiler * * May contain spoiler * <br /> <br /> At Shrek (film) & Pixar (studio) age this is a more traditional animation film. It put together some characters that would not normally be viewed (not to mention, try to save a human baby and bring him back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as the best friend. If it sounds like a Disney movie, it is (only through the 20th century fox). The movie trailer was one of the best I've ever seen, but the film doesn't live with the hope that the trailer is set. The problem is that the filmmakers did not make their mind, who is the target audience of the film. Yes, the movie has jokes that only adults understand, but the film is mostly directed at children. Parents enjoy it for 90 minutes. their children's attention is focused on something other than them. The backgrounds are great and the sound is good, but that's nothing more than a nice movie. Kids love this movie, adults like it.
