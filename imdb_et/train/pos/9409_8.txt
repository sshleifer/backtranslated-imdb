The chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty and does not wear, but is considered a threat to the survival of different industries. In this amazing comedy of Ealing Studios, Guinness is admirable as a lightweight but persistent chemist. Greenwood plays the interest of love with his sensual voice; Parker is his harassed father. Thesiger is fun as a fabric industry patriarch. Speaking of an inclusive story, the film also raises some interesting questions about science, economics and politics. It is headed by Mackendrick, who continues "The Ladykillers" and "Sweet Smell of Success" in the 1950s.
