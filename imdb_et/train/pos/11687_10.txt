My affection for Chris Rock varies according to his films, I hated him after a deadly weapon 4, but I hated all this movie after that. I love her when she is and doesn't hold back like Dogmas. Well, it's still his best, he doesn't expect it to be good. Chris Rock offers a sweet, wonderful story, backed by some of the funniest comedies I've seen for some time. I loved it.
