EOLLENER (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's locomotive will give Williams extraordinary low performance. <br /> <br /> What is it about celebrities and fans? What is close to paranoia, what the other binds and why is it almost normal? <br /> <br /> In the last derange-fan scenario based on real events, Williams stars are not a talk-time radio called Gabriel Someone who reads the stories he has given over and has gathered interesting fans of young people a boy named Pete Logand (Culkin), who has filed a manuscript in his troublesome young commands as an editor of Ashe (Morton), who gives it to anyone to read for himself. Nobody is disturbed, of course, but ultimately Pete's horrible existence for robbery and sexual abuse has been around for years, until she finally saved her sister named Donna (Collette, who gave excellent performance), who has accepted the boy, but her correspondence does not show anyone Pete dies of AIDS. Of course, nobody wants to meet fans, but suddenly expects doubts about their possible remote motives when seed is planted by his foreign lover Jess (Cannava), whose sudden departure from his New York apartment is an emotional acquaintance. it was only now that the tea cup grew strong when it decided to do some research on the background of Donna and Pete, discovering some of the truths he didn't see. <br /> <br /> Armistead Maupin (who wrote the manuscript with his former mistress Terry Anderson and the director of the film, Stettner), and based on a real story about the fan hoax, has some moments of Hitchcock running in full tilt like every good old-fashioned pot boiler . This will help Williams give a personality with an eye-catching and low-performance contradictory heart who really wants to believe that his number one fan is actually real and loves him (one thing that has escaped his reality) and he has some awesome moments with a horrible colleague, whose one physical trait is not mentioned, but emphasizes the despair of his character, which can rob you of the core. <br /> <br /> But the movie runs out and eventually gets a bit repetitive and predictable, despite the stuntly-controlled hood and mystery, it's worth listening to your inner voice: be careful about what you expect.
