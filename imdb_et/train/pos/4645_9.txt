This movie is very interesting. I have seen it twice and it seems that Glover has hit the nail with the head he claims he wants to achieve. For one, I may refer to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate generation, which is an attack in our media center, and the things we should not "think" of as a culture because of corporate media management. The fear that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements of films is as clear as visceral aggression and beautiful poetic strength. I'm glad to see this movie and it's even clearer that Glover is something interesting that is part of the trilogy. This is good! EVERYTHING IS FINE. Look at it. People who reject this movie as "thoughtless" or "pretentious" are really missing from the boat. This is an intelligent film. If you see it with your live show, it will appear before your books, which is also very angry. The way you get to your mind is really something. You have experience!
