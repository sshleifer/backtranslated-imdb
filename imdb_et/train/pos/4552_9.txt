Daniel Day Lewis on my left leg gives us one of the best performances that an actor has ever made. He is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man with cerebral palsy who then learned to write and paint his left leg. Well-earned Oscar for her and Brenda Fricker, who plays her loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is terrible because the younger Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are big. Look out for outstanding performances.
