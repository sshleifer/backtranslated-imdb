Will Smith is the best actor of all time. I don't know how he does it. I kept reading books, but if there is a movie with Will Smith, look at it. He has a rare gift that will draw you into a movie and keep you there. This movie is one of the best films I've ever seen. I watched it on Saturday and I still can't get out of my head. RECOMMENDATION and sad all at the same time. Thank you again to Willi. To understand every part of the movie, you have to watch this movie from the beginning to the end. You can't miss anything. Make sure you have a lot of Kleenex and your husband / wife who sit aside so you can go indirectly. WELL It is worth the money you pay to watch it. Don't wait until it reaches the TV.
