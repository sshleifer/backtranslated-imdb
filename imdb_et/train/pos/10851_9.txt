I found that "Still Crazy" is admirable and not only for those who lived in the Stone Age of the late 60s and early 70s. My 15-year-old daughter looks at it every time I pull out a DVD (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she loves it too. <br /> <br /> This is a truly loving, embarrassing and fun rhinitis era and every actor hits his notes perfectly. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am delighted that his somewhat similar "Love Actually" brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a drug-damaged rock-car stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson got his name as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and for the first time I saw the film I got into Billy Connolly. a local shopping center (she lived here) and told her it was one of my five favorite films all the time. He invited me to sit with the food and discuss the film for a while. We even talked about the idea of ​​an American-oriented remake before it was reasonably rejected. My only problem with "Still Crazy" is that it was not very popular in theaters and too many people have forgotten their experiences.
