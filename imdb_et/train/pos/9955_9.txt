You saw this movie twice in community screenings and really loved it. I work in the Jane Finch community and I feel that the film really attracted some of the community's nature and taste - taste, determination, majesty, creativity, your face and despair. Writing, dialogue and acting are certain, and I really found myself in the story of a young woman, Raya, when she struggles to achieve her goals and does not lose herself in the process. Large dance series and not just bodies that run smoothly and with electricity, but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence. All the characters are multidimensional - none of them are good or bad, and women's characters are excellent. It is a film that has a strong beating and marks the irreplaceable spirit of young people, hip-hop and communities like Jane Finch.
