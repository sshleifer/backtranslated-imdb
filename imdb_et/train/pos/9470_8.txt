I'm not a fan of Steve Carelli, but I like this movie from Dan, an advisory columnist who goes to his parents to stay with his children and end up in love with his brother's girlfriend. The story that has been talked about before, but it doesn't like it. There are too many small bits that make the movie better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup, he is quite good as a widow who thinks he knows everything, but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes surprises you with life. Occasionally, wisely and wisely, how annoying the Hallmark card is, the film is some more, how can you grow and be more than a mill film. Worth a look
