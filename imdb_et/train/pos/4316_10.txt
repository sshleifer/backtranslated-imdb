I have to say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most seen films. I've been watching it several times and I still feel the first time. that the film could in itself form the whole film in the direction of the postgraduate curriculum. <br /> <br /> A long time ago, the film elevators promised: "It makes you laugh, it makes you cry." This is a very fine and short way to describe what the Grand Canyon is doing. It will take you to the best places in human experience and the next moment will take you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie moves forward to move around between people who are lucky and the same people are awfully close. This is also always a short step. Just to direct this swing of grace and without seeing it as false or exaggerated, is the director's genius. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (type) that comes up. After the viewer gets used to the round of emotional spectrum back and forth, the film throws a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and back, but extends from ordinary marriage, through a random self-induced knife wound that may or may not require sutures, an earthquake with signs from the house. At the moment of his relief, the forgotten unforgettable argument, the earthquake surviving, the neighboring woman calls out that her elderly husband has collapsed. The couple rushes for help. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw it. I'm crying now. It's not sad for me to do that. This is not a particularly sad sequence. What tears me so that this few minutes of the movie was PERFECT. It's perfect! Amazing. There is so much to say about Grand Canyon. It depicts relatively common people who have epiphids, and this allows the viewer to experience them directly. They are neither beautiful nor overcrowded and are not a long pause to look carefully at the moment. The film is moving forward at a pace. Even if the characters try to understand what has happened, they are not sure what they will get from their experiences. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is a very human film.
