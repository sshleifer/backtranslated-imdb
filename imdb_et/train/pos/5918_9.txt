One of the most interesting films to be classified as "blaxploitation" is Bakshi's "Coonskin" rich text that is full of wonderful insights. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appear in the film. Racist images can often be distracting, but the film's message was so powerful that NAACP gave him confirmation (but only horribly). <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in exploring the racial atmosphere that Bakshi is trying to deconstruct. Wonderful things.
