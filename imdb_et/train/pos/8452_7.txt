Overloaded Mobile Suits That Can Destroy The Whole Army - Look! Weapons that barely need to be targeted and destroyed - check! Mobile Suits Based on Angels - Check! <br /> <br /> OK - the Gundam series. This, Gundam Wing, has good character development, real complexity, interesting ideas and pretty eye candy. it becomes stronger and more independent (though it is still with Heero Yuy, a series of key figures). The aforementioned Heero, which is originally a cold, hard butcher, is becoming more and more human, but still unique. And when you see the missing Millardo Peacecraft (who is Zechs Marquise), OZ, the freelance and the White Fang command, show how some people can lose their creations themselves. <br /> <br /> The political and military situation is also quite good, reflecting the functioning of the real world. With a 49-hour episode, however, it becomes a bit of a responsibility, because this complexity is not fully exploited. <br /> <br /> The series of ideas - the necessity of fighting, the desire for peace, etc. - are the ones that resonate even today. Looking back, this series was ahead of its time as a "war on terrorism" and everything. But exploring these ideas, monologues, especially Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible dramatic piece that forms part of a series of best writings. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, however, good writing is sometimes extremely bad, which drastically causes it to lose its part. <br /> <br /> In the eye-candy that is what it is in the spider booms, everything from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra te Idot! better explosions). But who cares ?! Stuff explodes and it's all important. <br /> <br /> But because of the short complexity, this means that if you miss some episodes, you are left behind. Poor writing can leave you up and sometimes animation will make you "WTF?!?" But it is built on its classic animation style, its scope, incredible dialogue sparks and the more mature research that such Japanese animations are waiting for.
