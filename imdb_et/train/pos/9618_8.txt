I recently bought this movie and I do not regret it at all because I am very happy to add this movie to my collection. Cinematographers Matt Manfred and Phil Hay took less than one month to film and spent about â‚¬ 1 million on this great movie. This proves that not only big productions make great movies. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie is perfect. In a computer language, a BUG program is an error that causes reactions to a computer function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects as well as beautiful moments. The vertical events of this film begin with the death of BUG. Man knows "crime" on the other side of the journey ... From there, everything becomes complicated ... <br /> <br /> I draw attention to John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece, a man who doesn't get anything at all do.
