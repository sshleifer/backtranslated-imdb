Audiard made a very interesting movie here. It begins with a description of a deaf young woman who is secretary in her job; she is ignored, disappointed, rejected ... hiring an intern as an assistant seems to be one way to find her life, but the man is just out of prison. Both of them, rejected by society, are gradually joining them. Character description is great, goes into details ... both will help each other; because he can read on his lips, which shows him a very useful ... He gradually develops far from what he was at first. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed; The whole is very convincing, even if it turns into a movie at the end. The beauty of Audiard is especially noticeable. Emmanuelle Devos should be called the Best Actress Cesar Awards. The action towards the end of the film is simply hampered by the "fashion de moeurs". It's actually surprisingly fun: 8/10.
