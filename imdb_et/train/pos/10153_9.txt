I hit this during the movie testing. It was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story. Well done. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The man was awsome. Very funny movie. Located in the best locations in New York. I wanted to go there. I just saw that "You have a post" I thought "it was for you" was a much better story. Fresher. <br /> <br /> It was clean and great for the whole family. Audience I saw it with love, a definite suggestion!
