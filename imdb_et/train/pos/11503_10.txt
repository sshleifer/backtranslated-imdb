Kolchak is just entertainment. Big stories and big cast and nothing else. Darren McGavin gives an energetic presentation that draws the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage, and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin strong support that most leading players can only dream of. Some great guest stars add colors and vividness to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in Terror Terror, Phil Silvers Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas The Zombie. It's easy to see how childhood spent watching Kolchak drove Chris Carter to create X files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
