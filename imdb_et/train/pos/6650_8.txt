I wouldn't like to comment on how good the film was or what was wrong, because I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough film making knowledge. I know that making such a movie on your first picture is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director on it. But at some of the readings I read, the critics have complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted and his siblings were completely removed from the story. Now, I would really like to point out that the name of the film is not a film about the brothers of Hiralali, a film about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing more. If we begin to complain that some characters are not in the movie, it would be a little unfair, because these characters are not suitable for the picture, no matter how important they were in real life. So I think it would be better for us to stick to the main idea and stop our own critic. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
