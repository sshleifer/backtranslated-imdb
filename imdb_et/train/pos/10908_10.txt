I couldn't prevent tears when I watched this beautiful documentary. It was heartbreaking, distracting and inspiring all in one. I recommend this documentary to someone who is looking for something that makes them think about what they do with their lives. Or simply, something that makes you think. You look at how John lives his life in the last few months. You look when he passes his days with a positive attitude. At one point you will see that he is a truly amazing person. You will realize that he has something to teach us all. His life and struggles make you cry, laugh, and find that life is much easier to live by taking it one day at a time.
