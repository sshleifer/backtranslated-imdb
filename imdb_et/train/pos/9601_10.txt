Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about Duchenne's muscular dystrophy teenager (Weems) and his 11 friends who take him on a cross-country trip to see if "Pimp My Ride" pulls out his wheelchair. I recently watched this movie at a sun protection festival. It played twice during the festival. This movie is an amazing story about the spirit of man and the spirit of our friends. I don't often say that about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel moved to do something. Every film that this film has participated in has received this prize. It is at Tribeca Film Festival and goes to Greece and London to London. I wouldn't be surprised when this film went to Academy Awards. It's under the snowball control. If anyone has the chance to see this movie wherever he plays, go! Get as many people as possible and go! It goes to New Orleans Film Festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach FL. Darius comes from Georgia, so I expect the Atlanta exhibition tickets to be sold out quickly if they are not yet. Please watch this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
