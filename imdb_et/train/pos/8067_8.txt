Today, if someone mentions Victor McLaglen, the answer is probably "Who?" or "Why?" Believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Best Actor Academic Award for the poor, desperate person who is ready to sell his best friend "carfare" to the United States. This is an interesting movie that shows how low even the most meaningful shnooks are going for just a few bucks. The film takes place in the British-dominated Ireland, and although all the other characters are fighting, directly or indirectly, for Irish political independence, all of McLaglen's characters are concerned about getting money and drunk. In the film, the idea arises whether political activism is all worth the effort, because although the activist has a reason, many others do not just care, they do not even know what the noise is. The moral of this movie is: look at a friend, he can sell for your dime.
