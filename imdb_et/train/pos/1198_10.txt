Like most other reviewers, I've first seen this movie (on television, never on a big screen) when I was a teenager. My father has always kept this movie high and suggested it to me then and I have to say that he was not just right, but this movie has been with me for more than 2 decades, because I saw it for the first time. Since then, I've seen it two or three more times (just a few days ago I gave another clock) and it hasn't lost anything over time. It's still a great and worthy movie! Manr considers Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY to be the first and best later western part to have a realistic look at life in the old west, but hardly known as LAST HUNT is definitely a better film and was even half a dozen years earlier. In fact it was probably 3 decades before his time or maybe it is still ... <br /> <br /> Although I was thinking hard and definitely seeing the western 100s (I like this genre) I can't remember any western wet and depressive. Two men tied up, partly with hate, partly because they had no other choice, surrounded by the beautiful Padget, the old men of the evil, and the young Inian, leading the life of the buffalo killer until one fate reaches one side. <br /> <br /> Someone who has never seen this movie can forget the end of it and the latest frames in this gem. When the camera moves away from Mr. Taylor and from there, the (tree) appears a white buffalo skin, and again the losses from the past when all the hatred began. Mr Taylor has his own buffalo, but finally got a bull. <br /> <br /> In addition to the high scores, intelligent script and great dialogue of all participants, it is worth mentioning that THE LAST HUNT is a great photography, I have rarely seen Western shooting well (aside) led by Anthony Mann, perfectly captured. photos) that all places are cleverly selected and that even the soundtrack fits well with the picture. <br /> <br /> And BROOKS is a great storyteller. Crafted Mastery! He has made quite a lot of really great movies and has been successful in almost any imaginary genre, but even during such a fruitful career as it is, the LAST HUN looks one of the best, if not his best. br /> <br /> Definitely worthy of a higher rating compared to 7-something RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.
