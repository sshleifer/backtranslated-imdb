The continuation of Charles McDougall involves managing episodes of "Sex and City", "Desperate Housewives", "Queer as a People", "Great Love", "Office", and so on. Meg Wolitzer's innovative SURRENDER, DOROTHY is a success. And to a great extent, he manages to keep this potentially enjoyable story of the sudden death of a loved one and how people react in their lives. <br /> <br /> Sara (Alexa Davalos) beautiful single young woman is accompanied by her best friends - gay playwright Adam (Tom Everett Scott), Adam's current squeeze Shawn (Chris Pine) and married couple Maddy (Lauren German) and Peter ( Josh Hopkins) with his little boy - a house in Hamptons for a summer break. The group seems cheerful until the arrival of Adam and Sara's local ice-cream causes a car accident killing Sara. Meanwhile, Sara's mother, Natalie Swedlow (Diane Keaton), who has an active social life, but is calling her daughter on a regular basis with Surrender, Dorothy, to play elsewhere: if she receives a phone call that Sara is dead, she will be coming to Hamptons, where her exuberant personality and grief create friction between her friends. Slowly but surely Natalie reveals the secrets of everyone, succeeding in speaking about Saras, as if she were bringing her life. Natalie's truth is thirsty at all costs, and the group's big changes and only through the love of Sara they will eventually get together. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton is the best in these roles. To walk the warp between drama and comedy and his presence keeps the story together. The scenario has moments of good lines, but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit difficult and nervous, making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they've given. Yes, this story has been repeatedly mentioned - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy disclosures - but the movie moves with a casting pace and has enough real entertainment to watch it.
