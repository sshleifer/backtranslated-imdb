Modern, original and romantic story. <br /> <br /> Very good performance for both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a nice job of imitating the Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as a shy, boring secretary. For men (and some women): Kidman's absence is fantastic and very likable. I forgot what she was a proud woman. It is not difficult to imagine that John loves him. Some unexpected turns of the story are good for skipping. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the film was a surprise to me. Conclusion: a good film. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: Empty Points.
