I loved this movie and I am one of those older people who shouldn't enjoy it or feel like that. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? Such films are never. But the message is strange. That we all have the potential to be whatever we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I've always thought he was somewhat similar to Katharine Hepburn. So, it's nice to see that both Hepburn and Posey made films for librarians (Hepburn on The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 8. It is by no means a big movie that has cinematographic standards, although there are some nice shots in it. But it is incredibly charming and fun.
