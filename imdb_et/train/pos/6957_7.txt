My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a fun movie no longer any less. <br /> <br /> The story is quiet easy. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) subway and connects him. At the beginning of his relationship, everything seems OK, but Matt thinks he is G-Girl. First of all, it seems Matt is really cool, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and poor. So he decides to leave with him and his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). It makes G-Girl very crazy and she's against a former boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The film is most liked by the scenes where G-Girl gives himself to Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris' second role, her character for the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> I give this movie out of 10 out of 10 and recommend it to someone who likes nice comedy.
