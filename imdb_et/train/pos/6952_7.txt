In New York, where the sheltered and lonely project manager at design office Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) on the subway, he still invites him to dinner with him. Jenny loves her right now, they have sex and she expresses her true identity by saying she is a powerful superhero G-Girl. After meeting her coworker and friend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), the poor Jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and Matt follows her best friend, Vaughn Sick (Rainn Wilson), and digs her, breaking her heart. Jenny makes Matt's life hell while he has romance with Hannah. However, Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), a former G-Girl and Jenny high school jeweler, offers Matt to attract Jen to remove his superpowers. <br /> <br /> "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" is pleasantly silly and funny. This romantic comedy-adventure has many fun moments and is great fun. Luke Wilson has a great idiot role, Anna Farris is very sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is a big, nervous neurotic superhero, reminiscent of Glenn Close's "Fatal Attraction" or Evelyn Draper in "Play Misty For Me". My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Minha Super Ex-Namorada" ("My Super Ex-Girlfriend")
