I enjoyed the innocence of this movie and how the characters had to deal with a powerful animal in their midst. Gorilla looks terrible and her eyes were particularly viable. Sometimes it is even a little scary and children should be scared a bit without moving over. Rene Russo plays a wonderfully feminine role. Usually, this type of Hollywood film, which takes place in the past, is known to create a shoulder-man, but the only opponent is gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are to people, how they feel the same emotions we do, and how we really can't treat them like people because they're not. Not many movies come into this area and you should see if you want to consider the similarity between humans and animals.
