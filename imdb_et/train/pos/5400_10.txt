This film is a brilliant lesson from Japanese history at the end of Tokugawa Shogunate just before Shogunate lost a great battle against loyalists who wanted the emperor back to the throne to rule Japan. Really, I had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) gives an excellent performance as Izo Okada, one of four Hitokiris (= Human Slayer). He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. To achieve a good life, he becomes Takech's Hanpei keeper (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke Doom sword). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who allows his Hitokiri band to murder many high-level Western politicians to achieve their political goals. Izo Okada follows her leader without actually asking what they are doing. As long as he has the money to go and drink and spend his whore. Okada's killings are becoming more and more brutal in the film, and he is proud to have a fear-based reputation everywhere. <br /> <br /> This is a great portrait of a simple samurai who gets into political situations and is really naive to understand what is going on. First of all, after deception and torture, and always negotiating with Sakamoto (who has rejected the samurai), he changes his ideas and views on life. But it's too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff are giving great performance. Every actor gets to his role. Sword is fighting very unique and fast ... probably faster than many movies nowadays ... <br /> <br /> Check if you have a chance !!!
