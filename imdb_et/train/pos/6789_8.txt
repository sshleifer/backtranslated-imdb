The Legend of Dragoon is one of the little known games that people love or hate. Some people say it is too similar to other games, namely the Final Fantasy series, which is understandable as it was originally designed for Sony to be equivalent to Final Fantasy. Frankly, I can't comment on similarities because I don't know FF games very well. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite game is the battle system. Not only do you have the ability to become a more powerful dragoon, but every time you attack, you have to pay attention to press the buttons at the right time to complete the attack. Not only that, sometimes enemies attack you in the middle of the sequence, which means that you must press different buttons to avoid damage. Even using certain attacks requires a bit of a button press. If you do not want to attack, you can always watch out, which not only reduces the half-done injuries, but also raises your impact points without using healing drinking milk. <br /> <br /> FMVs are pretty well prepared, about the same quality as Final Fantasy 8. But the graphics played during the game aren't quite in line with this standard. They are nice, but they could - and frankly - be better. Translation also leaves something to be desired. This not only creates interesting characteristic relationships, but also has some grammatical errors that should not have been allowed to pass. one dies and the other becomes basically useless for the party and the pages. Although the death of one character has often said that it does not make sense, it understands at an early stage that characters, heroes, are still as mortal as the next person. People who replace the lost characters simply get their statistics so the transition game is reasonable. Maybe my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love, Shana. She is a helpless woman who needs salvation, pathetic to play players screaming. Although you can use her at her party, she is very weak - I don't even know what her dragoon powers are, because I didn't want her so much that I've never used her. The Rose symbol, on the other hand, is probably my favorite female in any game. He's not a wimp, and some of his dragoon magic are very useful. Meru is also quite strong, though sometimes it is a tedious speaker. <br /> <br /> Characters designers were like most of them tend to make female characters beautiful or whatever, and didn't give much thought to the actual utility of equipment. Seriously, no armor and most of your leather are useful in fighting monsters. But I give them props because they have women in different countries as knights. <br /> <br /> I can't comment much on the plot because I didn't pay much attention to it where I had to go. I'm not sure if it says something about the plot itself or my game style. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very enjoyable game. It has its drawbacks, but for me it was just the right balance between thinking and just pressing buttons and killing monsters.
