In this magnificent twentieth-century Fox movie, the metropolis has a labyrinth of despair, where living and predators live alive. Cropping urban images of the lower humanity in a dark expressionist symbol. <br /> <br /> The prostitute has its own purse of metal. It contains a microfilm and the length of the communist spy ring extends to its restoration. Two parallel inquiries will open up to the destruction of valuable information by both spies and police. <br /> <br /> Anti-hero Pocket Leather Skip McCoy plays with Richard Widmark's scary fortress. He knows his moral equality and intellectual inferiors to the police, so he complains to them: "Go ahead," he tells Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "drum reward. Throw me in." . Just like Candy's prostitute for bribery, so that the police can be steered, the police are aware of paying stool pigeons. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that when the Widmark movie was made, it was early in life. The 39-year-old star at Fox ends up with Skip McCoy with a teenage surprise. Nowadays, it may not be acceptable that a romantic draw captures the interest of his love unconscious, restoring his shoulders by dragging his face, but during the period that it meant was toughness - and Candy is a fallen woman. br /> <br /> Jean Peters is bright like Candy. Here, right in the midst of his five-year-old B-film fame burst, he is beautiful and tempting as a whore with a golden heart. He is a victim of a story, a martyr on his beauty as much as anything else. He means well, but cynical men are constantly manipulating - Joey, Skip and the police. <br /> <br /> The real star of this movie is New York. The hunting of city panoramas and sliding subway stations provides the city with claustrophobic links as a living and malicious force. Like rotten cheese carrots, human beings descend through the city side roads. Lifts, subways, sidewalks - even a silly waiter works for the flow of corrupt humanity. People who hold a niche that gives safety: Fashion is its grimy rented room, jump on its relaxed cage on the Hudson River. As characters move and interact, they are framed by bridge architecture or beam lattice or shared hanging winch. The personality of the city constantly establishes itself. The corners and cross-sections of the tree in the cell are the echo of the curve of the curve, and the square map index cabinets simulate the Manhattan silhouette. When Joey's way out of the subway is blocked, it is as if the town's steel surfaces had plunged. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this movie will be made in the near future. The character controls the plot as it should, and close-ups are used to enhance the character. When Skip interviews Candy, a close-up captures the sexual energy between them, raising Skip's hostility. The beauty of Jean Peters is painted in light, with a fine soft focus. The device is also used to increase voltages. The sequence of opening, the purse, does not include a dialogue: drama relies entirely on its powerful influence on the near future. <br /> <br /> Snoopers and snoopers carrying snoopers fill the movie. Fashion (Thelma Ritter) lives as an informant, and even his victims are accepted in the hierarchy of his place. When Skip says, "He must eat", he sings a repetitive abstinence. Just like "direct" New York members sheep or lumber, Underworld trades by commodity. <br /> <br /> And even in stool pigeons are better than Joey and his Communist friends. Joey's Feet In the fashion bed symbolize the most basic moral code violation. Joey is in the dark. Fashion does not trade with Joey, even to preserve his life: "... even in our fine business you have to draw a line somewhere." <br /> <br /> Pick-up was made during the Cold War. Richard Nixon was newly elected Republican Vice-President, having named Alger Hiss - a fake communist microfilm and everything. McCarthy's show trials were a daily reality. We see "the cheaters who gave the Stalin A bomb" to the police in the film. <br /> <br /> New York can be considered a gigantic container with human translations, beatings and murders. Containers make up the whole movie found. Moe carries its trademark box ties and candy wallet, microfilm, is a plot engine. Skip keeps his only property in an underwater box, symbolizing his secret street wisdom. The coffins on the knees under the knee at the hood are the containers of only one cargo that are shifted around a ruthless metropolis. <br /> <br /> Film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy is shown between the overflow of a mortal dirty move that marks his moral rise. When a weapon is placed on a table, the extreme perspective makes it bigger than Candy - violence has begun to regret. Lovers are the shadow of a hidden stevedore hook, reminding us that their love is not pure or absolute, but depends on the whims of an unhappy city. Communist Enyard is a shadow on the wall or a cigarette abandoned puff. He's like a single alley cat in the rubbish - night-time phantom. Camera shots through taxi barriers, newspaper kiosks and hospital beds are constantly increasing our awareness that we are all trapped in a metropolis. We are the cult of civilization.
