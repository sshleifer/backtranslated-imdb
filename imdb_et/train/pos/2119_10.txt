"Shop around the corner" is one of the biggest films by director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it is full of astonishing actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are the type character actors that Hollywood unfortunately no longer uses. In fact, the film itself is a movie that Hollywood no longer does. ("You've got a letter" makers say their movie is a remake, but it's just something that is inflated to self-praise.) Anyway, if you have a affection for romantic comedies of the 1940s, you'll find "Shop around the corner" nothing wonderful. Same good with a recurring view. Enjoy!
