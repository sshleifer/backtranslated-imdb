I'm proud to say I had a copy of the 70's Crown International Driving Comedy Cheese on a DVD. It's a really funny and pleasantly unreasonable flick with a beautiful breezy'n'easy 70. It tries to make a sincere point of true love and friendship that is more important in life than cool wheels and a quick piece. Of course, this is the essence of a manly fantasy of blatant youngsters - the main vision of service Bobby Hamilton gets girls, respect for his friends and the opportunity to show local van-racing bullying - but it's too hasty and happy to hate. Stuart Getz, our main protagonist, makes himself a terrifying dork, Deborah White as the main goal of Getz's affection is for sure beauty, Connie Lisa Marie is also quite lush than the amazing blonde babe and the despicable meat box Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (60's biker movie multiannual) is wonderfully angry than the brutal Dugan Hicks. Particularly sure, Danny DeVito is the absolute rebellion of the boss Andy, the owner of Getz's goblet car wash, who is a lovingly passionate ne'er-well-well-slob who carries very ugly hard Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a heavy gambling habit. I especially love this scene where two criminals brutally beat Danny - one keeps his hand behind, while another man works over Danny torso! And Sammy John's cunning memorable diamond song beats your skull for at least a week. In short, it's a great groovy retro-70 fun!
