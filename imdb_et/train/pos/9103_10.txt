For the first time in life, we organize stones (Piedras in Spanish), such as career, family, friendship and love. In this way, we find space between smaller stones, our small needs. If you act in the opposite direction, you do not have enough space for larger stones. The five main characters of this film are women who have been unable to organize large "rocks" in their lives. Spanish filmmaker Ramon Salazar defines his first feature Stones this way. The film discusses the parallel, contrasting trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-) and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena , 1954 -) Everybody has tried to remove the stones that are in their way or, at worst, in their shoes. They are five Cinderella who are looking for princess and a new chance in life. The best of these five Cinderella's is Anita (Monica Cervera), which also stands for "20 centimeters", "Busco", "Crimen Ferpecto", "Entre Vivir y Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia".
