If people didn't know who Barbra Streisand was before, ... (is it POSSIBLE?) ... they knew who she was! <br /> <br /> This exhibition won 5 Emmys, It seems like one of the best things Streisand has ever done. <br /> <br /> It consists of three laws .... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra sings standards from room to room, full of musicians, including a segment where she is a little girl, all ending up with an excellent version of your signature song (at the time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical excursion from Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings poverty songs ... is better than it sounds ... <br /> <br /> ACT III .... Best part, Just Barbra, musicians, & some great songs like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", and "Funny Girl" are talking about .... <br /> <br /> all that is a big part of television history, one of the world's greatest performers!
