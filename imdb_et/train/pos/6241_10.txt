At first I had a lot of people after seeing it: that sunny people like fatty people were cheap shots. OK, so he makes the diane arbus together. . . what ever. . . but it was not long before I realized that it was not done in a dehumanizing way, as the images opened. I felt that the problem was totally audience: we have Hollywood and almost everywhere movies that really feel that watching people over a certain age behave in a sexual way is something vague, something that shouldn't be shown. if it were all the film offered, it would be a lot. At the same time, the story of a notorious boyfriend and his drunken girlfriend is really like tons of bricks: very telling storytelling, incredible performances and thinking that the scene was improvised. This blonde man is a genius actress. Finally, I want to resist those who say that this movie is all that pathetic about all these people. An old man who is with a woman who finally dances for her is a completely OK character that breaks its form, so don't simplify the movie by watching her. Yes, his dog is being killed. it is not a rosy image of the world, but it is not. . . completely desperate. anyway I was very grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful movie. I wouldn't say that every thread would be as strong as the strongest, but I say that this movie starts with an ass and would recommend it very much. . .
