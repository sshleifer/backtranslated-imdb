This is undoubtedly John Thaw's best performance, where he successfully deletes his inspector Morse character traits and brings Tom's perfect adaptation book from pages to TV. It is a well-made product that keeps a look at your family, despite some very mature topics like the outbreak of World War II and the physical abuse of the child. <br /> <br /> This is the relationship between Tom and young Willie, the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see the bond between a young boy who was evacuated from London and an evil old man to whom he has developed - a true grandfather / grandchild association. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this story was not done with a bigger budget when it comes to a larger screen than a Sunday afternoon every ten years. When giving the right instruction, John Thawit is celebrated worldwide and was awarded many awards for his excellent performance in this film. A great actor and a big role that should have been honored more than that time.
