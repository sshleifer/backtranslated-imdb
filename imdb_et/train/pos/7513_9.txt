"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Director: Mary Harron <br /> Starring Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn Rating: "R" (nudity, sexual content, and some language) <br /> <br /> It seems that every celebrity is biological today. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, Biopsies are now very large. The Notorious Bettie Page is the last one to be released on DVD. It's Gretchen Mol as the world's most famous pin-up model, Bettie Page, and mostly filmed in black and white with certain colors. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Neverland", this movie is not designed for the Oscars this year. This film lacks emotional resonances that appear in other biopsies, and most dramatic moments in Bettie Page life are completely ignored or only suggested. This does not mean, however, that it is a bad film. In fact, The Notorious Bettie Page is a thoroughly entertaining and perfect movie - a strong cinema. This film focuses more on Page exciting careers and sexuality and pornography. It's filmed passionately and carefully, and the direction of Mary Harron pulls the look and feel of that time because most filmmakers dream only. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Do you know him as an icon or a simple porn star? She is a woman who had a very profound influence on American culture when she discovered more skin than was considered appropriate at that time. Most people know him as one of America's first symbols - a legend of many models, especially Playboy and other adult-oriented magazine models. He lived while he showed that there are a thousand flesh below, that the waste could be arrested, and that the borrowed photographs of the page were exactly what pushed the American public. In fact, the photos launched a full Senate study on the difference between dignity and harmless films and pornos. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is absolutely amazing with Gretchen Mol. His performance Bettie Page is just brilliant. I understand that when his role was announced, many people were skeptical. His name is not what pops up in my mind when I think of big shows. Now, that's it. He completely fulfilled his role and led me to the vulnerable and still deeply interested. David Strathairn has just returned from last year's "Good Night and Good Luck" where he gave one in 2005. Here he gives another fine result, although he is a little underrated. I was shocked at the very limited time of his screen, but quality is always the most important aspect of a movie in terms of quantity. The only performance I saw from Lili Taylor was "The Haunting" (1999). While most people ignored the movie, I found it to be enjoyable, if not completely low, horror film, and I've always thought that Taylor was completely believable as an emotionally disturbed Nell. Here Taylor gives another reliable result. He gives a very modest result and gives a perfect result to congratulate Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, I realized that "Notorious Bettie Page" cannot be compared to other biopsies. as "Neverland" and "Walk the Line". It is incomparable to them because it tells the story of a woman and her career from start to finish. His personal life is brief, but it really is his influence on a world that is getting high. We look at the movie knowing that the Page ends with everything and we know the impact of its decisions? But we have rarely shown what impact they have on their personal lives. She is a woman who has never looked back and constantly invented her. After all, he was an adult model that became a Christian missionary. This movie doesn't make anything more dramatic. It could have included fictitious moments of the page that hysterically frightened and asked God to forgive. It could have been showing the page running and screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of its past and still not. "Notorious Bettie Page" says a simple story and it is rare for today's standards. Fortunately, it is refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: "Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing film with absolutely amazing cinematography. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9/10 (A)
