Some movies you just know that you will love the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracking its roots in the 40's "Double Indemnity" and "Postman always rides twice" - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90s. Nick Cage plays a "successful" main character who gets into the plot of his wife's murder - and his happiness gets worse than worse when he tries and tries to risk people, the city, violence and Red Rock West. Lots of turns, great performances by Cage, Hopper, and Walsh, the hypnotic musical background of the slide guitar and smooth running make this a real pleasure. Favorite line: When Cage looks at the empty gas meter in the car, shakes her head and says, "F *** the story of my life."
