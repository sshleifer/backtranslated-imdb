It was a great movie, but it was the worst end I think I've ever seen !!! The actors were great and gave great talent. The whole story was twisted and unexpected, which made it fun. As good as the movie was, the whole movie was judged by the end that was terrible! Perhaps the sequel could leave this bad end.
