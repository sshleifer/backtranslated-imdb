I've seen a movie a few days ago on a videotape, and although it was hard to swallow one by one (because of its length and story), I really liked it. First of all, I was impressed with the script and then realizing this script. The film takes you on a ride, but it's not a simple, cheerful ride; it takes time and different political regimes and shows their impact on the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the inner logic of the film; logic, which, like logic in life, was sometimes rather illogical and confusing, but finally, when I thought about it, all events and revolutions were affected. There is no point in trying to tell the story again as it spreads over 50 years. I also liked Nikita Mikhalkov's character Alexei and how she played it, as some critics saw, with an uneasy surrender. I didn't like the fact that I think he later played Aleksei-like characters in movies like "cruel romance" (Zhestokij romans, which I really love) and to some extent "offended and injured" ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" shows that I think that great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski was before he went to Hollywood and made forgotten films like "Tango and Cash" and less forgotten as "Runaway Train". I prefer them "Kurochka Ryaba" ...
