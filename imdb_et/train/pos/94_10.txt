I'm a big John Denver fan. I have a big music collection on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on television and loved it. I have an original vinyl album and a CD. I have the original CD and later release. Later, however, several songs are released. I see it released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - Think that Christmas Cd would be so worth it. It is not worth selling this value to me. This is my favorite Christmas CD. I've never been able to find it on a VHS or DVD. I would like me to have a version. If anyone is available, please let me know. Thank you
