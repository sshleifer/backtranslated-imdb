I saw it in movie theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it then and I recently had a version of VHS. My 4 and 6 year olds love this movie and ask it over and over again. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed it again. Although I have to admit that it is not a little television so good. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter sings them over and over again. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
