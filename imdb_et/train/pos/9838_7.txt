Born Again is a season 1 episode. I think the bit of reincarnation is cool. The more I look at it, the more I like it, but it never rises very good for me. Although not very memorable, I always remember it as an episode of reincarnation. Anyway, now I'm saying good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> Good: Oragami. Oh yes! <br /> <br /> This fish tank was nice. =] <br /> <br /> Dropped out of the window. Very stylish. x] <br /> <br /> Bad: Marry your best friend's husband! O_O <br /> <br /> What is a random selection to restart. <br /> <br /> Why didn't a man who died with his scarf get out of his scarf? <Br / Summary: Okay episode, not particularly memorable. 7/10
