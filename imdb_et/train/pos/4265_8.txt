If you haven't seen this hidden little wizard, you should look for it. This is the story of a ghost, Sad Sack of war (Fred MacMurray), listed 4-F each time he tries to join any army of armies. She finds a magical lamp that naturally contains a gene (Gene Sheldon), but the genie is even more strange than MacMurray, she sends over time to serve at all the wrong times and places she wants. It's cute, cheerful and clean, and you can't help it. The plots are similar to the Disney movie, especially since both stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) did both Disney movies in the 50s and 60s, though not together. Needless to say, it all ends up well for everyone and the viewer is feeling pretty good.
