This is one of the most spiritual films I've ever seen. I led about 150 people to St. George and we saw this movie in St. George Temple Visitor Center. There were also some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and touched on exciting music and the story of the pioneers and the hardships they created. /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to better understand Joseph and the difficulties the pioneers went through. After all, it's next to American history.
