Functional - fantastic. Story - amazing. Script - wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it is slow and mostly speaks, but all of their life and how it is spelled out and out of the way gives you the opportunity to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story. I myself read the book on which the film is based, and it has shown me even more of this story and answers some questions that remained unanswered in the film. I also have to read the song of Exectioner, the other side of Gilmore's story. This film made me think so much about the phrase "looking for the other side of the glass". You hear a movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, a punk band that wrote a song about Gary Gilmore's eyes (one of the things Gary gave when he died of transplantation) and when you listen to it, which is the last time If Mikal ever sees Gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were just the song yourself. This movie opened my eyes in many ways. I recommend this movie (and the book) very much.
