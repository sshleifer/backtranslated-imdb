Cinderella was one of the first films I ever saw, and for me it is timeless. This is a cute-looking movie with great animation. My favorite animation scene was dress-scene - I just love those mice. The songs are also lovely, not as good as Snow White, but they are happy to sing and remind Tchaikovsky. A dream is a desire and so is love? is standouts. Characters are also a pleasure. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice offered great comics. At the same time, the sisters, as well as Lucifer. But I loved the best of stepmother, she was really evil compared to the grandmother who was the fairy tale. This is true, the film pulls the mice antics slightly, but they were really funny so I don't care. I don't think it's overestimated, underestimated. It rarely plays on television, but it is a bad success for Cinemagic regularly. if you want a great Cinderella adaptation, try the wonderful Ever After or the pride of Slipper and Rose, which is not so good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel I have a mistake because you thank me. 9/10 Bethany Cox
