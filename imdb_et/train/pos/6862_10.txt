When people ask me why I like the movies so much, I usually answer, "Have you seen the art gallery sequence De Palma dressed to kill? This scene alone represents everything I want to see in the movie. "What I would like to do." "Clean cinema" is one way to describe this sequence, and it's really amazing to see how the entire film by director De Palma works with the same high artistic frequency. I think the film raises an important point, which is always a hot debate: can the film rely solely on technology and still be considered an artistic success? The film has no message to speak, action is great, but it is in the service of style and script logically short, De Palma's film is a very good case that style, if properly handled, can fail Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon perform superbly, but this is the end of the film. This is the sensational demonstration of film media opportunities. I'm not telling you what a movie Hitchcock respects (I don't want to spoil any surprises), but I think De Palma goes beyond the story, and succeeds in creating a movie that fits all his career. Not heart weak!
