Anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with British music trends in the late 1970s should definitely look at Breaking Glass at least once. The film about the young woman's aspirations to record her music in the world is captured perfectly, from sexism, harsh economic times, social upheavals, pop culture displacement, and tumble punk to frightening feign and pretentious futurism / new romanticism. The musical and fashion styles that have been created in Britain every day in the late 1970s are rediscovered and reused (nothing new since 1980). It was a dazzling time, and Breaking Glass both tell a very personal story and look at the cultural landscape and do both very well.
