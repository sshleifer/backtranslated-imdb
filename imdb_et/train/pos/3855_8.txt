The Vlissingen Literature Club invites you to lecture on homosexual, alcoholic, and often-dying morbid Catholic writer Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé). At the railway station in Amsterdam, he seems to be a controversial attraction for a beautiful man who goes to another train. Gerard is introduced to the club's treasurer and cosmetician Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk), a wealthy widow who owns the Sphinx beauty salon and has one night. The next morning, Gerard Christine's boyfriend, Herman (Thom Hoffman), sees him as the man he saw at the railway station. He suggests that he bring Herman to his house to spend a couple of days together, but with a secret intent to find a man. Christine travels to Cologne to bring her boyfriend and Gerard is alone in his house. He drinks whiskey and sniffs him safely, finding the rolls of three films with the names of men; He decides to look at the shots and discover that Christine had married three men and they all died in tragic accidents. Later Gerard believes that Christine is a witch and the question is whether Herman or her is her fourth wife. <br /> <br /> The vague "The Vierde Man" is Paul Verhoeven's second great feature in his Dutch phase. The story is based on an excellent scenario that uses Catholic symbols to create tensions related to smart dialogues; Jeroen Krabbé's spectacular performance in the role of an alcoholic writer; and amazing cinematography. A consistent solution is open to interpretation, as in many European films that explore common sense and intelligence among viewers. There are mediocre directors who use men's foreskin to advertise their films; but Paul Verhoeven uses Gerard Reve's nudity as part of a plot and never an aggressive or sensational search. Last but not least; sexy Renée Soutendijk's androgenic beauty fits perfectly with her wife's role as a attractor to a gay writer. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O 4o Homem" ("Fourth Man")
