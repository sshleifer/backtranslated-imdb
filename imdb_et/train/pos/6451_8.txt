First, I enjoyed this movie and its message, which is the courage to live life completely. Very poetic, cordial and funny and sad scene, very lively, was a pleasure to watch. But here are my "exceptions": the film was too long and at some point more and more extra conflicts, so it started to lose its main story. However, I do not agree with the second comment that it is unrealistic to have so many "strange" problems in such a small village. I think it was absolutely realistic! There are incredible dramas everywhere, we just don't know about people we meet only superficially. I didn't want an end that was so symbolic and extremely forced. It left a bad taste because it was just too much. I didn't like the fact that so many big questions were mentioned in the group (when some blamed others for all the big things, people would just be "embarrassed" to talk about everything so personal, even if they are a group that works closely together). And: Protecting yourself is human beings, which are the strongest instincts. Why would Daniel let himself be beaten and never returned, not even defend himself? I mean, he wasn't weak, he could at least try to defend himself, but he just made me crazy that he wasn't doing anything. Just as the storyteller was trying hard to bring a message like "violence is not necessary", but the way he did it was not good. I am also against violence, but the character loses everything despite the attacks. And: Gabriella ... why on earth would a woman who had spent years with her husband, that her husband be arrested and says, "I don't want you any harm. Like all of us. Oh really, it broke so much! It would be normal for him to be bitter, but not so "holy", and therefore not human, whether his work with Daniel and music was so great that he forgot all the s ** t he had happened to him. nevertheless, I think it is an amazing movie that is quite amazing, considering my inconvenience with so many things. Look out !! ;-) "
