At first you think the other Disney movie, it may be good, but it's a children's film. But if you look at it, you can't help but enjoy it. All movies love this movie. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 years old and now 8 years later I love it! Danny Glover is great and could not play this part better. Christopher Lloyd is fun and suitable for this part. Tony Danza is as credible as Mel Clark. You can't help but enjoy this movie! I'm giving it to the 10/10!
