This movie is absolutely fantastic! If you look at it with your friends, it may be a very nice day ... You probably need to know that the movie is stupid and very bad, directed and behaved (Tomba / Unziker, by a couple), and this is probably the worst movie in the world, but you you can enjoy it very much. We looked at it in 19 years and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first when criminals kill Alex's friend and try to act desperately and the result is a first-class comic scene ... And when he shows Leva (Antevleva, what's) "Palassio di giusstissia" and then Leva's accident, which once happened the car leaves the road, and the second one, the car is completely empty! What a magic!
