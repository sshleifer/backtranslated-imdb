If you were born around the time that this movie was ready, and I had a liberal / open-minded household that I had, then I am sure that in the early 80s your parents will be introduced for the first time to watching filthy films or extreme dirt in movies. You do not know 100% pornographic, but rather real drama and pornography, or you should capture your collection and in a movie in a rectangular image called VHS. You had to be very quiet and ninja-like, but they still had little heart failure when the tablet-based buttons were discovered that big pop noise was detected. In any case, such films were sent to the back, waiting and waiting for reunification with such visual "art". Needless to say, this film fits the above-mentioned description "T". Many people comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but perhaps because of the fact that I am desensitized, I am rather disturbed by nuances. Did the creator talk to us more deeply about the human musculature and / or what could be considered a true abomination, interracial relationship, bed frame masturbation, voyeurism, or can it be a despair of social status for murder, pedophilia / homosexuality, or repressed sexuality of 18th century French social elite women? Who can say, but in spite of Mr. Borowcyzk's taste of living raw sexuality, which is the "norm" of his works, I would say that this film really speaks to the viewer about better charity. When I have learned it, this story became much more interesting after the meaninglessness of the shock value and is therefore worth it.
