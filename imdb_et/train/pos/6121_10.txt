How does anyone like this kind of movie ??? This movie is so good that in the first week when I saw it on the shelf in a video store, it was stolen .... BEST Horror Movie Ever !!! .... I mean he took Carrot and he ... well you know HAHAHA. The only movie that is close to that touch is Chucky's bride and it was just great!
