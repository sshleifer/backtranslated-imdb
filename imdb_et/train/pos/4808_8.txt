YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegant costume and reproduced a bit of history, with some fine adjustments, a definite direction by Jean-Marc Vall√©e, a younger girl who became England's longest ruling monarch - Victoria. Much of the early part of the film, part of Victoria being a child whose mother (Miranda Richardson) is challenging the throne, and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong), looks out of many costumes and landscapes. variations. But when Victoria (Emily Blunt) becomes old and worshiped by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), the film is booming. Blunt is a strong actor and finds a gentle line between birth and royal dignity, which makes her a beautiful foil for judges trying to control the "Queen of the Child" - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But when she matures in her eye, she lives in a striking German Prince Albert, and the love relationship that has lasted all the memories is similar to the concept of joining with the concern for her subjects - much to Albert's sensitivity. The film takes us to the birth of the first nine children and then ends with some statements about Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's impact on different royalties across Europe! It makes a beautiful costume for the drama evening and allows us to evaluate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. Strong as epic transport. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
