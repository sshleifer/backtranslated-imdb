I can't start to describe how amazing this film is. Suffice it to say when I am depressed about how dishonest or pointless things seem, this is the movie I rent to put me in the right view. Background music makes your minds easy and the simplicity of happiness is greatest. An Indian girl who sings is just one example of a movie that doesn't struggle hard and is therefore happy. Ruby (Ashley Judd) laundry worker Perfina is another eye and a smile can make the day of the most difficult person. I watch this movie and I dream of better days or good conversation with friends and I realize that being alone - Ruby is quite common - is not the same as lonely. Recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful movie.
