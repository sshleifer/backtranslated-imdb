This is one of the funniest series! I laughed until my parties shared the floor. If only one would be released in America. Area 0 or 1 - Non-PAL. <br /> <br /> I know it will appear in the UK, but it's 2nd and PAL! We give this series a fair shake. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's original and stupid role in it. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Unleash this show in America! or Show it again in PBS stations. I have to laugh and laugh! Please let us know, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
