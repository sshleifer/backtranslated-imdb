I almost didn't see this movie because I remember the penguin's march wasn't that exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree when I saw it in the opening week, but after I saw it, it was just amazing; The fact that it is impossible for photographers to take pictures is just worth their money. You will also see different habitats, different flora, animals and natural phenomena that not only would shock you simply because you are not creating a magic and dynamic from nature - just touch your soul and raise the question of humanity in the world, how our lives have deviated from nature to such an extent that we take for granted the natural beauty and wonders that are important to our biosphere. You do not have to be an earth lover or a tree-hugging environmentalist who would appreciate the exclusivity of this documentary. You just have to be a curious soul asking for the value of life and wonders. Enjoy!
