A woman in black (1989) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill's contemporary classical ghost story, which was published only a few years earlier than the film. Unfortunately, this movie is not published on DVD and as far as I am aware it has been deleted from VHS. Its availability is in direct contradiction with its popularity among those who know horror films. The story revolves around the events that take place in the seaside community at the beginning of the 20th century, where his company sends a young lawyer to a recently deceased widow who died in his isolated gangs to end things. What he thought would be a routine and apparently annoying task becomes a horror when he discovers that the old woman was haunted by his death and that his past ghosts are not satisfied. The story is said to be subtle, but brief, never as self-conscious, flashy or over-exposed. An obviously tight budget can have contributed to a nonsense approach, but that's exactly what the story needs and why it works so well. That's what you don't see this fear. That said, there is one particularly horrible scene based on visual and working perfectly. I watched this movie during the day and it still gave me weeks. If you love to be scared, do what you need to get a copy of The Woman In Black.
