This is a great example of a fairly simple Film Noir, which is exceptionally well handled - thanks to Otto Preminger's superb direction and some beautiful actors. Dana Andrews stands for a hot-tip detective who too often uses her fist instead of her brain. Soon after the movie begins, Andrews will be told about it and warned that if it continues, he will be Christmas. A little later, when investigating crime, he was attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to defend himself. This time he does not use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrews panic and assumes they don't believe him trying to cover his death - though instead of blaming the innocent man. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this movie than that - including a plot that includes a slippery frog (Gary Merrill) and a love for Andrew's (Gene Tierney). All in all, this is one of the best examples of the genre - with a great brilliant dialogue, great lighting and a simple but very effective story. It was so Noir was meant to be.
