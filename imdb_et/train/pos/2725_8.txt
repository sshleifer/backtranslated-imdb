"In Cold Blood", adapted by director Richard Brooks of Truman's Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and pointless killing of four families by a couple of unhappy criminals. The distinguishing feature of the film is the characteristic study of killers, especially the perpetrator Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> Few recognizable names are cast, but they are just a story for life. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent with two different individuals as a criminal. They play each other effortlessly, while Blake also has many ways to characterize his character. The rest of the majority is just average and not worth it. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the script does not take into account the late unlikely stories. Also featured by top-level Conrad Hall, Oscar-selected cinematography, as well as editing. It is also worth noting that Quincy Jones has given a jazz score that secured the nomination of the last four Oscar nominations for the last film. <br /> <br /> Unlike so many other criminal films, glamor is not violence. Brooks makes killers rogue, not to condemn them firmly. Do you agree with this opinion that the film does not offer an ordinary Hollywood approach as an interesting alternative. I recommend the film for this reason and also the knowledge that deals with the technical aspects.
