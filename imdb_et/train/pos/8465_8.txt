Booth puts a whole new twist on her regular J-horror movie. This movie puts you in the story of the protagonist's shoes. The director wants you to see what the main character sees and thinks about. <br /> <br /> The story is about knowing people who work, live and love our protagonist, and how he perceives the people surrounding him in an outdated radio station DJ. The story draws back the layers of basic education like onion on the back of the flash when the film runs, and we learned that things aren't always the way it looks. The film was mostly in the studio of a small obsolete radio station with a very bad history, where the main character was forced to pass his speech board thanks to the radio station that was currently relocating. From this limited space, this film thrives and feels very claustrophobic and very paranoid. At a time when our protagonist was unable to find out that the strange events of the old studio were due to the ghost of his associates or some conspiracy, or all that he thought was. From this movie, I like to see filmmakers see you through the main game eyes and make you just as paranoid as the main character. This movie is a very smart, rather short 76-minute film.
