am I the only one who saw the connection between camus cypresses and myth and mari life? In the Camus version, the man condemns the fact that he would spend his eternity with the gigantic stones he must lay down on the hill. unfortunately, every time he reaches the top, he slips and ends in the beginning. maybe his eyes were bouncing, I'm not sure right now. In the movie Mary spends her life in trouble to get her life together, unfortunately every time she gets her foundation and loses everything. in the case of the party he throws, where he is drunk, insulting his falafeli lover and practically attacking the mild schrieber. If you are questioning this topic, indicate how this scene ends when it tries to climb the flight of stars when books fall somewhere that prevents him from progressing until he finally ends. the next morning, when he wakes up, he's still on the stairs, never to the top.
