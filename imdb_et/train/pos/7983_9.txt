It's difficult to put this movie in many ways. Everything works well here; casting, acting, scripting and cinematography are all first-rate. For the figurative, this is a moving, violent story of love and redemption of people. There are many sharp techniques and technical values ​​for the film critic. There are some tactical errors and, as discussed on the disks, the finality is not realistic if it is strictly formal with regard to the CIA agents' training angle. But I took it to the end, because instead of a pragmatic approach by CIA agents, Creasy basically puts his soul on Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes supernatural through sacrifice, be it pragmatic. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy renounces the usual civic morality, and one by one, the bad guys in their methodological search for justice, which actually brings salvation to themselves and to the innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is very remarkable if you have attracted the genre at all. Excellent soundtrack, excellent writing, flawless casting and solid rendering on the entire disc make it a top-100 (or better) movie.
