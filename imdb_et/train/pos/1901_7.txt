It's hard to put a finger on it. Basically, I think it's a drunken comedy drunk who falls in love with a (relatively) poor girl whom he wants to marry when he's left the family. <br /> <br /> He has funny moments of romantic moments and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes his self-centered character love, Liza Minelli is a convincing foil because his entertainment is the opposite, but John Gielgud steals the exhibition as Arthur's superbly sarcastic butler. <br /> <br /> but with a very memorable memorable soundtrack and lasted nearly 3 months in our local heap.
