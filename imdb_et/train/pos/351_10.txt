This is a colorful film. That's about it. <br /> <br /> This is a mysterious element that SCREAM made so popular in movies, but I don't care about such things. Considering who is a bad guy is not that interesting, given the clues, are all misleading. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death were ingenious and gorey, bringing back memories of 80's horror movies, like Friday, 13th. Another nice thing about this movie is that unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS, where it was obvious, it's hard to identify a surviving girl. People who don't like slasher movies don't like this movie. It's that simple. I really enjoyed it and I plan to look at it again, waiting for the same. <br /> <br /> MB
