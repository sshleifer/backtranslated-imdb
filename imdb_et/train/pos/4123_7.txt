Freedom to own your Sea Going Power boat, the excitement of underwater adventures, tough, adventurous and cute (and so well equipped!) The husband's husband, who is exquisite in Bikini, were all "SEA HUNT" outlets. 1958-61). <br /> <br /> Just what was the reason why a series of "weapon hire" * was introduced. Let's take a closer look now. There must be some clues. <br /> <br /> If we look a bit back, we will see RKO Radio Pictures UNDERWATER! (1955). He played Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive diving advisors working on rescue quarries, including Pre-Fidel in Cuba. The film was moderately successful and not memorable, not necessarily the story, like the main swimwear of the principals. Fine, Shapely Women Folk in some really comfortable 2-seater swimwear (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) There are always advantages for boys; and the presence of harsh athletic men who show their "best" meat cake is equally pleasing to Gals. <br /> <br /> And there is one element that is the real legacy of this old RKO feature. It is on the soundtrack between musical lakes and themes. This is a recording by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White" by Damaso Perez Prado and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this Insturmental or Song (Lyrics) will not forget it soon. Its Carribbean Beat is so lively and its rich use in the orchestra's brass section is powerful and instantly transforms the impression and memory. The 45 RPM record of this song made it to ten of the most popular weekly songs for many Saturday nights at NBC TV's "YOUR HIT PARADE". We don't remember how many weeks it is and how big it is. (Maybe someone can fill up with us, please!) Then we got back to "SEA HUNT" and our odyssey to "Tube". The public had taken UNDERWATER! Well, but would they go to the TV series. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions was renowned for bringing out a type of product that most networks did not log in to connect to multiple stations. But they had great progress with the television show. ** With this in mind, we offer a series of stations to show them on the TV for every market area. (Like many newspaper syndicates, "sell" comics for different papers all over the country and the world, even. <br /> <br /> So we got "Mike Nelson" by himself, Lloyd Bridges' physical presence Mr. Bridges had been around for 15 years or so In some of the Black Blackie films (with Chester Morris), in the most memorable phases, they had mostly supportive and very different roles to go (3 Stooges in 1943), SAHARA (also in 1943), NORTH JUNE (1949), and MORE in EATON'S FIELDS (1951). he looks like a man who lives with his physical abilities, he took a very good diver as a diver, be it when he performs on-board tasks, or seabed masters. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd did take this role quickly, but, contrary to the fact that there is a lot of false information, he did not know SCUBA *** before landing Mike Nelson's concert, but Athletic Mr. Bridges turned out to be a quick learner because so many underwater close-up photos od showed that there was no doubt that it was Lloyd with mask, bubble bath (air tank) and pinball fins. <br /> <br /> Stories were almost always related to the payment of a customer, such as a private investigator. What if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in swimwear, the better. <br /> <br /> Like many other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV Productions, "SEA HUNT" had a fine, strange opening and closing with original random music and queue. <br /> <br /> I believe that "SEA HUNT" was simultaneously the top syndicate TV series whose success in the ZIV series was previously known as "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". As for the point of this underwater saga, here in Chicago it showed late night (after 22:30) WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC Affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I remember who was the original sponsor of this particular market. And there were even star ads in Star! How well we remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson, who is driving his Power Boat. And when we were invited to come back next week and look at "... another SEA HUNT adventure sponsored by G. Heileman Brewing Company, LaCrosse, Wisconsin" Old Style Lager Beer! "all when Mike roasted us by lifting an old-style bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drinking beer on your mobile boat! We are talking about the Coast Guard!) Then the boat leaves the dock, which brings with it the theme and rolling of the sea wolves. <br /> > NOTE: * Mike was becoming more and more figurative than writing, and things went very much like Deterctive Story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ZIV syndicates progress was "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WEST POINT" (and its clone "MEN OF ANNAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT", and "HIGHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And, of course, the SCUBA is an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.
