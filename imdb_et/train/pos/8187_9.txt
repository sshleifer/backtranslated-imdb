Anyone interested in Ood looks strangely similar to H P Lovecraft's vintage "Great Cthulhu"? hmmm? <br /> <br /> Great episode pairs (which don't refer to Billie Piper as most seem to be!) impossible on the planet and Satan's pit. <br /> <br /> The "Legion" link also thinks I used the one before and also refers to Satan in different novels after the exorcist era ... <br /> <br /> Big breaks using fear and elements of faith. A new team for those who work with great magic on television. <br /> <br /> This will definitely create new fears and "lies on the couch for hours not to be seen in many years when this wonderful BBC series continues (the BBC confirms that Billie Piper is giving up - maybe not permanently - after the end of the 2nd series): O ((
