Having seen and loved Greg Lombardo's latest "Knots" (he also wrote and directed this feature), I decided to check my previous work and this movie was worth the effort and rent. The Manhattan-based Macbeth is a cheek language, an excellent Shakespeare favorite, updated and moved to NYC. I was impressed by the basic features and intelligence of the script, and it was won by the way the film's production story reflects its own story and - very cleverly. In parallel with the challenges and tribulations of many Shakespeare games and Central Park, Manhattan was rarely used as a forest around Macbeth Castle. Mr. Lombardo is probably in his heart a pleasant place for the stories of New York and New York (Knots is a funny and warm sex comedy with about sixty New Yorkers, mostly in the charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Manhattan offices and downtown attic are good) time around Shakespeare games. The movie is well-paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the important drama in the center of Macbet. It reminded me of Al Pacino's "I am looking for Richard" - another wonderful Shakespeare "to play in the movie." I recommend looking at Macbeth in Manhattan.
