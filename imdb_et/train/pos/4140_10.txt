With an amazingly funny and original show. The start of a hysterical Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen's Gun A Gun) is just perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim), who plays a lesbian who has always challenged her partner and business partner (Asian-WOK-DON "T RUN"). (including one of Newhart's favorite exhibitions of all time) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane, then you love this series !! One of the best moments at exhibitions is Cindy Williams, who plays for himself. Cleaner, Tammy finds Cindy Williams in her coat. The image is from Cindy Williams, who is doing inconspicuous action with a bow-stick. It is fantastic to see an actor like Cindy Williams who can play as such. Opera, like many surprise waves in a short time, can only hope that it will ever appear on a DVD with many different bonus features.
