Another Aussie masterpiece, it deepens the unknown and supernatural world, and it does very well. It doesn't use great special effects that go beyond American flicks, it focuses more on emotional effects. A relatively simple plot by Rebecca Gibney & Co. It is the result of a couple buying an old house that was said to be home to a very old woman who never went out and whose husband disappeared in a mysterious situation a century ago. Strange things will happen in the house and John Adam will become a lost man who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
