She is such an extraordinary singer who cares about something else !! This last scene is one of the best moments in all show biz-bar none! I'm glad he kept the camera for ten minutes - he deserves this iconic status - it's the voice power. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie when I was five years old and it had a big impact on me. I see it today and yes, I see some mistakes (like Esther who wants to leave Grammy's right when his prize is announced). <br /> <br /> Some other user comments are just wrong - I mean where is nudity free - maybe we saw different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing power is monumental and if he has a great ego - good! <br /> <br /> He has earned it.
