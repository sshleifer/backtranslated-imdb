Four teenage girlfriends are going to Laurdale for Spring Day. Unfortunately, they get a solid tire from Georgia in Medley and one of the girls sees a deep murder in the forest. The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... "Low Grave" is a pleasant low budget surprise. The cast is quite pleasant, the direction is stable and violence is particularly disgusting and misognitive. Particularly the second murder is quite grim. The murderous sheriff is not a one-dimensional couple of scenes seemingly to regret what he has done. The two guys they meet at dinner are out of nowhere, but the scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.7 out of 10.
