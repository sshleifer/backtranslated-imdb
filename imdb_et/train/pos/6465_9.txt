This film, which was recently voted at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, is inspiring and moving. The famous conductor, who is forced to retire due to illness, returns to his small village to become the chief of the church choir and finally to find the fulfillment in his music. Based on Sweedish, which keeps things in itself and the isolation of a small Swedish village, this film develops its symbols well. perfectly targeted, acted and sung, it brought tears to many eyes and smiled at everyone. Hopefully it will spread in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, look at it!
