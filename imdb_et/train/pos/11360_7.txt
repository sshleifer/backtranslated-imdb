Chris Gerolmo took care that he simply didn't give us the "Jack-the-stripper" type of murdered people: he got into convincing results in his psychological character. Maybe mostly thanks to Stephen Rea's excellent performance against Donald Sutherland with good empathy on both sides. Was it playing these two parts? before anything else ?? which made the film more than just a disease from a Rostov butcher. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, did their parts really well. Good governance. Photography was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was in Hungary was definitely a couple of aberrations, but frankly, due to the depth of the stories and interpretations, these little trivials are completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Once, the HBO TV movie has come tricky. Recommended, especially if you want to analyze the characteristics and forget some of the illnesses? what I hurry to add is never exaggerated.
