Usually when we use the word "escapist", we mean it negatively; Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" big screen version proves that "escapist" can be good. It's really one fun movie. Like the name of the yellow clad, fearless title, Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate: ready to act, but not without its weaknesses. the world itself. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect any offender to attack; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is probably the most puzzling person; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is an average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), 88 musicians (Mandy Patinkin) and Kid (Charlie Korsmo) who have challenged the call. Also Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates. Wait, wait a minute. I haven't even explained the plot! In the plot, Tracy is trying to try and find something so far to find something for Big Boy. At the same time, some very strange events have taken place in the city, the answers of which may not be closer than everyone believes. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it is fun to watch. When Warren Beatty had ages, he used it well here. "Dick Tracy" is one cool movie.
