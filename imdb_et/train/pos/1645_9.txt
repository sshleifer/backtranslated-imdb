This west is different than most others. Here is the key to realism. Conchata Farrell arrives in Wyoming to work on Rip Tower on his beaches. The way it is presented makes America the most interesting part. I would have preferred to see it on the big screen, not on the tape, but it's worth seeing how life was in the West. Cinematography is great. Solid 9th Tower & Farrell looks in this movie.
