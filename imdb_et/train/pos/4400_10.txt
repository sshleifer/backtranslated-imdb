The star of this movie is a scenario. Attention is devoted to the time period of dress, language, social mores (we do not hurt women) and politics. This is today's reminder for Kosovo. The fine pieces of action scenes exist for the attentive viewer and the choreography of these sequences is excellent. Perhaps this film is near the bone of reality to earn the support that it should have received. It's like a staircase of growing violence, where each step is calm and calm. Great movie.
