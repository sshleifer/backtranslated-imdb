Winchester '73 is a great story and I like it. It's not your everyday west - it uses a rifle that passes through different characters - a mechanism that talks about these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian master, Jimmy Stewart plays a great man with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a captain who has to cope with the reality of his wife and west of nature. In these politically correct types, it is important to note that they kill a lot of resentment in this film. According to today's standards, it is still quite violent. But it's a great story and worth a look. Enjoy!
