This is a very well made film. Functional, scripts and camera work are all first-rate. The music is also good, although it is mostly at the beginning of the movie, when things are still relatively happy. There's no real superstars cast, though several faces are familiar. The entire cast works great work with the script. <br /> <br /> But it is hard to see, because there is no good end to the situation as it was presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for placing Hindus and Muslims on one another and brutally separating them into two countries. There are some values ​​in this position, but it is also true that no one forced the region's prices and Muslims to treat each other badly as they were during the partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw tensions between religions and were smart enough to use for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> The result is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation, and it's very unpleasant to remember and see on the screen. But it has never been painted in black and white. Both sides have greatness and awe and hope for change in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is redemption when Puro must choose a man who has destroyed his life, but also loved him and his family, who have abandoned him, and later look for him. But at this point he has no chance of causing him great pain. <br /> <br /> This film bears the message that both Muslims and Hindus have serious mistakes and that both can be a dignified and caring person. The reality of the partition makes it even more difficult to realize it because there can never be a real reconciliation on the Indian-Pakistani border. In this sense, it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> Finally, we were happy to have seen the movie, although the resolution was heartbreaking. If the United Kingdom and the US could deal with this kind of openness in their history of racism, they would certainly be better.
