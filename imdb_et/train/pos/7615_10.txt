This exhibition is undoubtedly one of the biggest TV shows. I mean, it's big, intercourse, drama, comedy, all, and in such a simple story: the plane crashed on the island. The characters are big and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us what a great actor he is, Josh Holloway is so big, Jorge Garcia is fun, I could go on. Also unexpected plots revolve, the back of the characters, the music at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms has once again proved what he is an excellent writer and producer. I mean, it's better than ALIAS and I loved ALIAS. Anyone who doesn't look at this display should definitely consider getting and watching DVDs because they don't have much. This exhibition can be the best example of television history !!
