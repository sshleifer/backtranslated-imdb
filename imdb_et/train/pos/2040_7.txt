CREEP is a straightforward, serious horror movie in real time that wants nothing more than just to show that in 85 minutes the mutant has attacked an empty subway platform. And it does just that. Something more, not less. Director Christopher Smith pulls the drama far as he probably can, by introducing a series of characters that are actually a reason to be in the subway after locking it. He also deliberately leaves the origin of the title slip deliberately (illegal experiments in the 1960s indicate this) and this little secret mostly works. Unfortunately, he is undermining himself, actually holding back the twist, where more genetic malformations appear (also refer to them). Yeah, you heard me right - I wanted to end the clich√©! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good as a terrorized female leader and the rest is good.
