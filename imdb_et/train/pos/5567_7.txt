And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to match this movie to television was very bad. ALL USING AND ISSUING ELIGIBLE NAMES !!! How do they do it, can you ask? Well, they don't do it very well, that's for sure. Anyway, if marijuana, which Cheech and Chong should have, is at their disposal, they claim to have diamonds! Still, the characters are moving with marijuana smoke stones that are stoned in stone in some other way, without explanation!
