This James Bond Game is the best bond game I've played in my life, it's my favorite James Bond game because: <br /> <br /> The missions of this game are really fun because they can be really hard, which makes With its more fun to play missions, there are many activities the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are fantastic, car missions have many activities and are fun to play. The voice of the actors is really good and it is cool that Sean Connery, with the James Bond vote, also makes the look of the bond really cool, as it looks like Sean Connery when he played James in the movie and the other sign looks pretty much the same as in the movie. The graphics are pretty good in this James bond game. Also, the game follows the movie pretty much, but not all, but most of all the time that is cool. <br /> <br /> Overall Score ********** ***** *****
