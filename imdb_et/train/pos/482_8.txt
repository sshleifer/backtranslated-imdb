This is a poem created by the film, perfectly presented and photographed with sensitive art. It occupies an ideal time and place in the atmosphere. (The Italian Lake District in the twenties.) It's a love story with twists. The characters are unique and plausible. Settings are deliciously exotic. Some scenes - funeral mist - a big long-lasting image of the shock plan in the midst of a sketchy tile floor - have beautiful pictures. And instead of the obligatory happy ending, this story is bitter sweet. When a film is an art, it is close to the masterpiece. <br /> <br />
