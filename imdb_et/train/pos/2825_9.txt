This film was quite surprising. I didn't expect much to be honest. Greta Garbo's First Hollywood Movie? So what? Probably something rough and ordinary exaggerated hand-waving and facial contrasts that the low-quality silent movies often show. Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo had to shock the people in the studio as much as she did to me because this movie made her a star and earned it. He instinctively understood the ability to stand, or just a meaningful expression of a long, lasting moment to feel and not only see. I was thinking about myself, how did this modern actor get into quiet movies? He was only years and years before his time. <br /> <br /> The story is not so interesting, it is a common story about love found and lost. It's only Garbo as Leonora, a poor village girl who does a good job in a big city, and then returns to the man who gives her life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is fit to use, but his character has never really been developed and retreated by the script. At one point he is ready to wear Garbo clothes, leave a piglet, return and return. Don't even talk about his terrible recent scenes with Garbo and his wife. Too ordinary, he didn't have much career after that, and I understand why. But he is enough for Leonardo's obsession with somewhat mystery. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is one absolutely fantastic line that just says it all. "Leonora, you're striking." Yes, striking indeed. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it's all about, despite the whole movie, just look at the last 30 seconds - Garbo's look when he's sitting in his luxury car alone. "She must be so happy she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all. I have to see it again, Garbo is just amazing.
