Review on World Premiere on September 9, 2006 at Isabel Bader Theater during Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> It was an interesting assumption, but it seemed to be going too long. heaps of e-waste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc.) that were shipped to China over a ton and then sorted and returned to new products to sell back) and other destruction. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers tried to get more people interviewed to increase the human element, but they were often prevented by Chinese censorship. However, it was interesting. Particularly striking were Shanghai's high-quality real estate agents, who proudly and dragged their luxurious mansion and garden, with other scenes living in medieval conditions. The 480m factory floor tracking was also something. The scenes from the three Gorges Dam project activities were also complemented by Jia Khang's films in TIFF (Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and Documentary Dong), which were also built around this topic. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, directed by Nick de Pencier, director Peter Mettler and theme Edward Burtynsky were in the Q&A stage after premiere worldwide. The producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced to the public and thanked as the most important person who helped to access China on the spot.
