As other reviewers have pointed out, this is one of the best Tarzan films. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of a movie because it seems to be a pretty accurate description of what a trading post must be. In addition, there is a need for exposure so we know why Harry wants to go back to the jungle. In addition, the film has one of the most exciting and terrible tracking sequences ever made. This happens when the Harry Safari group has to cross the cannibal tribe. Pre-censorship production values ​​add a lot of realism, which represents truly terrible dangers that the Europeans expected in the jungle. The film, although perhaps earlier, provides an accurate picture of how terribly local Africans were treated by their white employers. In addition, sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some big sets and two chetas! Don't forget the adventure classics.
