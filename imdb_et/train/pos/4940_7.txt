This film is about human relationships. Charming, funny and well written, meaningful text. It seems Morgan Freeman is definitely a set of fun. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and wise woman. I really enjoy her. A woman like her is a good motivator to learn Spanish. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets cute Paz Vega, the view is taken for an intimate journey with two strangers who learn to take care of where their lives are directed. 10 elements or less are about vitality. If you enjoy this movie, also see the blessing of Will Smith and his son. It's not a feature film or naked comedy. It's all about human relationships.
