Fey's story of Martian's attempt to colonize Earth. (Things must be pretty bad on Mars.) Two national soldiers are investigating the reported UFO crash scene. Whatever lands, the Tracy pond is buried under the ice, but there are traces of snow on the trail leading to the nearby canteen. <br /> <br /> Diner has not been the client on the eleventh day in the morning. Now there are a handful of bus passengers waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver requires six passengers on the bus, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is that now SEVEN people are waiting for the journey to continue. One of them is an alien, but which one? All of them are suspects. Of course, there is a crazy crazy guy (Jack Elam) who seems to be practicing sub-pink. There's a blasting businessman who has to go to Boston (John Hoyt). Young couple on their honeymoon. (Completed by Spouse Ron Kipling.) Except for couples, no one has noticed anyone. And even couples are suspicious of each other. Bride for a freshly minted spouse: "I could have sworn to have a mole on your chin." The story continues sparsely, but in a somewhat horrible way - the phone rings without reason, the lights turn on and off, the jukebox turns on - and none of them are serious. <br /> <br This is a very enjoyable ensemble game and climatic revelation deserves to be hit. There is no visible "depth" to it. This is not a moral message of normal people as ridiculous people. It is not a warning, but a fairy tale that directs and amuses. <br /> <br /> I enjoy it whenever it's on. It is especially interesting to see that John Hoyt is an irritated and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was a Roman Senator who committed the murder of Julius Caesar in MGM's Shakespeare game. And here he is - with three weapons. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
