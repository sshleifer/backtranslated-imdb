I was not too interested in seeing Flock. At the Lau, he drew the trilogy of Infernal Affairs's masterpiece, but he had fired Flock and was replaced by Niels Mueller, the Emergency Director. I had a feeling that Lau had made a good movie, but it was not happy with the study, so they fired him and hired another director. It usually doesn't work well (remember Invasion). But Flock was better than I expected. great movie, but it is an interesting and fun thriller. The development of the characters is very well done and I could feel the features very well. The relationship between the two main characters is also natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring a competent show. Let's go to the negative points. One element that disturbed me (was the moment it irritated me) was an unnecessary print to give the film more "attitude" and style. d their presence is arbitrary.Plus, I think the film should have been more ambitious. Nevertheless, I recommend Flock as a good thriller. It is not memorable, but it is fun.
