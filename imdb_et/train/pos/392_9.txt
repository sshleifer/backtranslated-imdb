Zu's legend was, in my opinion, a very interesting story. I think many people who did not like it did not see the mythology behind the film. They waited for something similar to Star Wars and it wasn't. I think Joseph Campbell would have liked this movie. There were many metaphors and hidden meanings that the average viewer could have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords inside. We all have to go to our living cave. We all have to see our insomnia one day. Giving some stories was a bit confusing, and some activities were sometimes somewhat confusing, but I think other points in the movie are easily prepared for it. I'll look at it again. <br /> <br /> I don't know if there are any differences between the Zu legend (which I saw in English in English subtitles) and the Zu Warriors (dubbed US version). to an audience that would have really damaged this movie.
