Anyone who is cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly plausible. The result is so moving, it brought me to tears. Choreography was beautiful without seemingly athletic. The graceful dance and charm of May gave me the horse draw. Tamako is such a wonderfully pleasant character. The old schoolgirl has almost seen when she remembers seeing the "King and I". The nature of Aoki is so fun and pathetic. Masako is so overwhelmingly natural as a confused woman, you want to hug her to convince her that everything is fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a keeper.
