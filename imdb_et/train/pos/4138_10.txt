Another reason to watch this pleasant movie is Florence rice. Florence, who? It was my first reaction when credit was opened on the screen. Soon, I discovered who the Florence Rice was, a true beauty who simply turns to a great result. As they all do for a band that grabs it. It has been a different time since 1939, but it has a charm. It takes you to another world. It starts with a mild comedy, but becomes very serious. Florence Rice runs from comedy to heroine. She is quite pleasant, at the same time strong and vulnerable, developing from a girl to a woman. Watch the facial expressions at the end of the movie. He made over forty films and I was looking for thirty-nine. Alan Marshal is in Flynn / Gable mode and proves to be perfect for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel offer great comics, but the real star is Florence rice. Fans of the 30's 40's, Don't Miss It!
