I must admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilt. Purple Rain not only broke the borders, but for ten years, costumes, music, behavior and dancing! By now my friends and I still have the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend we are a prince and a revolution. <br /> <br /> Now, with the movie itself, I was just thinking about what I said in the title, because in most cases this film itself is music. Acting? Please do not allow me to do this because it is one of my favorite guilty because I know it was not worthy of the Oscar in any way. But I think this movie, which took this movie, was Morris and Jarome, their calls from passwords were just fun. I want to evaluate this movie on the concert sequences because I felt it made a movie. <br /> <br /> Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music. Although the film and the actors are pretty bad, this movie is still fun to watch and even dance at night. This movie defined the 80s, so just enjoy it. The prince would like it, just a party! Oh, boy, it looked flat. <br /> <br /> 9/10
