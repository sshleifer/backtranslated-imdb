For the first time, I heard this movie after buying the 1976 flick "snuff". I was told that Devil's Experiment was a lot better, of course I went on and ordered Guinea Pig box. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had been trying to ban either this movie or another, so my interest was the highest. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment is a short film with no story, no character. Only 3 men torture a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture him in different ways, like beating him, turning around in circles over and over, forcing him to drink alcohol, forcing him to listen to the voice audibly within 24 hours, crushing his hand with a grab, burning and trying to eat burns, throwing the gut and ultimately dropping a sharp needle in his eye. <br /> <br /> I have to say that a lot of this movie was fake, like beating scenes. But then, some of them were really well done as much as you did. The scenes in which the woman wrapped around the circle made me look disappointed. Or is the scene where he is forced to hear a sharp noise within 24 hours, painful thinking. The worst is the eye scene. I didn't look at it, but just thought, "Damn that looks pretty good with such a low budget movie." I enjoyed the flick, but I don't know if I can really recommend it if you don't see most of what horror music offers. 7/10
