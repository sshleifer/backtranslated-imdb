This is a great British film. Intelligently observed script with many quoted lines that excellently captures what magic mushrooms can do for weekend people. As usual Phil Daniels is great with most of them being rated by British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles, hanging out with his mouth, is a casting mast and Gary Stretch, who looks out of the way, brings a strange atmosphere to the piece. Although it seems to be paid as a biker movie, I find it to be out there, only on the assumption that a lot of people have done it and got a t-shirt. also an excellent original soundtrack with a dazzling version of Freebird. It can really be the heir to the famous Ealing comedies of the 21st century. Like weeds in Welsh fields: it's a breeder!
