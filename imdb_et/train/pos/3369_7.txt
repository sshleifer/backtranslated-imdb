Regardless of what the title might mean, "Pigs Pigs" doesn't set Porky Pig. Rather, it has a young pig with more appetite than John Belush's animal in the house. Her mother repeats her, but that's not good. So much that he goes to another house, where a kidnapped scientist reaches him more than any mortal who can cope (but ultimately is a surprise). <br /> <br /> Most of the time, I would say that this comic seemed like a site owner between really big cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months later). But don't make that mistake, they're doing some clean things here. The power-consuming sequence seems more important today, considering our country's obesity epidemic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, not the biggest comic, but worth it.
