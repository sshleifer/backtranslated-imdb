Continued with angels with only dirty faces, Angels Wash Faces suffers somewhat from Dead End Kids' traditional Shenanigan. In fact, in the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, it would have been considered a real continuation with Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for consistency. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is a true bright light of this film. When paraphrasing the clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read the phone book for two hours and buy a DVD! <br /> <br /> The second round of this movie is chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the movie is kept too far in the background. I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row for a better show of Sheridan-Reagan duo.
