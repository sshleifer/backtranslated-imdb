This movie has a special way to tell the story, at first I found it was rather strange because it jumped through time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> In any case, the story was simple but still very real and touching. You met for the first time with someone you loved completely, but eventually broke down and promoted deadly embarrassment. Who hasn't gone through it? but we will never forget such pain in our lives. I would say that I am quite touched because two actors have shown a great character that shows the characters between love. I just want the story to be a happy ending.
