Why not have more movies (especially the American) on the Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I am accused of "electric ecstasy" after I have chosen "Meatball Machine" for my first quest. This is a survey, so I'm trying to stick to reflection and gut emotion. <br /> <br /> This is one creative work, although it is clearly inspired by the classic classic TUSSU! What if it's not all original? I have both of these films, and although Tetsuo is one weird son, the meatballs are much better and can sit without the strong suggestion of peace of mind, changing drugs to explain the importance of the film. The Meatball Machine Has The Same Story When It Is Its High Blood Flow And Gore. Thank you for the Japanese cinema! Simply put, the last time my dreams went beyond the horror of the horror occurred after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 years old. I can take a picture of my dreams coming out of the phone in a week. This time (in the 31st century), my dreams were pleasantly amazing. <br /> <br /> In this movie, human organisms are aliens whose sole purpose is to try and stop their endless quenching with human flesh and blood. People can eat cyber meat! There's more !!! Fight scenes! Great music !! Great points of view! A decent work by Cyborg's wife (at least better than her male colleague). The finished fight is worth ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention it's a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but it takes a cake! <br /> <br /> I can't wait to have friends to watch this movie again to see their face react. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because I am afraid that most friends and family do not understand the meat machine. The truth is that the whole world is not ready for the cutting machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, my wife went in when I watched the climatic fight at the end and she was speechless. Usually he says something "why are you watching this junk?" This time he had nothing to say. I was glad! <br /> <br /> It's not junk. It's not just SPLATTER (splatter is also great). This is the art of my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
