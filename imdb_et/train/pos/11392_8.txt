Paris is a place to enjoy beautiful art and music and fall in love - as it is in this movie. The boy meets the girl, they fall in love, but something stands for eternal happiness, classical story. <br /> <br /> George Gerschwin's wonderful music complements Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron's great dance. "America in Paris" is a humorous, delightful and loving film that is worth a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
