I could no longer accept the quote "it's one of the best ever made movies." If you think Vanilla Sky is just "redo", you can't be wrong anymore. This film has a huge depth: visually, musically, and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is soft and gentle (Sofia scenes) and other times powerful and intense (Times Square, after climatic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds are so great in this movie. Without music, the story is only half. Nancy Wilson created an emotional but eclectic score for the film that could not fit the dream-like theme anymore (although I never got it, I got the original score of about $ 60, you can find yourself a copy). Crowe's other musical choices, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etc., are also suitable for the film (Crowe is a good music ear). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes of this film (ie love, sadness, regret) are very powerful and have been amplified ten times by visual and musical experience and ingenious dialogue; I admit that the scene of the elevator brings tears back and forth to my eyes. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie (as if it were better) would be that it is so smartly designed that everyone, if you see a movie, get something new - so watch out and be ready to think! Of course, the topic becomes clear after the first or second view, but the story is always more than you think. <br /> <br /> It's just Cameron Crowe's best work and a completely brilliant job. Much of my filmmaking and musical inspiration comes from this work. It has honestly touched my life because true art has a tendency to do. It constantly surprises me that there are many people who cannot understand this film for what it is (I think that true art is art itself). <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Vanilla's sky is her league.
