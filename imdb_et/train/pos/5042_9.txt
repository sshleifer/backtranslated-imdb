The summary of this movie provides an excellent job of explaining what to expect. This is a very good thriller. Well shot. It is hard to believe that this was the debut of Bill Paxton's director, although some shots look exactly like the storyboard version. <br /> <br /> There are still a few frames that really look good and show Paxton's real imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a definite story at the end of some great twists, many of them, all believing, all fun and the best, hidden well enough to turn them into real twists. <br /> <br /> The film's child actors also do very well. I'm usually cautious about movies playing with kids because they often move as Nickelodeon rejects, but both children do a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. But it is very, very scary.
