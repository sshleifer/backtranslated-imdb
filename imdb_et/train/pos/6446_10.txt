"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was probably one of the three most beautiful films I've ever seen in my life. That it won't win the Oscar, I won't break. This movie is a kind of class that the Oscar could have suppressed !!! My dearest friend Anders (Nyberg), you have made a great pencil with your pencil! Kay Pollak, with your creation and everyone who contributes, has all given the gift of love to our world. From our world to the points of entry into the world, then going out of it - you really say you have made it better! A special personal thanks to my soul for all of you to bring back valuable memories in the second decade of your life. I grew up in Sweden and my young man and present Being formed and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings thank you all. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits in Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
