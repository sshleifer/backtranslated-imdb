I regularly watch dull short films and it is always nice to see something that has a simple and enlightened message without any pretensions or self-direction. <br /> <br /> A boy at school must attend a lesson when his friend is playing a rune and is given the most important lesson in his life, but to find that if there are not enough copies to go around, he has to bully the school. <br /> <br /> Unlike most children or children. the participants that these children have, and that is plausible. The music adds beautifully to the emotions of the pieces and the strokes of the film work well.
