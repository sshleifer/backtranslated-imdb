It's as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with its outrageous behavior and equipment, and the film was probably done because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We'll see a lot more this time. I also like Ioan Gruffudd, who is Kevin, an attractive man. Using Paris as the culmination of the movie was a wise idea. You should watch the movie regardless of your age.
