I randomly tuned it to an independent film channel and rushed it. I am a professional actor and I was flabbered from performances. They felt completely improvised, absolutely without influence. I couldn't tell if it was written or how it was made and waited until the end to see the credit and then spent half an hour in IMDbis to find this movie. Don't miss it. I can see that the writer-director also made a very fine film called a daily man, which I enjoyed very much. The shame of the film company is that these great projects do not get the distribution and advertising they deserve and live under radar. This movie deserves to be high and proud to fly. I invite people to look at it and look at it.
