Great movie, realistic picture of modern Finland, touching and deep. One of the best Finnish movies. Captures the everyday life of the small town of Central Finland, the wishes and weaknesses of the people, the joy and the worries. Bright early sunshine creates a good atmosphere for a clear examination of people in the welfare society. Indeed, Lampela is one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without arms and bloodshed. His next film, Eila, is also worthwhile, although the story of women struggling for their work is not as universally appealing as the fate of the River.
