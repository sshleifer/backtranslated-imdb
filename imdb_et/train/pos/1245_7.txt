When I see the most comments, it is called "failure Eddie Murphy". These critics want to look at some of the things he is doing these days, and maybe soften his attitude retroactively ... "The Golden Child" is not a great entertainer, but thanks to most of it, old life breathe old clich√©s and gives Murphy one of his best role. I do not understand the permeable lack of "effort" at all. Maybe it appeared at a time when the company had grown up from tired, exciting moments of adventure? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; it is unfair to make this one scapegoat if what is probably his greatest sin is also completely harmless. There is nothing wrong with getting the benefits of the trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, but even a casual observer should be able to understand that "ridiculous" is where Hollywood's mysticism begins and ends. More important than disbelief in this story is that the audience has entertaining guides to show them a mysterious sight. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy are just fine for this ability. My advice is buying a ticket and driving.
