Strongly wonderful movie. You have a grip on death if you let yourself be involved. Successful dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) is in a torn life crisis that balances his career with his family. He observes his former college roommate Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He finds that Charlie, who lost his wife and family 9-11 attacks to America, is no longer connected to reality ... by choosing his favorite music with past and video games. Former roommates revive their friendship and strengthen their former bond. Johnson has a friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try to bring Charlie out of his grief ... but it's Alan who gets his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays with Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's lawyer / guardian. Also cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Model and Robert Klein. Outstanding sound that likes Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. NOTE: I've never been a Sandler fan; but I found him missing this role. In some scenes, I thought loudly ... why he never got into singer / songwriter Bob Dylan to play biopsy.
