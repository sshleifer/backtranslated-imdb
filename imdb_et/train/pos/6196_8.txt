Fay, the sister of the notorious Nobel Prize winner Simon Grim, still loves Henry Fool. Their son gets an undiscovered orgy-in-a-box from an undisclosed sender and three continents in retrospect, which includes a collection of government representatives, terrorists, escorts and bellhopers from the very evil bag. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey offers a perfectly timed comic, including some great physical work. With strong contributions from Jaymin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim demonstrates the best Billy Wilder tradition that nothing is funny as a beautiful woman in distress. <br /> <br /> Another good result from Hartley (and thanks to credits from the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley was a companion in autumn 2004).
