Each story contains a presumption, signs, and conflict. Characters that characterize their playful drawings allow victory and are easily borrowed by military character. The premise of Ardh Satya is, in summary, the poem of the same name, written by Dilip Chitre. The line goes - "ek palde mein napunsaktha, doosre palde mein paurush, steam teek tarazu ke kaante par, ardh satya?". Unprocessed translation - "The right and wrong delicate balance (often seen in the trial of blind justice in courts) is the inability of one disc and the other party. Is the needle in the middle of the truth?" <Br>> <br /> The poem is spoken by Smita Patil in Om Purile. This has a major impact on the main character and provides the basis for many subsequent events. At the end of the movie, Om Puri is in exactly the same position as the poem is so aptly described. <br /> <br /> The film is trying hard to do what the poem does. But Chitre's words are too powerful, and at best, the film fits into every aspect until the poem. <br /> <br />
