Today, Joseph L. Mankiewicz does not remember most of the best leaders in Hollywood history, but this film proves he is. Mankiewicz has long been successful in making complex American dramas, such as a letter to three women and all Eve, as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to Julius Caesar's life. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he can't sing too well. He is the only actor who could pull it out completely cool and clear. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job of acting on Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good when Sarah Brown and her scenes Brando shine with great chemistry. All supporting actors play their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry Horse is very funny. However, Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit to bring his music to the screen so that it seems authentic in many scenes, but is still a story in his world. All in all, boys and dolls are great music and work on many levels, which should not normally be.
