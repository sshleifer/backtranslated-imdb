I keep it quite short. I believe this is an extraordinary film. I see other reviewers who have commented that it is poorly written, badly shot, a terrible soundtrack, and worse that it is not in the real world of depicting one's life. OK, so it may not be quite plausible for this whole length, but this film carries a message of hope that some others seemed to have disappeared. I hope it is not too late to save people from the terrible things that continue in so many lives. Gangland violence is real, right? Is that right, no! This film carries an important social message that cynics may not like, but which must be praised rather than paralyzed. I've been watching this movie at least eight times, with equal enjoyment every time, and every time with the feeling that maybe the world can be better and not better than saving (not just until 2008). 9 of these 10 for me. This is, in my opinion, very nearly perfect. JMV
