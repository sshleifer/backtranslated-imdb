This interesting Giallo increases the typical but still fascinating plot and really sadistic killer who probably likes to murder victims before his murder. <br /> <br /> Director Emilio P. Miraglia, who also made a very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" a year ago (see also my comment on it) or sequences of time. /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but it only appeared in Germany in a video clipped under a 15-minute plot under the silly title "Horror House". At least murder scenes that satisfy every gorehound are completely inviolable and the viewer remains the killer motif. However, all Italian versions of the film material are of course still searchable. <br /> <br /> Giallole is recommended for convincing Giallo with mandatory twist and red herring, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" fans and slightly higher than Miraglia's above mentioned other thrillers.
