I went to the Oscar winners list and was surprised that this film won the Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for the best picture in 1969. After actually seeing it, I'm no longer surprised. To develop the character of Joe Buck, it was so early on in terms of style, cinematography and rebound. <br /> <br /> For me, the most amazing thing is the depth of Joe Buck's character. short film. I think Voight grabbed naivety and resentment when it caused it. The two scenes that really drew me were after getting in the theater and when the older man asked him. I think when he looks into the mirror, he tries to see if it's really the one who has done or is going to do something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was Hoffman's great decision to take this role. Otherwise, he may have finished after that. Anyway, it was always considered a great cause.
