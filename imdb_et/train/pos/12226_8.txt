It's the best TV movie of all time. Can I say that because I'm a big Silverstone fan? Partly, but even without him, I still see it. I am a fan of successive genres of successive killers and I believe this is a big entry in this category. Mary Giordano Alicia is also one of the top five characters. Totally memorable - as it actually exists. I would also have my side if it were to solve the mystery. He plays the character as he does his real life, fully trusting everything he does. It looks sweet, honest, nice ... just like it is in real life. So it works? Yes, indeed, he is rebel again. This time he's not bad, he's too good, and a little afraid to do things over the law. But he doesn't do the things a normal teenager would do. Instead, he spends time reading detective games and solving crimes. Clich√© abundantly: he tends his father to die differently from the vigilant style. At that time, it seemed that Alicia was playing the same signs: rebellious, seductive, unmarried, lonely. This is also happening here, but he's a little nervous this time. It doesn't matter; she's still kidding. Check it out soon or else Giordano will investigate why you're not ...
