I had a personal interest in this film. When I was 17 years old and just out of high school, I got a job as a member of the 20th Century Fox Workers and Hod Carriers Association. At the end of the first day (sweeping the deck board on board the aircraft), I was told that next morning enough clothes and the like would be brought into the suitcase. When I arrived the following morning, the bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south to San Diego. We soon stopped at the military base called Camp Campan or Camp Hahn. When we were bunked, we went a few miles north to the great seabed of Camp Pendleton. There, on the beach, we started to build a Japanese Pacific Island base. It took about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, a mine, a sand pit trench and a dwelling. All of this was a very high salary, sometimes a golden time, triple our usual hourly rate. Our food was also first class = the original rib of lunch. a film that was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited eagerly for two hours before the movie finally appeared on my screen. Then there were no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the heroes of the movie diving into the base bombing and blowing it down. Slightly disappointing but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment I enjoyed this movie and haven't seen it. I later learned that this movie was signed by the government and that Fox was paid on a cost basis, which could be our extravagant reward and lifestyle there. Bob Weverka
