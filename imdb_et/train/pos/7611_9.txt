"I've looked at this island and what I saw was beautiful," one of ABC's award-winning TV shows "Lost" announces. The series could be summed up as a drama story of a group of anti-aircraft equipment that remained on an unknown island, but it would be an exemplary service. "Lost" follows a large number of characters who come into conflict with the island, each other and ultimately themselves, because they are fighting for their new way of life and interdependence. The situation becomes more complicated when it turns out that it is not an ordinary island - and that they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My initial fear of listening to this series concept was with new stories that they could tell us after a while, but it turned out to be unfounded. The narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the filling is great. The island is inherent in itself, and to understand this comment, you need to see a series for yourself that shows only its originality and size. <br /> <br /> While writing this review, only the first two seasons have been blown up and they are full of strong episodes. My only slight criticism is that the second season seems to be slightly slowing down, but fortunately, the latest episodes will come in admirable shape. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend one TV series, you should follow the better now, it would definitely be. If you like excitement, adventure, distinctive stories, extremely strong cast and team, beautiful places and an island that seems spiritual as natural, "lost" to you. Just make sure you get started.
