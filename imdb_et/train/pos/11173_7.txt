Ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are the main part of a variety of horror movies. That's a lot of them. Then it's Stephen King, one of the best horror masters. This movie was very good, just too predictable. And what horror movie is not stupid people? It is overcrowded with slowed down casualties that virtually scroll for their lives. Pet Semetary I found some scary. The way everything was created was really horrible, but not terrible. Most often it was believed that the actor was SOMEWHAT, the relationship was not so tight, but the level of entertainment was set to a high rank; My eyes were almost glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans must see this movie, but just like anyone else, wait for the OKAY thriller.
