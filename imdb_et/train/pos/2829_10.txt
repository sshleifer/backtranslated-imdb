Undoubtedly, Lessons II is the biggest film I've ever seen. Japanese imports (badly) are translated into English, a joy to watch. Not much of this makes sense, but it doesn't matter. It's the biggest comedy without deliberately being deliberately funny. My recorded copy has been viewed dozens and tens of times, as I slowly, personally, introduce it to the world of cinema. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays the instructor / lover for Ken, our hero. (Obviously he was just under his control.) Ken is played by Goro Inagaki, the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives him everything and has big hair through the film. Stacy Edwards, "In the Men of Men" fame, also appears in the film and is probably happy that he later found other film works. the plot is. In recurring viewing, you can enjoy elements such as abnormal quantity of views of Ken in your house (at least 50) or that Ken is wearing a shirt that has stapled corn corpses in the film final. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable but highly quotable. My friends and I restore the whole scene. Yes, it seems we are flat losers and we are ... but we are flat losers who have seen "private lessons II." Be one of the ten people in the world who has seen this movie. You thank me for that.
