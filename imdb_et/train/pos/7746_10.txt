Those who know the group, know Tom Barman, the lead singer. He directed this movie a bit as he creates music, it's all. This is a comedy, although in most cases it is absurd and cynical, drama, no major character is happy to say life, and that is not really the goal. <br /> <br /> The film starts on Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, where there are several people, some of whom have nothing in common, but they come together at night and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books that nobody reads, a young scientist with a deadly taste and his sister, the owner of the gallery, two young men who are constantly in contact with the law, a man working in the cinema and two young women. Throughout the film, a man has something to do with the wind. All characters have their own troubles, family or friends or just life itself. <br /> <br /> The film is located in Antwerp and shows many beautiful pictures of the city and port. It is not easy to explain the events of the day, I just suggest watching a movie, just saying too much. But I can say that Barman has great camera use and uses a lot of music to set the mood (mostly dance music, not real rock), especially at the party with great music. <br /> <br /> This movie is an experience in itself, it does not leave you smarter, maybe just that you have to live it and not waste or false moral truths. <br /> <br /> In short, look at it, it's definitely worth it!
