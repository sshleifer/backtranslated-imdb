"Footlight Parade" is just one of the many wonderful musicians that Warner Bros was brought to combat depression in the early 1930s. The "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced during this era and they literally made millions of Americans forget their worries for a while and enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> While most of the films produced were the great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parade was incomparable to James Cagney. Almost ten years before his most famous music, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he is dancing in the most original dance styles, where his hands usually fall to the side and his legs make all sorts of waves and strokes. It's easy to see that she enjoys herself and that makes us even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Although almost all musical sequences appear at the end of the movie, they are worth the wait. I believe this film was made just before the production code was installed, so some costumes and scenes are a bit stiff. But it's all fun. <br /> <br /> It does not matter what the plot of the movie is, but you know that there is a lot of laughter and great cast. In addition to those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is on the right. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
