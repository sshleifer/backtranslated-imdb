One should really be very skinned that it shouldn't be wiped into the treasure of this movie (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). Actors, beautiful settings, locations and surroundings, depicting deep emotions, sweet songs (especially the voice of my favorite Udit Narayan song) - everything was just cute. The human (imperfect) element was also woven to create some drama and lead the plot, as well as to allow a cordial resolution. Alok Nath is such a terrible actor so that he opens up his image characters with emotions, he steals almost an exhibition of the young stars. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves real romances - those that go beyond the superficial beauty of true love - as one of the best movies there, in Hindi or any other way!
