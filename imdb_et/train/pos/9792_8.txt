Once a year, such a movie comes and makes things easy for you. You haven't tried to think it's good, it's just. You enjoy it when you look at it, and you take it home. I can't say it's completely flawless, but it's close. Action - great, story-interesting and intermediate. It's a small family story that's pretty much predictable, but it's not a secret itself. this is the way the blind girl achieves it. I was impressed by how the director depicted their deep relationships (a dark girl and her cousin). The only thing I didn't like is an actor who played with her mother, she was too harsh and without need. Keren
