I saw that this film was addicted to Jane Austen and felt hesitant about the cinematic presentation of the complexity of her novels: well, this takeover is just accurate, intelligent, gentle, careful, tactical, respectful, intense, literally perfect! br /> <br /> Emma is one of Austen's most enjoyable and funny novels, thanks to the general irony and characters. In the film, this fine irony was ignored, ignoring the comic (Miss Bates above all). What's in the novel, and the film clearly changes it, is the deep knowledge of the human life of the English writer and the contemporary look that women, men, and their relationships are handling, and it's amazing when we think of an 18th-century female writer who lived almost lonely life, he understood this depth and truth about life as he did: it is the majority and I still care. We can feel it in modern times: just replace costumes and use the current language, but the situations, feelings, ideas would be extremely modern. I mean the interest in the lives of other people or the imposition of envy, which now, once prevails in the relationship of women, and still has difficulty in exposing and expressing one's feelings, especially love: every situation becomes universal and the value of time. The cast is very talented and offers very good and extremely excellent performances: the young Gwyneth Paltrow is especially suited for this role (nowadays it would probably be too mature for it), Toni Colette is just great. And how did I envy those great dresses they could wear! And then, in a breathtaking English country where every situation gets such a magical and dreamy dimension ... a truly enjoyable and worthy movie.
