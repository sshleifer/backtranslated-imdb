I'm astonished at how little Columbine's massacre has been made. There is no big documentary, very puzzling. Fortunately, we have been blessed with Ben Coccio's talent who led ZERO DAY and Gus Van Sant, who did the same with ELEPHANT. The two different events that have a common idea that the real cause of the massacre is always a mystery, is that there is something ultimate confusion and unknown about the motives of these two killers, and what really brought them to the imagination is a terrible reality. ZERO DAY, which consists of a video tape made by competitors and found after the event, is completely riveting. Even if you know where it goes, you still have the hope that it will not "go there" ... and the tensions that have arisen in the last minute of the movie will be torturing. The film is top-down, starting with the director's script (not much improvised, although it seems very spontaneous) with two leading players and supporting players. ZERO DAY is just one aspect that disturbed me. Okay, so we can't figure out why shooters did what they did, but it was definitely one of their contributors to their ANGER. But these guys don't seem angry. They can say some things that show they are, but they didn't really convince me that they had something inside them that forced these innocent people to kill. But it leaves me feeling why "why?" this director Coccio wants me to have. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it slips on you and stays there for a long time. The people of BLAIR WITCH may have wished these men to have fun documentaries.
