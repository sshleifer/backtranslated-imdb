The sea view is made from the original Akira Kurosawa script and is really a lush and warm movie. It's a pleasure! <br /> <br /> Kei Kumai as a director is certainly not equal to an old but eternal master (especially in the case of a massive scene at the beginning of the movie, is a terrible act), but the overall mood and landscape are very enjoyable. Another thing that remains here is that Kurosawa was always able to allow characters as much as they actually show and do. <br /> <br /> Probably it was during his magic shooting; and just maybe this script was not yet running. Maybe we just forget the man's eye. <br /> <br /> This is one cute and sweet movie, but it's not Kurosawa. Expect it to be very silly ...
