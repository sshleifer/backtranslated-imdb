Unlike another user who said this film sucks (and Olivia Hussey was terrible), I disagree. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is all she has! Yes, he may be older because many remember him from Rome and Julia, but he is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story can be used quite often, but it is a unique movie and I fight back anyone who disagrees! I enjoyed this movie as much as I have another Olivia Hussey movie. Olivia "my girl" and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with it. Not only because it is Olivia's movie, but because of its unique story and excellent direction.
