Instead, the film does not allow a lot of women who want to see a football match who are not interested in football, like me, but it is not football, but it is discrimination and the enthusiasm of women for the sport they love. <br /> <br /> The film will open on a day when a crucial World Cup match between Iran and Bahrain will take place. The girl tries to go to Tehran's Azad stadium when the boy is dressed, she seems to get until the soldier tries to find her. When he is caught, it is taken to a small body, which is located outside the stadium, with a handful of already caught women, here being guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who run back home. cattle. We never learn a character's name, but we know them as people because girls ask the guards to look at the nearby gap in the wall and when they refuse, they try to give at least some comments. <br /> <br /> In addition to being an important part of rigid gender segregation in today's Iran, the film contains a lot of fun moments, such as "hide" that one of the girls is wearing the toilet and going to the girlfriend. who hid himself as a soldier and was only caught because he decided to watch the game from a senior seat reserved for a senior official. The girls' enthusiasm for the game is that eventually the viewer is likely to be on the edge of his seat, hoping that Iran will win and win in Germany. Soldiers are not shown as fundamentalists, they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be, and when girls are explained why a woman can't watch sports, they don't seem to be convinced of their arguments. <br /> It is a shame that this movie cannot be seen in Iran, but it is good that the wider world sees it and therefore sees ordinary Iranians as not a number of fanatics who desperately want a war in the West but ordinary people with the same passions troubles like people everywhere. The pain did an excellent job because their characters seemed rather like people than just caricatures.
