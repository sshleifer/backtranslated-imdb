How can one claim that Urban Cowboy was and still is the best Texas magazine document. Consider the following: men beat their wives, break in bars at night, get married to solve the fight, adultery, and compete in mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly. They no longer do them. It seems that the current movies are always people who have a lot of money, live in big homes, drive expensive cars and don't work. This movie has a trailer for the sake of fake! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I look at it at least once a week. Without joking. I've cut it at the end of this movie. send me an email to learn more about why I call this documentary. Look at the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are shared - he agrees friendly and waves, he slips him into a bird - he returns to the half-peace mark that adds to his horn to hit and tear. <br /> <br /> Buds mother calls her around. 18 hours after the city arrives on Sunday to see if he still has a job - everything he has done is drunk and put (x2) with the help of his wife and aunt. <br /> <br /> "You all live like pigs" Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary? Could we not find out without displaying a dirty sink? God whom I love it! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows Wesil to help him ride a horse. Just a few days (or maybe the next day) after Wes just got out of her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wesi? Oh yes, did you win my husband the other night so we get this lesson to not mention the fact that he is looking for him later in a lot of battles between Bud and Sissy, which incidentally take place publicly - Gilley's! <br /> <br /> A wedding reception picture that takes a seat (oh mankind!) could at least arrange or move chairs away. "My feet are mommy" <br /> <br /> All in all, you do not put such scenes in the movie to try and understand human psychology. It's a documentary of real life. <br /> <br /> I just want the director to be cut there.
