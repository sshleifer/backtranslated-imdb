The House of Spirits is a thrilling story of family intrigue, South American politics, and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring Isabel Allende's novel to life with all her passion and difference. This is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons, like Esteban Trueba, is very incredibly old and soft, while Meryl Streep is Clara's role in his relatively short life of his gentle, loving warmth. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a nice pair to fight for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, like Esteban's sister, provides very mobile performance. The Portuguese countryside is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. The settings for Clara's home and Esteban ranch are effective, and US cars add to the postwar atmosphere.
