Guy Kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughter. Like most candidates, he knows almost anything. Warren William, a highly appreciated actor, is great at giving Kibbee instructions; that is, he teaches him to say something that does not mean something for the voting public. A campaign based on a commentary, "I'll take it under the advise" and "Maybe yes, but then again, maybe not" is the almost perfect way to win the election. Excitingly, the candidate, the greater the chance that he will win. After all, the public can identify with such a person. As for the film, it does a lot of comedy.
