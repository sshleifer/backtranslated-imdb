I thought this movie was very enjoyable. I watched this movie with my wife before I had my first child. That's why I didn't just look at it as family entertainment, and I still enjoyed it thoroughly. Many reviews seem to suggest that this film is not a land break, unexpected parcels have not changed, and the film was predictable and boring. If these people look at the film that they hope to have a religious experience, they will probably be disappointed. It's just an animated movie; Nothing more. If you just want to sit down and let yourself be entertained, you won't be disappointed. In the end, it is definitely not the best movie Disney has done, but it's fun and I don't understand the bad reputation he's got.
