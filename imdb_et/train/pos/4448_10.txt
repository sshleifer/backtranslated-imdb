I saw this movie yesterday for the first time and enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm a student of screen writing and I loved how little characters intervened when something important / climate happened in the scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of the story is quite shocking - at one particular point, Barbara Stanwyck has flirted publicly with her daughter's boyfriend; AND reviving some passion with his wife, whom he has not seen for ten years; And with the "two shots and one" shock signal, he puts his old shag mate in Holland (the reason he left the city)! ALL AT THE SAME TIME! The moral majority must have been back in the late 50s. <br /> <br /> I love costumes and cinematography and direct hip-dialing - just to watch Barbara Stanwycki and Co's "Bunny Hug" is a good enough reason to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of this period I've seen for a long time.
