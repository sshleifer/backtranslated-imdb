ABC has done more for this show, allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join this show. Initially, this exhibition was observable and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and three children are truly professional. An hour's lesson after John's death in real life hit me. I lost my father at age 17 and can understand and understand their pain and embarrassment. ABC should be proud to preserve this exhibition and even preserve it as John's last wish. This exhibition has matured and developed due to such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmys.
