This is a great game! Okay, he didn't have some of the features he had to have, but Digital Anvil is still a good game. There is a certain similarity to Elite (you can trade, weapons and destroy them from destroyed ships, go on missions), but this game has a heavily written mission. This is a great mission. The control system is different, uses the mouse! You basically drive around the space ship system and make your way up! The game also has pretty good graphics even in 2003. This should also happen on a modestly defined computer. The story contains a great voice from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (he will appear in every computer game). Continue with the story that it gets better and better. There's even a part of the competition where you and your opponent have to ride around your spaceships (that is, you pass the rings). This part took me time to win. This adds to the diversity of the game. Some sections are a little harsh here and there, but generally you can win this game. The game has an active mod scene online. Pick up some ways to expand the game. I haven't played any mod yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, its sequel was abolished, shame!
