A really good horror flick that features the biggest, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa, trying to find an old meteorite. After finding it, Rukh is poisoning its radiation. Everything he touches dies and Rukhi's dark side makes him an egotistical murderer. His friend Dr Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited solution to the problem and at the same time understands that radiation can be used for humanity by treating diseases. Two teams are fighting for radiation opportunities. Pretty good special effects. Others cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
