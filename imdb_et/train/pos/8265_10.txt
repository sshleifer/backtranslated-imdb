The name of this film alone made me want to see what it was, so I filmed this movie in the early days of AM. If you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through in the first few days and actually saw a dramatic scene when the mines crumble to men. This film clearly shows that Germany and France can work together and be friends during World War I, and how the Germans, to help French miners, were much unbelievable in French townspeople. All the actors were outstanding, there were unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine. There's an old old pensioner who can bypass the mine when the elevator breaks down. If you're a true movie movie, this is a movie you don't want to miss.
