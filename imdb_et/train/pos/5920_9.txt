The American icon Henry Fonda depicts "Elegant" John Howard, an aging truck that has crushed his beloved "Eleanor" after his long hospital stay, forcing him to give up payments. Deciding that he wants to make another perfect run, he stops out of the hospital, steals Eleanor, and joins an old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan) who needs to relocate his prostitute troupe. / / <br /> The wonderful power of the Fondas is a natural anchor for a film that pulls the hearts as efficiently as it tends to make funny bone more comedic scenes. Excellent cast, including Robert Englund, as a reluctant young man, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit) and Dub Taylor (a delightful ham, as always, in the most blatant comic part of the picture) helps immeasurably. br /> <br /> Ultimately, the nature and the journey of the life-giving image of the image represent an incredible weight; this picture is that when you get there, you remember long after it ends. <br /> <br /> The promise of an open road is clearly shown here; the countryside is just beautiful. Set Craig Safan's wonderful music score, this is a remarkable picture of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> It loses something in its final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are a bit more than invasions), but it still retains its good symbols thanks to its central character. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances can the title (especially its alternative title) be used / driven. Great Smokey Roadblock "), this is a rewarding movie experience that I can recommend without being beaten. <br /> <br /> 9/10
