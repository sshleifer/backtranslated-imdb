I was very surprised by this film. I had touched the lives that Paul had touched to find his "marie" from whom he was separated. Humor was also very good and it didn't damage the story when I thought it would probably happen. In fact, I was expecting "paulie wants crackers" to hurt this movie, but even it was done in a very humorous scene that becomes very touching when paulie is in a press conference at research laboratories. So if you want to see a good "animal who speaks" then look at it much better than Dr. DOLITTLE thinks. PAULIE also has a surprised twist that is well done.
