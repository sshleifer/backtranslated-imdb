This work is conspicuous in depicting the exact life of teenagers during its execution. Although this is a broad-ranging generalization, the parents of this time were too independent to be true parents, and those who lived at home were too distant from the real problems of their children. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us how to let go, even when it hurts, and does it in a sweet, melancholic but informed style, according to which Foster speaks philosophically about knowing life's pain. I loved this scene. It was my favorite scene in the movie actually. <br /> <br /> The funeral journey had to show that life goes on and so we must. Baio skateboarding through the gon package and overcoming them had to show us that difficult times are passing and we need to get through to better times. <br /> <br /> The whole metaphor "moving forward," and the life process is all over the film and it gives us hope, finally. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, although I don't often see it because it tends to be melancholic. <br /> <br /> For toddlers, this should not be seen, and probably only those who rose in the 1970s and 80s would like to. <br /> <br /> This price is 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
