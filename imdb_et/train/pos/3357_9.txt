When Rome goes crazy, celebrating Hitler's visit - uniforms, ensembles, parades - two stayers stay home, in a large building and finish the meeting. She is Sofia Loren, a brutal civil servant and a mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who has been fired for his homosexuality. Both need business and understanding, both find it with each other. <br /> <br /> Film covers a few hours. The color is faded and everything happens with military routes and hysterical radio transmitters. Strangely enough, the Nazi anthem - Horst-Wessel-Lied - is becoming a more romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> A beautiful movie, a great pastime special pastime in Italian history and a touching, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we have been waiting for, and Sofia Loren is doing a great job, very far from his usual truck driver's nepolithic fishwife person. Don't miss it.
