A nice character in a pretty cool environment. Being a man, I'm probably not qualified to fully understand it, but they do a nice job of creating a restrictive Victorian environment from the beginning. It is not as grim as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even tougher. This makes it an excellent chemistry among the main characters. Each of them has its own "thing" they face. When they come out of the rain and break out of the spider net, they begin to communicate and slowly lose their doubts. I liked the movie that it didn't go for cheap comedy. It didn't try to put us in a lesson. People who seem to be completely worthy are really well-developed people who can see the light. I had a little trouble with the character of Alfred Molina, who had such an epiphany so fast, but it had to happen in this world. Good behavior with something positive going on in the lives of some pretty good people.
