As others have commented, I checked it after Siskel and Ebert listed this one as their ten best films of the year. What a gift. Then I went to buy it so I could borrow it. <br /> <br /> Best Offer? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on his cabin. When Cage goes down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I'm afraid of you." Yoakum pulls his gun on Cage's face, "Does it look like I'm afraid?" Great exciting humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. Continuous monitoring of the "Welcome to the Red Rock" sign highlights the nerve and shake the smiling head. Music created "Twin Peaks" for a cinematic film of hunting, quality of fear. Unlike the "Twin Peaks", however, it does not break things that go too far into the extreme, needs "upper" itself. <br /> <br /> I admit that I look at credit 15-20 times. They saw that they had Yoakum's "thousands of miles somewhere" (completely chosen) playing a freight train curved in the desert. . Snowy mountains are far away. It was an incredible, fluid design. In addition, I have never seen a better combination of vision and sound in a movie. Also, this story is perfect.
