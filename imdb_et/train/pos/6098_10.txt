This is one of the horror-based TV shows that is right. On Friday, the series had nothing to do with movies. Poltergeist legacy: I'm not so sure. It can be loosely connected to movies. They just seem to show the famous title at exhibitions, so fans look at it. <br /> <br /> This shows that Freddy has burned Elm street parents (in my first episode) and the number of parents was disappointing. With all the children she was trying to get to the first 3rd film, you expect more parents to be there. But succeed. <br /> <br /> Freddy is mainly an exhibition narrator. He monitors the activities of people who live in the real world, sometimes participating in some way. Just as other anthologies show, like Tales from a crypt, it is a twist with a supernatural or surprising end. <br /> <br /> No action, but believe or not: violence sometimes goes beyond film. This show lasted a couple of seasons and was done during the fourth film. I heard it was canceled because of protesting parents. I watched a lot of R, which became a child, so that his embarrassed parents had to destroy it all. 4 series movies came after the series, so it wasn't a complete loss.
