Here's another movie that doesn't really need much advice. It's a classic comedy, very funny and fun, and of course, inspired a successful TV series that many would say would be even better (I personally like it). For some, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau find it difficult to warm up when Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, when they were watched in TV shows, starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or vice versa). But what we have in both cases is four good actors who, in real life, seemed as much as their film colleges so they managed to make these testimonials themselves. This is Neil Simon's humorous material that is key and where laughter comes from. who has been thrown out by a 12-year-old husband for his long-term husband and settled in his sloppy and totally irresponsible friend (Matthau) manhattan apartment. Meeting these two unlikely roommates inside the same four walls makes for some funny conditions.
