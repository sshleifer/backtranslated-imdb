it was one of the most funny and informative exhibitions I've ever seen. It's a must see for anyone over the age of 16. This exhibition was loud for me and my 2 boys from the beginning. I don't know if everything was true at the show, but the way it was presented leaves no doubt that Mr. Wuhl was not only very aware but also had an explosion that provided this information to very happy college children who were present. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to redo this form, they will have to rent a building in the Georgian province to keep all the people who want to see it. I agree with the idea of ​​making it into the HBO series. That would be amazing next
