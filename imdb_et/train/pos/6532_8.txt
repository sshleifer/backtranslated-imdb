I think it's part of the reason for making a movie ... and it's aimed at players who actually play all Nancy Drew PC games. There have been a lot of movies recently on video games and I think it's one of them. <br /> <br /> So this movie doesn't follow any books. But it follows the games. I'll buy and play every Nancy Drew game as soon as it comes out. And the games come from HerInteractive and are meant for "girls who are not afraid of the mouse!" And some of these games actually won the older gold medal. Not only are they fun, they are actually something or two while playing. <br /> <br /> I took two of my baby steps with me to see it and they loved it! 10 years. The old one had started playing his first Nancy Drew game before the day I took him to the movie, and he was so fun to play when I thought he would also enjoy the movie. And I was right ... he not only loved this movie but couldn't wait to get home to finish his first game and start another. <br /> <br /> My second step daughter is only 7 and she also loved the movie but she is still too young to play games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister at times to see what's going on. <br /> <br /> Games are based on children aged 10 years and older. All games usually get a real descent overview and are classified as adventure games. For more information about games, just look at HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So I personally thought the movie was pretty good and I'll buy it from the DVD.
