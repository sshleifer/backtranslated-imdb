It's nervous that the beaches have never been. As much as I wanted to love the Beaches, it seemed to me too fast to "feel" it (its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums). In contrast, Stella moves slower (and from time to time too slowly), and although it is somewhat manipulative of her tear-making self-sacrifice story, it works because Bette and the rest of the cast ring are great performances. 10/10
