As a native of Bolton, this film is obvious to me. Location images are fascinating and show a great deal of Bolton's transition - there are numerous scenes of obvious omission, but it shows the city rebuilding - and the idea that the old must make a new path is right in the heart of this film. Somewhat uneven James Mason leads a pleasant ensemble story about herring, which spirals form a perfect generation conflict, then a pleasantly schmaltzy resolution. Although I am a bit too young to remember it completely, the specialty of Lancashire's life in the 1960s is all: on Friday, songs on piano, Sunday's constitutional, good neighborliness, fear of terror, massive self-esteem, and I was pleased to see that Naughton's more fun lines remained intact. There is no doubt that this movie should be available on DVD - it is well designed and most of the performances are well realized.
