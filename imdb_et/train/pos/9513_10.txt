The Great Gangster Movie.Sam Mendes has directed this beautiful film showing the adultery of the other sons. Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan )'s leading grandiose constellation has done a terrible job. acting also for Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Reconciliation is just too good. The plot is pretty good. You enjoy the movie. A great image of a 1930s gangster. as the genius of all the gangsters of this era. Soundtrack is very good for the movie. An excellent flick that shows what your father is doing to protect his son.
