This show is beautifully done. When it first came out, it is nothing more than a family-friendly comedy with a slight heart, with very few good liners. It seems that many families really did well, but the different concepts of both the parent and the child, as I said, no longer thought of it, good viewing in the evening. But my view was shot out of another window as the fantastically funny tragic death of John Ritter gathered. The program set it on the ground and really recognized the lives of the characters in a very sensitive way, which also touched everyone at John Ritter's admiration, a fantastic actor who has something to do. When the exhibition sparked after Ritter's passing, I just wanted to hug my father and let him know how much he thought of me. I thought it seemed to throw three children, especially Bridget's character, talented talents who were worried about the last words he told him. It reminded me that no matter what terrible things I say to my father, I don't mean them, and it's very important that he knows it. Great exhibition
