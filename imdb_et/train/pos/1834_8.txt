This is a movie that is very touching. I don't care what people say about this movie, it's a very good movie. The role of Amitabh Bachchan is great for the dead father because he wants to teach his son how to cope with life when something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was the role of his corrupted Aditya Thakuri. The role played by Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was excellent. Priyanka Chopra had a small role in the film as good. Ragpal Yadavil is a brain-dead servant and Boman Irani as an actor-father-right, has a very good connection and the comedy scene was fun. The direction is very good.
