This movie surprised me! Never heard of Gackti Hydest that I didn't expect much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was that someone mentioned that the movie contained some John Woo-style scenes! Normally I am very careful when it is claimed! On this day, there is only one John Woo and the drop hasn't been one of the directors who are close to their brilliance when it comes to action! The fact that "Moon Child" owns a vampire convinced me even more! How are you bugging vampires! Looks promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this movie was that the pace was slow! It takes time to bring the mood! This movie contains some nice Hong Kong style action scenes! But the "Child of the Moon" is not an action movie! It's a friendship and drama of loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship! Pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job and are very believable as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A couple of times the film seems to have missed a couple of years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! Example: If one gang member dies (a very dramatic moment), Alexander Wang Kei (Hyde) sees blood from one attacker! Without warning and unexplained, the film leaves nine nine years and most friends are no longer together! Even without the right reason, the Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) must kill each other! I know it will be done to add some serious drama! It is very effective because of the participants, but sometimes it seems forced! In addition to the film's flaws, this film has an atmosphere and slipperyness that makes this movie unattractive! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But it's just! Overall experience is cordial and sincere!
