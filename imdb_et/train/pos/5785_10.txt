When reading the comments left for this exhibition, I could not point out that a large part of the reviewers had not actually seen any episodes of the exhibition either at all times or according to their free will. Kerching thing! that is, it is an exhibition of children, so obviously for kids as your parent seems to be cheese, forced and probably stupid. I even found one person who says the kits were stupid, but I remember that an eight-year-old would know why Taj had an icea cube on his wall, and I wondered if my parents would let me stay (they weren't). Yes, it may be annoying, it may be better to work, and some characters do very strange things with their hair, but if the kids show, I appreciate it for 10/10. Compared to what they are putting into the air today, you can simply say that I want it to be re-inspired. Anyone on a DVD?
