I'm so upset that ABC is giving up another show that has the chance to be a real winner. This exhibition is so good that writing and storyline were a great, real original idea to show, not another boring reality. Casting was remarkable! Signs and actors were not only right, but they were very talented participants. The concept and idea are really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this idea of ​​"connections". I really love Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, no one is connected to the fact that I didn't like it, even those who were just a few episodes (like Sheri Appleby). Actors and characters are so easy to enjoy and talented !! I would like ABC to show more, and did not interrupt the show in the middle, nor was it advertised enough. Really unfair !! for everyone !!. This exhibition showed a great promise. For one, I promise ABC how I feel and send emails to keep this exhibition alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way, where is episode 13? I want this last show!). Please support this example and send email to ABC, we can do it! This exhibition is worth it!
