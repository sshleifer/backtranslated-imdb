When Grinch came out, I was excited, though I thought it was a happy movie that was happy. Although he had a little nightmare before Christmas, he touched it. You know it's dark and spooky. I loved this movie because it helped people get Christmas. This is how Grinch mostly escaped Christmas. And what happened well in Whoville, they say, that Grinch's small heart grew three in the day. GOOD GRINCHMAS!
