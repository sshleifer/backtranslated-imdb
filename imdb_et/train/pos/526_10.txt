If someone asks if the cinema is an art form, you can do it worse than show it on this film. <br /> <br /> It's just the perfect combination of story, script, actors and cinematography that are ever dedicated to celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a deadly bomber pilot who is not able to receive English mist during World War II, and his subsequent brushes with heavenly power (or his head) are played with the panache of David Niven and Kim Hunter, incredibly touching - Especially in scenes that open when a killed pilot (Niven) describes his difficulties in front of a terrestrial radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> Jack Cardiff's high-profile photography and incredible production models. <br /> <br /> The highest touches come to heaven, appearing on Technicolor's black and white and terrestrial scenes - even mentioned by the heavenly conductor (fantastic Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> Not only the high point of the British cinema, but the cinema, period.
