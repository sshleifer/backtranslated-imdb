Although this series only ran during the season, it has been with me for 20 years. It was by far my favorite movie of all time. I'd give almost everything to get it on a DVD or in any format. If you find the options for seeing this series, I suggest you take full advantage of it. This series was the first (in my opinion) to have a truly unified story that included several episodes. It also made me really care about their characters and between them. Heck the sign Goose actually scared me sometimes. He was strange at that time. The leader of the group also reminds me of the combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has the opportunity to contact the creator / owner of the series and put them on the DVD, do it anyway !!!
