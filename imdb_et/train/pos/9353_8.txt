REIGN OVER ME (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen, Paula Newsome. Occasionally, sometimes dramatic dramatic influences on a depressed man who lost his family on September 11 (Sandler in his best role after "Punch-Drunk Love") who crushes himself again with his old college roommate and friend (Cheadle continues to impress every role so far ), a well-functioning dentist who seems to have it all? family, wealth, happiness? but really sees the ally in freedom by offering the personal life of his satisfied friend. Binder wrote and directed the director (who marks Sandler's former best friend and actor) with the equal parts of humor and the real heartbreak that the film works best when two stars divide the screen until the last act comes in almost a film-of-week sprinkling to solve the solution to handy questions .
