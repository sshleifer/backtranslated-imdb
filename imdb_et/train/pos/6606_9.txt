Hollywood Time to Sit and Note! When actors act to hit, you only have to do the animators who worked with this little miracle. The Renaissance is probably the first animation to forget that you don't see people. Although cast voice commands (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) are some of the best I've ever heard, even the emotions depicted by the "caricatures" are sensitive. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not very new, but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a lively painting. Ironically, such technical sorcery makes you forget that it is actually a very nice movie. Stimulation and plot development are wonderful and dialogues crisp. <br /> <br /> Plot: The disappearance of a Mega corporation's top employee covers the story of fraud and corruption with a cold-hearted hero. You can't say much without giving it all ... except that while the film keeps you at your seat, the climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> A must watch ... adults laughing "cartoons"
