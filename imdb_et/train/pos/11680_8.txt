OK Clara Bow quietly film in 1927, this is a spin-off Rain, with Bow playing half-Hawaiian wild daughter in a local pineapple king who falls in love with staid English engineer - Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for her attention, but both women get a big surprise when her wife appears (Patricia Dupont). The predatory woman is ready to divorce until she discovers that she may be on the edge of the fortune. Bow shoots his hash quickly. <br /> <br /> Vibula has a personality to save and has some great scenes: her opening naked bath, her scar grass in her skirt and dog rescue with Bow and Brook who are doing their own tricks. <br /> <br /> Note: The IMDb credit list is invalid. Movie credits (from DVD) include Patricia Dupont, who plays Mrs Haldane --- not Margaret Truax, as listed in IMDb.
