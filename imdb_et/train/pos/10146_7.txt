As we all know, there is a romantic comedy genre whose ending is already known. Both drivers must always come together. In the third window late I tried to figure out how it goes together and how they come together. There was a hint from the start, but it can never be understood. It's a simple hook, but it works. It had to be a normal land for you, but always takes a fresh spin. I liked all the NY characters and I loved the locations. This is NY postcard. It was also nice to watch the movie and found nothing offensive in it. So, if you like a good old fashion romantic movie ... then that's for you.
