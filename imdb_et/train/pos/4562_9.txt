You saw this movie yesterday on DVD and saw it terribly and slipped. The unaffected action of DDL blew my mind and I was amazed at the cast and its excellent example. All the characters were so authentic that I really took DDL to Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for her mother. Go and see it! You cry out your heart, but you experience a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches you one important lesson: determination is all. You may be exhausting in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but if you're strong enough, you won't have any problems at all. If you can use your left foot only if you are good enough to be a painter or writer. The worst thing you can mentally challenge is giving yourself a disease. It won't get you anywhere and the only person who will harm you.
