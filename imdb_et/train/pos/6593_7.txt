I've been watching this movie twice and I think it's pretty good for the limited equipment used to create this movie. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory of South American colonial migration of Colombian Indians to Polynesian islands with large balsa disabilities. This documentary follows Dr Heyerdahl and the team when they choose Equides balsa trees and swim with them down to the Pacific. They start with a 101-day sea adventure, testing the strength of their primitive raft, surviving only by the means available to the indigenous people of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
