The adaptation of the Pearl S. Buck movie is certainly classic. A true Hollywood epic is all about a great Hollywood movie: Birth, Death, Happiness, Sadness, Joy, Despair, etc. There is only one thing for me. I know it was a sign of time, but neither of these major characters has played Asian players. Paul Muni was a great actor and he does amazing work like the Chinese farm owner Wang Lung. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She doesn't even see Chinese! I think he was trying to get this role, but they should have Anna May Wong. I know why they didn't, and Mrs Rainier is very good at the movie, but they hardly tried to make her look "authentic". Stillm is a great movie, especially if you read a book (I did in high school decades ago). He must see, just look over the casting. I think you can.
