Everyone should see this movie, because each of us is broken in some way and it can help us understand 1) My life is not as bad as I thought it was and 2) the importance of having the necessary child. There's so much. To think that the film is based on a real person, we were deeply thinking about life and how the world is and always is. Corruption, but corruption doesn't have to get home. We all have a choice! We definitely recommend it ... and if you're at it, I'd like to throw TD Jakes 'Color Purple' and 'Woman, You're Open'. <br /> <br /> These are all movies based on life and giving us an overview of life.
