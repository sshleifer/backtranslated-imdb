I've been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years and it was so glad I was able to see a man at work, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The splendid yard of a ship in Bangladesh, a stone quarry in Vermont, China's enormous assembly factory, the beautiful old neighborhoods in Shanghai waiting to be demolished: the photographer and landscapes are so well off. filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought about old TV documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic molds; the stuff I watched. Burtynsky's works are of great value when he points out how industrial activity has shifted to Asia, it has not stopped. The strangest scene for me was the computer yard somewhere in China - the waste had a threatening air, while the workers were very distinctive.
