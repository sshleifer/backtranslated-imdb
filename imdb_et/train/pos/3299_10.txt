A great movie that needs a taste. When you start acting, movies and hate serious love stories are not for you. Otherwise, if you want to sit down for a good intelligent movie now and again, I highly recommend it. Just the best film of this century, produced in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> The only Indian film I would give would be Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then, this masterpiece comes second.
