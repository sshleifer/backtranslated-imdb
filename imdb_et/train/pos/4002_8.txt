At the beginning of the film, we look at Mayi and Dance to prepare for their trip to London to visit their grown-up children. You can see that Toots is not the best for health, but he goes by. When he suddenly dies, the world of May will spin out. <br /> <br /> A film by Roger Michell, based on Hanif Kureshi's screen, is a study of how this mother's figure reaches her new status in life and her awakening to a world she doesn't even know existed so far. <br /> <br /> May's life as a suburban woman was probably boring. Obviously his sexual life was something beside him. We know he has a short extra marriage, then there's nothing. When May loses his wife, he can't go home so he stays behind his granddaughter at his daughter's home. It is in an environment that begins after the daughter's casual lover, young and hunky Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren wakes up in May with a passion he never knew. Can be answered by turning yourself in front of the eyes. May, who is clever at the beginning of the film, suddenly begins to dress up, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. He reaches the heels with falling heads with the young man who holds him with passion he never knew. <br /> <br /> Having known a few cases, I was not surprised to see May's reaction. His chance to get a normal relationship with Bruce, a widow, comes to frustration, who understands how big his sex with Darren is. The younger man we are seeing is only in this matter to satisfy ourselves and the opportunity to squeeze out money. Finally, daughter Helen discovers what her mother has done behind her when she discovers her mother's erotic paintings. <br /> <br /> The film is the director's triumph. Anne Reidis has found an extraordinary actress who brings with her as much role as May. Daniel Craig is also amazing. He knows how Darren reacts. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also vital to this story because she is the one who has to answer her for what is behind her. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small part, like Bruce's older man in Helen's class, and is quite effective. <br /> <br /> The film is satisfactory for those who see it openly. <br /> <br />
