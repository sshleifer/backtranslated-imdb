It's an interesting little flick that was made in 1967 with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that makes you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun. I saw many similarities between this and "Creature with the Blue Hand" (AKA Bloody Dead) and have the same director! Scotland's yard is best explored by murders of young ladies in college. It seems that criminals are released from the local prison to make an evil person offer and then return when their work is done. In the Bible, there is a nice device that sprays the acid, and there is another device that is neither naive nor secret, it looks like a big pistol gun and the victim has to be soaked before they expire. Joachim Fuchsberger plays the inspector and mostly looks at the rubber and looks at the distance. There is a "monk" and the way somebody identifies this thing as "monk" is beyond me, it carries a whip and dresses with a red hood with a red tint, more with a clan member that is of a different color than a monk. There are all kinds of nice devices, such as a fireplace burning that goes up and down to admit a monk, and it goes over the fire without turning off his knight. This is a strange combination of a criminal drama with toilets, and while it's sometimes stupid, it's fun to watch. 7 out of ten, not bad.
