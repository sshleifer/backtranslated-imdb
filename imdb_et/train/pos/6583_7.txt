This is a special Sherlock movie, but we find Holmes who loves a servant to kiss, cry and even rob. This time, with the episode «Scandal in Boheme» with Irene Adler, the only thing that Holmes is in love with is. Top-class Brett performance, along with Peter Cushing, is the best Sherlock TV, while the cinema is forever the Basil Rathbone. Brett performs with resolutive, strong and fast.

Hardy, who today is a member of Cornelius Fudge's role in Harry Potter, has a forty-year career and several successes, such as the 10th Kingdoms and Winston Churchill's official actor.
