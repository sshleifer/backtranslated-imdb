When I found this movie in my local video, I expected it to be another cheerful American vampire movie in the same "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise, "To Die for" is really a good movie. It's a little bit cozy, but still has enough stylish pieces and surprises to match the vampire enthusiasts. It's a perfect mix of romance and horror, and it's sometimes surprising.
