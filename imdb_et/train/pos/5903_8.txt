I liked this movie sort of reminded of my marriage. It is very clean you see with your family. Very well done. The songs are also OK. I think the writer's director is great. The film shows how marriages run over time. They have couples at different stages of their lives, and the relationships in their lives represent a fairly similar phase of the film. Some dialogues are pretty good. The film depicts complicated human emotions, not very dramatized. It also shows perfect is not so perfect. Shows the very well-organized marriage dynamics when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
