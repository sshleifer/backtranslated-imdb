"This is not a love song" is a brilliant example of the genre of chasing, which many people have meaning. Love between the two main characters can be more than brotherly. I believe Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see it. <br /> <br /> I feel it is depicted with scenes like stroke and letter writing sequences. Heaton shows great proximity to Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he writes Spike's name at the top of his letters very carefully. <br /> <br /> One thing I've noticed when looking at an external review is that when the film is slipped, the observer hasn't fully understood the film because they haven't even mentioned the possibility that Heaton has sexual feelings for Spike. I also feel that some reviewers have not recognized this when they use phrases such as "Who is Heaton? What does he do like Spike?" However, this person can hit his head with a note. Spike shows noticeable signs of A.D.D, although I don't think this person has understood it because it seems to use the word "retard" as a deviating term. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not a weak heart. The film is extremely characteristic, there is not much after the shooting until the end, but the dialogue between two anti-heroes. If you are not used to watching such deep, sharp movies, stay far away.
