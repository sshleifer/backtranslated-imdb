All dogs that go to heaven are playing the dog's underworld. The film is a joy for children with a comic and dark but satisfying and happy story with lots of songs and dancing. It has an outstanding Charlie, a fellow countryman who has been killed, but who is dead. He meets a homeless girl who looks at her and through this relationship she understands the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation that I love very much in my eyes as a child. I would highly recommend this movie to children. I'm not sure how adults respond to it. (I tried to watch it in VHS a few years ago, but these recordings won't last long, will I?)
