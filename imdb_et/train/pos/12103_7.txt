I've never seen Barbara Steele's movie that I didn't like, and I've always been a strange story of a good ghost house (especially for wonderful pictures like "The Hell House" legend and "The Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill"), so I had the feeling that "Blood Castle" would be at my alley. And boy, was it ever! This French-Italian co-production, though not classic, which Steele's first horror film, "Black Sunday" remains, is still an extremely obvious and chilling entry into the spook genre. The black-and-white filmed manages to transmit a truly horrible miasma. The film concerns a journalist who contributes to one of Lord Blackwood's and Edgar Allen Poe's author, that he can spend the night at Blackwood Castle all day of the holidays, when the spirit of the castle's deaths restores its destiny. The viewer sees these deaths and they are usually very terrible. The movie really sends the backbone of the viewer and the uncut DVD that I just watched - thanks to fine people at Synapse - is even a surprising topless scene and some light lesbianism! And Barbara is great in this movie; the beauty on the other side is good for a sympathetic woman. His mere presence makes the terrible ghost story truly memorable. Nothing has called her "King of Dread".
