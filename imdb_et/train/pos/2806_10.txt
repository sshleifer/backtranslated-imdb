Okay, first I hate commenting on this thing, but I felt like I had to stand for this movie. So many people got into it and I felt like people who would like to see another opinion. <br /> <br /> First of all, Bend It as Beckham is not meant to be the deepest film of the century. If that's what you're looking for, it'll go elsewhere. Just because it is an independent film does not mean that it has to be artistic. It should make you feel good and you should look at it and these two things are at hand. <br /> <br /> Second, although not "Halle Berry Monster's Ballis", it's still good. The film does not have to work so honestly not. This is a family movie. If that's what you wanted, you shouldn't look at this movie honestly or even. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's really a lovely story. I think it's well thought out and it's fun to watch. For this culture, it is also very true to life, so if you want to sit and watch a movie you can enjoy and feel good when you're done. If you are looking for something with deep thinking lines and great dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
