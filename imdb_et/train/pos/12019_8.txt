I've seen this movie not long ago from Sky Cinema. I have to admit that it was a really good West with 2 big names. On the one hand, Charlton Heston, who plays the notorious and retired lawyer Samuel Burgade. On the other hand, Late James Coburn plays a fearsome Zach Provot .. in search of revenge on Burgade, no matter what the price ..! <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie was that there were really good signs. Most of the participants did it really well. Especially James Coburn, whom I think he really meant in this film. But it was .. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, I've been seen everywhere in other movies .. Playing Hal Brickman .. I felt that his character was cold, but he managed to beat himself with Burgade to reduce Provo posse! <br /> <br All in all, it was a great movie. Very good look. Excellent grade from the late Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> Great western man. 8 out of 10.
