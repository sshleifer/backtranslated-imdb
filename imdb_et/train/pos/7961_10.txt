"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of the wonderful old movies in the house of pets. It deserves its genre and even the cinema among the amazing films of the world with other animal films like "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". That means it's more than just a pet movie. <br /> <br /> Is it just a "remake"? It's too good to be a "remake"! I know it one by one because during my early teen years (when I was 12). It is emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, fun, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, cordial and sometimes dramatic. This is one of those films that smiles on the faces of those films that appreciate this type of film. It has a well thought out story, enjoyable characters, a wonderful and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling Sierra mountain decorations / landscapes (Oregon). Not all hills are talking about forests: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... ultimately all the pure wonders of nature - a truly complete panorama. The main human characters are nice, well-developed and well represented by the respective actors. Robert Hays is fantastic as a friendly father, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is the usual youngest and cute brother of Jamie (his appearance reminds me very much of Kevin Corcoran's "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is great as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our quadruple, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is a loyal, smart, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old golden retriever (Don Ameche's great voice). The opportunity, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, fun and loves to play (provided by talented Michael J. Fox). The opportunity just can't stand. Sassy is an image of cats: elegant, independent, very self-confident and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude, but the charm of certain cats. Sassy is the seal point for the Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Sassy is expressed by Sally Field, who also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are by nature big "actors": Ben as a shadow, Rattler as an opportunity and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie, but classic. This is clearly lower. <br /> <br /> It should definitely be in the Top 250.
