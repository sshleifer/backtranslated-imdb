A great movie that is quite complicated than really fun. Unfortunately, there are no memorable bids here, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: If you leave someone you love, you have to say what I'm telling you now: "Goodbye, I'm going." But disappear to hide like a criminal, it's zero. (don't look at it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is all about it. There are so many tactics in the relationship between Alexandre and others, but everyone misses a little more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more if Alexandre's experience is. The common interpretation is that the film only criticizes the possibility of "liberated love", depicting unwanted consequences for those involved. Indeed, it shows this convincingly, but I would appreciate if the reasons were treated a little more thoroughly: it is not that the liberated love is in itself condemned, but people (especially men, I think) should work with themselves and try to overcome the prevailing morals before and after. not through liberated love. <br /> <br /> That means the movie is realistic though and really worth watching.
