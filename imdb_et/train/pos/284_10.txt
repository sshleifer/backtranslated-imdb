The only season that has just inspired Australia and I thought it was brilliant! I love it! all the story is so good! it is a much more realistic view of teenagers and family life. however, it still kept strong family values ​​so that they would come into contact with each other and be there. their problems were real and really pulled you to the show. The exhibition is mainly about the family called "Days" and their lives. The family consisted of Abby's day (mother), Jack Day (father), Natalie's day (athletic daughter), Cooper Day (son of a foreign artist), and Nathan Day (son of a boyfriend). Every episode of the day in your life, with schools perspective things all over it. I loved Cooper that his exhibition through the show was just great. he was my favorite. it ended with so many things that could have been continued, I'm really sad for another season. it was a great show that I miss to miss.
