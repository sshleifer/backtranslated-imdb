1989-comedy for classic K-9, Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to the fight against crime, but this time they are with another detective [Christine Tucci] and his partner. Doberman named Zues, who doesn't get well with Jerry Lee. Dooley will not reach his new partner either. It all changes when the movie goes. The film is intense because he is a man who really wants to kill Dooley the way he treated him before. There are some dramatic scenes that deal with Dooley's wife's death, which does not seem like a film's tone, because the rest of the movie is sequences of action, dog jokes, jokes and jokes about biting dogs in a particular area. I know it looks very low humor, but some of it is very funny. I didn't see this movie for jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I'm a big fan of James Belush and the other for action stages. James Belushi is more fun when he was in K-9 and the actions are better. It would have been nice to see more signs of K-9 return, but it's still a fun movie. If you're a fan of James Belush, you love this movie.
