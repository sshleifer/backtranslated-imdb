<br /> <br /> With the New York Boxer, the young man with BABY FACE will start loving the sweet floors of his large floors methodically. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential precursor drama. Without correctness or regret, he peacefully manipulates the man who is unhappy to find his way. Wonderful actor, Stanwyck is here to have the chance to showcase his great talents. <br /> <br /> George Brent is a fairly late story because it is one of the companions who may be able to handle Stanwyck; his sophisticated style works beautifully against his icy behavior. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker represent his unfortunate victims in succession. <br /> <br /> John Wayne will only appear in a few seconds as Stanwycki's affective judge. It would be the only time these two performers appeared together on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speaker and Charles Sellon & Edward Van Sloan as bank governors - all outstanding. <Br /> <br /> The music that has been heard on the entire soundtrack of the movie, perfectly capturing the plot, is Benny Davis & Harry Akst and St. Louis Blues (1914), W.C. Comfortable. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is a model for precursors. Honestly & unapologetic dealing with sex, it's just such a movie whose implementation of Production Code 1934 was meant to be eliminated.
