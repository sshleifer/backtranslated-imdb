After an anonymous speech from a space launcher that would have fallen into the frozen wood, two police officers find the event really happened, and apparently one of the Martians was gone from the scene. They drive to the nearby Hi-Way caf√© and find that the bus stop is stopped and seven passengers are waiting for the snowy bridge to reopen. But the driver says he only had six passengers on the bus. During the interrogation of the passengers, strange things happen when the lights turn on and off and the rotating plate switches on and off. When passengers are released and the bus is traveling, one traveler returns to the canteen and discloses a land intrusion plot. <br /> <br /> "Are you a real Martian?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. The intriguing story is ironic and clever dialogues, funny characters and situations, and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point to the end. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("Mars")
