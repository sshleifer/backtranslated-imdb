"DÃ´u desu ka den" is the first color film by champion Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly it is not a samurai, a ronine, a warlord or a battlefield. It is located in a slum in Tokyo in a very poor community, where the inhabitants are homeless drunkards, beggars, trampolines, abused women, losers. I don't know why Kurosawa chose this tragic topic and the environment to put colors on, but indeed they are very sad stories, some of which are heartbreaking. Personally, I like the story of a shop and his father who dream about their house and the house they have built; a story about a broke boy who believes he is piloting a train; a story of a man who raises five children as if they were their sons and daughters; and the story of a young woman abused by her father. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden O Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskade's Life Way")
