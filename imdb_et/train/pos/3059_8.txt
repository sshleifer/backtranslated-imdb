Henry Brommel, a writer / director, has done an excellent job with his film "Panic" since 2000 and includes his choices: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain David Dorfman. Brommel has given Ullman and Ritter their decisive forgetting roles, and turning out is a welcome change from what we usually see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" is the story of a man, Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his real profession by doing mail order work; He and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family according to all appearances. Satisfied with his life, Alex is looking for a psychiatrist (Ritter), speaking only to his mother (Bain). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell), whom he is immediately attracted to, which makes his situation even more difficult. Her mother breaks her promise and tells her father about a psychiatrist. When Alex gets his next job, he discovers that he has to kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is a deep story of a gentle, good man made to kill his father's monster with his mother's mother. Knowledge that kills your father but can't stand and give up. His rage is so profound that he has lost his emotional attachment to almost everything and everything except his son - and this is finally his son who awakens him from almost lifelong repression. If "Panic" is the time to move, then - quickly. <br /> <br /> "Panic" doesn't seem to panic at all. In fact, it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly not because it is badly done - slowness is deliberate, reflecting Alex's own psyche that slowly slips out of the mist. Judging by the character of Sara, Campbell and her brand, her psychiatrist as a living, breathing human being, Alex starts to make connections between her and who she is and how they do not jive. And the difference between the two can lead to the disappearance of another psyche, Sammy. <br /> <br /> William Macy has another great performance as a loving father, a distant man and a cold killer, a two-child kid with monsters who have never felt grace for their feelings or desires, a man who finally realizes that he must step on the plate or repeat the cycle. <br /> <br /> This is not a drama that plays well in the cinema. It is too adult, too small, too fine, too characteristic and too good.
