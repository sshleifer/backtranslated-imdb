It's an amazing movie since 1936. Although the first lesson is not very interesting (for today's viewer), the 2036 stylish vision that follows it will compensate. But don't plan to understand the whole dialogue - sound quality and accents (that is American - but America's 1930s) makes it difficult. <br /> <br /> In principle, the story is extensive for 100 years, see the fictional US city of Everytown. It dates back to 1936, when the war is on the horizon, until 2036, when technology jumps forward and creates its own problems. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a bit slow - although it's hard to tell which audiences you would have thought of. Events, intercourse and visuals are quite a few keys today. But when it comes to the future, it's just fun to watch. All the great kits and the retro sci-fi look are hard to beat. <br /> <br /> If you don't have much listening power, it's hard to listen to this movie. I think I only understood 80% of the dialogue. It can use closed captions. <br /> <br /> If you are a sci-fi fan, this is one of the genres of the genre and must be visible (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until you have a closed caption version and watch it when you're happy with the movies of that time period.
