This movie has it all. Emotion, power, affection, divine naked beach dance by Stephane Rideau ... It has a need for true inner fellowship and external communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who are gay, that doesn't mean that no one is useful enough. I will probably classify it as a homosexual film, but by heterosexual people, as well as by homosexual and bisexual people, they can be appreciated and loved. Mathieu's inability to cope with his emotions reveals a way in which our society does not encourage us to act differently and creates a discrepancy between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must-have !!!!
