For any punk rocker, this is a movie that made The Ramones a household name in the early 1980s (when it first appeared in premium cable stations). It was one of the first and best American Punk Rock movies where the golden classic status was there with the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally, the producers wanted the stars to be good tricks, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" was just what made them superstars and too hot for a low budget movie. Good luck to Ramones, who was looking for an underground punk rock world and mainstream market (which unfortunately didn't happen until after the band ended). The band, especially Dee Dee, did not like the film during the 1980s, but fans loved and could hear most of the movie when they were waiting for Ramones to be shown. This movie, like most of the classics, is silly fun with some of the classic Ramones footage at their flowering times. Don't wait any more, you won't find it. It's a lot of fun, so enjoy it. Another classic film by Allan Arkush in a similar way is Get Crazy, featuring Lee's legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
