John Van Druten's Broadway hit brings the maximum starry power to this romantic fantasy of a modern witch who is making a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart can get the best bills, but it is Kim Novak, who steals the exhibition by one of the most attractive witches to spell on the screen. Lead bonding is actually one of the few weaknesses in the film: gray hair Stewart seems a bit old for the role and although it is easy to understand why it falls hard for Novaki, it is a little harder to see what it finds attractive to it because it looks like temperature and outlook inappropriate. (This is one story of the amusing perceptions that witches and warlocks have been portrayed as beatniks and bohemians of Greenwich Village.) Strangely, Stewart-Novak's tying in "Vertigos" would generate much more heat that appears in the same year as this movie, but then "Vertigo" there was an influential temporary story and the direction of Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Movie comics are mostly provided with letter-supported cast, including the young Jack Lemmon (like Kim's warlock brother), Elsa Lanchester (their perfect aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) as the engraved writer. Hermione Gingold even looks like a fun, like a kind of Grand Witch. There are many nice things in this movie - smart, romantic and big - that means you can take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak. I've seen the movie one and a half times and I can never do it.
