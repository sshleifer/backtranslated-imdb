Henri Verneuil represented the commercial market in France in 1960-1980. Verneuil was always sure to speak in the box and usually talks about dramatic and suspicious stories about casino robberies, mafia scores and World War II battles. He worked with his day's male choir: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time he led Yves Montand. This is a strange static film that takes place mainly in offices and conference rooms that do not contain any chase scene and hardly any violence. Montand gives a good result when it is somewhat dry and well supported by other participants. I couldn't think of what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story on the basis of Z (Lambrakis murder) and L'aveu (sturgeon Artur London torture in Czechoslovakia).
