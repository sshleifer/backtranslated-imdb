Some people say this is the best film China has ever published, I'm not particularly sure because I have some of my secrets in my heart. I say this is probably one of the most unique movies they or some other big or small, ever released studio. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of the wrongly made ferry has returned to the back to kill all those who wore him as well as all their spring. The grandson of one of the victims of the ghost, the current barge, comes to this mixture. He takes over the ferry construction because the ghost closes the man he loves. <br /> <br /> The dense fog is covered and set mainly on one of the swamps; the rhythms of dialogue, especially in early scenes, are their poetic cadence. Similarly, the camera is like a cadence when it moves back and forth across the sex if it were to cross over and across the door between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of the lesson of opera or oratorio or musical object more than the usual horror film. This is an amazing film artwork that is probably unique in film history. <br /> <br /> This is not a Lilly Guild. It is a low budget horror / mystery that tells you a clean story that keeps you entertained. His story of love and revenge is an important, not poetic, film-making, and it keeps you focused first and foremost (technical aspects that are simply window coverings.) If there is a real mistake, the cheapness of its production. The fog creates a mood, but it also hides the fact that this swamp is completely dry. Standing back and forth is fine for some time, but even after 58 minutes you want us to see something else. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong as I like the movie. This is a good little movie that I wanted somewhat less in poverty. Be sure to look at it when you come into contact with it.
