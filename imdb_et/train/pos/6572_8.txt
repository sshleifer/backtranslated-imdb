One of my favorite films for many years was "The Last Hero of Acts"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to break his fun by becoming a corrupt politician; so now I can't wear any movie he could have walked on. <br /> <br /> Jake Speed ​​Adventures are actually toys that have some themes similar to those of the latest ... heroes; so I was happy to find this on the DVD so I could look at these topics as well. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that during the civil war of the African people in the white slavery was "inside the plot," it is not a feature film. The plot that is "within the plot" is actually a question that the film has no intention of solving: is Jake Speed ​​a real person who helps the heroine save his sister from a white slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine has somehow reached the universe that actually exists only in the pulp novels)? I recommend that it is not clearly defined in the film and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are fully aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what kind of audience such a fictional "adventure story" may want from the universe. In fact, it is a rich subject, the potential difficulty of which is made easier by the film's friendly and campy sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The film has weaknesses - mostly cinematography, which makes the movie appear on TV. And this pace repeats. <br /> <br /> But I like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure they live in, but they are stupid. And I find an interesting idea that this adventure is actually in the novel. <br /> <br /> Keeps a multi-view all-m show!
