"Luzhin's Defense Minister" is a good film with fine central performances, but too many novels and not enough filmmaker's handicrafts are out. Most of the film felt that the characters helped push the story. Perhaps Marlene Gorris could have explored Luzhin's psyche instead of depicting her as a tortured innocent victim who was disrupted by other cruel motives. <br /> <br /> Customizing literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not go well enough in the relationship between Luzhini and Natalia. Natalia's mother breaks her mother's rather dirty disagreement as a dramatic flashpoint in the film. I felt that I was put through the torture and tragic end of Luzhin without the joy of let go of his unusual and complex personality. But it was a moving and enjoyable film, but certainly not great.
