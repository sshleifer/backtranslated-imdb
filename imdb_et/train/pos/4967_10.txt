This film is compulsory for all people who enjoy football as an art. What strikes first about this film at the World Cup is how it is filmed. In addition to the game, such as television broadcasts, there are large footage designed to track the individual players in the games. It brings out the emotions and situations that these men go through when they try to achieve honor. Today's television broadcasting style, which is as different as 1986, is even worse in terms of quality. <br /> <br /> Players are not the only stars. In the development of contemporary history, the focus is on the audience, the judges, the journalists on meetings and the environment. In this film you can see how all these factors play very clearly together. In this regard, today's television broadcasting style has not yet achieved this quality, although it is now much closer than before. <br /> <br /> There are a number of highlights: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # o ( Spain), Socrates (Brazil) and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This movie is not a summary of the best Mexican football in 1986, although most of them are well covered. For the whole film, the emphasis is on presenting several aspects of games and competitions, based on the progress of their players and teams, even when skipping games themselves. It makes this movie so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Due to the events of the Mexican 1986 judges, much of the commentary on this film and the world cup is extremely Maradona-biased. Much of these comments ignore the fact that the judge has two judges, that they are both human and players, and that all the above-mentioned acts make mistakes in one way or another. Football rules do not allow judges to make TV-based repetitions so that, in most cases, judges have to decide what they perceive. Therefore, judges play an active role in the development of the game. Their effects are seen in several parts of this film. <br /> <br /> Another film of the 1990 World Championship compared to this is just a bitter source of frustration. Much of this is due to the fact that it participated in the game too, while this film speaks things further, impartially.
