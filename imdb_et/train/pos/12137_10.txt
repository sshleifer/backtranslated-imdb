How amazing this movie is! I've seen it over and over again over the years, and I'm always against it. The reason why the film is so easy to see is, of course, the result of the arrest of young Bette Davis. Not only does he steal every scene he has, but is actually much nicer and better photographed (not to mention sexier) when he was in any movie he had ever done in his studio, Warner Brothers (this movie was RKO Radio Pictures) . She wears a very attractive make-up and has a very attractive hairstyle and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially in a restaurant in London, Soho). His body was as young as he was young. Get this burden cheap, which he will bear with his great explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And boy, he's an absolute force in this scene. Howard is a little too nervous, but he hits the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee appreciates it sweet, pretty young Sallyna, who really loves her. Max Steiner's score is both charming and amazing. Great performances and thirty flavors change the version of this classic novel.
