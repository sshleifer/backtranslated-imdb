Dumland focuses on one (American?) Family life ... Father; a violent and superstitious person who loves to use punishment and contempt and who has no redemptive qualities. Mother; who seems to be paranoid psychotic, never says much. Son; hidden tedious repetitive little companion. Animation is simple and crude, but does not offer stories and characters. Episodes were originally only available from davidlynch.com, but are now published on DVD. The DVD has 8 episodes and the following is a brief summary: <br /> <br /> 1 - Neighbor: We meet next door and we know three things about him - he has a really nice boat, he has only one hand and he likes to make dolls things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2 - Running Track: We find that the husband has an exercise, but the husband does not believe it is a good idea. After all, the training race is victorious. 3. Doctor: Dad has an unfortunate accident with a living wire ... a doctor's examination is quite thorough (if not unusual), but the diagnosis is "you're completely normal" (but we knew it). <br /> <br /> 4 - Friend Visits: After mixing with a new clothing lift, a friend must visit (believe it or not, he is one! but after we meet him, we understand why) tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5 - Get Stick: We meet another neighbor, he's sticking to his mouth (although we'll never know how it was there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from the mouth of your neighbor will be more difficult (and more violent) than expected ... but he has finally won ... Jesus may be grateful to some people !!! <br /> <br /> 6 - My teeth are bleeding: it was my favorite episode ... and was also the most pleasant repetitive and annoying (hmm, what does that tell me ??). Not sure why his son's teeth started bleeding, but believe me when I say it was minimal on the plot. What is oxymoron, because the story was not a plot. But did he have a funny ending (which included a flight) !! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After Uncle Bob's and Uncle's bob's husband's meeting, we get a clear feeling that the Dumbland gene fund is very low. Uncle Bob is a sick male (I'm not going to work that I don't break it for you). Uncle Bob's husband will certainly wear his family pants ... and his father will definitely come to the wrong side of his big fist (and spend the rest of his stay in the back of the tree). <br /> 8- Ants: After getting home in the ants and mistakenly mistakenly mistaken for spraying, it ... faces it spraying on the face with a mist spray and begins to hallucinate. The ants put a fabulous song and a dance show ... he's beating, trying to kill them, a full body of gypsum comes up ... and just lets say the ants are getting their revenge. As bad as these stories are, there is something that forced me to look at them. They give another insight into the idea of ​​their favorite leaders. David Lynch. Maybe they had an outlet for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts? I smiled loudly at many episodes. Many aspects are absurdly funny !!
