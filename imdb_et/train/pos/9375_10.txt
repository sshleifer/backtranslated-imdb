Before Nicholas Cage was a great actor, he was a great actor. This lesser known film is where Cage gives her best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-budget, almost unfamiliar movie, but it's one of my favorite films. I discovered that it was walking in the aisle of a video store and wanted to see that Cage and Hopper (who are also big in the movie) appear together. Go here, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
