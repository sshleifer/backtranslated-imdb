Often the comedy is labeled, The White In The White Suit is here and there much more than ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who doesn't get the chance to flourish his inventions in the world, because nobody pays him a message, but he's just an odd odd man at the place he was. After he went to the Birnley textile factory, he uses his laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that will never disappear but never need to be cleaned! First of all, he is declared a genius and those who initially ignored him suddenly want a big one, but then the infamous of the industry are attacking their heads and praise is rapidly becoming more frightening. <br /> <Yes, the movie is very funny, in fact, some scenes are funny, but it's a satirical edge for a film that raises it above normal. The contradictions with the emergence of technology are a very important issue here, do we want inventions that save us from the fortunes of industries to close down, just to see what happened to the British coal industry to find out what I am. Ten years when the film was made, it is important to note that the production of nuclear weapons became more than just a rumor, the advancement of science into new proportions. You look at this movie and see the rapid move of the main protagonist Stanley's events, from the hero to the enemy in one mistake, to the victim of his quest for the right humanity! It's so dark that the movie should be called The Man In The Black Costume. <br /> <br /> I can't find anything wrong with this movie honestly, today you can shoot a script by Roger MacDougall, John Dighton, and director Alex Mackendrick, and it wouldn't be like that in the mind of sharpness and thinking. Sound and setup are enormous, the direction is smooth and tonic shift is adroitly with Mackendrick. Some scenes are just wonderful, especially heartbeats that bring one of the scenes of David Lynch's Elephant Man about 29 years later, but after the fall of such an event, Alec Guinness succeeds as a genius to close the film to keep viewers not only Stanley's future but also the rest of us in this rapidly developing world. <br /> <br /> A timeless masterpiece, themed and artwork, 10/10.
