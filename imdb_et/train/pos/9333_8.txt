Ontario has lived all his life, and in the same city where Marlene Moore grew up, I've heard her parents, grandparents and family members. So when I found out that they were filming a movie about him and that my start was on my street and his house was very close to me, I was excited. <br /> <br /> When you read a book about Rock a Bye Baby about Marlene Moore, you get a pretty different picture of it than a person who was uncomfortably beautiful, who really had the chance to know her, except her his own family, who often abused him. child except one of his brothers. Also, if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you, you knew that he was really wounded before he even walked in the institute, he was always defensive, and what seems to be the unwillingness to learn in the school environment was actually embarrassing the fact that he could not. <br /> <br /> Marlene does not deserve the life she had given without the need for it. The government and the people around him helped his death if they did not try to understand his needs and why he did what he did. I still feel angry that he was imprisoned for self-defense by men who tried to rape him. As his brother once said, "They didn't know what to do with him so they locked him and killed him." I believe it with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in Marlene, you deserve so much.
