I loved this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Secondly, because it provides refreshing action on dealing with HIV news in a family with much less hysteria than what I usually see in movies. The brothers are very close but not judicial. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but ultimately it does not need it. I understand that Leo's choice of how to cope with his treatment may not be the most popular with people, but I believed it was the right choice for him. I can't believe it was a French television program. It had high production values. I gave this movie to ten, and I think even when you've seen it.
