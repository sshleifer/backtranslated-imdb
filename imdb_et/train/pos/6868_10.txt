I saw it in Detroit, which must be his original move. I literally drove the theater aisle. It was so funny. I haven't seen it, but it would be nice. Where can you get a copy? Anyone who says something about being dated or redundant is just a bunch of poseurs for my money. Every skit is either malicious, erotic or perverse fun. Everyone! Involved is not weak. For example, the order of opening that parodies 2001 contains gorilla go-go dancers with pendulum breasts. Felin would have filmed it as if it were an evil spirit ... If you come to this movie with an open mind and a gentle heart, then you draw it in your best lists.
