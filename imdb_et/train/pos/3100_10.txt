By the end of the first hour, my jaw was held comfortably between my legs. There's never a movie and I never think of it. It can be a mild activity, but it is an action. Once again, each cast member fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, chase scenes were feasible and the fight was incredible. Matt Damon is forever Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Everything I really have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and it is no exception. Action, stakes, plot. How they do, I never know. I praise the man who wrote this screen for all these films. Because if he hadn't done such a good job with the first movie, we shouldn't talk about it. <br /> <br /> So don't look at it in theaters, go to theaters. if it is still where you live, but if not December 11th, Bourne will get you home!
