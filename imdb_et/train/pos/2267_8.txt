I have not read the novel or anything else by Kurt Vonnegut, but now I am going to start. It grabs you from the first frame and won't let go until the final credits start running. Taking you to places that you do not expect, the plot is interesting all the time. Stimulation is on the ground, nothing goes on for too long, and makes it ideal for balancing unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we've seen. It's well-said and well thought out. I've never watched a movie I feel like I could compare it particularly. It's intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. The actor is great, Nolte shines, Goodman again proves he doesn't have to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are enchanting. I could go on, really ... no role is considered less than the result of the star. Editing and cinematography are wonderful and all visual images are excellent, a couple of unforgettable and amazing. I go through the books by other filmmakers, as directed by Keith Gordon, as well as two others. It has one scene of sexuality and a lot of disturbing and disturbing content. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates it; it is not pleasant. 8/10
