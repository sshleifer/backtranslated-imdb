I have to be honest. I looked at this example and enjoyed it because it was tough, offensive, fun and messy. Yes, there is a lot of humor for every taste. If you are in a humor that is, for example, dropping roller skates, you have a great time for that. <br /> <br /> Or, if you enjoy people in extreme tricks, you also have a great time. And if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations, you will enjoy this exhibition. <br /> <br /> I enjoy all three types of humor offered by "Dirty SÃ nchez". I like to laugh at play situations. "Jackass" is like walking in the park compared to it. So if you're tired of Jackass's typical American foolishness, try to show it English's extreme stupidity. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is an exhibition with little taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are easily offended or attacked. <br /> <br /> Now these guys have to see a psychologist. Specially for Paco sign.
