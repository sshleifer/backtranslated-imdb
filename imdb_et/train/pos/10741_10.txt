French Naudet's brothers did something no one did, had a day when this tragedy happened. They were in building no. 2, when you saw a paper drifting down, people who hit the ground jumping from that height. <br /> <br /> I mean, it goes as far as both buildings collapsed when they ran, the camera was still running, when the white dusts covered them, they found the doorway in the store and entered, but all this footage is real and i think they made it a great occupation for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Brother of Bethany, who filmed this extraordinary movie, which I watch every September 11, so I'll never forget what this country went through. I believe that, when I remember correctly, this is the first death of the priesthood of the firefighters when he was taken to church and to his honorable funeral.
