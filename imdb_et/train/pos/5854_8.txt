This game is fun and it has a plot you could see comics. The Spiderman has shaped a mysterious fraudster. The city is crossed with strange gas and the symbiosis, like Venom and Carnage, appear all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? He seems to have turned the new page around. The poison does not seem to be involved even when he has just noticed that Spider-man has probably paid him a fairly good photo opportunity. Well, the other heroes and later the many crooks, is Spidey's loose mystery. The struggles are fundamental, not difficult to accelerate, the battles with the bosses are quite fun. You can collect comics, run out of the web, and it's a bit more fun to drive around with the city. This is also a weak point. The rocking is not as big as everything you do is hover through the city, because Spider-man looks like his nets in the sky. You also don't have much room for maneuver, which is especially useful for the Spider-man 2 movie game. However, it forms a rather bad swing of other elements, especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage one of the wild activities.
