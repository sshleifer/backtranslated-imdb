The best way to describe Europe on my favorite movie list is the exclamation that came from a companion after the end of the movie: "I didn't know that movies could be done like that." It is completely original in visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It's as far from the "captain and coverage" of the shooting style as possible; perfectly integrating many images, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voices, performance, editing, lighting, etc. Despite the short-sightedness of Hollywood's "dialogue", there is no cinema about dialogue, nor about beautiful light, action, or music. It works best when all the elements are on an equal footing, where ONLY the CONCLUSION of the elements in the order or combination in which they are presented is conveyed by the idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element and the film has no meaning. "Europa" is what cinema should be.
