I was lucky enough to see a zero day last night. This is an amazing movie. It is very disturbing. <br /> <br /> In some ways, Zero Day is very similar to The Blair Witch Project. It's connected to the camera. It's about 2 children. Just your average kids. Andre and Calvin. They start the campaign there with an institution called "Army 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story has been talked about in Video Diary 2 for kids. It shows that there are also relationships between other parents, which show that they are just ordinary children, like the people we know or have come across. We find that the army of the last two missions gives the right to zero day. They're going to shoot there at college. <br /> <br /> You will see how they get into the weapons, how they plan, everything. They emphasize that they have not been influenced by the media at all and that there is no reason to do so. As I said, it is also in the form of a video diary, and then the tapes are stored in a visible storage compartment after the zero day. <br /> <br /> Actual shooting is shown through cameras captured throughout the school. . Cooling really. The film is very cool. Some of the things they say about how they prepare it, you have to look at it yourself. One quote I remember is the only time Calvin is himself. He says, "Andre thinks they are just leaving some escape car, doing it in many schools across the country. <br /> <br /> I probably haven't even given you the right idea for this movie. You have to see it yourself. It is now around festivals. <br /> <br /> A +.
