First of all, I would like to say that although I know part of the star wars, I am not a fanatic. I don't know how many chromosomes are Wamp Rat or TK427 extended family. what I know is: Star wars, all the movies (less so with episode 2), took something magical. It's hard to say what Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. this is the idea. <br /> <br /> How to ask? I'll explain. Star Wars concern the most universal stereotypes, good vs. evil. it does so so clearly, so deeply, that literally every person can understand every environment. Episode VI does this very well, ending with the epic struggle between the son and his used and manipulated father, but with the addition of prequels, there is more hinted at the recollection. maybe this is Darth Vader, and viewers understand that this is a story of Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3 years everything was amazing. it seemed realistic that the capsule had fallen into the sky on Lucas's lap, specifying the historical report of a distant galaxy. when I see them, especially this, I feel very small. I feel like I was pushed into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. I see them feeling when I see them, feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope for.
