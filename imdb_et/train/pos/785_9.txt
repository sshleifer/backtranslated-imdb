I am of Irish origin, loved this movie, not only was the man hot and funny, he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl she loved, she was beautiful. They were such a lovely couple. The end was so sad. Love this movie! Although it is a bit dirty, it resembles the British or Irish Prime version. If you liked this movie, you should watch it. The same story younger man falls on older women, older women fall to a young man. Many paths cross, eventually making the best decision or completing the task. There is nothing else to say, without destroying the whole movie, although I thought the French guy was ugly, less pleasant. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Friends Circle", this movie is so good. Quick quotation, you may not get if you look "well, it has ruined my dinner." LOL
