I think everyone has to come back at some point. And this embarrassing Taffi resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) is going to make The Times of Times. Yes, the man who went all crazy with "Good Morning, Vietnam" radio is playing football. In this case, he tries to play his high school prestigious game. But the former teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just that easy to go. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie for either person. But Williams and Russell are actually a good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you a command (at least). Look at it.
