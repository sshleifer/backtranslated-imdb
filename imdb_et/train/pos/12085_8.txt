Shirley MacLaine is another custom role. As an aunt of a mother of the 1962 Chicago Class neighborhood, the veteran character becomes an actor for another training, as a woman's wife, who does not let any setbacks hit her spirit of success. Children, a pre-teen boy and a girl, are pulling their enchanted aunt Zoe, although many of the magic tricks and practical jokes she has learned, which are at all wrong options, get them out of school. <br /> <br /> The plot is surrounded by the Cuban missile crisis, which has all the social consequences. Men build a bomb shelter, people watch news stories about what appeared to be the only TV set, in the dining area, and overall discomfort and fear in the air. If the "harmless" miracle is blown out of proportions, climate change will still make the viewer well. Yeah, Virginia, the sun's coming tomorrow! It is clear that this is a low-budget production, it is still a sweet little film full of the magic that Sunday matting was made of. With some of the "Oldies" choices, the efficient Sound Track is thrown away that the whole family enjoys it.
