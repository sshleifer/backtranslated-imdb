Well, if you are one of these Katana movie nuts (just like me), you will surely appreciate this metaphysical Katana swinging blood-spilling samurai action. <br /> <br /> Starring Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) & Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between the Heikki clan and the Genji clan touches the zenith on the final showdown of the Gojo Bridge. The body is countless. <br /> <br /> Demons, magical swords, Shinto priests and Buddhist monks, and the beautiful visions offered by maestro Sogo Ishii make the rest. <br /> <br /> Good Japanese rainy summer evening.
