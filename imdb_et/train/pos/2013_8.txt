In the first three films of Frank Sinatra, he had a purely specialty: apparently, he seems to be playing a song in another movie during the nightclub. In her fourth film, which is a very pleasant "Higher and Higher", Young Blue Eyes moves into a real career by playing a real role ... an easier task because she plays a fictional story that gives her the chance to crown some numbers. <br /> <br /> The entrance to Sinatra is quite funny. Michele Morgan hears knocking at the door and asks who is there. The hobby-tone voice is answered from outside the "Frank Sinatra". Of course ... <br /> <br /> "Higher and Higher" opening credits can confuse some viewers because the names of songwriters Rodgers and Hart are prominently displayed. In fact, they gave only one song to this music: "disgustingly rich", which was able to break it like a kind of intro for a completely different song "I'm a debutant". Interestingly, the song by Rodgers & Hart - one of the weakest - is probably the least enjoyable song in the score of this film; Several others are lively up-pace numbers, namely, "This is the most important thing," "If it's in love, you're alone" and "I saw you first". <br /> <br /> Sinatra is good at this movie, but she would do better work (and sing better material) elsewhere. The real advantages of "Higher and Higher" are the joyful circles of some rare films. Paul and Grace Hartman were an extremely popular spouse-dance team who played a number of Broadway revolutions: truly graceful dance dancers; they put a lot of physical comedy on their dance material. (Here, Grace strikes a big knock out of Paul's shoe.) Grace Hartman, who died of cancer at the age of 48, did almost no film, so it is a real pleasure that this film rarely gives us the chance to see her close, hear her beautiful sing the voice and notice how sexy she looks like her maid. After Grace Hartman's death, her husband had a long career as an actor, dancing directly in solo. (Or, with Ken Berry in one memorable "Mayberry RFD" episode.) <br /> <br /> Here too, the "higher" and "maid" uniforms are quite attractive teenage singer Marcy McGuire. Why didn't this talented girl give more movies? Maybe he was just a bit too similar to Betty Hutton. I enjoy Hutton's performances, but I like Marcy McGuire even better. Close to the "Higher and Higher" end, there is a little bit of physical entrepreneurship, with McGuire and Mary Wickes as rapporteurs, alternating between the board and the nightclub. The alternating steps of the short McGuire and the high gawky Wickes are fun! Unfortunately, although Leon Errol plays a big role in "Higher and Higher", he is given almost no comedy action: he never does his famous rubber football dance. Jack Haley, despite his outstanding settlement, has also been wasted. <br /> <br /> Dooley Wilson, who is inevitably reminded of "Casablanca," is very well represented here. In this movie, Wilson made his own song, but made a fake operation on his keyboard like "Time Goes By". (In real life, Wilson couldn't play the piano.) Here he sings "Higher and Higher" joyfully and gives other players some fun reactions. Less enjoyable is Mel Odious, I mean Mel Storm. Victor Borge rarely plays a film here, skilfully interacting with his dialogue, but never doing a keyboard comedy, which he did later in the performance. <br /> <br /> Plot? Forget it. "Higher and higher" is not an idea of ​​"great" music, but it is an enjoyable pleasure, and I appreciate it from 8 out of 10. Tim Whelan, who has worked both in the UK and in Hollywood, deserves much better recognition.
