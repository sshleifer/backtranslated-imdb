The eye in the maze is not your average Giallo ... and frankly I'm not quite sure it's really Giallo; but Giallo or not, despite some problems, it's definitely a very interesting little movie. I don't hesitate to call it Giallo because the movie doesn't contain most of the things that make the movies they have; but many genre lists break the form and it seems to be one of them. The film does not contain any brutal murder, as many Giallo do, but it is designed with a surreal atmosphere and a plot that is almost confusing to remain interesting. The plot seems easy enough because it focuses on a doctor who has been killed by Julie, his patient, who for some reason sees him as his lover and father and is offended by walking on him. Then we move a large house that is inhabited by many people, but nothing really seems to be because there are many secrets surrounding the different events that took place before Julie arrived ... <br /> <br /> The film seems to admit something about it how the mind is like a labyrinth. It never really comes, and I just preferred to sit down and enjoy what's going on, instead of worrying about what (if any) movie is trying. In the labyrinth of the eye is director Mario Caiano, director, who has been a great condemnation a few years earlier. He does not create the atmosphere in this film as he did before; but the surrealistic aspects of the story come well and the secret is always upwards, which stops the movie from boredom. Star of the movie Rosemary Dexter, who offers candy all over and also delivers good results. Most of the other pain is not really worth the exception, except for Adolfo Cel, who is a good cable offender and Alida Valli, who is remembered by a great number of great cult sticks. The film explains itself at the end; which is happy because i'm sure I'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused! In general, this may not be a classic thing; but it is good and good enough.
