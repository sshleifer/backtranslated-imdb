Yes, it is a class B horror. But at least the manufacturers, the leaders and the cast do not pretend that this flick is manna from heaven. The plot is horny, the psychotic killer of the serums who is on their way is sprayed with genetic acid, making it snow. The Snowman, who is Jack Frost, then goes to murder to find the sheriff of a small town who was finally arrested. Due to the limited budget, the team had limited special effects, most of the money seems to be spent on the snowman costume. Particullary heavy frames are managed with cartoons or panoramic photos (shots where the camera moves to hide details). <br /> <br /> This is not a child's movie and should not be confused with the same title as the Disney movie. If you do not allow your children to watch pg-13 movies alone, if the parents should not watch the children. This film has two claims of fame. 1. Great Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made her first big film role. The scene where Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth is sometimes worth it. 2. This movie is the worst snowman joke. The joke is so bad that the directors credit the list of credit jokes.
