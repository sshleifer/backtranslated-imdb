I enjoyed the movie and would recommend someone who just drops out. Don't take the movie too seriously, remember that this is Disney and it's rated G. It's good clean fun, though some parts may be recognized by adults, but kids never notice, especially the "triangle" of Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella faithful lie to Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and really has made Cruell itself and incredibly frightening even when she has "healed" the fur-loving way. (I even found myself jumping in when she surprised me with her "bipolar" as the dog loved Ella.) All in all, I see it again in theaters, I found myself enjoying so much.
