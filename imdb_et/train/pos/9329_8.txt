I've seen the perfect Son about three times. I don't see how this movie is gay, I'm not even gay, but I don't see it as a gay movie. This is a homosexual film, I do not understand why every geeks should be strictly a movie that is gay. I think the film is sympathetic to the investigation of death, the death of your relative. I think Theo is changing his life after rehabilitation quite quickly, because he wants and watches that his brother dies in front of him and turns him around his life. I found a scene dialogue when Theo tells Ryan that he's going to be a father who is very mobile, Ryan says he doesn't want to know what he's ever seeing or sharing with anyone. Isn't that terrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
