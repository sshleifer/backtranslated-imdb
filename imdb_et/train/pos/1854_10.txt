Having developed a critical eye for a movie and love for a good cinema, I went to look at Antwone Fisher's soul symbolically. Although I'm a fan of Denzel Washington, being both an actor and a public figure; I am honestly a fan to admit (very few) times when he hasn't hit a character in a movie or two in a row. And I may be wrong with them - I'm no longer a maker. But it was different - Denzel poured out his career experience and guided a film about one of the most sensitive topics known to people - child abuse. Like his director's debut, not less. And develop a movie to point out that he would successfully win a man's victory. I didn't want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I wasn't. <br /> <br /> What I saw is a movie full of promise that united different viewers and gave the inexperienced viewer a short but real eye on the young man's life, whose childhood was a living hell, but who won despite it. This movie did it - and it proved to be the color of the theater with a dry eye. Knowing the topics of this film will let someone know when the truth has been presented. This is a talented filmmaker who will tell you convincingly if you have not experienced it. And if he can pull the audience further and emotionally react to the audience without regret, the filmmaker has done his job. In every movie. Black, white, purple or spotted. That's what makes a good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all Antwone Fisher - you've really won.
