I thought the sentinel was a mediocre film. When I finally saw it, I took a good surprise. The film is not a big deal, but it is very fun and the action scenes are very well made. This film reminded me of a TV series like 24 or Alias. It is very similar to this series and it reminded me also that Wolfgang Petersen's thriller fire. Going to wait for one of the most original and and one of the biggest thrillers in movie history, you are disappointed. But if you go with little expectations, you will enjoy the guard. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
