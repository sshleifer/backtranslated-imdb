Like someone who lives near New York's Buffalo, this movie threw at me before I saw it. Buffalo even has some parts of real-life news TV anchors, and it never knocks. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Theology-wise, pure-leeze !!! God is still looking and thinking like people ... and of course be a bit liberal. Being a light comedy, it's not something that should win prizes, but it's still fun and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some ridiculous stumbling blocks and hopefully an audience - Christian atheists. . Weaving to writers at least to make this theology correct and give a good message. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good-hearted film that should be very insulting.
