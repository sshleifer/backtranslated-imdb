I understand this film as a debut feature and as such it is impressive. It has a sense and a temple of "true indie", but director Todd Yellin has a clearly photographic and editorial vision, a mature and experienced professional. The shots are well framed and well thought out and serve the story. He and scriptwriter Ivan Solomon offer a story that is much deeper and more lyrical than typical "color numbers" scripts. This is the story that needs Judd Hirsch's caliber character talent to let him work. Judd is fantastic as usual; like Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floyd. But the real surprise is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to nuance young actors in a role that could have been easily devalued by a stereotype or overpopulation. Anyway, I found the film refreshing and fun.
