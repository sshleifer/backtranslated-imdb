This movie is a movie that everyone can see. Congress should see this real documentary from a soldier's point of view, as well as all of America. The previous reviewer was completely ignored - the idea is to reveal the truth about how to teach our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but who live in our "enemy" territory and what it does to the soldiers. We need to support our troops by bringing them home immediately before the other person is killed or injured. It also shows that the government does not help its veterans, mentally suffering, post-traumatic stress disorder or physically lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
