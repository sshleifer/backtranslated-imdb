Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it consists of three readings, but hey, so what? I thought it was fair to be pretty good. I really liked how Anastasia changed a little during love, which shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad. <br /> <br /> I also loved the Cinderella voice. I have nothing against my voice in the original, but I think it sounds better, more beautiful. I also liked his personality, he had more backbone, but he was still kind. So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True on 7/10.
