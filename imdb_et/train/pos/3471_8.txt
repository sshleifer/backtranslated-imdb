The film recently shown on cable television opens up with the abandonment of responsibility for the cooperation of real people; this in itself is an eye-catcher. However, the script and the action of the main characters are excellent and I found myself innocent all the time. It is not a small way for a crisp, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film is a meeting between one of the two "legends" of real music that were compiled before, and then separated. The film has the essence of their life and philosophy, a story that explains their initial "division". This impressive is that the actors give the seemingly realistic images they play, the flaws and everything that the viewer at least had to believe that I saw the real event of almost every detail. The great skill of this game is that in the case of honest writings and fine-acting films that are basically about "two of us", there may be a great picture. It is worth at least 8 out of 10.
