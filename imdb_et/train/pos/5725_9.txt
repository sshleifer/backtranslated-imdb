This is what I wrote to some friends earlier: <br /> <br /> The holy criticism, The Grudge is honest to God, one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen! I'm either very old in old age or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures made KICK A ** work! (Boogeyman can't wait!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared while sitting in a dark theater and I wanted someone to have someone sitting next to me (except for the protagonist Grudges. I felt silly, but my nerves didn't care! I was all over the movie, opening credits and the music was fantastically frightening. However, I mean the sound and I don't want it! <br /> <br /> I cried out loud and cried, "Oh" in one scene! Oh, yes, I even covered my eyes a couple of times! Wise: I thought some scenes were little psychotic. My DH hated the Horizon event and thought who wrote it was sick and psycho, but I can't remember comparing the movie. <br /> <br /> I can't say "I enjoyed" this movie b / c I was scared but it was very good and scary. , well ... who! for a 32-year-old mommy, I think I have nightmares of this movie, especially that Please go out of my head;) <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not a slip like I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is the most horrible movie ever. Ideal for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great trailers from this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
