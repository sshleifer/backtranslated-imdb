Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s and what put him on the map. The scale of this independent police drama is visible from the opening and closing scenes, in which the village and the shopping center are demolished. There are clear differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions, many of which do not make the last. The latter is also hindered by stars who do not know anything about their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that duplication has corrected is the trial? At that time, colonial Hong Kong studies were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> However, Chan's fighting style and martial arts chore injects humor, if possible, so that the non-Cantonese audience will not miss much. After all, it is not a dialogue that makes Chani a flick, but an action and painful statement. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays a non-destructive Hong Kong detective who is catching a dwarf pair (Cho Yeun) and has been appointed to protect the burglar (Brigitte Lin). Activities are great from start to finish and there's not much time to breathe. It will never get you thinking, but what is a fun and well-assembled film. It is said to be one of the best martial arts films.
