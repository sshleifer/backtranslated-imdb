An interesting mix of comments to make it difficult to add something constructive. But I'm trying. It was a very good film with some big pieces. Note that I refined the genre. I didn't see the lack of characterization, and I didn't act. Enjoy it if it is what people are from the average movie. I could go ahead, but I've made my comment.
