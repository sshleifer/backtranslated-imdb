Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family includes father, Louis, mother, Rachel, brother Gage and daughter Ellen. They are greeted by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89 and can basically tell you about the whole history of Ludlow. When Ellen wants to see it, Jud deliberately takes a family trip. This is the beginning of hell for the family of Creed. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the kids are gone, Ellen's cat dies. Jud finds that Ellen is not ready for her cat's death, so she advises Louis to follow her down the road, behind the pet cemetery. Micmaci Indians. Louis buries church without Judi's help. A few days later, the church returns, alive, but to hell. The greatest performance would ever be Zelda, Rachel's sister who has spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help the beliefs make a mistake to bring things back from the dead. <br /> <br /> In this music movie plays an extravagant part. At the same time, it is sad and mysterious. It goes great with the film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
