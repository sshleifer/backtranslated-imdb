Simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is a great movie I can watch again. This is definitely one of ten comedies made. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau formulated Neil Simon's perfect script based on his play with great pain. <br /> <br /> This is a real life situation that is absolutely perfect. If you have a digital cable, there is a menu at the bottom of the screen that gives you what's on. Usually this movie gives ***% letters, but it really deserves **** stars. When you actually watch this movie, it can be said to be so funny and fresh in a hundred years.
