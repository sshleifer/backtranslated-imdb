I'm glad it's now available on DVD. This film is an excellent example of the content and style of triumph over empty-blinking lights and continuous loud noise. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you have a short attention or a lack of thinking to deal with a literary narrative that you don't like for such a movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately they have rarely been achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job of successfully conducting the story of Catherine Storri's novel "Marianne Dreams" through a scenario. It is certainly known that anyone who has seen a book in the book is unknown. <br /> <br /> Casting is great, allowing director Bernard Rose to rarely see participants; They're going to act! I know, I know, the actors who do their job and act instead of turning to the camera lens insignificantly when they travel around, are really rare, but it actually happens. That's the ultimate reason for me to be an imaginary thinker and not with a spoon-fed tabloid reader - apart from a strong script, direction and action, it depends on the atmosphere. temporary and indirect horror. If it is classified as a horror, the paper house presentation is more in the Sophocle vein than the Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you like a lot of loud noises, explosions, constant cuts, and bright flashing colors, you'd better see if you see "Transformers", but if you like a suspenseful story that unfolds through skillful and conversational use of narrative to insult your intelligence by feeding you cacophonous nonsense then it may just be your thing.
