This is another example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and celebrated in this terrible mystery. No one could do it better. The intercourse was visible from the heart. I wish Mr Wilder would love you. I've enjoyed everything I've ever seen Wilder, but I had no idea how gifted he was until I saw the "Small Town Murder" and that continued. He is really sure what the viewers want and how to offer it in writing and, of course, in their brilliant performance. His subtle spirit comes through the spades. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and / or Gene Wilder's filmmaking. His letter just becomes lighter and brighter.
