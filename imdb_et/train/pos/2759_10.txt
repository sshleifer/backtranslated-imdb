Many times when I have seen tears when watching a movie, there is little. And there is only once I really cried and it was when I saw this movie. This film has some cliches, but I really don't care. I also cry when I write it, and it had been around for some time after that. It has been fully functional and all output values ​​are good, but in fact, a simple and wonderful message is important. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. It is only when we love that we are truly alive. I know how sentimental I hear and I promise I'm not usually that. I'm pretty cynical. This movie has made me feel stronger than sad and happy than other films, and this is probably always the first movie I suggest to others.
