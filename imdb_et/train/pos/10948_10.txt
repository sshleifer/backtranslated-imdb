Adhering to Sitcom's schedule is so pointless that the simultaneous functioning of its character works both in context and in context, but the rest of the cast population is the kind of experimentation actually used by sitcom. Supporting characters show the exhibition in a sitcom reality, which gives a contextual counterpoint to Sarah's uneven person who, due to general sensitivity, has no specific repetitive attributes based on behavioral expectations, making him less characteristic than canvas, which must be repainted in every episode rather than a scene. Sarah is able to see everything from the outside, allowing her to parody social behavior that is small enough to usually go undetected. Every time he speaks, it is like an independent 5-second skit. He moves a lot, showing countless things that a smile or change in pitch can mean, but never sticking to one idea long enough for you to be comfortable and formulate the expectations you have met. It can be the most creative, original and experimental TV program.
