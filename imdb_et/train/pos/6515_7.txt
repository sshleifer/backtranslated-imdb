I almost didn't rent it because of all the bad comments, but I did it anyway. I thought it was similar to the darkness I liked. The only part I hated with a dentist was two red neck brothers at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but it was not comedy. It destroyed the film a bit for me because it was unnecessary. The rest of the movie was the way the horror or midfield should be. The make-up was good and I saw the worse films than that. It was a plausible operation with a simple story. This is not the most scary and the toughest film, but I didn't look at it and didn't want to watch it. The DVD had previews of other movies that all look good and I look at them.
