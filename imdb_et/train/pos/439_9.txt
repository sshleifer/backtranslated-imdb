The real yardstick of any fictional work is whether the characters grow from their experiences and come from experiences that have changed somewhat (note that this change does not have to be positive or useful). According to this measure, Enchanted April is an amazing success. As a film in general, it succeeds quite well with the excellent ensemble's cast, well-developed characters you care about, the wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations. In short, the film is enchanting. Although all the performances are first-class, there are three to mention: Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. He says something when Miranda Richardson does his usual good job, but there are still so many others overshadowed. Most recommended, especially if you are in a romantic heart.
