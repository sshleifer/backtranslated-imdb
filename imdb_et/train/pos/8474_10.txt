I saw this movie when I was 13 years old and I really liked the dana plato, who later played in various strokes like kimberly drummond. I don't think it's garbage. It was not meant to be a continuation of documentaries. its just a cute kids movie about 3 kids who go after men try to find a brittle stream monster. men get in and the kids rescue them with the help that has been created. it's a good movie for kids, real violence, some mild fears, but fun for young kids.
