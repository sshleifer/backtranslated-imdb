Although I cannot claim to be a fan of comic books, I have read my part, so I think I'm part of this movie's audience and I wasn't disappointed. It ends near the steam, it is almost full of ideas and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actors, was on the floor of the cutting room. Little Hank Azaria Blue Raja can go a long way. However, it is easy to forgive them if you have such a fun movie. All actors seem to have broken their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight arrow Shoveler and Janeane Garofalo as Bowler. And unlike some, I found a city design to make fun even funny. I also liked how the disco was the music of the selection of bad boys; somehow it seemed appropriate.
