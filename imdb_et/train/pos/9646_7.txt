There is definitely a feeling between the two main characters when they explore their relationship - one based mainly on physical attraction from the beginning. And also the emotions associated with the internal affairs of the Mathieu family and their relationship with the mother. But the problem is that it leaves a lot of things unanswered (if I'm not just too stupid to get them). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What did the boys break? The flashing between the present and the past is a little more difficult first. The main reason for letting this movie seem to be is to enjoy some homoerotic effects or some nudity. But if the love story or character study is incomplete and insatiable.
