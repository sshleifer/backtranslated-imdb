It was a film that I could hear from all my life, but it had never been seen until a few years ago. It's really a reputation for success. I knew that Michael Myers had seen the mask, saw the ads for all the subsequent steep results. But I grew up in a decade when Jason and Fredd had a deadly grip on the game of fear, and I didn't think much about the Halloween franchise. Boy, how I was disappointed with cheap knocks. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a really scary movie. According to today's standards, it is not so graphic and visceral, but this movie offers all the other levels most of the horror films do not reach today. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is so horrible, and the fact that it is set in the center of the western city is a testimony of his ability. Light effects are terribly terrible, with the "shape" apparently appearing and disappearing into the shadows. A simple but brutally effective music score just adds tension. <br /> <br /> All players' performances are well done, with specific youngsters to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs Curtis is so good Laurie Strode because she is so pleasant and vulnerable. It is even more frightening when directed by Michael Myers because the director and the viewer have invested so much, we want him to survive and get away. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays Dr Boom on a mission and it works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the city as he knows what the evil is on his streets. <br /> <br /> Overall, not only Halloween is a great horror movie, but also a great movie. It works on multiple levels and pulls in the audience and never lets up. This should be an ordinary viewing for anyone who wants to experience a truly frightening movie. For an even more frightening time, try looking at it with separate lights. Don't be surprised if you think you can see the "shape" in the shadows!
