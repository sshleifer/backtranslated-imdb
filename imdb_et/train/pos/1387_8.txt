Slightly slow (somehow like the Sofia Coppola movie), but still a very enchanting movie about three teenage girls discovering sexuality. The magic of the film is that he can bring back many memories of how he felt about their age. Confusion and uncertainty are portrayed in a very simple way, but so alive. The music is perfect and the actor is amazing. The camera also works beautifully. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look at this particular lifetime when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that this is a beautiful film for young people who are going through this period. So many films have been made in adolescence, but it really captures the discovery and complexity of perfect romance.
