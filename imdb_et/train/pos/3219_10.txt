This is a great movie. It's an enchanting story, an awesome main character, a very good actor and a killer. It usually takes place in 2036 but shows scenes that have taken place in recent years to explain this story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a solitaire named Todd who has been trained to kill from birth and like all other soldiers have never had a normal life. Finally, the army introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, they don't need old soldiers like Todd. They are testing new soldiers who are fighting against some old soldiers, Russell has been injured in battle and supposedly dead. The military are digging their bodies and fewer others, assuming they are all dead, but what they do not understand is that Russell is alive. he was shot down. For some time he has been living there, but he cannot adapt to normal life. He rarely speaks a word and is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. If they feel he is dangerous to them, they send him to the desert. <br /> <br /> As Russell leaves the planet, new soldiers are attacking. What the army forgot to train soldiers to be wise, like Todd and other old soldiers. So, if these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd will ease them. The army will understand this and Todd will kill all his men, but one. This is Jason Scott Lee and finally you see a classic fight between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell probably appears on top. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action films I've seen and I've seen a lot. It has everything you could include in the movie, including some big lines. The writer also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman when she called even "sir". There are no holes in this movie, every minute there is a goal and it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Amazing one man army action movie for Rambo fans, Commando and no action. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / sci-fi fans.
