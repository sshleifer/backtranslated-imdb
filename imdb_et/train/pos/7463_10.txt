This film seems to polarize us. You love it or hate it. I loved it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment I said, you just have to "feel" it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, Tom Cruise shows her girlfriend an impression made by Monet - an impressionist painter. The style of Monnet is to paint in a small cafe so that the upward painting looks like a mess, but it can be said far away what the theme is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I believe this is a tip for mobile. This film is such an impressionist country. This is impressionistic filming! And it is no coincidence that the title of the film refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thinking. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always sure what's going on. But finally everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You have to focus on this movie, but I think people make the mistake of focusing too hard on it. After it ends, you should think about it. If you try to find out, it will start to amaze you. Just let it happen ... "go" with it ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the presentations at the cutting edge and thought it was immensely unique, extremely creative and enchanting. <br /> <br /> But I do not criticize the intelligence of those who did not enjoy it. He turns to a certain taste. If you like an existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thoughtful, complex, spiritual film, look at it. If you prefer something a little lighter, skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you do as I described, you will enjoy it.
