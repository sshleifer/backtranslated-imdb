I note that the DVD version seems to have no scenes or lines for FRF posting and launching. <br /> <br /> They have to prove they can win the right to sit in the FRF besides the green team. <br /> <br /> The second scene is like a simulation failure, Kevin gets Joaquin. I think a VHS edition that is not on ABC can be all missing. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I want to know which DVD has missing items. <br /> <br /> The DVD I watched has been changed on TV.
