I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! It's damn good! I'm not much of a fan of movies, but I have to say that it opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast energy. I was happy to get through the Zoinks! The film festival in Boston and the story surrounded me from the beginning. It had a lot of adult themes and character, and when it ended, I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. It would be fun. My only problem with this is Melissa Connor's play as Anya. UGH! She sucks! I've seen a wooden block that pulls a better result. I'm not doing what the director thought when he put him. But if you ignore it, you can't give this movie, but it's ten!
