This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything that I think was the upper limit of operation to management. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other movies are in the video, if not DVD. So, why not? My friend saved this from TCM, but it would be great on a DVD. For special qualities, they could say that the shipowner is talking about the battle and if Mr Schmid's wife or son is still alive, they could also interview. Anyway, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it's ever to count, it won't color. Painting, in my opinion, simply destroys the effect of the entire film. The battle scene until 1945 was quite realistic, the film went on. Mr Garfield did an excellent job of portraying Mr Schmid. Some actors may have been tempted to overcome the part of Mr Schmid's disability, but I feel he got it right. I sincerely hope that they will come to DVD on this film one day to pay tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other sailors who sacrificed us so much in World War II.
