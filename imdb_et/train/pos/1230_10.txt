after watching this movie for the third time, I think it is almost the worst film of Adam PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR compared to what I have to say when Dickie is thrown out of a boat, it's so funny (hair differs from him and I like it all This movie should only be brought when your true fan of Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> characters are poor compared to his funny movies like Waterboy, who has the same people (Peter Dante) who is one of the assassins who is trying to kill Australian birds. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks a deep and decent story and deserves to be at the bottom of 100
