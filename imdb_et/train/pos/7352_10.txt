It was my first introduction to the Bollywood world and I'm hooked now! Okay, so it requires a different mindset to watch US movies, but if you promise to enjoy it for what it is, you won't be disappointed. The songs are great, melodious and very memorable. The actors are visually convincing especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actors in the film world. Locations, color is fascinating. If you want something else and are looking for uplifting, rejoicing and stimulating, I suggest you catch this movie.
