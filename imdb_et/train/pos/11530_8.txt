A group of friends decide to take a camping trip to the desert and find a black lift hidden and murdered by a mysterious killer. "Mirage" is obviously inspired by Spielberg's "Duel" and Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes." But this slender yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and affection. The highlight of a movie is a sequence that includes a man with a chain of arms and legs around the tree and when he is pulled from the rails. is also a bit tense and some exciting stem and slashes. Operation is pretty flat and the script is pretty weak, but the movie is fast paced and shocking. Desert areas offer some atmosphere and gore is quite strong. Generally, if you like low budget horror movies, give it one look.8 out of 10.
