Usually I don't like the series at all. They are all predictable and they tend to get bored and boring very quickly. <br /> <br /> These series, however, are well played, the story follows all episodes and even if you forget, the story remains episodes all filmed in the hospital and takes you further and further into the dark and old secrets of the mystery under the hospital surface.
