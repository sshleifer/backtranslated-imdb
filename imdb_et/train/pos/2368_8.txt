The plot: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter, ex-policeman, lies inside "peace-makers" after his friend kills their leader. When he is there, he discovers that the woman wants to go to the mayor, and does something to achieve that goal, even murder. The cast is good (Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and a good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen plays a sexy antagonist with another bad guy playing with Matthias Hues as well as her a good martial artist. The direction is good (fighting scenes too). The rest is OK, Tony Burton who plays friend Kurt killed Nilsen and Cyndi Pass playing bad girl. The producers of another action / martial arts (Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas) are a good action film. Best film from the Martial Law series.
