Man, I really love the new DVD that Universal put out. I've never seen this SENTINEL for good, because I had to offer dirty, steel VHS tape for years. Unfortunately, there are no additions to the trailer, which seems worse for wear. And AVOID Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It sucks. <br /> <br /> In any case, the troubled fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves to haunt the NYC brown stone, only this is more than just haunted. It's also a hell portal, and the Vatican keeps the old blind priest (John Carradine) to keep it over and make sure the devils and arch-angels can't escape. <br /> <br /> This is all the stars full of old journalists like Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc., as well as the 80's, including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (who is the voice) mysteriously overheated) and Tom Berenger. And you don't even recognize Jerry Orbach from law and order. I had to do a double take if I didn't see her before I saw her before. <br /> <br /> A nice gene scenes from Alison that slit down her eyes and nose from her dead father's rotten corpse, which has been a devil. And there is a clean end where hidden, deformed people try to commit Alison to suicide, so he's not the next one to watch the portal. It seems that Alison's worrying past makes him the Vatican's main candidate to become the next sentinel. <br /> <br /> Great, creepy classic 70s director Michael Winner, which shouldn't be missed. I also recommended it to those who want something more common than the usual silly teenager slashers and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br />
