Some road stories on old-fashioned trains in Slowen's early summer province. At first, you see someone in underwear sews trousers from a black cloth, and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases, you can see that the trousers part has been silent (probably his father is dead). On the train he meets a young lady and almost without words, but with many small gestures a wonderful love story begins. It is somehow a surreal, very poetic and small odd movie that has many strange signs and strange cases. Beautiful pictures that love beautiful details.
