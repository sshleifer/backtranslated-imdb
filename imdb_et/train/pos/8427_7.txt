This is one of the most unusual films in the Zat么ich series thanks to its very unusual pace and the role Ichi plays in the film. Interestingly, it was the first Zat么ich film made by Shintaro Katsu's new production plant. Now, instead of just playing the blind sword, Katsu is responsible for making movies. This can easily explain why this movie looks so different from the previous 15 movies. As for the role of Ichi, the film is very different because it is not as much as usual in the film. He is also a fool, and in fact, for a while, he is harming people instead of helping! <br /> <br /> Zat么ichi R么yaburi begins with Ichi talking to an old lady trying to take advantage of her darkness. Oddly enough, Ichi says he's been blind for a toddler, although in an earlier movie he says he was blind when he was 8. This is a small mistake, and just as crazy as crazy as I would have noticed. br /> <br /> This film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year - so you can see what I was talking about at an odd pace. Most movies in the series take a few days or weeks. Ichi comes to a city where there is a boss (Asagoro) who is trying to be nice for Ichi because he knows the reputation of a blind man. The boss is quite charming and surprisingly, Ichi has been completely taken by the evil man. At the same time, he meets with another boss (Shushui) - a kind of guru for the poor. Shushui warns people that they are giving up all violence and even Ichi falls under his teachings - giving up his steel for several months. Shushui's teachings are very similar to the Daoist teachings from China - non-violent and life-accepting as it is (good or bad). <br /> <br /> Every month after leaving this city and thinking everything was fine, Ichi learns that as soon as he left, Asagoro showed his true colors - enslaving women, pushing the poor and being almighty. In a sense, Ichi is responsible for helping Asagorot as a friend. Now, Asagoro has been hit by Shushui and several innocent people have been killed by the actions of the evil boss. <br /> <br /> When Ichi returns, he does not automatically agree that Asagoro is good or bad, but he will test him wisely. This scarecrow bit is inspired and leads to the end where, what else, Ichi kills the bad and releases Shushui. This final was very good and rain. Then the final scene is great with Asagoro and stones, although today's special effects standards are burning. <br /> <br /> The advantage of the movie is that although it is poorly worked, it is different and cannot be confused with the previous one (which often looks very similar). In addition, it ends very well. The disadvantages (aside from the pace) are that some may not see such a fake by Ich, and the scenes of Ich and other blind people involved in the comic strip are very ... very, very flat. They are sticky and uncomfortable ... this is the apartment that it is.
