I felt this movie all the time. I am impressed by Russell Crowe's talent to develop his relationship with Lillie, like a typical Aussie blend that has softly softened, a bit self-depreciating and very durable. Really loved cinematography and direction. Pace was just right and almost all the characters were impressive. <br /> <br /> Gosh, Russell's talent doesn't even shine in 1993! .. and I haven't seen the Gladiator yet.
