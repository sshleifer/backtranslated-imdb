I've always been interested in watching Hong Kong movies, but they didn't meet my expectations ... so far! THE FINDING PROJECT does not contain the flat-humor or the dragged-down second-level story of the HK movie. The story is not complicated, but there are never scenes just to fill the "intelligent" space (the only truly intelligent martial arts I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved, it's not a real HK movie for me). In this movie, there are some incredible fighting scenes from the first (which is one of the coolest I've ever seen, but so short) to the last major scenes! But remember, there's also a lot of blood that flows (people are cut in half, lost, etc.). The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the writer's fantasy can be filled, although some shots have to be quite technical (note: a sheet of paper he throws and the wall hangs on!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my favorite Hong Kong movie, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure hell goes out of this director! Ace.
