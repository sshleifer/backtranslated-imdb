it's really a nice place for every Bolan fan, some might think it's a bit up, and it's just about Ringo and Marci egos, but I think it's similar to any other concert video except it's Marc bolan, not just one man! I especially liked the revolution in music for children, Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip alone is worth all the money, i can't believe they didn't release this version alone. The film is great, especially for us. I wasn't alive in the 1970s. but the Danes were generally around them. the media did not play or show any of the most popular music, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they played only a little with The Doors, but only really popular songs. so, I know from my dad to see it, give him a part of his youth, he never got any experience. <br /> <br /> I don't do it too long, so ... If you're the least fan of Marc Bolan, you'll have to see it. maybe it is boring or, as stated earlier, a bit above the tip. But at least you have seen one of the best musicians ever in action! <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappears a little is that Ride A White Swan is not on tape. but I forgive it because Jeepster and Get It are so wonderfully played.
