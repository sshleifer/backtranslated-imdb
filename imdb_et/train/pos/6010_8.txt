"Zabriskie Point" (1970): It was especially interesting for me on a personal level, because it happens in the same conditions, with the same peers, in my own life? The Counter Culture Movement of the late 60s / early 70s, a campus. We follow two independent youngsters in separate stories that are slowly woven. One of them is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless pseudo-revolutionary jabber in his university classrooms and dining rooms, and another young woman who goes to Phoenix to see his father and employer and take on the "foundation" job. The film is FULL from the American visuals of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni), and the confused psychedelic careers of this era, "we know all this, we make everything better" for young people. Who is "revolutionary"? What does this really mean? Do you dress like one and march around? Do you "fly under the radar" but report your arrival in advance? Do you keep your plans for yourself and go into the business of change without the need for group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "periodic piece" - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal movie moments (after all, it's a movie man who gave us amazing 1966 "Blow Up" and era items, but that's more. It offers opportunities for cultural revolution and Antonion (who seems to be supportive), young people are too independent to see what is needed to achieve radical success. Because of this, this powerful, scary film that is valid for everyone, any time, everywhere.
