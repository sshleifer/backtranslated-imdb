People call it comedy, but when I just looked at it, I smiled <br /> <br /> only once. I think the problem is that I saw it for the first time when I was 14, <br /> <br /> and I was not old enough to realize that it shouldn't have been serious. There were quite a few scenes that meant they were funny, but I took too many of these signs to laugh <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch this movie the next time you love, and try to take it seriously. I think you find that, despite some stupidity <br /> <br />, this is one of the most mobile love stories you've ever seen.
