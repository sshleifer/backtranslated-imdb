Loved the movie. He loved two families that cross the journey history. The only question is, will Sam die, then how does his family run? He is the son of Madame Zeron and Zero should be involved but no other child is mentioned? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mentioned any other child or woman before the teacher and spoke to the teacher? Maybe she had a baby before kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. Just loved it. Operation was great. Not sure where the story was when Sir Sir was Marion's women, but makes his character even more fun. Another "advisor" seemed to be a concern for children, but of course not so much. A poor caregiver must be a truly smelly childhood to grow up.
