California is a movie of lost ideals. Journey to the Dark Road. An irreversible road. The plot has about a couple that found a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his current role) wants to write a book about the famous crimes in America and his girl who is a photographer takes pictures. So they set the track for the famous murders, without knowing what was waiting for them. To share their travel expenses, they decide to find another pair and they place the ad. But the couple who answers are not just a couple. This is one of the most strange couples. The girl is a naive, weak creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is exactly the opposite. Terrible ruthless murderer. We learn to film early and we follow him on a journey to California (not with C as usual, but K, which is likely to symbolize the killer of the word), along the path of his betrayal, murder, and ultimately defeat. All the leaders, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes are really good performers and you have to take into account that when this movie was filmed, not even one of them was a star. Photography is amazing, darkness covers the biggest part of the film, and music fits the dark character of the film. All in all, this is a very good movie. Don't miss it. You mean again before you take a stranger in your car to share the gas!
