The only other film besides Soylent Green, with such desperate air, is the beach. Both films deal with the consequences of cataclysmic species and the planet. A beach with a nuclear war and Soylent Green with environmental poisoning on the planet. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is a reason for some optimism, because since 2007 we have not reached the worlds described in these films and we have now. There are still about 8 million people in New York, not 22 million at the turn of the millennium, as described by Soylent Green. Environmentalists always welcome this film as a consequence of global warming. For me it also shows the right to life. There is obviously no family planning in this world either. Charlton Heston is a NYPD detective who lives with the spouse Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember the Earth before the disaster. A murder has been committed, Joseph Cotten is a leader with Soylent Corporation, a multi-country concern that has brought food, some color to many colors, to feed the world's population. This is the latest product from Soylent Green. The investigation finds that Charlton Heston gets his man, but it also brings some terrible truths about the future of Soylent Corporation and the human race. When Heston finally ends up being Soylent Green made of people that we have become a cannibal, it is a terrible thing that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet and we have to survive our dead. . A few weeks after Robinson wrapped up the screen in the final scene, with the consent of the eanana, he died in real life. Not many did, but Heston knew that Robinson was the end result and that there was nothing between the two final death scenes. <br /> <br /> Although the schedule was off, this does not mean that the world does not see Soylent Green predicted. Hopefully we not only have a sense of intelligence but also a shared sense of responsibility to keep it.
