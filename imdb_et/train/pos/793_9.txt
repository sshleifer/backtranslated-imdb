I really enjoyed this movie. (That's why I surprised me that there are so many users on this site at such a low price!) I'm not saying it's a masterpiece of cinema, but it was a great opportunity to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. It's funny, terrible and big stories about female friendships that run through tough times, and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each other! Bill Paterson shines as Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove he can be a good actor if the role is right and he thinks about it. (And the best "wedding getaway" I've ever seen or dreamed of in this movie ... more guts than anyone I ever know!) You laugh and you cry --- ignore the marketing campaign and how the movie is marketed. .. this is a hidden gem that should have been done by TONNES. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
