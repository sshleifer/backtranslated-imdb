Your average psychotic walnut tree palate (with the taste that Stephen Sachs smelled relaxed) strikes down a variety of dim young "adults" (to use the term very loosely) at Dayton Hall University, which will be closed for demolition. With all the dreadful deeds (Daphne Zun debuts here Dominie, bimbo, who has a car-broken head) is a debut and malicious film! Mungle, some bloody murders (bashing a baseball, chicken wire, your usual drilling through the head, a bit of a frightening thing), an amazing surprise that was later copied to the "Intruder" which was Christopher's horrible score. "Hellraiser") A young, small ridiculous woman's nudity, and Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with "The Power" and "The Kindred"), this fun-exhausting slice'n'dice in terrible sizes as much as deliciously relaxing and drecky low quality fun.
