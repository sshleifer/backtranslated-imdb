If you love culture in the 70's Sci-fi as I do, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", if you love it. This is the 70s of Sci-fi consciousness that is the 22th century junkyard and a million million years of earth. This film is pure 70's. Put Steve Miller's "Fly Like An Eagle" or Pink Floyd on "Dark Moon Of the Moon" and you're ready to go!
