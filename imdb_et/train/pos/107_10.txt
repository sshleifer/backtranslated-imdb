Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely good film. Is this okay?; How is it ?; What do you think? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling the story, at least he's done with Europa. For me, the whole movie was like an experience, even when I saw it on a small TV screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this movie is the most complete, REAL and moving movie, most of which are top 250 listings. I also think that this is probably the most frightening, most gothic and complete film. Let's be good, but it's my favorite. The final scene is one of the most disturbing scenes.
