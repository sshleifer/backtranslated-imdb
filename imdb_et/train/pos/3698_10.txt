I had no idea what this movie was like, until I read about it L.A. I generally agree with LA Weekly's review and decided to get a ticket for this movie. movie stars are molly parker (my favorite TV show Deadwood) and Lukas Haas - who I suspect we will see more in the near future. The film is funny, warm-hearted, with great effect and beautiful photography. I don't know if the film has a spread, but I hope it - or it will - soon. it must be a real indie pearl. this is even the music of my favorite band of silver jews! The only disappointment was that the molly parker wasn't screening. even without it ... it was the best movie I saw at the festival.
