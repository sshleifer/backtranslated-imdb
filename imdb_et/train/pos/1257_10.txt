I've read a number of comments about the movie and I have to say, "What's wrong with you?!?!" That was a great movie! I thought this movie was great from start to finish and the story was very well told. I am convinced that people who did not like this film did not pay much attention to the film. There are several very important scenes that if you do not pay attention, you are confused and the following scenes may not be meaningful. I invite everyone who didn't like this movie to look at it again and look at it, so you can really pay attention. The story gave me a lot of sense and, as I said, it was very well said. Each movie scene has a point and everything fits at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a great job! Sean Connery was always very good in her role. Laurence Fishburne was great as Tanny Brown playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a nice touch and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I didn't expect anything big from him, but he drew great performance. Ed Harris was the real gem of the film. He plays a really sick person and really sees how his character is disturbed. Look at her eyes in her scenes, just great! In one of his first roles, there is also a very young Scarlett Johansson (Kate), not a bad place to start. Great for pouring this movie! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves some cast member or just likes thrillers. This is a great movie and it should be seen. Don't listen to all the other people's opinions, watch the movie and get your conclusions. I hope you see the movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> Crisis
