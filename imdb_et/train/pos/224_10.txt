Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite films. I first saw it as a Christmas opportunity at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and loved it. I saw it in theaters 6 times and when it plays today, I'd go see it again. <br /> <br /> There have been many commentaries on drivers' great achievements now. Matthau was brilliant but failed to stand against Jack Nicholson's Oscar winning Randall P. MacMurphy performance "One flew over the cuckoo nest. Burns won, although Richard Benjiman deserves at least an appointment." roles were played perfectly, such as Fritz Feld's chambers for potato chips. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the reason for reviewing my movie, Ross, a very underrated leader of Herbert Ross, who previously brought two people to play "Owl and The Pussycat" and made it a full movie, does it again games without looking like a photo field. <br /> <br /> Here we are 20 minutes of the movie before we reach the game opening scene where Ben Clark has to watch his uncle and talk to him about a special comedy. Play in the first 20 minutes, the sequence is brand new. A few years ago, I saw a huge revival of the game with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful. But I think Ross and the scriptwriter, Simon Simon, corrected it. It's just a great movie.
