This is a great show! I had a teacher in US history at high school. History has many "facts" that are not quite true, and Mr Wuhl leads them very well, unforgettably. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl teaches film students, but historical students and even the public wisely appreciate how he discovers some of the world 's famous historians and tries to impress them on the brains of his students. It is also very entertaining to use live actors who perform "skits". <br /> <br /> I recommend this series to anyone interested in the history they learned when the child turned upside down.
