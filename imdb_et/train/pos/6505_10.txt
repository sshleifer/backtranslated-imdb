Theo Robertson has commented that WAW did not cover enough conditions after World War I, which led to Hitler's rise and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he missed the first HOURS volume 8 and first 8? Covers this period and, together with the volume of the previous series, clearly shows the existing conditions. My friend grew up in Germany during this period, even joined Hitler's youngsters, and his experiences were very similar to those of the WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is so far away from documentary films from the history channels that I own, that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> ONLY guilt, and it's small, I have WAW, this is: numbers are not included, many times. For example, when you talk about a loan transaction, how much military equipment was borrowed / leased? How much to Russia, how much for Britian? How many merchant ships U-boats sank and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese navy do in 1941? What type were they? How many troops? How many soldiers are allies together and by country? A lot of numbers could have been made by many viewers, but I would have preferred MORE! Of course, I always want to see more military analysis. Like WHY did Patton & Clark not allow the German army at Cassini after they surrounded it, rather than compete with Monty in Rome and let him escape? I don't think you can begin to understand the war until you have seen some of these video segments in "complete war" like Dresden's fire damage. It's like understanding Auschwitz, etc., before you see the clamps of the death camps: you just can't turn your head around - it's too unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Unidentified and, of course, uneven at this time, Japan's toughest atrocities and inhuman events, including cannibalism (read "Flyboys"), and some LIVE divisions of medical "experimental prisoners", any anesthetic! <br /> <br /> Dave
