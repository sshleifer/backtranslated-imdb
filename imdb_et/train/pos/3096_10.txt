Six degrees had tried me. I was looking forward to it and I was completely disappointed when Men in Trees replaced this place. I thought it was just a break and it would be in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised. We could deal with characters with real problems. We talked about every episode and we had our favorite characters. There was no one who didn't like it and I felt the actor was great. I like to see programs recorded in cities where you can identify local areas. I would like to protest against this cancellation and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give her a good time, don't leave that day out of that day and advertise it so people know it's turned on.
