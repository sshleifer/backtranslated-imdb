I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film that was later dubbed in French in 1930. The fact that his singing voice is dubbed by the legendary Edith Piaf helps us relieve purists of duplicate fraud. <br /> <br /> This is Lulu's story and we will see him first as a resort with his macho boy Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame like a pair of legs: we see her inside the car, changing her bathing rain. Lulu is very free when she turns off her body and she doesn't sit well with fucking Andr. If Lulu wants to apply for a Miss Europe title, then we know that the happy ending will not sit at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to focus a lot on men who are beautiful women. We see a lot of bathing dresses and their men's views. But at the heart of it is the magnificent Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind past films, consider it. Louise Brooks is not the name that most ordinary movie lovers can easily know, but as soon as you see her, you're mesmerized and you want to know more. Check it out in the "Pandora Box" if it is available. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the release of the US Cinema DVD. I don't know if their projection speed is right. Many scenes are probably too fast. It can be as they were shot. I do not know. But since this is the only way to see this movie, it's worth swallowing one little bitter pill.
