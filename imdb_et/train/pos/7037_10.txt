This is a great political satire. No wonder why it was mostly ignored in the US: it exerts our murderous foreign policy on what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good era of this era, handing over, was also completely abandoned, as it appeared exactly that the United States is a war machine that has fought for torture, murder and rape of civilians in search of world domination. <br /> <br /> Intelligent plot, good actor, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei?) And some joyful scenes should have hit this movie. Unfortunately, the Americans do not want to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are involved in massacres.
