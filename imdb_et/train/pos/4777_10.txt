Perhaps David Lynch's most personal work is his most accessible. This time, not mysterious thematic structures that may or may not include the plot or represent more than bright nightmares, offers Lynch a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal topics of aging and family, and finds both. The simple real story of the Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who is driving to a lawn mower in Wisconsin to visit his stranger, tired brother, still has a lot of unique and original visual dreams (some pretty eye-catching air competitions, filmed by veteran artist Freddy Francis) to make it indisputable for Lynch effort and characterization, which are some of his unforgettable. Farnsworth is a great stoic, but a satisfying way to make the stories he hears about his journey, part of his life, and Sissy Spacek pays some of his best work to his lesser-challenged but attentive daughter (whose painful John Roach and Mary Sweeney a gentle passage of a sensitive script reveals a secret weak move), but a small part delivered to the rest of the person provides indelible performances, one of which is Barbara Robertson, whose casual killing deer is both bad and sad at the same time. But this is the vintage Lynch who has the ability to do his best. For those who don't know Lynch or only know him because of his violent, disturbing reputation, it's a great place to start; for those who know his work, it is one of his best repertoires.
