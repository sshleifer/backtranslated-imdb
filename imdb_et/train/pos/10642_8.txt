I just watched the detention last night and I liked what I saw. It was a cool fun movie. Dolph looked great at Bike. He also looked good in this film compared to his latest films. He's in good shape now. The story was ok and the other actors were also satisfying. I wouldn't call this movie his best, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But it was also part of the Problems. The first was the way the bullets flew everywhere and even if they were shot in a blank space, they were missed. They should have shown that ppl escaped from the balls in a better way. Another problem I had was how the students swore. I do not know in which school the students can swear before their teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few. There should have been more bad guys there. The last problem was certainly the fact that the set looked nervous, but it was due to small budgets. In general, the film was a good film. I enjoyed it. I recommend that others look at it. P.S. Now you can win a police officer at DEAD. (Some of the individual linings were cool too) <br /> <br />
