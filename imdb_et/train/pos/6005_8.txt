Although this movie is somewhat disinfected (because it was made at a time when people just didn't speak about sex), it is a very useful short film to show birth girls to know what to expect during menstruation. No wonder Kotex paid for it, although it may surprise Disney to make this film because they made a lot of educational films from the 1940s to 60s. But the film is well done, but I think the filmmaker continued the real opportunity. A nice female narrator instead of a voice and a relatively gentle visual would have been great if they were using Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang! I know it would have given my old Walt heart attack, but it would have been a great movie! By the way, although the concept of sex has barely hinted at the film, it explains enough about menstruation in general. However, it lacks some details (especially on intercourse), which I assume are included in the accompanying brochure. <br /> <br /> Now that I can understand why I watched the cartoon about menstruation.
