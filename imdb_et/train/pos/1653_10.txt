I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best "spy" genre. My husband and I had conquered it when he first incited and followed every episode in the United States. I was trying to buy a series at this time (I did it all on tape), but WGBH said it was not available. I even read in writing to Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version is ever available on DVD, I will be the first to copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but bold Bernard Samson was amazing. (She's always amazing.)
