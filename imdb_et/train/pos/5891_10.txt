ITALIAN is an amazingly achievable film of its time. Amazingly fired with a luminous intensity that is truly sublime, it's an early gem that clearly shows that REGINALD BARKER is D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control over Thomas Ince's production is hard to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant trying to keep his family in New York is very mobile. The themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are now completely relevant. Close-ups are excellent and the power of GEORGE BEBAN is electrifying. Now we really need good print on DVD so that we can genuinely appreciate this cinema's earlier masterpiece.
