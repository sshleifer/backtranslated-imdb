It was a pretty good movie. I'm not sure if it is considered a spoiler comment, but I didn't want to take this opportunity. Anyway, at the end of the movie, the prosecutor reads a written verse and then cites another memory. I do not remember the first paragraph he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9:12, but he cites verse 6. This is a common point many use for the death penalty protection. It is too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the Bible today. Has anyone heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court judge in the history of this country? He said the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad we have lost that view in America.
