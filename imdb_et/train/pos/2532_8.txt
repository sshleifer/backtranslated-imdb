The third collaboration for Karloff and Lugos looks out of the Poe and the scientific literature series. Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a device that can capture the light beam with his telescope in the Carpathian Mountains and translate them into images that make up the universe's visual history. <br /> <br /> Before several guests, including Lugosi, as Dr. Benet, an astro-chemist who had previously been crying for Rukh's theories, the presence of an unknown radioactive element, called "Radium X", contained in the meteor, The Earth fell to the darkest Africa for thousands of years. Karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories, but Radium X is a complex compound - it reaches the mountains at a long distance and cures darkness in a short range. However, Rukh is careless and poisoning himself, glowing in the dark rather than those old Ready Breck ads! Dr Benet is ready to work on radiation, but the combination of poisons and treatments Rukh is completely paranoid. Convinced that he's been deceived, he is looking for expeditionary members in Paris, including his stranger, and his very touch of radioactive status means death ... <br /> <br /> a killer (remarkably distinctive Karloff!) and a Radium Xi device used to symbolically melt the shape of expeditionary members. And even James Whale's touch of a cocktail house in Paris! Invisible Ray is a lot of fun, besides opening the Gothic it is interesting to see that Universal is moving to Africa and Paris. The film lacks pace, but always sucks. Karloff outperformed, but Lugosi is terrible. Universal used the main transit outline Man Made Monster, this time with Lon Chaney Jr as a glowing hazard (this time caused by electricity) and Lionel Atwill as a much more crazy doctor than Lugosi is here. Invisible Ray is a bad and clever little movie to admire. Not as famous as other universal horrors, though it works and is very fun.
