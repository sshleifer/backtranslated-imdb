Boys and dolls are a unique game based on characters. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-level player who bets Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for one thousand dollars. Nathan needs money to start and succeed his usual mess. It was a mistake that Sky could not take only one girl to Havana, Cuba, and she chose "doll" Sarah. Sky finally bribes <br /> <br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with her. They fall in love with each other, but later he blames him for something he didn't have. Nathan ran the missionary at night when they were gone. Nathan's 14-year-old Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) disagrees with Nathan's gambling and tries to do it. But when the movie ends, all ends are happy with double <br /> <br /> weddings. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are just wonderful, no matter who sings. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brandol has no voice at all and it is true that they could have duplicated it, but that is not really important. He did a great job (apparently seeing it as Brandot) and played his character very well. I've seen some movies with Jean Simmons and I thought this film was his weakest, and he couldn't sing at all. However, singing is performed by Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also original boys and dolls for Broadway production. Vivien Blaine had a great voice and it was the perfect Adelaide. If you like musical and even if you don't, I suggest you watch it.
