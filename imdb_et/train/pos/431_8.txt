It starts slowly, showing the life of two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy in April, but don't give up. Nothing happens a lot, but the time is fine and there are a lot of crazy jokes (my favorite is a truck storm that I think is fun). The film is strangely romantic in many words in hours, the landscape is beautiful (like Polly Walker) and movie resolutions are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film has a few freedoms. The book with the biggest creature is the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I preferred this version of the film (it may be more sentimental, but I felt it was more in line with the tone of the story and anyway I like sentiment when it is well done). <br /> <br /> A great movie, especially when it comes to the date of evil weather.
