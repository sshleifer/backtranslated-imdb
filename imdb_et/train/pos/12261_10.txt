Tintin and I recently introduced PBS P.O.V. series. It is based on Georges Rem's recorded interview, which since 1971 has been the creator of Tintin's Herge, where he discusses his different experiences, expressing his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, then in his own comic books. Awesome wide-ranging view of various comic strips and surreal images of Herrea's dreams. For the first time, I met Tintin on the Children's Digest pages at my local primary school library, where I read the unicorn secrets. My mother later got a CD order and read every month in 1978 the whole treasure of Red Rackham. I remember that after that I saw some Tintin comics in a local bookstore, but for some reason I probably didn't get because I was 12 years old and I thought I was growing up. I have a Breaking Free, a book written and written by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. You haven't read it yet. This film also includes the artist's personal life as he left his first husband after being recruited with a colourist (whom he later married). His name is Fanny and he is being questioned here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this movie is definitely worth it. Update: 9/4/07-I have now read Breaking Free. Tintin and the captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are adapted to Mr. Daniels' anti-capitalist views along with Tintin, depicted as a tracker with his own shoulder chip, who cares about the captain with whom he is staying. The captain here is just trying to come up with a woman and a girl he loves dearly. They and other construction workers promise to hit after a coworker dies as a result of a faulty device accident. The whole thing is going on in England, where the accents of the working class are healthy. Nothing that would be approved by Herge, but interesting reading. Oh, yes, the dog Snowy will only appear in the top left corner of the lid (where Tintin has run over the police!) And on the page of dedication.
