Since the godfather's saga was commented on by the mafia, this series is a complicated story of the mafia's workman. If you have never followed this example, you will have longer treatment. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never free and the reality of the life needed by a man's gangster, Tony Soprano, and, frankly, he would never have known how many of his associates have come. Tony Soprano may discuss with Sun therapist Sun Tzut, then beat a man in a pan that fits with rage, and at the same time crushing and destroying his body with his nephew, take a break, sit and watch TV while eating peanut, and yell out and give cousin advice on your upcoming Marriage as they had just finished watching NFL football on Sunday afternoon. Even Carmella, her husband, given the opportunity to escape, believes that she really prefers life with Tony and the accompanying perks who look differently between their indiscretions and their lives. If you follow the whole thing, you know how it ends. If you didn't, then trust me that you've never seen such TV shows.
