Antonioni had tried a second hip masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic as "Blow up". It was not successful with critics and young people like the former. Why? Perhaps because the European vision of America was full of clich√©s, which then didn't work and are not obsolete. (Initially, revolutionary students are embarrassed.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps when it appeared, the big cobalt films and those that were specifically targeted at the youth market seemed dated. If it had been issued a year earlier, the cages would have been fresh in the desert ... It's a very interesting movie, very captivating, some great and Antonion scenes like love in the desert, silence in the desert building and the explosive end ... two amateurs, didn't help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is a little better than Daria Halprin. It would have been so much better with the right players! Maybe Michelle Phillips or Young Jessica Lange ... Dialogue is sometimes quite funny and terrible if you don't know how lines are delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very interstant document in the late sixties is definitely worth the photo and soundtrack .
