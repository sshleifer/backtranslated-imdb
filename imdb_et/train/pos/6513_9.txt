To be honest You think that everything in this movie was so good, there should be no reason why it didn't go to theaters, movie deaths are fantastic when fx is fantastic when used. The story follows a little girl, but all this was a very good movie, which I hope I'll ever get the necessary props. The first part of the film is why she came straight to the video where they killed a little boy, but after that story is based on a little girl and her mother who came from a mamma boy who moved out to become a writer. The property that he buys is a place where the witch (Tooth Fairy) lives and anyone who lives in his house or goes to his property becomes very dangerous to not give anything away if you want to see this movie, then do it for rent
