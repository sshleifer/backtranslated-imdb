Although in the middle of this film, or rather, it is a melodrama, the story is beautiful and subtle, and the actor is great. <br /> <br /> Yaara, who studied Princeton, will return to her mother-Israel funeral at her oldest and most expensive friend, Talia. Since Yaara practically lived with her mother's parents with the death of her mother, she has lost her adoptive parent. And since Yaara, blind from birth, is led and guarded by Talia, her friend's suicide is as intolerable as it is inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Inevitably, there is a dark girl who decides to solve this mystery of death. He has an overview despite his vision. Although she doesn't see, she can find what is more prominent than "normal" people around her. The film thus becomes an absorbing mystery when Yaara captures clues in her memories of her relationship with Talia, the house of her adoptive family, tapes, diaries and people in Talia's past and present. <br /> <br /> From Yara's point of view, the film is also viewed from its perspective when it visualizes what it hears, believes and represents. The mystery solution is quite common, but the search is done with such fine care and the answer is so beautiful and without a fan that the pat moment is easily forgiven. The truth is gradually, but consistently, explaining not only Talia's life, but also his relationship with Yaar. Tali Sharon, like Yaara, uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is completely believable as an adult as well as a teenage girl. At the end of the film, we fully accept our ability to find our place in the world more confidently. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is the accuracy with which places and activities are repeated with small but important variations that never become annoying, dead - with small characters and an interesting decision to represent Talia only as a teenager. I punish Yaara with the final declaration that stands at Gali, Talia's last boyfriend, on a cliff, but this trip to the brink is so exciting that the picture stays longer than remembering her words.
