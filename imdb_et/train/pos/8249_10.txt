Heaven. This movie really shows the talents of the actors. Billy Connelly flexes her acting flesh. Really amazing man, if you look at him as Absolution insurgent, Boondock Saints as a madman / killer and then finally Fidos as a zombie! His character in Fiji looks cute, scary, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is not a cage! Jumping Matrix and Momento as a darker, warm-hearted, conservative housewife of the 1950s! These days it is rarely seen that the actors may not be of this type. <br /> <br /> Now the story (not spoilers, don't worry). This movie would make Max Brooks (Zombie Survival Guide and Z World War II) happy! Finally, well done zombies and comedy twist. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you don't like zombies, if you're just bored or if you're too busy, watch this movie!
