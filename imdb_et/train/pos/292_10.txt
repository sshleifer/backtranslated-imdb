Okay, first I got this movie for Christmas, so it was FREE! FIRST - this movie was to be stereoscopic 3D. This is largely, but when the main character is in his car, the film falls to 2D! What !!?!?! It's not that hard to shoot a car !!! OTHERS - The story is not very good. There are many things wrong in this. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why do they show all deaths at the beginning of the movie! It made the film suck when someone wanted to kill !!! Look at it for a good laugh, but don't waste your time buying it. Just download it or something cheap.
