This movie was in my collection for a while, but it wasn't until my friend reminded me of that? Until I decided I'd watch it. I didn't know much about Leo? just that it was supposed to be a great age picture movie and it deals with a very serious topic? Help. While a person is a tool? is Leo? The scenario surrounds the way Marcel (Leo's youngest brother) binds to his illness. First of all, are all Marcel trying to hide the truth? is he believed to be too young to understand his brother's illness? The fact that Leo is also homosexual contributes to parents' unwillingness to discuss this with young Marcel. I know from experience that in many cases, most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young, it does not automatically mean that they cannot accept reality or even act on their own. Except for the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, they have left a real impression on me? how did they support their son? even after discovering the truth of your sexuality and illness. The fact that they allowed young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris with his former boyfriend was a great gesture among them? most families I know do not want to do. There are lots of heat in the scenes where the brothers spend time together? you see these real friends, one for another. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is a great drama that I strongly recommend
