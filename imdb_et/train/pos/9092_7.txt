I think this film enhances diversity and is very accurate from a historical perspective. The way it shows how different communities are leaving in Thailand is very interesting ... a king under the leadership of Portugal, Japan and various communities. The plots surrounding the court are traditionally a struggle for power with a lot of treason. The wardrobe is good. The film is also made in Thailand with reasonable production. The style in which the elephant is a filler is very interesting. It's fun and I think it's also used in schools because of its historical accuracy, because it shows that Europeans in Asia were the subjects of local kings, which are very different from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
