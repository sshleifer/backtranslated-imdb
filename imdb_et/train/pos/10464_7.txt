For anyone who does not speak Swedish: Swedish [original] title of this movie; "Rånarna" means something in the row of robbers. This is the main problem I have with the film, because it is not really robbers at all. It is about a young woman working in a Swedish police investigating robberies. Probably an ordinary desk job, but this girl will be out of the field soon, taking things into her own, as the story goes, even if one of the robbers is shot ... Exactly: we've seen it before. The fact that the plot has a rather interesting twist does not really help, because the end is the same cliché as the first two thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> What saves you from being just another mainstream movie is that it is masterfully accomplished in every sense that the actors are as big as they are and don't move and that the director can really do that exciting to keep as exciting as most of the story. One thing I really love about this movie is that this music sets the right mood when it is needed, but it is not the rest of the time, which gives a pleasant reality to exciting realities. the whole film spread. Nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actresses, who often tend to predict, hurts painfully, as you know he is not going to just play the heroine boy and have a backdrop of supportive character, but that is something you have to neglect. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an entertaining movie that steals more plot money than your time. 7/10
