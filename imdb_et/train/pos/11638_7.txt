I had fun watching Red Eye. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well targeted and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in this role. Yes, this is the same old story where there is a different place, but Wes Craven gave him a good pace. At least not another Scream with an ordinary college killer. It's nice to see a pure and cohesive thriller, even if originality doesn't distinguish your main character. Especially a filmmaker, such as Craven, who has given so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past, and that can now be brought home, which could have been a good TV movie if it wasn't published at the theater. Good work!
