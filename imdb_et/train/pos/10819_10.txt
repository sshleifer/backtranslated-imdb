Of course, this movie didn't like it. 16 blocks, inside, human being haunted by America. But it was a big secret that could happen to any of us .. I found this movie really great and scary. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where they filmed this movie "san pedro, california" And we've heard some real stories from this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you've heard "Queen Mary" from the famous boat on the long beach Well, the boat is haunted. I believe in spirits, illusions and parallel or u. is pretty. everything is there in your universe. <br /> <br /> And mind is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. it is great and not bad management at all. <br /> <br /> For those who appreciate it 1. They don't understand the movie. its meaning. its plot, its view. and how bad the life of the ocean is for everyone and for everyone. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
