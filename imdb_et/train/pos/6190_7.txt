Fay Grim is a continuation of the story that started with Hartley Henry Fool ten years earlier. I didn't see an earlier movie and I don't know if it's good or not. I can only handle the current film on my own. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's filmmaking style is something you either want or not. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humor really affects me and Fay Grim is no exception. It is the air, a sharply written intelligent parody that I and many at the Melbourne International Film Festival that smiled loudly. In the first half of the film, it was relentless and delivered with deadly straightness. This is a strange style, which is the lack of cinemas and a welcome relief for the frantic teen comedies out of the Hollywood pancake pumps. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the movie, humor will be a thin film to morphize into an international espionage / conspiracy thriller. Whether it was Hartley's intention or the failure of ideas was not clear, I think that the original momentum of the movie should have been cut or rewritten in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Performances were generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most screen time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery, and Elina LÃ¶wensohn played good support. The movie's visuals were nice (New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (including Hartley) was good without intrusive. The film is well written and I enjoyed it enormously. If you like Hartley's earlier work, you probably like it.
