I was surprised how the film could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. Frisbee's flying saucer was ridiculous, especially on landing, but the special consequences of Krell's attack were fantastic for a film that had been made for over half a century! Living in the Middle East saw the shades of Islam when JJ Adams suggested that Alta should dress up with a more modest and engineered imagination that was used for "futuristic" gadgets, and gizmos dreamed of props. All in all, it seems like one and a half entertainment, my first time Walter Pidgeon and the opportunity to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young man"
