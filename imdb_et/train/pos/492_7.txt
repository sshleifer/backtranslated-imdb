Let me first say that although I have looked at every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself in Trekker or Trekkie. These are people who live in their parents' basement and are wearing costume-wearing rubber ears. I gave this film seven fictional fictional historical errors. It was better than average, but there were no surprises on the plot. They tried to build the technology very hard, but the special effects were a great temptation. Now that you call these historical mistakes, the first captain who led the company was Commander April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk and so on. According to both Riker and Kirk, we pulled out and educated the Klingons and gave them technology (this is why the original directive was created), but as I said, they are not discrediting the series of fines. I hope the plots get deeper and then the special effects can be taken back.
