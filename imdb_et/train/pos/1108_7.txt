Some of the well-known Altman's "masterpieces" now seem to me to be sad. Maybe it's me. Like the last reviewer, I even like this "less" Altman (shown recently in the FMC), although I don't think he was targeting a wide audience. Organizational policy as a "microcosm" of public campaigns. Some of this satire "docudramas" is now dated, like Dick Cavett, who looks at the Tonight Show, but I found a lot of dialogue funny and understandable (eg "You're real. That means you're not threatening anyone"). The story is not "deep" but I liked it. And the performances are funny, especially Cavett (like "herself"), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of parliament) as a leftist ideologist (at the place where the people dressed as carrots were taught) about the Holiness of Politics) and Carol Burnett in the basket. Everything is unmatched in the Altman style, although it may not be so common. But quite imbued.
