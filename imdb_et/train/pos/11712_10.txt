It's a big movie called "Call me Anna" because it shows how a person has suffered so long without knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke to come out in the public eye and tell his story, this is the inspiration for those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for him as a person. The only thing I don't like is that I can't get it on tape, I've been trying to find it, but without success. Anyone know how to get it?
