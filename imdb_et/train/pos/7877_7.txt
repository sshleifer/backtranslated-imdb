Write the word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not quite! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant "Page 3" does is destroys the myth that adds to the pages of glam and glitterat, coloring the pages of our newspapers, and whose life (read party habits) is followed by manic passion that can only be explained by our inner voyeurist streak. Page 3 The phenomenon is as unfortunate as it is mysterious. How exactly he got such control over the printed word, and when it started to penetrate the front page, it is another discussion. Bhandarkar avoids it carefully. He is only concerned about the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And by doing so, he summarizes the different elements of this lifestyle. Like Robert Altman (although I do not compare Bhandarkar with the Altman genius), Bhandarkar uses a number of signs to further develop his motif. Is it page 3 wannabe NRI, gateway crasher, newly rich, upcoming model, social democrat or erotic novella author; All characters are entered with a goal and each has a separate character sketch, even if their parts may be small. And there's a movie complaint. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist, covering the page for 3 peoples. Initially, he is pleased with his work that he will soon see the ugliness of this undertone covered with its counterfeiting and cosmetic violation. But Bhandarkar opposes the temptation to make this subject a moral police and avoid focusing on just one character. Thus, the film does not only concern Madhavi, but also Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi's editor, who passively accepts his role as a social machine strangling society, Anjali Thapari (Soni Razdan), Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - homosexual make-up artist and Madhavi roommates Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - sassy airhostess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - ambitious actor. It seems like the impossible task is to assimilate so many characters (and more) into one story, but full credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyag to get a tight scenario. Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar dialogues have been written in great detail. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, no matter how good, may fall due to a lack of real occurrence. Fortunately, "Page 3" faces actors, not stars. Konkona easily passes on the role supported by its author. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part but almost overestimates it. Atul Kulkarni is wasted, although it is written. Sometimes the director looks as eager as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them fast. Ultimately, Bhandarkar's attempt to saturate our voyeurism, but he will take this step further. He takes us to photos and puts us in the horrible reality of the sect of mankind that strangely seems to be living in a different and distant world. These are the same people who promised the New Year, while a few hundred kilometers away, their compatriots had destroyed nature! Smart writing, skillfully connected songs, capable performances and a true sense of sincerity make this film worthy of all its fineness and poor product values. “Page 3” is the optimal way to enter a new cinema year. <br /> <br /> Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating - **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ** *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
