Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to be a secretary with a wealthy Hughes family to get her boyfriend off. Almost immediately he is a drug and sent off to the family's inheritance in Cornwall. When he wakes up telling him he is Marion Hughes, he is mentally ill and holds him ... but why? You probably think why not, but don't mind because it's fun. <br /> <br /> With the "Narrow Margin" and "Mask behind", this is one of the best B-pictures ever made. (B-pictures were low-budget pictures taken with low budget and capital letters). It is as long as it must be (only 65 minutes), well targeted, fast paced and exciting. Finally, it only comes to what I got a little unlikely to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (good actor) is just in the lead, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is great (and scary) than the villains. It's worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie with a low budget.
