Well, this was one of the films I took out, and it was good enough to register when it appeared next time ... If you, like me, enjoy a lot of the 80's horror, which branch out a bit (ie only from the successive general lakes), I think you can enjoy it. When a bad man finally emerged personally, he was certainly not what I expected! All in all, I wouldn't go out on this road, but if you like the genre, look at it when it comes up and you have one and a half hours to kill, I think. I'd give 10 out of 10.
