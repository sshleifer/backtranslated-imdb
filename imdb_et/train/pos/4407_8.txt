For those who commented on the patriot as accurate (which basically satanized English), this film was interesting. First of all, it was the bloodiest war that Americans have ever participated in, and they were the only presence. It was therefore very refreshing to see something similar to the historical accuracy of this part of the Atlantic, which did not paint America as martyrs or savior. All in all, what this movie brought home was the real horror of any conflict, and how any acts of war take place only in worse acts, often culminating in innocent suffering. It was not a movie where you rejoiced, but both of them were merciful and enthusiastic.
