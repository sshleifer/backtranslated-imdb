This is another tell-it-as-it-on Madhur Bhandarkar film. I'm not sure why he has such an obsession with showing the mole *** Ion and g * y concepts to an Indian film group, but I find some of these scenes really nasty! What's new? This is a nice piece by Bhandarkar, where he shows a story about an entertainment reporter played by the leading lady in the famous movie Mr & Mrs Iyer. What makes this movie different, it also includes people's stories that this reporter interacts with or has friends with, such as his rooms, colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people, and others on his entertainment page # 3 His newspaper is noticeable. He's probably noticed this role. He does selective roles but shines in them. He is significantly deformed and less beautiful in this film. But then entertainment journalists don't have to cover their people, right? Judgment: Madhur has highlighted another good film that brings social issues very well. But this film loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Does he try to show us the glory and glamor of rich people? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and opposing the life of a REAL criminal reporter? Does he try to tell us how the government and the rich people rule in the press? or he tries to illustrate the problems associated with child abuse and g * y folk. The other concepts outlined include the unwritten rule that young women should sleep with boards or configurations when they want to enter Bollywood. their work after some time and use extreme measures, marrying a lot of older people etc. She also talks about unfortunate women and rich families of spoiled children. <br /> <br /> It was all good for me. be too complicated for the average movie visitor who just wants to make everyday work easier
