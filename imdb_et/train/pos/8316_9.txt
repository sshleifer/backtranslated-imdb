I watched this movie whenever possible, back in the seventies when it came over the cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, which has impressed me (and Bill Clinton). I was still very young and the film gave me a big impression. It was nice to see a movie from other young girls who grew up trying to decide who they wanted to be and make both bad choices and good choices. I was blinded by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the great dresses they finally wore, and the gentle dialogue. As someone mother raises, I can really identify their girls and their lives. It's funny, these features seem more real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
