Having seen such a "horror black hat" as "it's a spinal cord touch", I can honestly say that though they are similar, both films really have to be seen. "Fearful" is many times that hysterical to you. No wonder why both films have such a great cult. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Hire it if you need to do it, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it yourself.
