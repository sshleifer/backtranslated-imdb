I remember watching this movie, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what's going on. I was surprised how much they would fit in an 8 minute short time. Let's start at the school yard. . Two friends are discussing the class. Kid B says to Kid A: "You can't go to class today." And Kid A rejects, claiming they could leave something really important. So the child B jumps and the child A goes to class. When he arrives there, the teacher tells him that today they learn to learn the only and most important lesson. They learned to learn the meaning of life. She gives a brochure to everyone and when she arrives at A, she runs out and tells her the boy next to her. Well, boy doesn't share, so Kid A is looking for a teacher. When he finally finds him, he gets a shocking revelation that is the real meaning of life. I recommend everyone to look at this brief. It only takes 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important that it can help you with your life.
