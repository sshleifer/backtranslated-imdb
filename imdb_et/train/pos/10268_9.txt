This typical Mameti film offers a quiet, steady, quick overview of what makes people trust (Joe Mantegna). It was studied by a psychological study, noted by a psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), who is slowly pulling him down with the usual reluctant consequences of his world. There are a number of players found there are several Mameti movies (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy) and they do their usual good work. I loved this movie with Lindsay Crouse, and I have often wondered why she was no longer a player when she got. Maybe I'm not looking for the right place! <br /> <br /> The film continues with a slow, flat dialogue, but retains the tension at the level that leads logically to the end of the bang-up. You are expecting a real shot at the end, but I found it to be exaggerating and satisfactory. I love this movie!
