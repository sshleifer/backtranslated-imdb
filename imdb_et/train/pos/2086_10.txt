The incredible work of Pearl S. Buck, who spent years as a child of missionary parents in China, giving him a deep insight into Chinese culture and its philosophy, is perfectly adapted to both the art and the acting. Wang Lung is a modest farmer who thanks the basics of life: to live out of the country and to be newly married to Olan, a wealthy and powerful family member of the village. Despite Wang Lung's and Olan's efforts to cultivate land, raise children and build savings and wealth, hunger is threatening all that they have been working on. By choosing not to sell their land, the traditional Asian faith, they travel to a big city to wait for hunger. While in town, they are begging and they are just one of hundreds of other unhappy homeless families. Although Olan is not a looter, he gets attacked by a rich man in the house. He is rounded to fill the army, but it is saved at the last minute. His happiness, however, is that he found valuable jewelery at the place of plunder, giving him and his family the opportunity to return to their farm. The newly found wealth makes Wang Lung. He becomes selfish, self-centered and takes credit for it. He becomes a very rich farmer, but it makes things worse as he becomes more and more unrealistic, overwhelming and more difficult to understand. He loses the connection with the basic things of life that money cannot buy: loyalty, dedication, trust, justice and honesty. As a punishment, nature will turn to Wang Lung's table again, sending a rose well to destroy everything he has. Wang Lung brings his knees to all his friends, former friends, staff and family. All this help to save the farm. From this experience, he returns to modesty and acknowledges the basics of life.
