When people ask me a name I've ever seen, I always answer "Black Noon" and so far no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I looked at it alone about 30 years ago when I was 13 years old when my parents left. As far as I know it has ever been shown once in the UK and unfortunately it is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can track the copy, let me know. <br /> <br /> If I watched it again, it would probably be a big disappointment, but it is always a particularly disturbing movie in my memory!
