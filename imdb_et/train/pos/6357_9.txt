I found this as a very fun little baby movie that is actually more targeted at adults with lots of fun and humor that they only understand. Some things are inappropriate for the child, but only a few. Othewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) breaks so many jokes that you can't keep up with, ranging from sexual culture to insider-Hollywood racial. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks good on a DVD. A little girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hair of these small people are fun to watch. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is also pleasing, so his story increases the film even more. His rhymes are fun to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, although it was "fair", but it was much better on the DVD. I've seen three times and every time I get better.
