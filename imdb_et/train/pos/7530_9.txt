This is to say that the queue for animated batman and it is as good as it is, and for all the same reasons it has a lot of things to do if it is good if the voice of the actors is very good, like Kevin Conroy's batman, Mark Hamil like Joker etc. Roisto is really good, like The Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you don't have to be disappointed with Batman's new adventures because it is very good. So make sure you watch it on TV or rent or buy a collection edition because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ********* ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** *****
