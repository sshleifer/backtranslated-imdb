I saw the trailer of this movie in the 1970s when I was barely watching the 16th movie. Oh !!!! how were me and my best friend. we couldn't wait a month or so until it came. I saw this movie 17 times this year. I love, love, love it. Kris is so perfect for the film. She's dirty and kind, but she's shy and insecure for Babide, and it's so nice to see it again. When they were singing in an evergreen studio and calling with their fat voice, which is very different from his perfect remarks, I thought it was one of the best scenes in the movie. How she looks at her and she's so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like an est-dress, even if I have a long sweater and a cap that was like he wore. it came on TV on time and I got my daughters to watch it when they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it's just that I got to this age when everything was extreme, I don't know. There are always tears at the end of the day even today.
