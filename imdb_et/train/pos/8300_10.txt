It's not surprising that Busey later developed a tumor in her sinus cavity, this film is also a bad decision, but one I enjoy completely. The first 5 minutes are all the most inseparable in 5 minutes; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with Spiderman's attitude, Busey screams for the best of the worst on any movie ... "your worst nightmare!" I made some eggs eggs so laughing. This line resonates so well, even Clooney's infamous "hi freeze, I'm Batman" line. Other classic moments are Busey's constantly upset people who remind him that he was able to kill his former CIA partner ... what he did when he accidentally put him under the chest (all made possible by a super slow motion setback that changes color to dry it looks exciting). They have ashes, hit the face and "it wasn't my fault and you know it!" Well, the shots show him that he is a lost man and strikes his friend, so ... Other frightening moments must be his former girlfriend, who falls to the grenade ground to allow him to escape logic, physics and absurdity. And finally, when McBain jumps out of Thunderblast during an intense guerrilla war and starts running and blocking a small object, I almost noticed myself. Some of Busey's best work is still renting or buying "butthorn!" My voice is perfect 10 (poo meter).
