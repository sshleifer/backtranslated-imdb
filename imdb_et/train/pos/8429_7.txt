An absorbing (albeit repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no progress or progress in attempts to feel better when you are undermined and downgraded by the people below seems the only way. But even here, in the lost dreams and the destructive destruction of the future, which does not work and reaches something or someone to comfort and share, simple charity gives some reward, even if it just does the present, rather than revive the memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is little reality on screen violence, it is a harsh and brutal film about violent oppression (politically and personally) that does not allow easy entertainment. Obviously, the game is based on a little pain, a broader, expanding relationship to the general social and political environment that the film would have reached a wider audience.
