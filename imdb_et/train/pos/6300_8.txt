I loved this movie. I thought it was easy to look at and it's easy to forget. I went after I bought this DVD, obv is not just forgotten! <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant and casting cannot be more complete. Every character has a moment and I laughed at the movie, the comic timing was on the spot. <br /> <br />
