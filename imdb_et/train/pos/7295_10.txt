I was able to see it at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my girlfriend. Both were impressive about the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally mobile. It was very well targeted with a strong design. The visual effects were amazing - especially short. It was an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: this movie is a young girl who is visited by a demon to help her with a malicious father. At the end, there is also a surprise debt that pulled me out of the guard. It relies on Gothic feelings. I would like to see it as a full movie. - Carrie
