Foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp is seemingly "perfectly" suitable. When taking pictures, editing by editing, the film appears around the disturbed boxer who discovers his goal (or lack of it). Other comments may indicate a lack of pulp, but I personally think it is a great cinema!
