When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, I was taken by a human drama by Gabriel and by someone he cares and loves. Nonetheless, we have been given a great film version of the great story and are expected to be shining over Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> The writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have really succeeded! <br /> <br /> With just the right security system, Robin Williams takes Gabriel's delicate character and lets us see his struggle for confidence in both his personal life (Jess) and his world (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we introduce the participants in this drama, it is recalled that nothing is as it seems and that the smallest event can irreversibly change our lives. An application to look over a book written by a young man becomes a life-changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength to continue and move on. <br /> <br /> It's bad that most people avoid this movie. I only say this because the average American probably thinks "Robin Williams is in a serious role? It didn't work before!" PLEASE HOW TO TAKE THIS MOVIE ATTENTION! Robin Williams touches on the darkness we all have to find and go through to be better people. Like his film One Hour Photo, he has grown as an actor and has made another quality art. <br /> <br /> Oh, before I forget, I think Bobby Cannava, like Jess, steals every scene he's on. The 1940's leading man looks and displays the screen. This is the kind of opinion she could make her own movie !! <br /> <br /> S ~
