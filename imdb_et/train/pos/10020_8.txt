The legendary Boris Karloff finished his outstanding career by making four cheap fears in Mexico. This is a symbolic period of mood from a gothic horror cluster. With a typical spry and dignified performance, such as Matthias Morteval, Karloff gives an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites many of his small, greedy and backward relatives to read his terrible lost castle will. Soon, hateful guests will be able to hit deadly life-sized toys that are in place. Andres Garcia, a Mexican tribe, is a stigma of "Tintorera", which shows that a police officer, a hero and Julissa, looks like a completely unique woman. Dirty, dirty (not) direction, loyal scripts, ugly, disappointed cinematography, ridiculous pieces of murders (slipping of gross masses with miniature cannon! Morbid gloom-doom atmosphere, which is largely weak (Karloff especially excluded), cheesy light gore, bad duplication and a pungent fiery conclusion, all of which offer this pleasantly horrible lemon in a pleasantly sparse, and thus strangely amusing funny charm.
