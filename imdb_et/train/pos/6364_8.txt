"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was all that the previews showed. Often you won't find it. In most cases the preview will only show the best parts and then the rest of the movie will be terrible. It is not like that. I was pleased with the original plot, although there were no sub-lines. Animation didn't go like "Shrek", but it was good. The plot and story were well presented and had only a few slow spots. It keeps you interested. I found it for myself. "Atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. You also need to think a bit, but not too much. If you think somewhat of it, you can understand what will happen, but you will not know how it will happen. <br /> <br /> Casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, like Milo, was a great choice. His personality fits well. Dirty natural commander Rourke was also well-chosen with James Garner. His symbol reminded me of his performance "Maverick", which I liked. I really liked pouring Claudia Christian into Helga Sinclair. His ability to play some nonsense personality makes the film more interesting. It's just too bad if he's a villain. <br /> <br /> Overall, you will definitely be worth it (8 out of 10).
