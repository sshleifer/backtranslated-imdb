I never saw it when I was a boy, so it was seen with fresh eyes. I had never heard of it and rented it for my 5-year-old daughter. Plus, the idea of ​​Christopher Walken singing and dancing made me curious. The special fx is cheesy and singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was entranced. I loved watching Walken in this role, thinking about her future. Very fun to dance with her! And if the songs were not big, at least they weren't the sweetness of Disney's overgrown sacchar. At first, the ogre scene was a little scary for him and he was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly, we recently read "Puss in Boots" and I thought this story was unlikely. But while almost all aspects are real, Walken's behavior made it credible. Fun. I'll look at it again with my daughter.
