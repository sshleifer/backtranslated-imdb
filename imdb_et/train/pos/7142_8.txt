Holes, originally Louis Sachar's novel, was successfully turned into a fun and well-made film. Being the head of Sigourney Weaver, Shia Labeouf like Stanley, and Khleo Thomas, the roles were very well cast, and the actors played their role well. <br /> <br /> The film had knitting structures that all ended. The main story is Stanley Yelnats and his punishment for a year and a half in Camp Greenlake. Another story is Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism and is a deeper feature of the film. Third, Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeron, explaining the 100-year curse of the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these storylines were very good. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, I think you don't have to read a book to read a movie. The film is reasonably easy to understand. <br /> <br /> The action was good, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (guard) and Jon Voight (Sir Sir). The other members of the D-Axis, Jake Smith (squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (underarms) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray) increased the movie comics. But the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a great team. <br /> <br /> Although the holes are a Disney movie, it deals with some serious issues such as racism, descent, and violence. The dramatization of the film at some points is very well done. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people of all ages, whether they have read a book or not. You shouldn't leave it.
