You are waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. I rated Audie Murphy's movie 3 (I'm a tough grader), the second lowest I ever gave to Audie (the worst is "Battle at Bloody Beach" when you're curious). I'm going to give this film an "8" rating (and I'm a tough grader). This is the story of a civil war renegade "soldiers" if you want to call them the bottom. People like Quantrell and the men who drove these laws. <br /> <br /> The original was a watery version, a very clean cut, still depicting what these men did. In fact, movies, like the older version, are best viewed by mature audiences who can differentiate this story. I would be more suitable to evaluate the original "R" and, if it is a lovely character, GP, because the newer film gives you a very honest version, a message that a minor reads more easily than an older version. <Br / The filmmakers have been "realism" since the beginning of the sixties, but few deliver. Instead, they just give drab landscapes, drab costumes and drab events, but the comic book cardboard stereotype characters, the weakness of the spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers have understood this mistake. This is evident in the Western style that we usually see today. This movie is an example. It provides realistic settings, but also gives us signs that we believe exist in this era. But the inexplicable situations are okay as long as the whole movie captures, and the characters are intriguing enough. The main character is what we can identify and at least with some compassion. The character of the early film "Audie Murphy" does not give any sympathy and is too self-just without motivation. <br /> <br /> The character of this movie follows the signs of a true hero. His insanity is motivation and method. We don't feel that he is really "right", but we understand where he comes from. <br /> <br /> The film has many actions. There is also some humor. One good scene is when the hero tells the hero not to lie to him and he will overpower him. <br /> <br /> This movie manages to do what filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This director and writer team got it right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Full success.
