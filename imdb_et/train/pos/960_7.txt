This is a film that has many things that only Japanese people understand. Even well-translated are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional insignia. My guess is that he tried to send a message, but it's just wasted me. <br /> <br /> I felt that this was basically a mediocre film with beautiful special effects. Some children become "one", and ultimately they are of no importance to the yokai war, which makes no sense. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they are talking about, but the Azok bean washing yokai and what looks like a big umbrella (Rihanna eats your heart!) I couldn't really distinguish the plot. br /> <br /> Bottom line: nice vision, baby screams a lot, the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap.
