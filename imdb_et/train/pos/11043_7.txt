Malefique has a sharp atmosphere from start to finish. Almost all of the film has been put in a jail with around 4 characters, of which the transvestite Marcus and his little slow-down boy have been called. Soon the detainees will find the diary of the previous prisoner behind their brick, dealing with his obsession with occult and black magical themes leading to his escape from the cell. Then everyone explores the secret of the book and its incantations to escape from prison. This leads to some accidents from the cell to the unknown light. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this story is pretty poor and the last twist is nice, but the ends are pretty loose for me. Anyway, I was delighted until the last moment because the film's atmosphere is unique with minimal setup and casting. The killings are raw and eerie ... he does not take his back chilling, and the occult themes are done very well and reminded me of Hellriser's devil issues. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel in a green tone. Sometimes you don't know if the real or hidden world shown here is a stranger ... if a slowed boy loses his fingers and is fooled to sleep in Marcus breasts, is it normal, so how strange gates to freedom? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and cools the viewer in a very different way than most genius shockers. I just want the story to lead to a more consistent finale. Many elements, such as camera visitors, other inmates with books, and the doll doll, which point to the vague end, are not closely related. Anyway, I keep my eyes on other films from Valette, though turning it off to see that he is making a Hollywood remake of "One Missed Call" that was already used in the Miike version and useless.
