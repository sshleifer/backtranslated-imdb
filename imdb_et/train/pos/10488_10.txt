After applying for the Oscar nominee "Secrets & Lies", Brenda Blethyn played an equally big "Saving Grace". And let me tell you that this is not a movie you can find every day. <br /> <br /> When her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that her irresponsible financial decision has left her with big debt. Fortunately, he finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's right, Grace starts to cultivate it. <br /> <br /> Every part of this movie played a big part; there's no dull moment there. And I'm not sure this end scene will come! But still you have to see this movie. After that you just see more than a little festive. If anything else, it can act as a good lesson on knowing your finances. But of course it is much more than that!
