For a film that is probably sex and leather, she has no right to be as weird as it is. Bettie Page, the story of a good Christian girl story that mommy won't let her date until she marries, who moved to New York and finally got her age to be the most successful, with excellent performance driven by Gretchen Moll. His page does not get well with the pornographic research and the alleged bad consequences of his pictures of the world around him in the world around him (which no one can touch, it's all fun and respectful). <br /> <br /> The page has inspired all Burlesque artists, not only because it had a shape for death, but because it invested in every image with an innocent sense of fun that was uniquely sexy and simple. Rather, this film likes, actually. The film is both black and white as well as brilliant in technology, it is a great way to spend a few hours.
