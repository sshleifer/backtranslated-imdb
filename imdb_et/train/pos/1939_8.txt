I don't know why I chose to watch this movie, it has a strange title and a description that just looked like something else. Every time it is good to try a movie that is a bit different from the Hollywood hero / thriller flick and this movie was definitely different. From the very beginning, this film was impressive, but I couldn't figure out why until the end of the movie when I realized the film was great because the characters were so real. I thought the actor was great and character formation makes you take care of them and hope that they will come out well at the end. I think anyone who watches a movie can somehow be associated with one character, and it makes a great deal of viewing, and some are laughing at the participants' exclusive rights. <br /> <br /> At the culmination of the film, you will surely get a sense of well-being and leave the "things that are OK" feeling. I am sure that it has a wide appeal and should be given the opportunity.
