This is a true 80-year-old movie: they made 100 times more films than they do today, and it makes many of them quite interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. Today, there may be people of the same type who would have made cheap "direct video" products in the eighties. Porn seems to be selling. Anyway, it's above the average trash-film level: it has a good and exciting story and it's pretty well done. In one scene, you can even see the microphone moving at the top of the microphone image. Of course, Ozzy and Gene Simmons are little to come, but they do not contribute much to the success of the film, although they are good in their small roles. Monster, the heavy singer "Sammi Curr", seems really terrible, especially when she sings. One of the most terrible monsters I've seen in horror. I can get her a nightmare at night. Not recommended for intellectual film lovers.
