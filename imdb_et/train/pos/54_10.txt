Home Room deals with Columbine-like high school education, but instead of self-review, the film is about the consequences and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. <br /> <br /> Spoilers * Shooting is seen as an upcoming conclusion without any action other than the almost teenage SWAT command after shooting high school killer. The film has three main characters; Detective investigating the crime that the culprits have not been convicted of, and two teenage girls who have survived the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and a busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> Two girls who have nothing to shoot together have been put together because of this and drama. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 have been blocked so much that the film's viewers are pretty much familiar with their solid and reliable style of action. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and unknown to me, blew me off with its enormous dramatic strength and screen presence. That girl was that part. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and it combines you with your intimate focus on weak but growing relationships with two traumatized girls. Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003) seems rather superficial and embarrassing compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic elegance and action. I see this movie got very little screen time and exposure - so much loss is equally traumatized for America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
