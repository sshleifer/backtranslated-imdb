This movie is so big. He fights against this 40's and Meg Ryan's character to be known as "wise." Plus, Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And all this is a magical feeling about it. Every time I watch it, I feel happy. It's definitely a girl's movie and I'm a girl so I like it. I also love music. Violin is awesome. but besides, I think this is a lovely story and everyone should watch it.
