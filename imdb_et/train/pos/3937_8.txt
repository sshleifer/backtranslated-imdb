Ford's early career is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that someone in real life has seen the material of Lincoln, but the Fonda who carries the fake nerve is Lincoln's funny, voice, delivery, walking and other motifs - just as Lincoln would have imagined. The first of three successive films he made with the Foundation is Ford at the top of his form, excellently highlighting America's early 19th century. The story focuses on the couple accused of murder, which Lincoln protects and the court scenes are pretty well done. Supporting casting includes many Ford regulars. It was Alice Brady's last film because she died several months after it was released.
