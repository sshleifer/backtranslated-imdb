In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from the POW camp using a gym in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to film his account and launched the story of a unique British Film Genre - Military Prison Camp, which reached his danger in the car (1959). <br /> <br /> A wooden horse is one of the quietest films I've ever seen. There are no great dramatic moments, but the lasting story is ultimately based on a top line with more tension, because the story doesn't give way to unlikely dramas, jumps or hats (sometime!) Music. Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel, and David Tomlinson are curiously leading low-key attachments and (I suspect) non-participants. Without exception, everything is constantly mono-tonic and quiet. They keep emotions out of their role. Since so many were only recently in service, I suspect that they restored their roles as "officials and gentlemen". <br /> <br /> This pointless approach does not reduce dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most warfare, the story does not end with a barbed wire: and it alone keeps me glued to the end.
