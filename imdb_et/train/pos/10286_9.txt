This movie is amazing! Being funny and fun, it is deeply deep and the eyes open. I look at it over and over again. Bruce is a man who is happy with his life. He has a job and a life, but that is not what he thinks he is lucky. Bruce is bitter, dissatisfied and outraged that his life is not as he imagines. As a result of this mental state, Bruce loses his job and blames God for everything he thinks is wrong in his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he saw to make him happy ... one exception. In the process of achieving all, he loses one person who really loved him. At the opening of the film, Bruce learns that the real changes that occurred in his life were not facts, but his perception of what was actually there. This film was inspiring and deep. If you really pay attention, it will force you to look at your life with a deeply humiliating respect that much of the time we are blessed as much as we feel. As my wife says, "When will anyone know what will take to make them happy?" and my humble insertion: "Do we not lose ourselves and those who discuss things when we try to find out."
