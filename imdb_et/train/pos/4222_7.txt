I love this episode quite a bit, Ruth Gordon is good, if not a little hammy, as he always was. As already said, music is very good and has a mood that is not present in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But one big plot hole is there, so wide that you can drive the truck through it. It has been established that light does not work in the vault. Don't you think that very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police should have checked whether the lamp has worked? You'd think they would have turned the lamp off in a very short order and found it. This is a fiction for television and different holes are always discovered, but it seems too obvious. <br /> <br /> It doesn't make Columbo a hidden genius when light doesn't work, but the "death bed" testimony goes on for days.
