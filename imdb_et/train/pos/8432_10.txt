I didn't read anything about the movie until I accidentally watched it last Saturday night. And when I watched it, I felt the affliction of Lena and Boesman in the bones. I was so fascinated by the exhibition and the tone and filming that I listened to only partially in dialogues. My husband slept right after bedtime and I was sleepless under the influence of the movie. I wanted to cancel him, saying, "If I ever vote for an Oscar nomination, it would be for the two participants." I decided to wait for the next day. Then I read more about the IMDb movie and was sad to find out that Mr Berry died before the movie was released and that he has probably never seen the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I want to tell him that my film was a true independent film in his concept and spirit. Actresses should not be praised not only for their excellent performance, but for accepting a part that does not have shine, not being shown, on the contrary, showing the true picture of human depression. Sad, but embarrassing.
