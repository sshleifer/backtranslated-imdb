My all-time favorite police suits turn to a TV movie. Does it work? Yes, yes. Gee runs the mayor and gets off. The "Hall of Fame" of Virginity appears. Pembleton and almost all the police who ever played in this series. A lot of setbacks help you who haven't seen the TV series, but it's also fun for fans. In the last five minutes, the second murder is solved and, finally, even two dead police cease. And a short look from my favorite coroner Juliana Cox. This is a good movie.
