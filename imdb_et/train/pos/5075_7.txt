Well done filmmaking with a tragic ending. Pros: how the story moves - Soorya, who lives, starts with a long setback on why he is there. Music. The life of police officers is inexplicable. Cons: violence and gore, but I think they add real effect. However, cutting the heads of the people and sending them to boxes and bags could have been avoided. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
