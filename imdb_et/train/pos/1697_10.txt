Basically, this movie is one of those rare movies you hate and you think the limits of suicide are the next best thing, not to sit down within two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a cultural feeling, one of those movies where humor, the plot, the actress, is actually really hidden, but for those of us who want to look for it, trusting the director, the reward is: U laugh at your A .. !! The fact that U needs to find the above-mentioned things makes the movie even more fun, because u get the impression that the director is not even aware of how funny his film is, which doesn't seem likely, and that there is intelligence in managing this great project: Spaced Invaders !!
