With smaller actors such as Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryani, this film would have become stupid and tricky. But with these two experienced paths, I found Silent Fury to be the most exciting and pleasant little secret. If their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married, and that he was the best man at this wedding, one can understand that there is some plot against him. As Colbert, Ryan and his lawyer set aside the requirement of pre-alien marriage, they have more evidence at every step that seems to reinforce the claim that he is already married. While it is not very difficult to find out who the main "baddie" is, it is still fun because the story's intensity and pace are increasing. All in all, a good, confident mystery film is a major cast of two leading actresses and a fine cast, often containing underrated Paul Kelly.
