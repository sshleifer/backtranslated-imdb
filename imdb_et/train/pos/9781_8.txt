I had first heard of TEARS OF KALI some time ago and it sounded like something I was, but all the movies I have regularly come down from my radar. Moving around the local WonderBook ... I noticed this box and grabbed it. I have to say I'm pretty glad I did. KALI TEARS is a strange, cozy, sometimes even terrible movie that is somewhat limited by its obviously low budget - but is still fun and worth watching. <br /> <br /> KALI TEARS focuses on the fictional Indian-based Taylor-Erikkson cult group, practicing meditation and other rituals to see and expel the "inner demons" of the individual - but apparently these techniques work too well or not well enough (depending on your point of view) ...) The dark forces are not only busy, but also triggered by unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> The film is about "anthology", which has a short but memorable "eye-opening" intro sequence, and then moves on three stories that make up a large part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The first (SHAKTI) is a journalist who visits one of the cult members who are held in a mental hospital. The journalist continues to study the culture of Taylor-Erikkson, but we find that his real motives can get closer to home. When the interview comes to a violent turn, the journalist finds that he could get over his head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) concerns a violent young man who is understood as a psychological rehabilitation. imprisonment for beating a young man's coma. We find that this treating physician is actually "alumni" of Taylor-Erikkson, and his rehabilitation methods are far from norms ... <br /> <br /> The final result (KALI) revolves around the riddle of the riddle - and his assistant who perform " If the healer unintentionally helps some of his clients and displaces him with power, the demon can now freely occupy and look for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I have to say I really enjoyed KALI TEARS. There are some mistakes in the film that keep it really great - but it's an original and ambitious movie about what it is. My biggest grip on production is poor and forced over-duplicated dialogue. Duplication is sub-par and I would have preferred it to the original Some reviewers have said that this is a bad thing, which I do not necessarily agree with, I think duplication is so weak that it shows that the performances seem strange, which actually In fact, some appearances of real fucking cooling (second segment "doctor" and third "client" memorize ...) and remarkable. Gore FX is a very good budget movie with some graphic scenes through eyelid-cuticle cuticle scissors, pencil-in-throat suicide, some decent (but irritating "trembling") self-playing and some other good benefits. Not as tough as some of these "extreme" gore movies, but definitely stronger than your average horror price. I also found that the story of the cult group is an intriguing and welcome change to a typical horror. There are many scenes of real atmosphere and tension that I have never met for a while. Although some basic ways are wrong, I still think that TEARS OF KALI will turn to most "underground" horror observers - some scenes may be too much for a larger viewer. Definitely recommended - 8.5 / 10
