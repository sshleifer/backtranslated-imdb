Years ago I followed the soap on the TV. So I was curious about this movie and I was so rewarded for finding it. It is a wonderful soap, jealousy, ordinary actors' insecurity and all kinds of beautiful moves. But more than anything - an amazing cast and incredible script. How did anyone get all these top-notch players in such a stupid movie? And how did this little film get the perfect features for the writers? I've never heard of someone who spoke or even heard about this movie, but it's wonderful and I suggest you see it. Sometimes I throw this household during the cleaning and finally sit on the couch, look, laugh and enjoy the wonderful thing. Many congratulations to everyone who did it.
