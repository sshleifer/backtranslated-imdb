This independent, monochrome, DV feature consistently strikes, astonishes and amuses its ability to create the worst situations and then find humor and interest in them. It's all fun and ridiculous things, but so absurd and a lot of movie should be, here's the heart and the reality that keeps the movie grounded, keeps the whole piece full of madness and there's a real message here. This film tells us how we all live in a crazy world. It seems to be the heart of the film. Because the crazy and the wall, as things get, Leon, 30 a. old paperboy main character, always trying to keep it together. He is like a child forever who tries to defeat a balloon to make everything work the best, so that everyone can do what they want. top, but extraordinary cast keeps the piece united. Van Meter is probably the best bunch here, with his absurd sick peaks. Just like the characters in the movie, we forget his unexpected hits to see the real person below. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. It takes extremely ridiculous plots and keeps them real. It's his manuscript and his cast that help keep the whole thing on the surface. This is a true testimony to Majkowski's skills and to everyone involved that this film, which has its own grid and characters, never works on our nerves. Majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and reluctant, but somehow gave it heart and humor. This is a unique film. Must not be skipped. <br /> <br />
