Another Woo masterpiece! <br /> <br /> This is the best wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except for some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - the largest director of the century. <br /> <br /> His films like big poetry! Woo is a Movie Sheakspeare! Woo on Movie Biron! Woo is Bloodsheti Mozart !!!! The themes of Woo movies are more humanistic, so more new movies.
