This movie is one of the best of all time, definitely in the Horror genre. Clusterophobic atmosphere is outstanding, music is as good as movie and killer as scary as possible! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance is fantastic as Dr. Loomis, he made the movie even better. Without him, the film would be an important ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great when our beloved queen queen! Because of his innocence, he is not aware of the actual evil that follows him until he finds his friends in the house seriously murdered, which is of course one of the best scenes in the movies. He gives a tremendous result. I loved this movie because it frightened me like hell when I saw it already in the early 80s and I still look at it today, because it's a wonderful movie that just brings you to this world if you could fish like a fish every step! The fact that it is a crazy man's form in a mask who has escaped from a spiritual shelter and is ready to kill everyone on the horizon without having any idea that he is there is just shockingly frightening and caresses even more of the film than events, though fiction can easily be. We all know that, unfortunately, there is evil in this world, and the nervous crazy man is certainly not a rare, very worrying deep fear of it. Death at any time. Of course, Halloween shows it in the most terrible way. Horror should be credible and it makes the movie enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made in a wonderful and terrible atmosphere. In addition to Psycho's excellent style, which both adore, I believe that the best horrors have to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best films I've ever seen, and I look at them all my life and they're not tired. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made.
