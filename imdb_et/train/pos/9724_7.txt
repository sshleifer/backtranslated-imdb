I love Kristen Dunst, especially Elizabethtown. I think he is an actor who couldn't do better before the camera, but just be himself. She did it and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this movie, however, he tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so he saw a sober editor. If in the second half he was completely on his daily journey, and I just couldn't tell him he would be an editor in some way. Therefore, his film in this film is not enduring. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole attracts and inspires. The nature of Joun is complete and reasonable. Anyway, the film tells a great and complex story. <br /> <br /> The only big drawback is that he did not show the hero and heroine's love story as a turning point. I am completely confused when they can at the end of the story, because it is quite unclear for two people.
