What can I say about this movie? I've seen it quite a few times since I first was about 6. I've seen the English version and it's doing very well. It's a great movie for all ages, but it's more targeted at kids. I love childish humor and appreciate it. If you haven't seen it, you should try a copy to rent, you don't have to be disappointed!
