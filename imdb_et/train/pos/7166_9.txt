Roma, holes, forced me into an education course. I didn't think I wanted a children's novel; plus, the rest of the few books I had to read in the class were very bad. But to my surprise I loved holes. It's really one of the best-written novels I've ever read. I think it has a rare quality that makes it pre-teens, teens and adults enjoyable. Anyone who reads this, I think, is walking from the right person. Although I can't really say that I'm happy to say that it's usually right for them. I don't think the film's viewers are walking away, but they are definitely entertaining without the side effect being stupider when they were sitting. This is a smart story and it is very well said. I think it's moving too fast. The novel takes more time to develop characters. And the setbacks come in and out so quickly that they don't have too much time to register. Earlier interracial romance seems more clich√© and trite than in the novel. And the end that connects all the loose threads seems very ridiculous. This is exactly the same in the novel, but it is an absurd feeling that the film does not exist. It works much better. I also don't like much pop songs. I want Disney not to know that it is necessary to sell soundtracks. The cast is extremely good, from young children to old pros. Jon Voight is especially big. Not sure why we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10
