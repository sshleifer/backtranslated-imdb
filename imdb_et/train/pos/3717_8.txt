It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remember seeing Cracker's bag. Just a beautiful feeling and still bowed. There are some terrible cinematography and the head of a girl is quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of that time. It has a real heart. It's a childhood Achilles wound that is subtle and painful. A simple story is always good. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and one, I look at my next project. Follow-up is always the most difficult thing. It's like another album's blues for most people. I hope his next movie is not like a shark movie. Cheers for everyone. Enjoy your cinema.
