This Academy's award-winning short film can be one of the greatest in the genre. I said completely without dialogue, this is a visual treatment a young boy who buys a goldfish, puts him in a lovable bowl, then goes to school, leaving the gold fish unprotected and the window unresponsively open. After a while, the adjacent orange tabby rises, enters the window and slowly drives the bowl. Fish knows that something is happening and becomes very excited. As the cat goes near the bowl, the fish jumps out. The cat covers the fish, it falls back into the bowl and leaves through a window that he came just like a boy without knowing what happened. It was filmed with amazingly real animals; how Cousteau behaves these animals in this way is remarkable. I want this movie now available to people; I saw it only once, in 1959, when it was initially released, but it is unforgettable.
