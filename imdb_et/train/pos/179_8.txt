The first "side-story" in the universe of the universal century Gundam represents a refreshing new look at the war between the colonies of earth and space. It is no longer a small group of people who play a central role in the conflict, but rather the everyday civilian population and how the war is viewed through their eyes. <br /> <br /> Include some Gundam clips that require ZEON team attempts to catch the experimental Gundam, but this is a plot that made this show interesting. This series focuses on young boys named Alfred and his neighbor Christina Mckenzie, who is secretly a federal pilot and novice Zeon pilot named Bernie Wiseman. Alfred develops a kind of "brotherly love" for Bernie, while our young Zeon pilot also falls for Christina. <br /> <br /> "War in Pocket" proves that you do not need a comprehensive epic story of special people for a good military history. There are no uber ace tickets or large fleet battles here. This short 6 episode of OVA focuses on a much more emotional drama than other topics such as politics or philosophy, and I love the way the characters actually depict. Alfred is your typical daily child who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces are cool. He is then given a terrible reality of war at the time of the crash. Unlikely friendship and tying between Bernie and Christina, anyone who does not know they are soldiers on different sides of the war, is played very real without the romance of drama going beyond. The same applies to loving relationships between Alfred and Bernie. Saying this, I wouldn't want to ruin a lot of the story here, but it makes a lot of fun to watch the tragedies that appear when the show moves all the way to its emotionally devastating twist-end. <br /> <br /> Although this indicator does not work, this example never falls into the "boring" category. The characters are just enough to show the entire exhibition. Don't worry because there are a number of scenes of mobile suits scattered here and there. Everyone is beautifully animated at a level that goes beyond OVA and is sure to have some "mandatory" battles in the Gundam series. <br /> <br /> Normally watching anime in Japanese or English, I would remain a personal preference. But in this case, I strongly recommend the English voice over Japan. Not only are the characters, all of whom are Alfreds, Caucasians, more likely to sound in English, but the performance of English voices is par and even exceeds the Japanese language, bringing every character with realistic emotions and intonations that they simply proclaim by acting in some live TV show. <br /> <br /> In short, this exhibition doesn't try to impress the audience. This means that it provides many warm-hearted topics that will hit the closest to the home, especially the death of the innocent on the battlefield, and the horror of war in the eyes of the child. A truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is given.
