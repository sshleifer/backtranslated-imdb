It is by far the most funny short made by two comic geniuses. From the time they walked, until Hardy just falls off the roof, it keeps me hysterically laughing. I highly recommend that every Laurel and Hardy fan should see it briefly. I also recommend all Ghost Series. If you are looking to laugh, watch this movie and you are happy.
