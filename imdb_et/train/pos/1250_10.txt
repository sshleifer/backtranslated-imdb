It may contain a spoiler so be careful. <br /> <br /> If it had been 200,000 thousand or two million people, would it make a difference? Sometimes I am so angry about the obvious apathy of a small number (strangely very LOUD), but I have to remember that many people here in the United States were not bred or bred to care for anything outside their comfort zone. God will help us in what we have done. After the relative simplicity we took for the native Americans, and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving races, you think we would have grown hearts and souls in the early 60s and 70s. But now I see that it is OK until our goals are just for us. So how can we look at any other dictator and terrible government, and we think we are doing something good to establish our will? We are controversial and hypocritical, and I am ashamed of it. I feel sad about affected people. They deserve justice and return home. If that were my name as an American for my expected safety, I don't want it. I denounce these actions and hope our global community realizes that many Americans believe that the American government is a bad train of fraud. No one is above the law. I want my country back and so do the Chagos islanders. Regardless of what people say about the anonymity of their computers, no one in their hearts can deny that they do not want to give up their generations with a bomb and helicopter. We cannot get caught in traffic, let alone forcibly and unfairly removed from our homes. â€œNone of us, British and American, forget what's going on. Do not be confused that a simpler, more natural civilization is somehow less worthwhile to observe and preserve their rights - when we return to the basic human rights and dignity of 2000, we turn to fundamental human rights. and the dignity of all people.
