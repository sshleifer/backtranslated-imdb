This movie was absolutely wonderful. Pre-partition time and culture are beautifully structured. Urmila has made another great performance. What I really admire about this film is that he does not use a Pakistani bashing that runs victim to films such as Gadar and LOC. If a partition is a background, the film will not be directed to political issues, nor will it focus on violence or what is right and wrong. At the heart of the film is always the tragic story of Urmila's life. His fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpa is perfectly illustrated. The film shows how people, both Hindus and Muslims, have suffered from this partition. In this movie, there is really a common theme that is just one religion.
