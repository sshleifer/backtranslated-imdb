This is a great example of what can be done with a low budget movie. Operation is great considering the script and the whole movie's atmosphere is very predictive. Gore is well done and is used sparingly (pay attention to excellent barbed wire death). The truth is that the script sometimes has some rain at times, but compared to other movies with the same (or larger!) Budget, it's not at all noticeable. In general, it is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it seems! 8/10
