It was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It hit exactly what Bulimia actually touches and how it is not always skinny and dieting. It showed how people with bulimia think about things like their life, their friends and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows what is Bulimia's problem is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This line really showed a lot of character and the same problem with others. This showed that the people of Bulimia do not have this problem because there is something related to someone else. It is related to them and only to them. This shows that it is time to talk about a person with a problem instead of drawing attention. It showed that Beth had to pay attention at this point and he needed most of his mother's attention at that time.
