One of the best Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers movies. Great music by Irving in Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn. My eggs in one basket. "The last song is introduced by Astaire, who plays jazz piano and then the cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings" Let Yourself Go "with Grable for backup singers." Get Thee Behind Me "is a song that sticks to you in the days. But where are you? "Fast and fast, this record is one of the best in the Astaire-Rogers series. The classic and amazing finale," Let's Face the Music and Dance "is one of their best-known numbers. glowing another number that dances (with the weight of the legs) around his feet and is also slightly visible, just proud, this is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters gave up to heaven in Pennies, fortunately he doesn't try to sing or dance. Grable and Ball would have been bigger in 1936, but they have little scenes and little effect. Allwyn has a bigger role, but it's just OK. /> <br /> Fun all the time, even though I was tired of "We joined the Navy" third time.
