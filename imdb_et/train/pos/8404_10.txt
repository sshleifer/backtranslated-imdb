Just a thoughtless, but good-hearted blog from a simple but good-hearted high school graduate who has the dreams of having the coolest custom van in the world to use as his "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Our hero Bobby spends all his savings on acquiring his dream vehicle. Sharing and the love that begins with girls with Bobby has picked up in the local pizza salon, but he finds a lot of responsibility, danger and heartbreak at the owner of such mechanical admiration. <br /> <br /> I'm guilty of joy. It includes the mood of the mid-1970s and has enough inadvertent humor to put it in such a "bad good" category.
