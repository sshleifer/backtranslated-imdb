This is a CGI animated film based on the French 2D animated series. The series ran briefly on the Cartoon Network, but its run was so short that incorporating it into one potential Oscar nominee for this year's best animated film was left by most people I know, "Huh?" This is the story of Lian-Chus, a heart muscle and Gwizdos, the brains of surgery who, together with Hector, with his fire-dropping dragon, are more like a dog. Travel the world by offering your services as a dragon player, but never pay. Zoe, the king's loving brother who goes blind, comes to his life. It seems that a huge monster eats the world, and all the knights put out by the king have never come back, or when they come back, they come back as ashes. In desperation, the king hires a hunting ground to stop the world from eating. Of course Zoe is by ... <br /> <br /> What can I say, why does this film hide under the stone? This is a really good movie that is completely out of the radar when it is unlikely that an Oscar competitor is. Its beautifully designed, fantastic-looking film (the world in which it takes place) is floating lands and crazy creatures that had to keep me going "Wow". The first is the English voice that comes with Forrest Whitaker like Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi). The script, which does not speak to your audience, is also the same, using some real expressions that are not usually heard in movies (neither Disney nor Pixar). It's all really well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some bits are moving for too long, but at the same time it is funny entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you can see it. This is one of the 2008 best animated films and will be in 2009 as my nice surprise list.
