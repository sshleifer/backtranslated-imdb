I've always been a big fan of James Bond! I've seen almost all movies except the second day of death, and the world isn't enough. Graphics are all or nothing breathtaking! Voice talents ......... WOW! I LOVE PIERCE BROSNAN! She is finally Bond in video game! He's BOND! I liked past Bond games: Goldeneye, The World Is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire and Nightfire. This is definitely the best! Finally, Mr Brosnan, (do I call him a tribute to Mr Brosnan? Yes, I get!) He was phenomenally exciting to listen to the video game ....... LONG LAST! DUH! I have seen her with Robin Williams and I tell you that they are doing a great team. Pierce Brosnan is a funny, evil nice (I want to say badly in good ways) and only one of those actors you would like to walk around and hand and hug, saying, "Pierce Brosnan, thank you James Bond," "If it weren't for you for, then I don't know who James Bond is. "He's a great actor! I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe, even though I've seen him in a few movies. His role as Nikolai Diavalo was great. (Did I write the character correctly?) LOL !!!! She puts great emphasis on the accent. Sometimes I can't even hear the accent. I've seen Willem, I mean Mr Dafoe, there are two films: Finding Nemo and Spider-Man with my favorite actor: KIRSTEN DUNST! SHOWS! Anyway, He won't be amazed anymore. And Richard Kiel, wow, is definitely part of Jawi's nail. I saw her in the movie and she's fantastic! In fact, my grandfather has met with Mr. Kiel and I was jealous when they told me. But Kirsten Dunst is on my Celebritie list of what I want to meet. John Cleese was breathtaking. I've never seen a better person playing Q, which is a wisecracking and gadget. Mr. Cleese was fun! I've seen her with Pierce Brosnan at Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. He's fantastic! John Cleese's latest project is Shrek 2, with Prime Minister Mike Myer, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew and Eddie Murphy. (Shrek 2 is now in the theater!) GOOD LUCK 007! Yes, and when Q alway says, "Grow 007!"
