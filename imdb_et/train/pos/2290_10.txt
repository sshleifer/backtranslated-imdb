As Alan Rudolph's "Champions' Breakfast" slides little into fanfare and many generations of theaters, it makes me think until 1996 when Keith Gordon's "Mother's Evening" came out. Now that Kurt Vonnegut says it is "unclear", it is surprising that he has received two excellent cinematographic treatments (the second "slaughterhouse way"). "Mother's Evening" is definitely one of the worst-rated films of the decade and I don't understand why. It's great! It is almost completely loyal to the book of Vonnegut (without being passionate or excessive literature) and adds purely cinematic poetry to it. How many of the author's work's film adaptations require it? Vonnegut himself even puts a hero on the end of the movie, and can you ask for better approval? Not only is it a beautiful movie, it is a beautifully written, written and directed film, and it is one of my decades of five or more American films. This is a grieving, inspired, surreal masterpiece that is not worthy of attention. I would encourage everyone to see "Mother's Evening" - it is not even aware of Vonnegut's work to fully understand it (like the "slaughterhouse way"). It is powerful, affecting the cinema.
