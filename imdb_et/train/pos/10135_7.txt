What starts with a very predictable and somewhat drab is finally fun and fun. The "right to die" is not very tense, but it is more than some extreme sets and the top edge. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here: <br /> <br /> Up the credit go to Martin Donovan's dead show as one of the most despicable characters ever to enjoy. Playing a character in a big "off" way, you feel almost frustrated when his big plan finally fails. Corbin Bernsen also looks at the landscape by playing a not-so-good man who just gets his desserts. <br /> <br /> Spoiler ends. <br /> <br /> The dead flick, "The Right to Die" benefits from its performers and it is more than one hour less than one hour.
