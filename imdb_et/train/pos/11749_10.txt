Finally we get the TV series where we see the actor talent! The episode one was great! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, there was still "I am not your father - I am your father and the omigos whom you deceived me!" garbage, but the script allowed participants to really feel and live those real moments, instead of showing us what it would be like to make so many TV soaps. <br /> <br /> The camera's work also gave us much more than usual, repeated hours were not boring, but there were no unnecessary shots or camera tools. the artistic "edge" also gave us what we needed to see, as well as beautiful landscape pictures! <br /> <br /> Nothing was too dramatic or melodic because they were real people in real situations, the drama was nothing drama and it was quite appropriate. It was such a relief that it would be open to real action and so good to let our country see how talented our actors can be a real script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, ten channels and all the cast and teamwork! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are very welcome and will not go unnoticed!
