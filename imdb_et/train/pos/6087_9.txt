I saw it in the first few weeks of the movie because I didn't remember exactly when. This movie is not a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about them. Or, as I said, you have a good sense of humor. For this couple, I saw people had nothing to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating, but I would have given this bigger film, I thought, was very good and it should have been better rated. Maybe it's not a movie for you. I'm just giving you another person's opinion.
