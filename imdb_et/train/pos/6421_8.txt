"Men of Honor" - a true story with a gorgeous and persistent black naval diver (fabulous Cuban Gooding Jr) is definitely an excellent film that both touch and entertain and is part of the absolute shell of the new millennium cinema. Wonderful action is the main reason why this movie is truly special and quite enjoyable, a great experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful because the tough, fierce and merciless leader Billy Sunday - the role he has written for him. This movie, with a fantastic "15 minutes" (2001), is the last proof that he is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "Honor Men" includes Cuban Gooding Jr., who has been one of the most promising young black actors from "Boyz's Hood". "Honor men" goes straight to "Jerry Maguire", "as good as it gets" and "instinct". Gooding Jr. Cuban is a skilful and fantastic actor and I am ready to get a lot more terrible movies about him. "Honored Men" is also a pretty great story and probably the most exciting film history. This is a great, exciting movie and I can only recommend it.
