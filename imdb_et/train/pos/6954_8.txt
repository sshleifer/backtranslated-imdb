This movie was one of the funniest films I've seen for years, and the audience's laughs support me. Not because my big fat Greek wedding (2002) has been laughing just as spontaneous and intense. It's just as difficult as last year's Mr and Mrs Smith (2005) using the parody (espionage by Mr and Mrs Smith and the sex of my Super Ex-Girlfriend). The great leader is Ivan Reitman's balance between comedy and drama, crazy and ridiculous. Never will shock and dramatic serious comedy rule. However, this predictable romantic comedy does not lose its touching emotional elements, even when the end is broadcast. In some ways, it's so obvious that it's nice to see how it plays. Just like in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that it can't really be seen. With the company Tootsie (1982) ranked eight out of ten stars. Maybe nine (depends on how it appears on the second view).
