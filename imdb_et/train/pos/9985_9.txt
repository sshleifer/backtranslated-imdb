I recently saw this movie in Winnipeg - relevant considering the location used. I first read Lawrence's book in the 1970s and for me it has always been a very powerful picture of the aging process in our society. It resonated when I was young, and it resonates even more. When the movie came out, I saw that the story could stay. and it was thoroughly impressive, especially for Ellen Burstyn's results. He manages to give us a complete person, although the character is generally harsh and judicious - someone with whom you would not like to live. It's nice to see that your favorite characters are so authentic.
