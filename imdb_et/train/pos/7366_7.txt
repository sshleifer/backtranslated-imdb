This is a film that the mainstream market is unlikely to ever get away with, because it doesn't give the viewer a precise view. The story of Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night movie, but he has his own unique edge and I found it to be fun. There are moments of brilliance, given that the film is made with such a low budget, for example, when Spike breathes into an aerosol. But I did not understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and, frankly, I spent most of the film trying to develop it. And I did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with talking to two friends and not really with 'action'. This is a small film that is difficult to watch and makes it attractive.
