I think when "Beat Street" made a national look, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one break dance scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. This was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only film that could attack "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose" because both films focused on how people used dance to express their ultimate feelings. </p> <p> </p> Beat Street comes just before the middle and end of the flap. And I loved them all. Almost all of the breakpoints were in fracture scenes: laureate, burns, head spins, suicide sitting, crazy feet, mortal , forward flip, figure four --- almost all. /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" is a violence related to gang life in the hip hop world ... but much less violent than the first. " Beat Street's only big battle was when the graffiti artist Ramon (which was shortened in the movie as "Ramo") is a lined up gang member on the New York subway lines ..... fighting with each other on the rail and both dying on this rail by electric shock. The scene ended tragically, it was better for them to die as they burst into the blood. <br /> <br /> Most of the Christmas exchanges were graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap music. because hip-hop members used it rapmu music as a departure from the negative aspects of gang life. Even the movie's song, which closed the curtain, was not just a respect for hip-hop culture - it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. By the way, in the dance scene, called "Tango, Tango", I think she was E. She, who made an obvious look in the female bands orchestra led by actor Rae Dawn Chong.
