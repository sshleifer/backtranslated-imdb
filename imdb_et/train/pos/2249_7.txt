I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found that it was a positive and largely true image of the LDS faith. I think this epic journey over the plain would be beneficial because many people today do not feel the challenges and persecutions faced by the early Mormon church. It is an incredible story of strong and dedicated people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the Church, one of the most disturbing aspects of the film (most historical inaccuracies did not bother me much). Brigham Young as one who "knowingly deceived" the members of the church to believe he was invited to be Joseph's successor as a prophet. Although I understand the dramatic causes of this plot line, it gives the impression that his suspicions in this regard are a historical fact when Brigham and a large part of the members of the Church firmly believe and was believed to be called to lead the Church. Brigham does not deceive the saint consciously; rather, he led them with confidence by inspiration. The point is important for the Mormons, because it has an important part of our faith: that God really speaks to the prophets today and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was inspired by God's prophet. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you believe this statement, just know that the film doesn't exactly reflect what Brigham himself believed.
