I thought the original of this film was charming and charming, and I sat on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Since I already saw this original when I saw it on Sci Fi Channel - I don't know if this remake was deliberately made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was in the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burg's character as an actor, I wanted to see how he would pull it out. <br /> <br /> Writers / producers, etc., modernized the film a bit, trying to explain the "difficult situation of aliens" (They could no longer reproduce their character and the necessary help) using the same pseudo science that has been squeezed in our ears in the 1990s. Maybe it added some polishing to the film. <br /> <br /> This film, film? This production takes a more distinctive edge than the original - the original ended up in a confrontation between a young woman and an alien, and there was an understanding even though the alien's problem was not solved. <br /> <br /> I remember that in this transformation the woman became quite hostile to Burg / Alien because I think it might have been better, but the end is just the end, and the yarn is an expanded yarn, 1958. 50 many great science fiction stories have been written and some even made a movie. <br /> <br /> This is an expanding thing to look like a rainy day or something. for the make-up, it came well. I really enjoyed it quite a bit. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wants to tell this story to WELL, I offer the original version of 1958 with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
