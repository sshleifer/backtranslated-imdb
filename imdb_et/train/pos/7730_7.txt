In the 1990s, when you adjust a book written in the 1950s, set a bloody thing in the 50s and not in the 90s. See, the 40-year-old moles and values ​​do not tend to play or be true to the way you go. It's a simple rule that Hollywood has been constantly breaking. And that is the problem with this movie. It should have been in the era when it was written. You think it would be a non-brainer, but no. I would work out, but the bmacv's comment shows it quite well. I'm limiting my comments to Rachel Ward. She looks like she has taken her ass completely out of her role in the diet. As a result, he looks like chemotherapy, and is as sexy as a gay leather couch. I found that he "I could die at any time" seems rather uncomfortable, and it greatly damaged his supposed "heat" and "sexual tension" that the film was created. Moreover, the film was pretty good; 7+ out of 10.
