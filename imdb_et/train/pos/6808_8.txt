The 1967 Cold Blood was perhaps a "real thing" (think about it: would we really like to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in the color world, and many people didn't even know what it was, and there was a chance for this television to do it. In addition, if you prepare it again, you can show some things that are not shown in the original. Truman Capote's book "Cold Blood" was the first "novel of knowledge". Truman's book was not really a story. I thought Canada's location in Canada was enough for a TV movie. Look for elements of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roles: Dick's feminine, Perry is an aspirin junkie, Perry plays a blues guitar.
