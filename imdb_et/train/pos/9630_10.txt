I've seen Dirty Work several times and is probably my favorite Stan and Ollie short. <br /> <br /> There are Stan and Ollie chimney sweepers and work at the home of Professor Noodle to clean the chimney. Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle is making mad experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie are causing many chaos to clean the chimney and into the living room. The end is where Ollie gets into a special formula tank that Noodle uses for her experiments and it makes her a chimp! The best part is where Ollie falls on the chimney and loads the bricks on the ground, but it doesn't seem like much pain. <br /> <br /> Dirty work is Stan's and Ollie's most fun. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.
