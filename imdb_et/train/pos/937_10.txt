When it was originally launched in 1984, my wife and I did it for my first VHS recorder. I still have this aging tape that I try to watch every year. It was the year my first child was born, and seeing the Christmas carol in this embodiment brings back pleasant memories of happy times - many hours spent with this film in the background. Finally, I finally broke this year and ordered a DVD that drove me for a moment to write this short reaction to the film. The story of Charles Dickens is perfectly modified here. George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and completely believable as Scrooge. Supporting cast is equally remarkable. This is, in my opinion, a flawless production. Small details add a lot to pleasure. "Similes" Scrooge's nephew and wife play with their party guests. (I've recreated my high school English students ever since then to classical work!) Frankly, I can think of a few ways to enjoy myself while on holiday while I enjoy CBS production that was originally sponsored by IBM. (By the way, it's fun to watch the old tape original IBM ads ... which show how many computers have evolved for 21 years. Amazing how things have changed!) Bottom line: Christmas Carol is a timeless story, and this rendition is timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, everyone!
