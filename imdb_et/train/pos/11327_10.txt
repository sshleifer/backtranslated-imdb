this film probably had a $ 750 budget and managed to surpass Titanic. I rented the day when I fell into my mother's car and that was the only thing that brought me to believe! it must be related to "Killer Bimbos Help". The things to look for are as follows: 1. Boost your work with the Chinese girl scene 2. Blade strength in the shoelace that never changes 3. Flinstone-like beating while driving 4. The red-headed band before she gets killed (don't worry, don't worry) I do not break any surprise because it is so predictable. 6. A spiritual patient who has convincing work because he is pushing manquen's eyes out. 7. A long end of graduation, involving a teacher and a priest. 8. Writing women on the bathroom wall. 9. Last but not least, excellent special effects - especially the bulging boy that did ... heaven helps me ... popping noise. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br />
