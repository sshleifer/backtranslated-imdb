I do not know why people always want a deeper meaning in the film or have thought it meaningless. <br /> <br /> What is entertainment? Something Morgan Freeman looks like. He'll be able to show little. Paz Vega, his co-star, gets a career and Brad Silberling gets the name to lead people to watch his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some stamens, some bittersweetness, but nothing from above. I got a special kick from Jim Parsons as administrator of a construction company. When he looks at Freeman adorably and says, "You want me to be a woman." He's just having fun. Vega's fight between her former husband and his girlfriend is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a cute, charming movie that makes you smile. You could do a lot, much worse.
