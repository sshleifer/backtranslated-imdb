Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wender's American friend. Innocent Nick Cage can work. Dennis Hopper plays the real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero becomes more confused, the more he tries to free himself. And a small town in America does not seem to be the safest than a big city. As mentioned above, this film has many plot twists that seem unlikely, but which all lead to cathartic self-discovery.
