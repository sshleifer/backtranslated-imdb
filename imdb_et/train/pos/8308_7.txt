On a musical Sunday it is appropriate to pump your heart and no one can do it better than Little Richard. The man could roll the tables with the ladies and the stones. <br /> <br /> Look at Leon for the final character as he has done with David Ruffin at The Temptations and Jackie Wilson for Mr. Rock's 'n' Roll: Alani's released story. <br /> <br /> It was an exciting biopsy when we saw Little Richard fighting his father, his church, and himself with just what he was. He won the battle and no one else has their own voice or style.
