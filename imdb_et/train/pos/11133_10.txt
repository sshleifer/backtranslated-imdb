Although I love this movie, I can hardly watch it, it's so real. So, I put it this evening and hid behind my computer bank. I remembered it vividly, but just wanted to see if I could find something I didn't see before ........ I didn't do it because it's so real for me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" wrote the age of the commentators and their summary. I'm all for that! It is quite obvious that most of the people who have commented on "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born when it was released. They mention other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared later. I'm just as stupidly honest: I'm 82 years old. If you are familiar with another comment, you need to know that I was a 60-year-old professional female of those years who has also appeared on the film - you never know me, even if you are familiar with my nightclub person. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this movie? YOU WANT! .... <br /> <br /> ... and I'm not least ashamed. If you haven't got any of them, it's your loss - but you have a great chance, but just didn't know it. So many mothers, fathers, sons and daughters could surprise you. It should not be a secret WHAT participants / actors have appeared on the "Midnight Cowboy" background. Who is the judge? I can name a few of the current BIG-TIME stars that were raised on the stunning streets of many cities, and they were less spent there. I do not make a decision because they are people, just as we are all - love, courage, goodness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name attributes, they all exist, regardless of the package. <br /> <br /> "Trivia" about Hoffman, who actually comes up on the streets to prove he could play the role of "Ratzo", is a pearl - he is visible that he is driving his car all over Los Angeles - how are you do you think he will get his contribution? I can also name a lot of men-stars who have stood on the streets and traveled for bars for money. Although the nightclub, where I last worked for 26 years, was world-famous and legitimate, I can also name some of the tremendous letters that had to take our back-street constantly out in search of pick-up. <br /> <br /> It should not be a surprise today, although it is definitely an activity in Hollywood and other big and small cities. Wake up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they have a different tone. <br /> <br /> Some of the "users" thoughts "Joe Buck" were broken by his grandmother. Although I saw her in bed with a boy, I couldn't find it. Believe it or not, kids have not always had their own spaces - because it's black, you should say something to you today that something can happen in the master bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have asked for a change in the streets, but some "users" suggest that Jon Voight was not a big star in filming "Midnight Cowboy" - his real salary would have surprised you. I think he was kidnapped! No one doubts the clarity he has put on his role, nor that he has celebrated Him for such great work as "Exemption". He defined a strong man who had conquered his devils and was better for him: few people commented that he had been sodomized in this film. At the end of the 1960s, one may be one of the first open films, but society has always been in the hip. <br /> <br /> I didn't find any homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe" - they were clearly opposed to each other. They found a much cleaner relationship - true friendship. If you didn't realize that at the end of the movie, you wasted your time. "Joe" confusion was obvious, but the invisible commitment was obvious. Yes, Voight deserves the Oscar for the role that John Wayne could never pull out, and he was just as beautiful in his youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - waiting for fireworks. He excelled them perfectly. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this movie was beautifully defined - if you don't think they're still around, you're wrong. "Party"? - Visit some younger people who participate ..... when you get in. See the lines of people trying to get into hot clubs - you'll see all the unheard of personalities. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was an exponent of the society's sleek women who occasionally got involved. If you were shocked by his brilliant behavior, you mean "it's not real", look at today's "women" who live on the shoulder line ... and are admired for it. <br /> <br /> Brutality "Joe", which is displayed as a kidnapping of an old boy, is, unfortunately, part of life. You don't have to accept it, but it's not too different from any kind of violence. "Joe" said his goal sharply - in this situation, I would have handed over the money faster if he asked for it. This is one of the scenes that makes this movie a breakthrough that I don't see. I have broken for both ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger definitely has to be familiar with the brightness to lead this coolly beautiful eye opener-Waldo Salt did not write out of sight. Anyone with any part of the screen must have realized that they are making history and should be proud of this honesty. Perhaps "only in America" ​​we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers do not have to present it to the public. Not looking at it doesn't mean it's not there - give me the truth every time. Bravo! everyone ......
