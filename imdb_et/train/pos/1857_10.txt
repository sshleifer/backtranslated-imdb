This movie was incredible. I recommend it to someone, much better than what I had anticipated. It was definitely an impressive film close to the heart. This is an amazing story with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another big movie with Denzel Washington. (no one should be surprised) Derek Luke did a great job.
