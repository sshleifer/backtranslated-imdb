Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny's" theme has been recycled from many different years. This theme extends from such plots of recent spoofs (see "Scrooged") to the same, more serious and dramatic idea that worked "It's a wonderful life" and a century ago the story of Scroog, as Charles Dickens said. "Christmas Carol." â€œIt means an ungrateful man who is taken to his guided tour and witnesses how his life could have been (or would have been) the first time. <br /> <br /> In most of these films, the guardian rescues the man from gratitude and reveals his life or how it might have been. Should have been. In this case, we will be shown a businessman Larry (James Belushi) who hates his life. He lives with an unmistakable wife (Linda Hamilton) and has a greater meaning for a greater life, if only he had hit the ball at the national championship decades ago, he is convinced that his life would have been better. he will probably remember it for a small lifetime, because it had a profound effect on his subconscious, but I doubt that the grown-up person would want to do one thing in high school, but it works in the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Larry is driving home from work in the evening, where he is with Jon Lovitz when the hi car breaks down. He travels to a bar that looks for a pay phone, and decides reluctantly to tell the bartender (Michael Caine) how his life changes. This is where we see him for the first time to remember the breaking of his childhood baseball. <br /> <br /> The camp's listener and knockers will probably not worry about other customers. This is probably due to the fact that the bar, though old and split, has never lived by any living person, to save the two men. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about not seeing the bar before. This is probably for a reason that the audience is waiting for Larry. So a bartender who can be an angel of God, like Clarence, fixes Larry's special drink that leads Larry's life upside down, showing him what his life would have been like if he had hit home all these years earlier. But Larry had no change at first, as Jimmy Stewart did not know that Clarence had extinguished his life until he went to the bar and went out. Larry still hasn't changed before he goes home to find a lawn unlike the outside and a big, wrestling-type man who lives in his home. <br /> <br /> Larry will soon discover that his life would be very different. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, she married Rene Russo and moved to a large kindergarten. He thinks that Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend, but his employee. And the most surprising fact is that his new life is that Larry has always wanted ... he finds himself lusting after his old wife Linda Hamilton; Evidence that sometimes money and a great but low woman in her life do everything, such as a smart woman and love and true happiness. Just as "This is a wonderful life" showed the public the life of a man he does, and that every person has an impact on people, "Mr. Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth, the lesson taught us over and over, but never as fluffy, forgotten and truly sweet as it is shown to us by "Mr Destiny". <br /> <br /> Mr. Destiny is never a lot of fun, but it's a sweet, good-hearted comedy that doesn't take you too seriously. The problem for all "It's a wonderful life" is recovering there, as the "Family Man" is that they try to be as influential and memorable as "It's a wonderful life". But there are only so many times when you can cut the famous movie with one hand, and "Mr. Destiny" knows it and plays the right to that fact. It is not trying to be something that is not; Rather, it is something he was not trying to do, and that is obvious to the public. <br /> <br />
