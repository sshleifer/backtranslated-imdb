This wonderful 1983 BBC television production (not the movie, as others have written here) from the classic love story "Jane Eyre", starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke Jane, is the best version to date. because it is as credible as the concept and dialogue for the Charlotte Bronte novel. classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; When filmmakers begin to intervene in the classical, highly viable, this class is destroyed. Luckily, the producers of this "Jane Eyre" went to the original with respect and loyalty, resulting in a remarkably addictive performance that is worth seeing many times, enjoying the richness of sweetness and joy and intercourse. The performances are strange, the music is just right, even the gothic design of the house and the pictures taken in the open air are beautiful and suitable for production. My only criticism, albeit small, is that this version, like any other version made by Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's world, she didn't think twice about Jane's situation, but stayed with Rochester when she learned she had a crazy woman and she was still married to her. "Oh, divorce," he said to his husband, or to live with him in sin. But Jane Eyre knew she could not satisfy this course in life and respect. Why? This decision was based on the Christian faith he had taught since childhood, not on brutal Calvinist low institutions, but on the Christian model of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was rather martyred rather than a second cheek. One day I would like to see some version of these effects slightly more than just adjusting them. A classic novel ending with the heroine writing "Even so, Lord Jesus!" should not exclude the foundations of this faith.
