Walter Matthau and George Burns were famous Vaudeville comedies, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau personally accepted it and has been frightening since then. Such a fun Neil Simon game made for the film is such a premise. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in their main, and the material is more fun than anything you find today. Richard Benjamin looks like Matthau's nephew and agent. There are even old clips of real stars from the golden age to enter the film, and the character actor Fritz Feld starts it all with "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who started in the 30s with Orson Welles and later was grandmother in "Family affairs", has a very small role to play. <br /> <br /> The only problem that I had (and maybe it is too selective and / or serious) is how Matthau treats Burns for the first time. It is allowed that he has a lot of annoyance in all these years, but some of the things he does are considered to be rude or just the usual bad ways. I'm also used to Matthau's behavior in other films, but not to George Burns. And Matthau's bellowing tends to be a bit old. All in all, if you need a consistently funny movie to help and forget your worries, put it in "Sunshine Boys". They raise your spirits and think for a simpler time and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to slip it." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait. I think you have to slip it."
