The fact that I still think about a decade later is what really talks about the movie. For me, it confirms the Grand Canyon as a film that touches you in one way or another. I really believe that before Crash was the Grand Canyon. The biggest difference between the two films, in my opinion, is the timing of their release. I'm not saying which one is better, but I say they share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this issue. I'll start with the comment you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to post other movie-related topics that we can share because I have a real love for the movie.
