<br /> <br /> I saw Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old - I threw my parents to take me three times. I started searching for this video about five years ago, finally discovered a copy on the online auction site, but I would like to see it when the new dealer got it back and out again (I understand that the original video was small) or have the rights that The Family buys Channel, Disney, etc. This is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life of the North Japanese fox family, spoken by a clever old tree. A great soundtrack welcomes the movie well. Today it would be a good seller, better than many weak deals on children's movies today.
