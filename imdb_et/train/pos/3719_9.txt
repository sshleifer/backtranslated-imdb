Just got it at the Toronto International Film Festival. That's a good story, convincingly. A hand-held camera approach to documents added to the intensity of these scenes (documentary style, not Blair's witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he doesn't need a big budget to create a cinematic film. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, especially the actress who played the film in the focus of Boz.
