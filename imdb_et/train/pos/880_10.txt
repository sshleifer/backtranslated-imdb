Probably the best film for me. This small French movie center is appointed by Secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who spends her day creating other men's jobs that are unchecked and who are the source of their shameful and lunchtime conversation that is too clear for her because she is partly deaf, lips reads . The change is at the beginning when she hires a recently paralyzed con Paul (Vincent Cassel) as his assistant. The relationship between them is the centerpiece of the film. Interdependence binds them for very different reasons. Carla attracts Paul and the fact that she makes her feel attractive, which seems for the first time. Paul does not make his feelings scattered because he needs his help. He owes money to a local gangster and is a plan to steal him, which involves Carla's ability to read his lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film over medium distance / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the film, no matter what other characters are on the screen, you can feel this amazing link between Carla and Paul. I do not remember when I have seen such sexual chemistry between two participants. Emmanuell Devos gives an excellent performance (she won French Cesar for the best actor). You never know you're watching an actor, it's actually Carla. Chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also great. It makes somewhat unappealing the character so appealing and attractive. I loved this movie for the two people, and both times when I finished watching it, I wanted to go back to the cinema and get them involved again.
