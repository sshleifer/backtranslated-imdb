One of France's newest waves of the latest classics. For the direction, Jean Eustache drew the beginning of a century of cinema simplicity; for the story, Eustache pulled his life of tricky love into torment. There are so many things to say about this movie - spectacularly brilliant; self-consciously superfluous; sometimes fun; emotionally draining ... etc. etc. In my opinion, the complaints about this film are overshadowed by its numerous strengths. Any movie student, writer, or just anyone who wants to work with a 3-hour movie without any sharp cuts, music videos, no soap opera-like plot twists, and no banal dialogue should watch this movie. Everything must be admired: in writing (short, smart, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone is just perfect in their roles) and in a simple direction (the viewer knows the film as a random observer). movie unforgettable. This is undoubtedly a movie that will stay with you.
