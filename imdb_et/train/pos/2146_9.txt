I just saw this lovely Japanese feature film at the fifth Roger Ebert Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although this movie, which is subtitled in English, has been dancing in its dance hall, the film really shows the world outside Japan, how rigid structures of family, employment (salaryman) and holidays are in Japan today. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese practice presentation (last name) and first name (last name)] use a not so popular dance theme to show Japan's social structure. <br /> <br /> [Also, I don't use movie name names if world-wide readers may not know Japanese official names that may be confusing. I refer to <br /> <br /> actors as their professional actress listed on the Internet Data Movie Base.] He increases his real spouse, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in his first and so far only on film. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. Yet his real goal is to compete once again in the international dance competition he was disqualified in the past. No, I'm not saying "why." Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the movie. Since 1979, he has been about 25 movie veterans who are giving the 40s the pound sterling <br /> <br /> who has a lovely wife, teenage daughter and just bought her house. <br /> <br /> longing. <br /> <br /> Yet something is missing from your inner happiness. Watch this movie to find out how she "dances" with dance halls and goes secretly. Most dance marks are exempt from the traditional Japanese social hierarchy. They are friendly and warm and invite. Of course, this is in stark contrast to the structure of Japanese society, which is the "place for all and for everyone". <br /> <br /> The movie has so many funny moments. Many 1500 comic moments at the time, nearly 1,500 theater guests were spontaneously laughing. This proves that comedy has no foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is both funny and brilliant as well as Watanabe Erin. They are two funny character actresses. <br /> <br /> You can buy and read a college book on the structure of Japanese life, or you can watch this fine film and understand how <br /> Japanese people grow in a rather rigid social structure. Vaadate's movie "Are We Dansu?" is a quick complementary study and other Japanese movies. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's charming, it makes you cry a little and it warms your heart. <br /> <br />
