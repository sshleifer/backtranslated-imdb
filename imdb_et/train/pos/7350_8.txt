well i was a teenager when i saw the movie .. the songs were a huge hit, but the elite remained govinda movies, then coz watching govinda and karishma (aka karizma) movies was nothing for this class, but anyway many people liked it because the series of films turned through the 90s and most of them were successful ... today I was watching this again and I remembered that there were a lot of people and the rebellion they had created when the song came on the table, the govinda and karishma dresses were free for each other ( the worst dew of this time) and charisma in the late 90s, but govinda is still very loyal to his designer, as his dress feeling remains the same ... but then all confused that it was all good .. everything worked and slowly realized the elite class what fun this lack and then ..... did not look back on this iodine because it went to n to make them from India by some but loved by the mass. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time for nothing to rent or watch on TV, I think you will not regret it ... but remember the worst thing is your best .. <br /> <br /> I still watch these movies when I can coz i cant stop laughing ... so I say go and have a good time when there are times when we all love stupidity and specially when it comes to the kings of their era, it's definitely traceable ... I recommend it to all film students ...
