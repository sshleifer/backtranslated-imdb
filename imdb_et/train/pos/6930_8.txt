It's a rather unusual and unique little west that is mostly original thanks to its story that revolves around a unique and better Winchester 1873 rifle and all those who get this movie at one or another point. <Br /> <br /> This is usually a very fun movie to watch, but not really western. The film received a traditional 40's / 50's Western genre film making style, so lovers of the genre should not be turned off because of this extraordinary basic assumption. <br /> <br /> Because the gun is actually the main plot device on the movie, it allows the story to follow a number of characters characterizing the movies, all of which are naturally connected and the story ends all the way. Without it, watching a movie would have been rather dirty, because the story often jumps from one dangerous incident to another, with constantly different characters. It is quite amazing how they managed to put Wyatt Earp in it all. But this is not really a criticism. I liked that the movie and its story were original and how the movie seemed to be one event to another. It gave the film a bit of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> This is also a very good looking movie. I liked what the film used, and it seems quite amazing that it was actually the first western director of Anthony Mann. Luckily, he later went into the western countries, which often also celebrated James Stewart's mainstream. <br /> <br /> It was a fairly bold choice to choose James Stewart as the main stove. He is one of the softest and most polite-looking and acting actors, so he seems to be a tough gunslinger. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and it shows how versatile and truly capable an actor was. <br /> <br /> There are also some other surprising players in the movie who are not often associated with this genre. Shelley Winters plays female lead as well as later well-known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis in some small roles. <br /> <br /> A real western with many activities and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
