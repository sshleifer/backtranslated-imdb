"Convicts" is a very third thing about film. All the dialogue and the interplay of character in it occurs late in the long southern wind. And more broadly, the life of this main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration between director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier, they worked with "The Trip to Bountiful", a film that seems almost packed in comparison to this activity. Masterson may not be a good director. In fact, he is just barely enough. Slow pace leaves a lot of room for operator Toyomichi Curitis to infuse the film with a feeling of light and heat. <br /> <br /> Because it is essentially a filmed game, with little effort to edit or master, it all works. As far as I am concerned, there are no mistakes here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, the two best American actresses (both born in January 1931), create completely real characters who are not interested in life. Lukas Haas, a young actor I knew from the "Testament" and "The Witness", plays very much like his other early roles. He's quiet, withdrawn, a little scared and sad, somehow. These are the qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is a title like "Convicts" in this movie service. This title, along with the opening screen, seems to create a picture of much higher western images. If slow-paced productions don't interest you awfully, you'll want to pass it on. Otherwise, this may be the movie you want to do more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
