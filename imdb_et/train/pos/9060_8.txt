I saw it at the age of 8 today. I thought it was cute. I agree with another poster that it was not a book I remember, but we still enjoyed it. All the kids are pretty good and everything is fun. Billy is a new boy who accepts the courage to tempt school to eat 10 worms a day. If he loses, he must go to school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the film is designed to show that Billy has very weak stomach and peaks almost everything. Hilarity arises in a variety of ways to produce worms. A good message against bullying and of course a happy ending.
