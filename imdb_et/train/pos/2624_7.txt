In this movie, there is a great opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumba in the movie, if they aren't shown - what's a lot! This film even goes back to Simba and (presumably) just after Kiara was born. <br /> <br /> As for the first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)" is a funny, fun, exciting and surprising movie (or sequel if you want to invite it). Surprisingly, surprises and fun await you. <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumbaa watch a movie at the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbal have an argument about what "Lion King" is about to watch when Timon wants to go to where he and Pumbaa come and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very honest compromise on their story about watching a movie that is waiting ... It starts at Timon's first home ... <br /> <br /> For anyone with a good sense of humor, who liked the first films of almost any age enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
