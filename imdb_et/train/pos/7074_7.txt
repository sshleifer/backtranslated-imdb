Terry Gilliam traveled to the future (he had already done so in "Brazil") to talk about the story of a virus that destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> The script is totally crazy with some simple tricks, but it's quite fun and Gilliam proves she has imagination (futuristic scenes are just big). As for the pain, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to him?) Are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying as he plays the roles he has been out of, so he's so forced and he's not plausible all. He should just play good looking successful young men. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
