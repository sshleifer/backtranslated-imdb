I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch it, I can't help it, but it's entertaining. Gunga Din is one of the classic films made in Hollywood at Golden Years when the actors themselves had to direct the audience to the film without relying on fantastic special effects and the man made "monsters" to wear the scene. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. has shown the charisma and comrader on the screen to watch and look very interesting. The language and cheek attitude, in which the three actors play their role, function beautifully and flawlessly. Some may consider it a "corn", but I find it the best for "classic" filming and action. When you watch this movie, you should remember that Europe participated in the war with Germany, and the audience went to the movie to escape the horror of war and be entertained and taken away where people were bigger than life and did heroic deeds and always conquer evil. Gunga Din excels at it by letting the audience laugh and with the actors during their harassing escapades. In short, this is a classic film that doesn't take itself too seriously and does not want the audience to belong.
