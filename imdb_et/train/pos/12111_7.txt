When I first started to see this anime, I never thought that something about making bread could be interesting, but luckily I was wrong. From the moment I started to look at it, I just pulled the world of bread making, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is that it is a very smart and very funny humor with some repetitive gags. However, animation, soundtrack and character development are lower than average, while the first episodes do not see such shortcomings because this anime is a very good job, it really starts to show the last 20 episodes if reactions and recurring gags are just aging and not so funny than before. <br /> <br /> I am worried that if this anime had ended with an episode 52, I would have given it 9, but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste, which can not be regrettably washed with 50 fantastic episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
