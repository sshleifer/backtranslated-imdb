The whole talent of Mr. Sooraj Barjatya in his first 3 films, I thought it was all an accident, because his 4th main core was so bad. But I have to say it wasn't an accident. This man is talented and the way he has made Vivah is just great. Immediately from the first scene that affects you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome. The chemistry of these two actresses is reviewed by srk and kajol. As usual, Alok Nath as a good and loving father is fantastic, so is Anupam Kher. But his Shahid-Amrita movie.Amrita looks good in most scenes, although the shah sees a little younger to marry, but he does good but still morally strong grooms. especially those who have gone through such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all, it's a brilliant film. hats Mr. Sooraj Barjatyale ...
