For a long time I have not seen such a beautiful animated feature. Having welcomed Pixar, I have to say that Ratatouille or any other movie made by 'em' can't be compared to it. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing, the background is desperate, almost all objects in every frame are drawn perfectly. Sometimes I felt my backbone - so much I loved what I've seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely romantic. It can be as romantic as an animated film plot. The characters are loved, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he has put, stones and rules! Other symbols are also very nice. Humor is excellence. <br /> <br /> Generally, it seemed that the creators didn't invest much in it. I think it looked like it wouldn't take too much of Pixar & Dreamworks people trying to think of something new every time. And I am very pleased that the product of the European Animation Studio was so big. They have made an excellent, touching movie, candy for the eyes and heart. <br /> <br /> The only minus is a stupid start and that's why it is 9of10 not 10/10
