It is always nice to see Angela Bassett bite his role. He is sometimes an intense, funny, and even sexy Lena, a "colorful" woman who is forced to make a home from deserted mud just outside Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also a meaningless role for his partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah gives subtle nuances to strangers, discovering the new life of Boesman and Lena. It's not often that you get the chance to see an intelligent movie that deals with mature topics. Although it is based on the game, late director John Berry (who also led Claudine) opens up the material, taking the film in a wide-screen Cinemascope format. He keeps things visually interesting about the actors' creative blocking and showing only the things mentioned in the game. Just like Diahann Carroll at Claudine, John Berry can lead Angela Bassett as an Academy Award candidate. This is definitely a movie you should look for.
