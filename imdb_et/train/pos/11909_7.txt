Young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her scanner and dangerous aunt (Sonia Dresdel) and Uncle (Barry Jones) that she is losing her mind and in a very delicate state that requires their supervision, which proves to be more manipulative because they try to keep her as far away from human contact as possible. The only other person he sees is a caretaker, a terrible character, played by Maxwell's Reed, among whom an adult aunt stood out. All this, aunt and caregiver, a butterfly expert uncle who has a serious area and a susceptible sister would have made a darker and more sinister film. As it is, the frame of murder is sent to Trevor Howard (a dismissed government secret service agent who took the butterflies of legacy catalogs) and Simmons all over the country, escaping from the police, trying to override the title "Police net" on his front page, the exchange of buses and the liquidation of Liverpool, where they they meet perfectly with cast letters and ultimately see a greedy and murderous aunt and uncle.
