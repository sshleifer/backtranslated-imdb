By beliefs, political and social means, women and their oppression are sad enough. Do not reduce movies and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality and marginalization of society, all in Allah's or God's name, or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is just another approach and Light is on the subject. <br /> <br /> The device is a 2006 race between Iran and Bahrain to become a world champion. Passions are high and many women try to hide themselves as men to get into the game. <br /> <br /> Catching women (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Iran, Ayda Sadeq, Golnaz Farman and Mahnaz) Zabihi) and the archives detained for prosecution gave a funny and enlightening glimpse of the practices of this country and probably all Muslim countries. Their communication with the Iranian soldiers who watched them and transported both the city and the villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter, gave some fun moments when we thought of having such unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a paternalistic society that feels it has to save its women from the raw behavior of their men. Instead of educating the male population, they deny the privileges and rights of women. <br /> <br /> Seeing that the changes of responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society are surprising, this film cannot play in Iran. But Jafar Panahil is the winner who is able to see it.
