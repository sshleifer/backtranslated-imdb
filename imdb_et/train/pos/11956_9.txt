I would even say that some Hitchcock tones ... it's clearly better than the MMM, which some if not most Woody fans see guilty. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was the mystery of murder for the first time? Nonetheless, Woody requires some importance in film comedy. The plot's turn is nice and tight. I will say that in the first 20 minutes some actors are too short for their lines to be broadcast, but they will stay around. Scarlett Johansson does well in Diane Keaton's role, and there are no uncomfortable moments between him and his older Woody. No one could imagine the perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman as Jackman.
