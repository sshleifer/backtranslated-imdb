I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - it was a great movie and created a sense of age that seems like a timeline. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong game for Byron, Claire is a juvenile and annoying, Polidor is persuasive beaten, all are beautiful, curious and decadent ... not scary wrecks they are in the Gothic style. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as an independent shock film, and I loved it for a variety of reasons, but it works like a merchant and ivory film, and it was the best pictures of what I had to know in the summer. Romantic, yes, but completely restores my interest in the life of Shelley and Byron every time I think of a movie. One of my all-time favorites.
