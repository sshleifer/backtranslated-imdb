I happened to watch this movie randomly a few days ago, turning channels. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting film. A Guy Thingis is played by Jason Lee Paul, a straight-line, Seattle-based male who plans to marry his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) and live the undisputed life of middle-class homelessness. First of all, we meet Paul in his bachelor's degree, where he does not want to take part in the usual undergraduate activities that his (surprisingly few) buddies encourage when he is a little naughty and gets into a hot trouble with his upcoming problems and contradictions. Of course, the next thing Paul knows is morning after night, he's in bed with a hula dancer and his mother-in-law phones to tell him that Karen is on the way. Oh, and hula dancer is Karen's cousin Becky (Julia Stiles). This tiny acorn grows into a powerful oak, where Paul shifts its failure and wrongly, trying to cover what he has done while maintaining a conscientious, family-oriented good-looking boy who is very excited about his future weddings. His efforts to provide Karen with the wiser way of making possible lies that have been ironically pushed by him, forcing Paul to be more fun and closer to Becky, forcing him to doubt whether he really wants a life that seems to have been mapped for him. The film has the right combination of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a look.
