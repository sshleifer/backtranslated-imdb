Its supply-budget production photography is surprisingly bad. The colors are muddy and brownish and the photo has a very 80x look. Direction and editing are often quite unnecessary and also TV movies. * And * first it seems that the film wants to torture its viewers with sexual and violence. Hans Zimmer's score is also the simple and blissful work of this superfluous, unattractive composer. <br /> <br /> But if you are ready to watch the movie, then you will be rewarded with a very mobile family story, a sort of European Edna Ferber family giant. At first you do not know why Clara married this idiotic man, even if his character becomes deeper and more of a background that can be judged by him. Clara gives the film a spiritual lesson, a great and moving statement set against the terrible events of her country. His daughter, whose lover is Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands this lesson and endeavors to live. How the chart was initially reflective was great. Participants also do a good job. I thought, "Who is Blanca's actor?" all the time, but of course it was really young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie really made me read a book.
