The next two seasons of this original series were less than empty. The recent catastrophic restructuring of the seasons contributed to this three-year short-term life. Maybe if the plug had been pulled out after the first season, it would have been following the culture. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the first season was really fun! Funny, smart and with excellent writing it was promising. The right ingredients for the brewing of the first season were the characters / actors, the story and so on. Plus comedy about the paparazzi reporter was original. Nora and her companions "photographers" are at night in the night, day by day, in exclusive locations. <br /> <br /> Many things don't make sense to me. Similar to how this show, and another of my favorite - Gross Pointe ever "done". If only the nude truth and the first seasons of Grosse Pointe appeared on the DVD, please somebody out there?
