What can you say when you see a good French movie that tries to capture an enchanting story in line with the social background of the characters? The main thing is that we believe in these characters and when they meet each other we want them to stay together. It's simple and very effective. The background story is less important. Why does the scenario go to the side of an advanced thriller? It helps not to get into the social demonstrations that most French filmmakers want to do. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mes l√®vres is just a good character with a fun French movie. <br /> <br /> For all the smart dots in the scenario, the end is too easy. It's as simple as the back side (obvious reference and certainly not a noir film), but a less powerful context. When I am surprised, it can be seen that the nature of the probation officer has not been deleted. He brings the story very little; when he appears alone, we don't know if we've taken part before. Jacques Audiard is not yet a new comer. Weird and weird.
