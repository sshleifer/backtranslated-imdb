Interesting, fast paced and fun. <br /> <br /> I am not one of those people who watch TV loads and loads. I stumbled during the show when there was a sick flu home for one day, and it was immediately put together. I was quite drunk for John Burke. He and Claire did an amazing job of organizing the exhibition. You could really say they both loved their job. <br /> <br /> The Super Collection segments were excellent. I found myself in interesting things I had never thought before. <br /> <br /> What would I really like to know: What happened to Jack? Did one of the hosts accept him?
