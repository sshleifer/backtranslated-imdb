"Mouse in the House" is Tom & Jerry's very classic comic, which is loyal to his traditions, but in his own jokes. It's hysterical, fun, very fun and quite fun. Artwork is also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short doesn't just mean that Tom is trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and tries to catch the mouse, because «there will be only one cat in this house - and this is the cat who is trying to get the mouse». <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many funny gags in this coma. The most funny for me is, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees two lazy cats sleeping and sarcastically says "I'm glad you enjoy the siesta" and that he hopes they're happy because he's not two cats despicable. Another funny gag is when Tom hides himself with Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a pan and then Butch does the same trick for Tom. Of course, it is even more fun than when the real Mammy Two Shoes and the two (stupid!) Cats think they see each other as hidden by Mammy and then both attack behind him - lol. Of course, he gets crazy and when he gets crazy, he's not someone he's confused about. But even Jerry won't win this time because he's been sent out by him.
