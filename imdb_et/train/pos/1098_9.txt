Modern viewers are familiar with this little film, primarily as a remake model, "Money Pit". Older viewers look at it today with Nazalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in a simpler, less complex era. Or was it? Of course, it is time to change the perspectives and so many films that are really vulnerable to social and political commentary today, it is a natural curiosity to think about contradictions in older, seemingly less provocative films. "Mr. Blandings is building his dream house" can therefore be more than what the viewers were looking for in 1948. There are, however, political comments, but fine. Finding a house at the end of the '40s was a truly irritating experience that was only slightly relieved by Levittowns and the like. Politics in the film? The children of Blandings always seem to talk about the progressive ideas they are taught at school (which would actually give teachers the accusation of communism). In real life, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, democrat and feminist. Melvyn Douglas was not a less democratic firearm: he was married to Congressman Helen Gahagan Douglas, who was accused of the softness of communism by Richard Nixon (and which destroyed him). Jason Robards, sr., Has a small role in the film, but his political activity was not less noticeable. More importantly, his son Jason Robards jr would be a very liberal liberal for years. Almost strange companion was Cary Grant, whose striking conservatism reflected in Hollywood the majority of political sentiment that was already sliding. But it was 1948: Communism was a real perceived threat and the black list was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism appears in mainstream films and then not so subtly.
