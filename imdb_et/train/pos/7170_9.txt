HOLES is not your average Disney stuff - it is very, very fun, even for adults who usually rush to the Cutesy focus group for "family entertainment" that the Uncle Walt Studio is alive. Perhaps the secret of the success of this film is in your faithfulness with the original book, which is a little darker than your average child. The activity begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to the boys' prison camp, where all detainees are forced to dig into the desert as holes in the sun. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story is intertwined with the legendary treasure, and this adventure is ten times more fun than any Disney movie about a boy in a prison camp. Jon Voight is especially disgusting and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
