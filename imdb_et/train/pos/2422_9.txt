Yes, it's a small budget. Yeah, this is one of Candy's earliest movies, but maybe it's more fun! John Candy was not so far away from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and shows. If you might not break up when Candy tries to help her son with her food while being handcuffed to the escaped cohort to have sex with her girlfriend only with the apartment that separates them (see, watch the movie!) Or how Euguene Levy (Kong) The creator of Fu Yu) speaks to her mother on the phone or just a myriad of facial expressions that Candy alone can control. If you like "Only lonely" John Candy, it may not be the movie I would like to see, but if you enjoy John Candy SCTV days, this movie must be!
