Bogmeister and others have done a lot of nails. Shore Leave is really TOS's first attempt with light sci-fi (which they later perfected with classic Trouble). This gave both the company's team and its viewers the necessary vacation from the threatening consequences of the universe, such as Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> Searching for a place to cool down for a while, Enterprise happens through a seemingly idyllic M-Class planet and sends a research team to look closely. Soon any absurdities will happen - some seemingly dangerous - but it all seems that the strange mixing of fantastic mystery (McCoy has reviewed the glass) plays the noise of human-sensitive emotions, the psychological thriller (Kirk is tracked) and the inevitable temptation of his past) and romantic comedy (without comment) . <br /> <br /> TOS was the smallest of all Trek franchise series, so it's easy to forget how many episodes the first season focused on a heavy, potentially unhappy drama. Unlike a later serial franchise writer, the TOS team was not afraid to literally go where the TV series hadn't been before. And Shore Leave, despite her random problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that cast (especially Shatner - his irony of legendary sense of humor) did not know how to deal with this new wrinkle on ST. The last scene is probably one of the worst scenes I remember in the whole TOS move - both in composition and in action. <br /> <br /> nuff said. My suggestion - look at it during the first season as it was scheduled - it's an order.
