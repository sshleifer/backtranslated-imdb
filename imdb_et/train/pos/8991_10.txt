DIG! is funny, fun, fun, interesting, stylish and very well done. Knowing that this has been done in such a heroic budget for 7 years, it is amazing that such a story can be said, especially with such style and content. If you are a music fan or documentary fan then this is necessary. <br /> <br /> Focus on Brian Jonestown's Dwarfs and Dandy Warholes over the years is a great way to show the contrast between a decent band with modest advances in persistence and compromise and a genius-singing singer supported by a variety of characters sabotaging their success with drugs , through alcohol and madness. If I didn't know that it was real people, I swear that it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece. The story is convincing, short, and just amazing.
