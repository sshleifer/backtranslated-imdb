Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, it was just turkey. But they're great. Ustinov is his best, and for Maggie fans it's fun to see him in his early days, matching Ustinov with every step between timing and timing. For English, in their fifties (and in this console), it is always fun to watch Swinging Sixties' pictures and hear sounds, and while this film spends a lot of time in offices, it has many sixties nostalgia, including red buses, Carnaby Street, Lulu song and delicious the waitress's micro-skirt, as England has seen in public places so far. I.T. engineer, I know that computer hacking hacking is ridiculous, but they do not need to be taken seriously. Neither do Italians, French, and Germans have wonderful stereotypes.
