Bottom line - the best romantic comedy. This movie achieves all the great movies: creating a world and a time that we want to visit again and make us happy in the human race. When I am blue, this film raises my mind and makes me ridiculous (and it is still true after many views - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All actors are in top form. Testimonials are so dead and the eyes of the characters so good that you forget the actor (usually it's hard to do with Matthau, Robbins, and Ryan). Supporting casting is consistently brilliant: Fry ("agae", "whole pygmy package"), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (three theoretical physicists as "greek cream" - "but no time"), durning ("something we we can run from NJ "), Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins boss and service station colleague) and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies is Eisenhower?). <br /> <br /> Don doesn't miss the treasure.
