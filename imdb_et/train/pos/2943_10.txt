I think it's still the best routine. There are others like Rock "bring pain" and Allen "Men are pigs" that are fun; "Damon Waynes last stand" is also funny, but this routine is not flawed. All the jokes are funny and the 70-minute deadline is perfect. Just long to last 20 years. I just love how it allows the audience to be completely self-contained and unlimited. I'm a fan of classics and a man who looked a lot at Jim Carrey growing up, watching a rather modest comic. Don't put in categories Ellen and Newhart, but something that you can look at when you're swollen. Thanks to Eddie, God bless you.
