Although I bought the DVD for the first time, and I watched it several times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I loved it when I first saw it and I still love it. <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that he never made enough money to motivate anyone to follow up. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, when he makes a comic book and a book like books, like My name is modest, another tough woman who doesn't know it, Peter O ' Donnell wrote his stories to focus on psychological tension rather than action. <br /> <br /> The tug of wills between Modesty and Michael is very true to the source material and is tense, tense and exciting for anyone who doesn't need gore and explosions. Alexandra did a great job playing the way O'Donnell's character had kept the situation under control. <br /> <br /> I think it is especially before the curve that follows Batman and James Bond's very much needed restart. After 2 hidden efforts in the past, though not well known to the public, it is a restart of a modest character, and it is really sad that his films are no longer being made.
