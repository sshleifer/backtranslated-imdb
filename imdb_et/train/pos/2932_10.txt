I've seen my fair share of comedy and standups, but it's so original, so fresh, it makes you wonder why you always walked right when you moved it from a video store. Murphy has some pretty funny jokes, but it's just too funny. If only every movie could be that funny. it should be called "107 minutes of the most unbelievable comedy" Murphy is in this movie a comic genius and makes you say "this is the man who made Dr. doulittle!" She talks about ice cream, shoe-throwing mothers, her aunt with a mustache, racism and everything else you might think of and what you couldn't. Please, if you see one comedy in your life, is it only if all the movies could be Delirious.
