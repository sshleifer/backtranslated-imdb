I saw this movie for the first time when I was in a gymnasium, and the film has stuck with me for years. The most important thing is not about soundtrack or cinematography, or even dialogue and somewhat bad behavior, this is the educational goal and the message behind it. This is not a sin when there is a child, if you are a teenager and still in high school, and this is not a bad thing, but it is a problem. The tones of girls I knew are now with the kids and I think they've never watched this big movie and when they did, they couldn't get it all. That means not taking opportunities in sexual relationships. Every girl can get pregnant for the first time. It's not a myth. You may not lose your dreams, but they must sit back in the future because you have a child who thinks first. <br /> <br /> Behind this movie is a clear message: JUST SAY NO!
