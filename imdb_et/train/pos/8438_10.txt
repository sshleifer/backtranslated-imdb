HLOTS was a prominent series that NYPD Blue never gets, HLOTs have real plots, dialogue is real, relationships are real. When HLOTS is behind the film, all the loose ends were put together, it was good for all the gangs to come together, even some of those who left show up (wont say how). the series was out weekly and weekly. Killing, living on the streets, networking drama your best !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs UP and all that. Thanks to NBC for giving us Finally we couldn't!
