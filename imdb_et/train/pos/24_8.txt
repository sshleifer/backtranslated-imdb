Although this was obviously a low budget production, the performances and songs of this film are worth it. One of Walken's few musical roles. (she is a wonderful dancer and singer and she also demonstrates her acrobatic skills - watching the lane!) is also starring Jason Connery. A great children's story and very pleasant characters.
