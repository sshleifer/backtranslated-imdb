I'm neither an older nor a man. But I could identify the heartache and pain of every character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for teenagers should watch. Maybe they will again appreciate the value of the family. I'm sorry for those who don't understand the value of love, family, and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. And it's nice to see Ben Affleck, 19, who is doing his best in moving and sincere activities. He showed from an early age that he was capable of a dramatic drama. He should be given more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland ... his first serious role in the years and he went out and won the best actor at the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Perhaps children under the age of 10 should not be seen because they may be scared that the same may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and I've been watching it with friends several times. Because it represents important values ​​in life.
