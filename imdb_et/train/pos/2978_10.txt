BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This is a film with an exterior wall featuring Matt Stone and Trey Parker, creators of the South Park. They play two sliders who create sport on their driveway, which becomes a national feeling. Most of the gags are really fun, but the most fun parts of the movie are when players try to "interact" other counterparts "psychically". There is no rule on what is not allowed, so naturally they do the worst things. One mistake in this movie is that the pace is too fast and after about half an hour of watching, I found myself asking, "Oh, right?" Another fun part of the movie was how Joe and Doug constantly blame Squeak, a surprising little man. BASEketball is a comic classical class with very quotable features, and it's a lot of fun to watch!
