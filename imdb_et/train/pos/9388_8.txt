Lots of your expected luck fair readers, Cage and Hopper met and luckily not on Lynch film because RED ROCK WEST is better than any Lynch movie? Nicolas Cage is a third-degree actor, a porcelain child is deadly, but his father Hopper is as average as ever? RED ROCK WEST is, despite the tricked pain, one of my favorite American thrillers; in one word, a thriller with some twists. <br /> <br /> One noticeable one is the joy, the fantastic tempo, the excitement, the nice stop, Lara Flynn Boyle's cute tight little ass, the enviable physical shape of Cage (though indisputably ugly, with sharp, bird-like, thick eyebrows and thin) , rare hair, Cage had a good overall shape?), Hopper's perfect routine, some moderately but really funny moments, Cage plays with his planned personality, Hopper's rigid, psychopathic temptation, Lara's meaning, Cage seems roamer, noir movie archetypal gloomy roamer , hungry, harsh, naive if necessary, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle performs as a Cold Mediator, Walshina as her heartless wife, and Hopper as Lynchian, a man he has already done. <br /> <br /> Cage really looks quite groggy or dizzy or very confused and has a serious hangover. But it can be his regular look.
