Thinking of "Great Escape", I promised to go back to the film from my childhood. I had read and read the 1949 autobiographical novel that inspired it, and when it was the only cinema (we didn't use that word, actually) in a city that showed "foreign language" movies, I was the first to match my ticket. <br /> <br /> When somebody brought up in war-time newspapers and propaganda films during World War II, I was interested in exploring the reality of the conflict that is personally reflected in the memories and stories of the people who stayed there. . It later extended over the years the desire to buy a book on this subject and finally read equally convincing novels by Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which gave an even deeper sensitivity. The versions of the film, however, were different in that they were rarely delivered. <br /> <br /> Black and white film media has never been as well earned as those years. I've never seen any version of the technical color that looks as authentic as the deep chiaroscura of movies like "The Wooden Horse". If it is true that we must always be captivated by pictures of our childhood, I confess it freely. <br /> <br /> And never like Leo Genn, like a British war hero. on the film. Not even Sir Alec.
