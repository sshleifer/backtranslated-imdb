I'm curious what the rifle Beckett used in the film, and also the bullet of the bullet he assumes he is burning. If it's loosely based on Carlos Hathcock, I think it's 7 mm. around. I'm also curious about the gun itself. He also commented on the final sniper rifle that the Vietnamese man had allowed him to use for his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper gun ever made. I would like to know what rifle it is. I know this particular rifle has been made around World War II or before. I just couldn't look close enough at this movie to identify it. <br /> <br /> Hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 miles and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unsigned kills. After healing his wounds in Vietnam during his burning, he spent the rest of his career at the USMC to teach the snipers they needed in this area. His sniping career is still mentioned by our brothers and sisters, who are hurting in the USMC. I found my name on my friend who is a former Marine. Any information would be great.
