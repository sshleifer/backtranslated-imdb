One of the things I always loved about Robert Ludley's thrillers is just when you think it has developed, it goes in the other direction. There are so many turns in this movie that I have a painful look at the neck. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can depend on the direct and then write (with his brother Rick) a good story. <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh cast and you have a story that keeps your interest, even when they are showing signs that they are all perfect. It seems that Dahl brings out the best people, and it keeps you interested and guessed until the end.
