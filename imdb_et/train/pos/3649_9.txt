As a student, I have seen many TV films, most of the usual waste of time being thrown out by US television. However, it was well designed and drawn and at the end it was very nice. Having only seen Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and the Stargate, I was surprised by his excellent performance, rather than the A-B output he usually provides. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zun after a long time ago with The Fly II. It is also nice to see Robert Guillaume's leading role. I can't say I'm taking Jane Levi seriously after Benny Hill's day, but she managed to do her job well. All in all, a movie is highly recommended.
