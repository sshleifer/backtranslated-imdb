Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another Disney masterpiece. It was filmed with animation sequences and actors and actors interacting with animations. (A similar concept was also used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappeared on the sidewalk.) I appreciate this film mainly through the eyes of the child because I haven't seen it over the years. Then it was one of my favorite films. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict that started with a ghostly armor battle) were my favorites. There were also many stop-animations that were used with spells (ie people became rabbits), which may now be a bit outdated and stupid. (I also believe that the movie starts slowly.) In the child's eyes, this is a fun movie and it is easy for children to film in the child's places. This is an imaginative film that, unfortunately, has been largely forgotten today.
