David Lynch's new short is a very "lyrical" piece full of darkness, tension, default, discrete but highly textured background music, and again two beautiful actors, a blonde and a brunette, a repetitive theme in their work. Both characters create a very intriguing slave-male relationship, which can be seen as a direct consequence of similar relationships characterized by Mulholland Dr. <br /> Beautiful. For the Lynch fan. <br /> <br />
