This film has a powerful philosophical ending. But this end is only meaningful when you watch the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The alienation of young people in the late 1960s, from a young man's and a young woman's point of view, is an obvious topic for "Zabriskie Point." Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin did not have much working experience that actually complements the film's message. Bear in reality because both players seem to be emotionally separated from the confusion around them. <br /> <br /> This is not a script-driven movie, except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with amazing cinematography. fit perfectly with the emotional separation of Mark and Daria. <br /> <br /> I would have replaced the thematically weak Pink Floyd with the music of The Doors. Many scenes will cry "Rider On The Storm." I like this movie. It's different; it's unique; it's artistic and imaginative. And deserts are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Over the years, "Zabriskie Point" seems increasingly attractive. This will bring the mood of the late 1960s to America. It is amazingly artistic, bohemian. The last eight minutes of the movie are philosophically foolish.
