Theodore Rex is probably the greatest film experience ever, which is definitely a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression! In this influential intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel aligns with the great filmmakers of the 20th century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. Special effects are nothing but breathtaking and any Spielberg job is subtle and elementary. Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary pearl at the time of its release that it raised the film-making bar to a level that filmmakers had never expected. The concept not only of making a dinosaur film, but of packaged customization of activities, an exciting detective novel that notices a "talking" dinosaur with a postmodern name like "Theodore" and an existential police officer of humanity as we know it. With such a magnificent beauty, the world can never be the same. Watching Theodore Rex is much like looking at God's face and listening to Him says "you are my most precious creation." This is one of the few movies that is just FUTURE !!!
