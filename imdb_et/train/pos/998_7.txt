This is a really interesting movie. This is a feature film with comedy. In this movie, Foxx makes a comic for comedian Epps to give him a comic spin. It keeps you wondering what follows Foxx. It was a well-filmed movie, the director used the right colors (dark color) in this film to give it the right feeling. Kimberly Elise was in this movie and she is always happy to see her on the big screen. He plays his role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing what you haven't seen. It's definitely worth it if you are a Jamie Foxx fan. It deserves more credit than it really is.
