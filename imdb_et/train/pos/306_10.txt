Well, I had seen "They all laughed" when they came up in 1982 in Europe and kept a vague but expensive souvenir. I saw it again on tape, almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich has a true affectionate affection for his characters and a kind of compassion that is not difficult to feel. Great comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone, and pretty good editing. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just like we all, at times. Go away.
