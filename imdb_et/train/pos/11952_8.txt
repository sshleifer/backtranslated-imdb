Scoop *** out **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite leader, but I enjoyed "Match Point". It was a great dark romantic thriller, which fortunately doesn't mean Woody Allen. It had a beautiful Scarlett Johansson. <br /> <br /> "Shovel" is Woody Allen's latest film and although it appears in it, it is OK. It also has Scarlett Johansson and two of them work together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays a young college journalist, Sondra Pransky, who gets Joe Strombel's ghost (Ian McShane). Joe heard a scoop at the ship, where there was a wet cleaner and a number of other Reaper souls. One of these souls is Peter Lyman's secretary (Hugh Jackman.) He tells Joe that Peter may be a series traveling on the streets of England. Joe, with a lifetime shovel, goes back to life and gives this information to Sondra during a magical activity. Sondra is a magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go to a vanishing box and when she's in the box she gets Joe's visit. Don't know what to do, he supports Sid Waterman's help to help him break. <br /> <br /> This film has a nice unknown feeling compared to "Match Point" and it all works. Johansson and Allen work together. Allen's humor is perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is fantastic, like Peter Layman, the "suspect" serum killer. <br /> <br /> It's a fun little movie to see if you're ever looking for a look. The cast ensemble works well and the story is flowing and sometimes you forget that your viewing at Woody Allen is yours. I say I give him a chance, because you like it easily.
