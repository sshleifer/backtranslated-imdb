This Raggedy Ann and Andy movie is so divine. We love to watch Ann and Andy sing and dance with camel wrinkles on knees. This movie is what made Camel with wrinkles with his knees so popular when he sang his song: "I don't love you". If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy Watch a movie and see why it's a movie that kids love, and adults!
