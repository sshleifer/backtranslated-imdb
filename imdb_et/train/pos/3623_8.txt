Disney can just be something here. First, they "remembered the titans" with Denzel, a story based on the truth that includes sports and a small town in Central America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie ... one more story of sports that is the basis of truth. <br /> <br /> Both movies will move you from time to time to tears and both will make you smile and feel after seeing them. My wife and I took it to Rookie and we waited for this to be a very good film. We didn't miss when asked if we would buy it out of the DVD when it comes out, it was a no-brainer. Most certainly.
