This is a short, harshly animated series by David Lynch (as it is said at the beginning), and it follows the backwoods that carry a generally large man, malformation with his wife who has a stressful and annoying son.

Don't look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece - it's something other than. In fact, it seems to be almost against such statements because its tough style comes into the face of any animation convention. As Lynch says, "If it's funny, it's just funny, because we see all this absurdity."
