Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton - What more could you ask? Monkey Grip, based on the same-name award-winning novel, examines Norat (Hazlehurst, a single mother who goes to heroin addict Jobe (Friels). A simple story is truly extraordinary through all the round great acts (especially Noni Hazlehurst) and the Little Budget is nice to use. The only mistake (if you can get it) is that the story is in Melbourne, although for budgetary reasons it was filmed mainly in Sydney, so in some scenes you can see the tram (Melbourne scenes) and then the Carlton post office (Sydney scenes) except that "Monkey Grip" must see (excuse the click, but it's) at least the previous "Play School" and "Better Homes & Gardens" presenter Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br /> 10/10
