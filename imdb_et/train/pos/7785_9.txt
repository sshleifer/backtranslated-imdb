I just watch 2 movies from Pang Brother, The Eye and One take only. When I looked at my eyes, I was disappointed with the two guys I heard before these good words. There is really a bad script on this film (The Eye), especially ending (childish, clich√© and overlapping in my opinion), but it's still good in photography and experimental pictures. So I decided to see only one and I wasn't disappointed again. Still great for photography, stunning picture, MTV-style editing, cool music, and this time the story is a lot of indie-minded, logical and beautiful, you can see some small plot holes, but it doesn't pose any problems in the storyline. The only problem with this movie is that I get a bad DVD.
