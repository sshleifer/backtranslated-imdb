I didn't know about Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew I was very scared about seeing this movie. (I was devastated by the film "Trantula" at the seventh age ... but I was ten years). The first scene where Blob climbs on the peasant's trot and pulls on his hands was enough to leave me in the theater. But I went through each of our monster attacks and suffered. I felt so horrible when Steve and his girl barely got out of the doctor's office (bad doc), and even more so when Blob stepped into the cinema and ate a large part of the audience. . . so much in fact that IT oooooozzzzzzzzed in front of the doors, too big now to fit through just one. The growth potential seemed indestructible and unlimited, and when Steve was afflicted with a sieve-like canteen, he seemed to be a sure dinner. <br /> <br /> If you say that the blob was cold, it would be a description of today, but in the end it would be better to be icy than a scary and mentally breathing little child. in the evening with my uncle Nick, trying to act boldly. He knew I was in trouble and when I got into bed, I couldn't feel just the room in the room, but when I called for the courage to look down on the floor, there was a red pulsating, heart-shaped hungry guy waiting for me to try and go up and go to the bathroom. It took several months to recover. <br /> <br /> I'm 57 years old now. . . I've done it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Blob wasn't destroyed.
