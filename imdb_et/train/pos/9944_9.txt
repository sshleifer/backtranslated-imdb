Of course, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems that the only "big" movies these days are amazingly shocking or with a big budget / mortgage in some way. <br /> <br /> Spin Kick is a drama / comedy group of people who decide to cast their hearts into a tae kwon. Regardless of what you expect from this movie, you feel moved by the work, pain and expectation that the characters themselves are experiencing. Although comedy is beautiful from time to time: a lot of old guards who take things too seriously turned a hoodlum a good man who just wants a second chance in life, a stupid team who would die happy if he just won once in his life and many others well rounded Characters with their problems - but most importantly, their own hopes and dreams. While the aims of film and film are simple, these aspects of the film only highlight the development of characters when they overcome their personal and interpersonal struggles. In short, this film leaves a fresh, firm and peaceful feeling.
