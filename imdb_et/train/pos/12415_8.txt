This was probably Mick Dundee's prototype, but â€œBarry McKenzie's adventures are funny. I was amused all the time and laughed alot many times. Barry Crocker's terrible central role in the title, Australia, invading England to disrupt the poms with their free-flowing unpleasant ways. Few Britons often disturb Barry's brutal observations to his hosts. The relationship between the two countries is staggering, but friendly, and this is highlighted by the film's last line, which is somewhat reluctant to McKenzie when he arrives home. "I just liked the poms."
