I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first one (by the lake in the cabin), but only killed women, and kills men. And the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are the first when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club, and he describes Kimberly's last moments before being thrown into the water. And secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in his cellar, just before they go when he kisses him. These scenes were very intense and riveting for me. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, not because the film was bad, but because filming was bad, I thought there were times when you noticed that something was wrong, like how the movie is usually filmed you can't see "live "camera shooting but very little you notice filming errors. what went wrong?
