The film begins very slowly, with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm, a photo service station. Her husband has been confined to punishment for filming for a home with an ankle bracelet. Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire brigade and takes the fire seriously. <br /> <br /> If we look at Wallace's rather dull life, then something new and jarring comes suddenly: the city is going to the carnival. One of its stars is Wallace's brother Wilder Napalm. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> So does Wallace. They are both pyrotechnic and "pyrotechnic", people who are capable of burning spiritual energy. Wallace keeps his powers secret; Wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some of their differences go back to childhood, where they inadvertently caused a deadly death. Wallace prevents the use of its powers; Wilder wants to go public on public television. <br /> <br /> Wilder wants Wallace's wife, both years before. He becomes a dispute and becomes one of the reasons why the brother is literally in the final word. <br /> <br /> Film is fun, but not ridiculous funny. I think that's enough to get a copy of my library. This is a good film.
