"Iphigenia" is Michael Cacoyannis' great achievement. This masterful game is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life with a wonderful cast. It was impossible in Cacoyann. He was able to film the Greek tragedy to lose its effectiveness and importance. Attention has been given to star-greek cast. Novice Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia. Equally impressive is Irene Papas, who is sometimes very real despite the top. Wonderful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyann, with excellent music score at Mikis Theodorak, perfect for every scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say the movie has lost the best foreign language Oscar with just one voice !!!
