One of the best ensembles acting I ever seen in movies. There is not much to the plot but an actor-unbelievable. You will see that the characters will ever become so subtle that it will displace the effects of rented wool in Italy and love. And good luck. The film throws you an enchanting spell as much as the wool makes all women. Really "fascinated".
