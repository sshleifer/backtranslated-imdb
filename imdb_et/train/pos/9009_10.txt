This movie truly captures the sense of freedom ....... and what is your freedom of immunity .... in the most pleasant and lightest sense. Not a serious but fun adventure. <br /> <br /> The story reflects life. We don't always get what we want right now, but we find out that we get what we need to understand, why we didn't get what we wanted. You get it after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> And this movie is really about finding love and knowing that one has found it and that it has completely changed its life. <br /> <br /> It's one of my all time favorites. .. is not easy to find, but worth it ......... I guarantee you look at it more than once!
