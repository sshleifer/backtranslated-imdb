The radio was not 24 hours 7 days a week when I grew up in the 1930s in England, so the lesson for me was petting when we had batteries and a battery to save power. The few programs I heard made a big impression on my young mind and the 3 things I remember is "Toytown", one of all the animals in the zoo, and --- Gray Owl, talking about the animals he knew he called his "brothers" ". Until recently, I learned that Gray Owl was not a real "India", but the tribute paid by Sioux Chie makes sense to me "Man gets what he dreams". Could we all dream of being a world-changing and useful if Archie Gray Owl Belaney. Can the new gray Owl influence world leaders in cleaning the environment.
