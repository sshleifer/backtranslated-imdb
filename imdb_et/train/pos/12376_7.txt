Extremely impressive, it's impressive that "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" seems to be scary images, "The Sentinel" (1977) is still a creepy film that focuses on relatively unknown actor Cristina Raines. Here she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves to the Brooklyn Heights brown stone, which is (and I don't think I'll give too much at this late date too much) near the gate of hell. As a tenant of this building, he suffers from worse conditions than leaking pipelines and occasional water supply! Indeed, the scene where Alison faces her noisy upper neighbor is really frightening and should definitely send ice water to most of the viewers' spine. Despite many criticisms of Raines' ability to act, I thought he was just as good as Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture is based on an effective unsuccessful conclusion, and while some plot points remain inexplicable, I felt more than satisfied. As the book "DVD Delirium" puts it, "not all movies with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles canpless cannibal lesbians be all bad"! On the side I noticed that yesterday I went over 10 Montague's terraces in Brooklyn Heights to see the Sentinel house. Yes, it is still there, and although the lack of a dark priest / nun in the window of its heavy bony fur and the upper floor seems to be the same as in the picture. If this house really sits at the entrance to hell, I think hell is ... Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But in New York, we've known for a while!
