This is the most faced documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of hidden industrial landscapes focusing on modern industrial growth in China, Edward Burtynsky brings to life problems that we just decided to ignore. <br /> <br /> Since this movie is not political, this film is a neutral moving picture of the reality our western societies do not want to educate us - by-products of economic growth, the external influences paid by citizens in less developed communities, the source of our amenities, and our consumer lifestyle wasting. /> <br /> Amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore. It's a tricky journey, but it's worth taking - please stop ignorance and at least take a look at these photos of truth, without any pressure to accept these questions. 10/10 definitely!
