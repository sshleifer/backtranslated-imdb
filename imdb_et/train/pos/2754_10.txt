I really love this movie, I saw it again last week after 3 years. This movie is perfect, great actor, great story, great director / camera-work / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael didn't do it after more movies. Top 5 Work. Really! <br /> <br /> Today it is 3 years and 3 days later the comment above. it has never been posted because it was no more than 10 lines. Anyway I saw "le huitieme jour" again yesterday. This is undoubtedly my movie's top 3 with "Cinema Paradiso" which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also very good. I'm really curious about the new "jaco von dormael" movie. I hope it will complete your movie up. 3. If you see this movie, rent it. Or even better. buy. Because you want to see it again.
