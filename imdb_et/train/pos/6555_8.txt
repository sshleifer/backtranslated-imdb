I have read more than 100 Nancy Drew books and if you are not yet bright enough to get it, Nancy Drew was a YOUNGER Nancy Drew, not an 18-year-old who doesn't attend school for all books. It was when he was sixteenth. So, of course, he wouldn't be as smart as what was in the book, because he's only in grade 10. Besides, I thought the film was very cute. It was clean and suitable for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. He was literal and sweet. I liked the inconvenience that Nancy and Ned surrounded each other because they probably weren't old enough to be in serious relationships as they have books. It was a lovely PG movie that I enjoyed completely, because unlike most people I enjoy movies without sex, drugs or embarrassment.
