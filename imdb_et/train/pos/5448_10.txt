This movie is probably a favorite movie all the time. Miriam Flynn is great as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest is amazing and the movie is really funny. A solid satire of fear films with a nervous twist. If you enjoy a fun, comedy evening, go and rent it classic. You laugh all the way!
