"Who did that?" contains many definite smiles and smiles. Not only is it one of the best Stooges movies with Shemp, but one of the best short comedies produced by Columbia. Director Bernds initially wrote a scenario for Stooges in 1946, but when Curly Howard wore a career ending, it was tailored to the Columbia comedy team from Schilling and Lane (their version was published in "Pardon My Terror."). it was too good for Stooges to bypass, and it was finally filmed by Stooges at the end of 1947. <br /> <br /> The old man Goodrich calls the Ace Detective Shemp, Larry, and Moe to be murdered. When they get home, Goodrich is gone and his niece and the assembly are trying to get rid of the Stoogenes. Do they find Goodrich and bring their niece and gons to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is especially funny in this movie. His reactions after Christine McIntyre gave the mickey are excellent; she gives her trademark sound (eeebee-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is trying to laugh! Other funny scenes: Moe mug that looks at the camera lens; and the dark fight with all involved members. With her donated hair, she can almost hand over Stooge if she doesn't tower over all the others! "Who did that?" is a pearl among Shemp's Stooges films. Even dead-curved fans will enjoy it! The real Stooge classic. 9 out of 10
