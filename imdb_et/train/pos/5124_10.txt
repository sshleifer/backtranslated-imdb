This is a great movie that I think won't get John Travolta's career on Saturday's fever or fat. She plays a man who is in love with a girl, but is a pig that admits her feelings to her. Instead, he wants to deal with a mechanical bull because he thinks it shows his masculinity. Although it was done in 1980, it is still timely. The great land music soundtrack is terrible. 10/10
