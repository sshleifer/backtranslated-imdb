This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, the singer of a well-known dEUS group, is not supported by everyone. For a simple reason, there is no clear story or even a plot. This movie shows 24 hours in "town" (here in Antwerp) and allows you to watch and truly enjoy dialogues, leadership, humor (Dario !, osteopat Bruno! ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...) characters. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: Windman beach, end of dance party, KISS fan, Windman visits osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> It is clear that some other viewers did not understand what is so movie so beautiful and interesting. They complain that this film has no story, etc. But it is the atmosphere that keeps you looking and it pulls you into it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, be sure to listen to music. The soundtrack is exceptional like Tom Barman and his group. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, say dicht hey." (don't tell anyone)
