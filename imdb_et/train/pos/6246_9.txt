Watching Hundstage is not brilliant if you are not 100% sure about your mental stability because this movie is being seriously tested, no matter how you are. I have to say that Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film, so most viewers would not have the "maturity" level to reach their pleasant side. Similar Tarkovsky films, but different. I can't say I had a lot of fun watching it. But it is an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the clich√© Hollywood offers. Swell stick your finger directly into your brain and scratch your mind. You can't just sit back and watch, you can use exclamations or search for the whole movie. A similar movie is Nachtgestalten, but it was much better and less violent. For example, it is not for children or those who are mentally fragile or bad. Most viewers would probably give this movie either 10 or 1. I'll give it to 9 because I've seen multiple stories in one movie and it was better. But this is a unique piece. Worth a look, but be prepared to see something disturbing.
