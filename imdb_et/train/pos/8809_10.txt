This document really opened the door to what people outside the United States thought of the September 11 attacks. This film was professionally assembled and presents this disaster more than an attack on US soil. The consequences of this disaster have been previewed in many different countries and perspectives. I believe that this film should be more widely disseminated to this point. It also finally helps to see something other than news of terrorist attacks in the healing process. And some pieces are actually funny, but not malicious. This movie was very recommended to me and I give the same feeling.
