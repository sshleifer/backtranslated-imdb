"Radiofreccia" is still a great surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by the Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and writes a musical score - of course. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrait of the life of the province of Northern Italy in the Emilia Romagna region. We are in 1975, the first time for free radios - one of the boys of the film creates "Radioraptus". Topics include young people's wishes, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment, but the film also talks about drugs - the main character of Freccia is the victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> Without boredom and moral, the story flows very well; the participants' spontaneity is strong and also the way of leadership. Probably Luciano's "League" Ligabue is not a Fellini or a filmmaker, especially a musician. But he manages to make a good product. Unfortunately he does not repeat his success with his second film "Da zero a dieci" - not good at all. <br /> <br /> "Radiofreccia" participants are generally not very famous, the only star is Stefano Accors - one of the most popular young Italian actors. Look at another Italian songwriter - Francesco Guccini, a nice communist bartender and football coach!
