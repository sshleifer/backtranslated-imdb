Yes, it can be funny and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies, but this movie is really fun when you really watch it. Tim Meadows has always been funny on Saturday night. If he showed this character at exhibitions, I'd burst out laughing. So after I saw it in Comedy Central one night, I decided to check it out. All in all, I was impressed by this film because it wasn't meant to win the Oscars or the comedy of the year, but it amused the Saturday night live fans who love the Ladies Man character. This film is also packed on some highly quoted lines that can be read for years.
