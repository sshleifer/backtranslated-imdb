De Palma's technique for this film had hit its high maturity, which is an excellent show of classical techniques, although unfortunately, as with many of De Palma's own films, the story is meta more than an emotionally influential story. <br /> <br /> The story opens with a CRAZY scene where Angie Dickinson masturbates in the shower as she looks at her husband. He is then grabbed and raped when his husband is unreasonably close - and the whole thing is clear that it is Angie's fantasy, because he's helping him out of bed furiously. He has a short scene with his son, Harry Potter's dead ring, that comes with a joke that "he says to his grandmother that he is playing with his Peter." He then goes to his therapy where he complains about his dead marriage before trying to attract his therapist Michael Cain. She refuses, and she hurts and feels uncomfortable and unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> Then the bravura's 22-minute almost wordless sequence begins, which is perhaps the highlight of the movie. Among the many things De Palma read out from Hitchcock is understanding the film as a purely visual tool for reading stories? and in a typical De Palma way, he turns it into a way of showing his tremendous skill. For me, the problem is that in this case, it is felt that the scenes have become unnecessarily protracted for the further development of the director's skills. The order begins with Angie at the Art Museum. He looks at strangers, everyone involved in sexual or family activities, and then turns to the man next to him. De Palma says very skilfully the extremely complex story without the attractiveness, embarrassment, retreat, and ultimately finding and presenting strangers at the back of the taxi cab. everything Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the series, Angie slept with her husband and returns to her. De Palma crashes again a lot of story without dialogue, as Angie realizes she does not have her panties, her husband is already at home, and no doubt knows where she is, she has probably agreed with a venereal disease and she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in shuffle. It is all very admirable, but one starts to feel a bit strenuous, because we are forced to do things by taking long lifts from the seventh floor, then back up, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> Spoilers out of here! When Angie comes to the seventh floor, she kills a big woman with blonde hair. The woman hacks her until she reaches the first floor when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. Nancy reaches the elevator, has a wonderful time, Angie arrives at her and the killer blade is ready for Nancy's hands. Then follow some electrifying images when Nancy looks and sees that the elevator is a convex mirror. All this is good, and by the time we are in dialogue again, you think; "Woah, this was just 22 straight minutes from a purely visual narrative!" Or maybe you don't, but I'll do it. <br /> <br /> Younger Dennis Franz has a big role as a buggy and tough New York detective who would rather want everyone else to do his job. He interviewed Michael Cain, making this outrageous (though it goes into the usual) Angie WANTED kills. There's also Angie's son, and he grabs Nancy and started laughing at Caine's therapist and finding out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Again, there is a strong attachment to Hitchcock, in this case Psycho (just like Obsession is re-working with Vertigo). You have a woman we should understand, a secret bitch who kills in a closed room in the first 30 minutes, in this case an elevator, not a shower. Then the dead relatives carry out an investigation that shows that the killer is a man dressed for killing a woman. De Palma will finally throw away the doctor who explains the psychology of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting, but at the same time the viewer can feel a little bit around, and this is my primary reservation for this movie. This is definitely an important sight and demonstrates some of De Palma's greatest items, but the feeling that the story is behind the third when De Palma has to show, and his somewhat uncomfortable sexual fantasies make it harder to look at it. <br /> <br /> --- Check out my website's comments about bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
