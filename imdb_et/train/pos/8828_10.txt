I was so glad I came with this short film. I'm always so disappointed that the short films are hard to meet, so when I saw it and saw it nominated for the Academy Awards Live Action Short Film, I was so pleased that I actually had the movie I was introducing. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, the director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to come up with a reason why people suddenly break the song and dance number as they did in movie music. The result is very fun and the song is really memorable. <br /> <br /> This is a well-made short film, well edited, and the actors all do a good job. And the last picture of the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
