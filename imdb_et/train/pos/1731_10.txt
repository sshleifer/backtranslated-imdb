The sex time of the late seventies and the early seventies began with free movies for free, and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. It was a peak in 1968-1972. One of the most loved and talented actors of the era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatical follower culture. He was actually able to act, unlike many who played the leading role of these flicks, and his later credits proved it. And his seemingly deliberate deterioration is uncertain when his career was pushed away, but he increased his mystery. <br /> <br /> Director Gary Graver was also a talent; probably too talented for the genre of sex plundering, and her skill with Monica Gayle's screen makes Sandra's wife a pleasant experience. The movie never pulls and you don't have to press your finger to fast forward.
