Man, if someone is waiting for a great zombie film after reading this title, you are slow and you have to be disappointed. As for myself, I waited for a small budget zombie flick for a cheeseball and that's exactly what I got. I wasn't disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool little movie. The zombies were exactly as they should be, because all the zombies were turned to JUST, so they are freshly undead zombies. Obviously they did it because it would have been quite costly if they had made a full zombie FX. I understood the whole thing, I have no idea how anyone could seriously nip this movie. It is called "Living" for God's love. Would you watch "Redneck Zombies" and ANE Uwe Boll movie and HOPE it very big? Of course not! So why does IMDb have some moles that make a movie like schoolgirls whine, I never understand. Oh and yeah, there are worse movies out there, so tell me that it was the worst you've ever seen because you know you're full! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "dead house" ???? These are some of the worst I've ever seen. If you don't see that it's just a low-budget zombie movie that has probably been made by zombie movie fans, then something is wrong with you. I was just having fun. A little bit up and I would like to see a sequel.
