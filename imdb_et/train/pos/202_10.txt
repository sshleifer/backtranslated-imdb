A The rating is 10/10 if the CYBER-SHOT is very user-friendly. The best actors of their time, Walter Matthau & George Burns, collaborate with Neil Simon and all other actors in this film, directed by Herbert Ross. Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70s. I love this type of humor, it just makes me laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> I got this movie VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper for only $ 3). I looked at it as soon as I got home, but I had to look at it again because I missed some parts for the first time. The second time I watched it, it seemed much better and laughed much harder. I definitely want to get it back on the DVD because I need to see the specifics. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how it happens. Two people work together as entertainers / actors / performers. They get to the stage well, but they really argue on the stage, they can't survive with each other for a few minutes, then about 15 years later they want to reconnect to the TVs. You can find this in this movie. Matthau & Burns was terrible in this movie. It's the fucking shame they died. George Burns deserves Oscar. He gave a strong comic book. He was also 78 when the movie was filmed. So far, she is the oldest actor in receiving the academic award. Jessica Tandy breaks herself as the oldest actor. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won the Golden Globe for the best supporting actor. He deserves this Golden Globe. While many people disagree with what I say, everything in this movie has produced a strong result. This comedy is a classic classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: who hates this movie is "Putz"
