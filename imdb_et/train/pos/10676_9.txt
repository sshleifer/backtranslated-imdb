The film was shot in Liverpool at Gerard Gardens and was the UK's response to films such as Blackboard Jungle. The film is quite a test of time, with all moral stories still (or even more) relevant. The film has some great British actors like David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays the Liverpool police assigned to juvenile contacts, assuming that when you reach children early, they are responsible adults. <br /> <br /> Significant lights of the movie are Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow are playing brothers and sisters (they are the real brother and sister of life) who have caught the criminals on the web. Tsai Chin is still active and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman movie Interpretor. <br /> <br /> Violent playgrounds contain a siege ring at school, so it won't appear on TV after similar events. Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in the gardens of Gerard, where the film was taken (although it wasn't born at that time) and I have pleasant memories of the region. I recently graduated from Gerard Gardens documentary, which contains extracts from a "violent playground" and a small UK film "Coast to Coast", which marks Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The buildings were demolished in 1987 and the films keep the memory alive. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released, there were complaints from residents, as the film depicted an area of ​​bad light. Time has helped heal these wounds. <br /> <br /> A little pearl from the movie, I'd recommend looking for it
