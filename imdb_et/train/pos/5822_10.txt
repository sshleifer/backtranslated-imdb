Three Stooges have always been some of the many actors I loved. I love almost all of the short they've done. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are fun and also celebrate many other great actors and actors, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, the three Stooges are one of the greatest actors and are always a more comedy team! <br /> <br /> It's good for three short. It's funny and is cast by Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin, and Bess Flowers. Stooges played very well in this short game! I recommend it!
