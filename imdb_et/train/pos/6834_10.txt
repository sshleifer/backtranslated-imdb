Let's go straight to the point: this is a film I would take to the desert island (DVD player). It's just perfect. If you see the reason that you love the actors to see the movie, you want to see that they can play in the room and feel free to participate, this movie is for you. See this scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) arrives on stage and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because he no longer follows the script. If you are sensitive to camera movement, how the camera moves on stage, the specific stream that gives you a camera, following the actors, as if it had led the theater's "private space" ... amazing. And the story is just a great story and a realistic drama Cassavets is again talking about Hollywood and the key companies' policies, but this time he does it through Broadway, making one of the most exciting films in the theater.
