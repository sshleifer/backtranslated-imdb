This is my second time through A Perfect Spy. I looked at it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it. I still like it. It's natural that this is compared to Baby's other major Le Carre series Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on "game" spies; The perfect spy gives us the second axis - which person is spy. There are several topics that these movies share with others in the genre. <br /> <br /> The vague - moral, sexual, interpersonal - that creates a multidimensional space for true and false, inside and outside, love vs responsibility. In a sense, these characters are the happiest when they are treated wisely by those they love and respect - in different nuances "backstabbed". <br /> <br /> The father and father numbers are also important. One of the most interesting letters of A Perfect Spy is Rick, the main character of Magnus, or the father of ersatz. The whole story he bets and betrays. A scammer who can always climb upside down when he is resurrected, who seems to be not thinking about him, asks Magnus each time they meet: "Do you love your old man?" and never: "Do you love me?" Maybe it says it somewhere else, but the perfect spy is a love story. Another topic is the issue of malignant tumors. The essence of the company is to change people - turn them against their government against their friends and companions, change them against their values ​​and beliefs. In all Le Carre films I've seen, the tragedy is based on Spy, who came from the cold, glass war, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, the Smiley people, and the perfect spy. Finally, not so much a theme as an artistic touch - there is usually only one weapon in each of these films, or maybe two frames that provide a story. Violence, torture, cruelty is always under the surface. We see their results not as streams of blood or prison arms, but in the objects that Le Carre's characters stick to because they are effortlessly sucking down into the moor. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movies above and you enjoy Perfect Spy, you're on therapy. I also recommend The Sandbagger Series (Yorkshire TV), the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which will reach such a level of complexity. In Berlin, the IPCRESS file and funeral package is nice, though light. With a political intrigue, try a great British coup, a house of cards and yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only the British were to make their three kingdoms, the film would be intriguing and intricate.
