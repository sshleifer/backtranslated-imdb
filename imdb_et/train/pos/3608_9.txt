Sports movies have never been my thing, but a handful of them work for me. The best ones are less focused on sports and more on nature, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great director debut for Karyn Kusama and a great performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels both realistic and inclusive, it is enough to make it a memorable film. <br /> <br /> The plot is small enough. Diana Guzman is in her fourth high school year, but thanks to her corridor cleaning she is near expulsion. As a means of relieving anger, he enrolls in boxing lessons at a club where his brother is training (according to his father's wishes). <br /> <br /> In ninety minutes, our viewers will see something extraordinary. Diana almost turns from a girl to a woman. We see it both in our body and in its behavior, especially when one of the boys in the club finds themselves under his leadership and gets into it. There is no bad scene or flat / contrast in the movie. The only mistake I would say could be that one of the subplots ends with what seems to be an unfinished note. In addition, Girlfight is a great movie.
