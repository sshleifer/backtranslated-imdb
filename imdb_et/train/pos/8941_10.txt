I really enjoyed this movie from the Delany sisters. I knew them, but it was all. This film opened my eyes to their courage and courage. With a couple. What sacrifices they made for life under their own conditions. This is not only the African African Americans, but all Americans. It is a kind of history lesson and documentary that has been rolled into one and a combination of entertaining film biography. The actors were all better involved and we really get a glimpse of what these two sisters have been through for many years. Both sisters are completely different from each other. They came from a very loving and very strict family with a high, perhaps even impossible, standard of perfection. It is sad to see Sadie's father refusing to allow her daughter to continue seeing her boyfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I recommend this movie thoroughly and I am glad I got it on television the other day.
