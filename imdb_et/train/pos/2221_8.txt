One night I stumbled upon it at a satellite station in Bravo. To be absolutely honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and her body is well shown. would be wasted as an actor, but probably not after the whole movie! My only real handle is the supporting cast actor, especially the actress who plays Melnik. Christ is bad! The prison guard Hank is also bad. get drunk and do it bad when he goes to his associate Wanda, though fortunately he has fallen and dirty with Wanda for the viewer and Hank. Used music is quite tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for executions. This movie is looking beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
