it is hard to talk more about this movie without breaking it. I liked it because I did not expect what I saw, but a normal sex book .... This is a pscyho-sexual thriller where nothing seems like. It includes Emmanuelle Seigner, who is not a stranger to the genre (and nudity) in which his wife Polanski had led him. And a tortoise performance (did I say creepy / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (Bernard Tavernier actor). It looks like Pascal Bruckner will meet Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), like Chabrol's mistake or Clouzot's thriller (I've seen someone who mentioned Les Diaboliques) but closer to Georges Franju Les Yeux sans Visage (eyes without face, the godfather of Dr. Phibes and more). Gem! I'm just afraid they'll hit this Hollywood remake as they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
