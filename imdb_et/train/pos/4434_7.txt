It's not complicated and no one's credit was a big career, but as a whole, because there are no famous personalities; the film seems more realistic than some big budgets, well-cast movies. <br /> <br /> For a few bucks, a film that deserves to be viewed should give hope to all those who are filmmakers and unwanted actors. br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it is made at the worst possible time. The TV took over the revenues of the film industry and this film would have been easily visible on television. In 1950, the entire TV price would qualify for the G-rating. The film industry began to make more "adult" films that could not be shown on television on the days when the TV didn't dare to show the sex and skin of today's ads.
