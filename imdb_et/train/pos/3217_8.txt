Kurt Russell is so plausible and action so endless that after thinking that there are important topics of honesty-goodness [Overcoming foreign fear, learning about early conditioning, love and love can bring friendship, etc. It is so rare in the case of a "man's action flick" that even me [who thinks most A / A is a violent priest] liked the film and suggested it to every familiar man ..... it's a shame that it was overlooked because with rights, he should have been one of the biggest adventurous adventure offices - he has something for everyone without being tense and losing almost non-stop activities. I am afraid that the answer to the fact that it did not hit is that adults did not see it. People under 20 years of age have probably not only seen more violent activities in their video games, but they probably do not benefit from multi-layered, versatile beauty or care about it. This movie can change anyone who avoids A / A as meaningless violence. If a man takes his lady [or rents it or sees it in a cable list] to see this movie, he will be more likely to move with him to other activities.
