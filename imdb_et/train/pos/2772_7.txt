I've always believed that David and Bathsheba was a film originally designed for Tyrone Power in Fox of the 20th century, although Gregory Peck gives himself as King David, a monarch who is misleading. <br /> <br /> This film, adultery, salvation, sin, punishment, and generally what God expects from his followers, covers many biblical topics. <br /> <br /> If you are a king, even in a kingly, biblically-predicted kingdom, you will certainly have many perogatives that are not open to the rest of us. King David has many women, including one truly cruel Jayne Meadows, daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But her eyes look out of Bathsheba in her garden one evening. It turns out that he is so happily married to Uriah of Hete, as David has quite a few women. Uria is one of the masters of David's army. David sends Bathsheba and he is a king, he is on the run, because he has also been watching him. <br /> <br /> What happens, the thing, the pregnancy and the carefully organized death of Uriah. But all the sight and knowledge of Deity is all caught and not only punishes David and Bathsheba, but the whole kingdom of Israel is punished by drought, disease, and rabies. <br /> <br /> Sexual Law Day calls Bathsheba to die with stones. David shows weakness in his earlier actions, but here he climbs up on the record and asks him to put everything on him. He even puts his hands on the Ark of the Treaty, which was an immediate death on the film. <br /> <br /> My interpretation is that God will admire the guts even if you are wrong and will let David and both forgive them. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and he and David are the ancestors of several successors to the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, until they are both conquered. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is a jerky Bathsheba who is caught in an unbelievable marriage with Uriah, played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that makes Moore a good battle. I really liked Kieron Moore's brave and pretty stupid horse. <br /> <br /> No one can legislate like Raymond Massey. His prophet Nathan is in line with John Brown's character he played in two films with the same intensity. So when his own laws called for death, why did God continue to Bathsheba and keep David on the throne. Perhaps it was that He just didn't want to train a third man. He already replaced Saul with David. But I think the Christian interpretation may be that it was a hint of a new Testament that one can sin and receive mercy when someone asks for it in a subtle manner. I will leave it to the biblical scholars for interpretations. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you can come up with a whole new theory.
