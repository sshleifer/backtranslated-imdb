Richard Dix decided to retire and Michael Duane took on the role of Ted Nichols, who met with young French girl Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple knew each other only for two days and they decided to marry the justice of the peace (judge), and it poured rain when they retreat to the judge's home and find that he is not home and does not return until the next day. When the couple is inside the house, you will see that one lifts his car's hood and takes part of the car. When you see this event, you realize that this couple is a great surprise and a story to reveal a very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley and so poor Ted Nichols starts with a lot of trouble and no marriage. Good secret, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
