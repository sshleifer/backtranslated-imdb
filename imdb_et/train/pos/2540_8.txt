Although not as famous as any other collaboration (such as BLACK CAT and BODY SNATCHER), it is a mighty little horror film, although the election decisions were a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays dr. Janos Rukhit, a strange scientist living in the Carpathian Mountains - near the town of Dracula. Bela Lugosi plays Dr Benet whose nationality was never discussed, although the name certainly sounds in French. I really think it would have been wise to have two switches, because the Carpathian role seems to be adapted for Lugos, especially with his accent. Despite this unusual twist, these two good works did. Karloff certainly played a leading role, but Lugosi released himself as a relatively normal person - something he didn't play very often in movies! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a little pariah, because other scientists (especially Benet) think his theories are odd and meaningless. But during the film it turns out that Rukh is right and Benet is especially generous for his new praise to Rukh. But unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered has a disgusting side effect of making it a crazy killing machine (don't you hate it when it happens?). Although it might have been just a nice scholar who was a mad story, the plot was well-designed, well-developed characters, and mad Rukh was not a one-dimensional killer, but complicated and interesting. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely someone except people who hate old horror movies. You can really say that Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops and made a film with a bigger budget instead of a cheaper movie, to the detriment of Lugosi and Karloff in later years. Good stuff.
