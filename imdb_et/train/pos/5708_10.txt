It's so exciting! After I saw "La Roue" in the afternoon, a short, delightful little movie, I consider it a real treat! It's completely delightful and one of the most charming pictures I saw this year. It is more amazing because it is an early chat and puts good images of the 30's into shame thanks to the use of innovative sound in the cinema. It's just music and the divine mood that's really horrible and the bottom line that made me happy! Obviously, it would not be so difficult to get a lottery ticket when the male driver had been looking for, but the pace is so exhilarating and the film is so remarkably entertaining that he didn't even think twice. Comedy is a lot of fun many times and I think it's even better than Marx Brothers, which is probably the greatest comic force of time. It's pretty perfect.
