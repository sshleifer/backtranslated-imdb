My 10/10 rating is just a fun factor and assumes that you have decided that you liked "killing high" even before looking at it. Yes, this is a typical revenge-many years-dirty-prank story, but how do you dislike some of the things that they pull here? I couldn't have predicted that the bath scene was a million years old. <br /> <br /> OK, so maybe we could be cynical and say this movie doesn't offer anything new. Well, it doesn't pretend. This is a kind of flick that "Scream" characters probably looked at, and it contributed to their rules of how to live a horror movie. After all, who doesn't want to see how people suffer from these things? Obviously, this is a kind of reactive undertone, because people will be punished for what the 60s won. But still, you have to love this stuff! So, apologizing to Don McLean, this singer did not sing for the king and the queen!
