Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) suddenly comes over to his son. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is quite surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis), has left her father. Spouse Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and her three sisters are trying to find Muriel while Ben and her father are going to look at a farm that is for sale. But it's not the end of their journey. His journey changes between a long treatment session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director of Thul About My Folks (2005) .Paul Reiser is behind the scenario and he has done considerable work. Ben and Sam's dialogue is just amazing. And he worked with the script for twenty years, so it's no wonder it's good. Who would be a better man to play with father than Peter Falk? Somebody, I can't tell you. And I really love the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk to part. Peter was an actor who made his father laugh. And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie. It's just fun when they go fishing.And how the old man wins the younger half of the pool and then wins him a stick.The film is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times.But it can also be touching from time to time. You couldn't say anything better than you said here.
