I watched a DVD while watching the movie, and I think anyone who saw it before watching the movie would be very surprised and perhaps frustrated. It did a lot about the movie being "by the Cube director" and it looked like a horror film, when in fact it is an Absurd comedy (IMDB spell-checking doesn't seem to think Absurd is a word, but it is), Rosencrantz and Guildernstern resemble, is dead. <br /> <br /> I love how the story slowly builds up, then gradually expands. I am also pleased that there is no explanation in the film. This and the fact that the story plays mainly in only one set is the only aspect in which this movie is similar to Cube. I recommend it.
