Fever Pitch is a fun movie. It has a lot of funny moments (including a fun disturbing shower). Like most romantic comedies, the middle of the "dead zone", where all the hard, "he breaks with me" things happen, but besides being still funny until the end. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is turned around by fanaticism towards Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sports. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I am easy to say: I've been a boy because I'm a boy. > <br /> of 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Barky
