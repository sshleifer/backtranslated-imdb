All dogs go to heaven is a movie I've always liked. When I was a child, I watched it every other day. This is underestimated when you look at your IMDb rating and many people's comments in general. It's not a bad movie as many say it's a very good movie. It's good and your kids will probably like it. Although it is rated G, some parents may consider it violent. In fact, this is a pretty dark story where dogs are similar to mobiles that are involved in gambling, extortion, and even the murder of cold blood. The movie is followed by a dog named Charlie, who escapes from the nail, kills his old friend, goes to heaven, but comes back to earth. Many younger children who watch this movie may feel they are watching a great children's film. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that can scare little children, but I'm sure they will do well. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me when I was a little boy. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they were younger, a movie that makes me feel like that. The productions by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last film with a little girl Judith Barsi. Unfortunately, he was killed at a young age, a shame because he had so much potential and not. t deserve what happened. Now that I know his story, I can't watch this movie anymore because his voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> Animation of this movie is great, the voice is great and the story is good, but slightly different from other children's movies. It was popular at the time of its publication, but Disney's biggest popular The Little Mermaid remained in the shadow. This is a movie that is not filled by adults, but if you're a child, or if you grew up with this child, I'm sure you enjoy it.
