Inspired by the Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, who performed throughout the war at Covent Garden Opera House, this film crowns the efforts of older saxophone players to reform (almost) all the girls she played as a school student at the end of World War II. Too short backtracks to the original band give us great music and help the members of the band to have a background, and especially girls, with an individual member - their transvestite band (who tries to give up calling). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench are turning to superb leading performances, such as Elizabeth's recent widow, and the innate, feminine Patrick, drummer. Late Joan Sims is the perfect band leader who now plays bar piano on the sea side and in June Whitfield glows as a thrombone player. Cameo's performances by other googles such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelawi make this an unforgettable experience. The film is a memorial track that has all the stars that should be rights to be actors on the hill. I can say I hope I can see my age so good! Especially Leslie Caron is still an incredible fox at the age of 69. He still gets my pulse! Looking at it, I looked spiritually at the leading director that she did not use women of suitable age. Later, I looked up at these girls and discovered that each of them is old enough to perform in London in 1944 (although it may be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swinging bands, flourishing with nostalgia, or just want to see how a good woman can look at her almost three-quarters, don't miss this movie. <br /> <br />
