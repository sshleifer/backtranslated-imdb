Ever since I heard Ralph Baksh's "Lord of the Rings", I thought, "What the hell is the" rotoscope "animation? !!! Well ... I finally learned ... I saw this movie about three years ago had a clue who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I liked it ... a lot ... A very good story ... it's even a small character development that is great for a comic ... Look at it when you get bored with modern animation .. .. Don't get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a nice comic ... It's also a pretty good movie ...
