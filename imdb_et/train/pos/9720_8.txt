"How to lose friends and transfer people" is a great movie. Fun from the beginning to the end of the movie. Lovely entertainer. I enjoyed it. Thumps Up! Performances: Jason is fantastic. She treats her from start to finish. Jeff Bridges is a great boss. He's a legend. Megan Fox looks amazingly hot and gives a good result. but dude, he's such a hot man! Anderson is wonderful. She doesn't see an old one, still hot. Kristan Dunst looks cute and does a good job. Others are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> "How to lose friends and transfer people" is a great entertainer.
