I have to admit that Tsui Hark is unique, you can't be in a strong style movie. The image of Chinese fantasy may not be easily presented to the audience, the director tried to bring back the classic fantasy tales of the Zu Hill and that is what he showed. <br /> <br /> The New Zu Legend Is Really Improved This new millennium innovation has seen Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu Mountains. Decorating with visual designs, the amazing action-fantasy epic is done nicely well. Keep me glued through the whole picture. Great pain just fine. It's really fun to watch a movie, but is it too weird? <br /> <br /> Now, it's down to people getting confused by the wide story that is shortened to a 95-minute movie. There may not be a lot of connection between characters on a plot, but by rewriting a movie, you have a better feeling of understanding the signs. Some may complain that there is not too much physical struggle, in addition to the supernatural ability of the characters to defeat enemies, heroes fighting hand in hand do not make any sense. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this nice stylish picture. It may have a thin story, but look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", which we could confuse, but it was really something stylish and awesome. Tsui Hark attracts H.K. Movie. American audiences can understand this film a bit while watching this movie because it is not a tiger, a hidden dragon, it is a brand new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but it has special effects really better than Storm Riders. It's really worth it.
