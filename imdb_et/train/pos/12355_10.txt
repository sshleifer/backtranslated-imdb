I understand those who do not know the reason for this film because lack of knowledge is first of all <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not Geisha, but brothel tenants and one who doesn't know the difference doesn't understand half the movie and certainly not the end . It is a complete work of art about the lives and needs of women in this age. Everything is important, and certainly as they dress, it means more in the movie than words. For those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, I suggest you read a little about this society before making a conclusion that is out of reality. This is Kurosawa's work, which is life, and I am sure the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa's work for the right intellectual choice.
