This film hit my heart from the very beginning when I heard the first notes of Quincy Jones or saw the wonderful color of flowers in meadows. It's really a movie that cries and dies ...! The majority casts the best results in the movies I've seen for years, and Spielberg has really crossed over! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (lord!), Danny Glover and others give us the best and you know it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, he gives him that the insecurity and inferiority that we grow with him, we grow up with him, throughout the film, and we triumph with him. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even if she is her arrogant, and shows us that "sinners" are indeed "souls". Always liking, charming, Danny Glover is doing a great job to hate him and (I say sir) Quincy Jones's great music adds to that great movie! Photography, music, director and music make this a beautiful, spiritual film for life. You don't want to miss it! "Sista" ... remember my name ... "
