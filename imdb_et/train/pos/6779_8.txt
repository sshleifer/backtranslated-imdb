George Cukor leads the baking and cynic classics. The peculiar Ronald Coleman is in this Noir piece with the best actor who loses his roles. Recognized Anthony John (Colman) has driven his wife Britna (Signe Hasso) to her very strong behavior. But both succeed in continuing to work together to please their audience. Things start to change when John is bored because of his career. he is reluctant to play Othello. He gets deep into character as a jealous and murderous man. He starts a walk between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his life, and eventually kills his lover (Shelley Winters), but he has no memory of a stupid act. <br /> <br /> Colman seems to be flawless in this role. Winters are very impressive when a young woman decided to leave her uneven life. Also in production: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
