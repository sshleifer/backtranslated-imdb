I got it completely out and couldn't wait for every episode. Action brought to life when the emotional person is lost in the family, and the consequences it would have on the closest people. The only problem we had with the family was how fast it all was "clarified" at the end. We couldn't hear clearly what was said and who had no idea what Gary was all about? Why did Kyle call him and why did he go along with it? After five hours of investing in the series, we felt disappointed that it only took five minutes to reach a conclusion. I've asked and none of my friends who watched it was wiser. Very strange, but maybe we missed something important ??
