I liked this movie, cute and funny. I found this movie a good family movie. The hardest part of this movie was when he referred to the New York Yankees. You have to be a Red Sox nation to understand that the NY Yankees have a dirty word. Excuse me to say to Yankee fans. I recommend this picture to the whole family. Of course, with your typical love / comedy movie, there's a long moment in the movie where I am in love and what I do, but the film does it for all the thumbnails. The movie show has a few moments on how the fans of the Red Sox (Fenway Park) knew that 86 years of Sox has always been screwed at the end of the season and how Sox's love and love for another person go hand in hand.
