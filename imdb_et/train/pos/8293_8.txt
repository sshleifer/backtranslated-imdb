As a 90-minute experience, it does not meet the "Drive" standard because the participants were clearly aware of their trade who is "Who am I?" the academy, while the action sequences are generally not better than the excellent Mark Dacascos. But those who enjoyed "Drive" (and I thought it was wonderful!) Will certainly enjoy it. You definitely won't go back to the beginning and you will look back again, but be sure to slip back some of the action for a long time. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see that choreography of quality fighting is still practiced, even if not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these men could do with budgets, time and respect offered to Yuen Woo and Corey Yuen Kueile. If you sit in the first half of the year and not be crazy because of an insane dialogue, then you're treating. Bosch is great and can really break up with some great acrobatics, beating and simple bravery. <br /> <br /> If you manage to be 500 miles away from a copy, follow it and watch it. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, it is less literal than Coolio's Chinese Strike Force, but you are impressed by the moves on the screen and the feel of the stunt team - (I'm pretty sure there is no safe way to land for you) head, or you need to force a wooden roof to speed over by car!?). <br /> <br />
