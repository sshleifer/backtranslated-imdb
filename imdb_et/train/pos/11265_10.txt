I never knew who Robert Wuhl had seen before. But after I saw it, I realized what he was a funny man. This special feature of HBO taught "American History" to New York University film students and the man was just phenomenal. He created almost every major historical event that took place not only in the US but in some other part of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that questioned me if what I feel like a true history is really true. <br /> <br /> I liked how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information and comedy and learn a lot more. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in history and wants to ask what his convictions are.
