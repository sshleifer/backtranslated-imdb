This movie is completely fun. Its cast clicks take you directly to the frame and lead us to a great ride through gangster movie spam. The conflict between Brother and Brother appears when Johnny's brother becomes a do-gooder D.A. But the best character is Johnny's Crusader, the highly acclaimed Moroni. As Johnny says, "This person should be arrested for English." <br /> <br /> Watch the video. Worth a look.
