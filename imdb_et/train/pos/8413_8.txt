A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed that she loses perspective and common sense. The evil magician approaches her and tells her that she can give her the great wealth she can use to win the woman's heart when she agrees to something she wants, in their room. The dark guy agrees and the wizard steals the reflection of the man from reflection - and naturally occurs as a result of bad things. Reviewing and evaluating this movie has not been so charitable. After all, the plot plots in the spots are a little vague and the act of dancing is sometimes somewhat inclined. But if you think "full-length" movies were rare in 1913 - and often only 20-30 minutes long! In addition, this idea of ​​a complicated story, as you get into this movie, is very unusual - when the stories were very short and broadly acting. So, given the time constraints, this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier known horror films.
