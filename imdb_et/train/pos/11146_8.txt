An amazing man in the city of New York, who was forced to live in a dead building with a criminal. Particularly grim study of today's moral and social decline, which was well run by John Schlesinger (who never worked here) and worked great with Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Generally, it packs a pretty punch, but "fantasy" scenes, some of which have been played to smile, are slightly intrusive, as is the "mod" batch. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, but the filmmakers are cautious not to eat, and it gives the picture an edge that it would not have been less than a director than Schlesinger. Originally X-rated in 1969 and Best Picture Winner Oscar; scriptwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger also won the shape. *** 1/2 from ****
