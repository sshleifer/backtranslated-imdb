Red Rock West is one of those tight thrillers we rarely see. It is amazing, well-behaved and leaves us with no open ends or unanswered questions that are so typical of this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage stands for Michael, an unemployed Texas who is desperate enough to lead the job to Wyoming for possible employment. He is an honest guilty but always on the dark side of destiny. <br /> <br /> After Michael didn't get paid, Michael Red Rock's bar, where owner Wayne (JTWalsh) injured him, was hit. he called Dallas a contract killer, hired his lovely but deadly wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). <br /> <br /> Wayne gives Michael the necessary information and a down payment for the adulterous Suzie strike. Michael is not going to follow it, he will take the money and warn Suzanne about his impending death. He also sends a letter to the local sheriff, who reveals the plot and splits. <br /> <br /> When fate says, Michael is not going to get rid of this situation. Leaving the violence, he runs a lover of Suzannes. Of course Michael is Michael, he takes him to a local hospital where he was found to have let. <br /> <br /> Sheriff is invited and, if lucky, Wayne is a local law. Michael manages to escape during this last race, and then the real "Dallas" Lyle from Dirk Hopper's murderer. After they discovered they were compatriots, Lyle asked Michael to join him with a drink, where else at the Red Rock bar. There, Wayne understands his mistake and soon he and Lyle are looking for Michael, who is happy to fall on the shelter of Suzannes. <br /> <br /> As the tempo rises, we learn that Wayne and Suzanne really wanted armed robbers, a multi-million dollar theft. Getting money becomes a focal point for films in many bets, double crosses and murders. <br /> <br /> The film was very well cast. Nicolas Cage was usually a low key, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye took over their roles more than many. The best results were given by late J.T. Walsh, who was threatening, unaware. Walsh was a great character actor who left us too early. The film was further complemented by John Dahl's tight director and Morris Chestnut's quick fire editing.
