At the end of the 19th century, San Francisco worked poorly in the well-dressed bank of Errol Flynn (like James J. Corbett) and enjoys local "fighting" (boxing) with his co-worker and drinking friend Jack Carson (Walter Lowrie). One day, Alexis Smith (Victoria Ware) walks to Comstock Bank, where Mr Flynn is working. Flynn is made with the beauty of Mrs. Smith when she offers her extract. Smith's secret is taken with the beautiful Flynn, but he collides with his glory. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good deed (actually a takeover attempt) gets him a free Olympic club that comfortably includes a high school (boxing equipment). However, the "club" members are annoyed by Flynn's uneven way and practical jokes (he knocks men in parallel bars). When an English boxing tour is visited by a club, members try to get to Flyney's man. They hope Flynn leaves, lowering his defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first producer, Robert Buckner, brings together a nice package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner was definitely his success story (studio) for a great "Yankee Doodle Dandy" studio. Unfortunately, this story is positively ridiculous. There was "Gentleman Jim" - this story is supposed to be filming the actual autobiography of "The Crowd of the Crowd" by James J. Corbett, but this movie must be fancy. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive leader; he maneuvered the script lightly and by the beginning of the 1940s it should have been recognized as an excellent actor. Many of Flynn's testimonials were overlooked as great performances and one of them. Smith makes her female interest by passing on her emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh makes stupidity smooth and extravagant. The treasure trolley, from the delicate Alan Hale (Pat Corbett) to Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"), is a casting support. <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
