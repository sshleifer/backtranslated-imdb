I watched Holly with another film on trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, which is called a commercial film by the sea at an international film festival. I have to say Holly blew out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing movie on many different levels. Only from an artistic and kinematic point of view is it amazing. Blending sound, camera corners, directing and acting are all on the ground. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way it treats the substance is delicious and unavailable. It presents the issue of sexual exploitation of children in both educational and accurate ways. The filmmakers paid extraordinary attention to the details, indeed capturing the nuances of the child's sexual exploitation and human trafficking epidemic. Too often, when dealing with this kind of topic, it is tempting for the audience to be shocked by the graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly can do all this without falling into this typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I have had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I've never seen any audience more. By simply listening to conversations after screening, the people they personally can do to fight the sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, both to their cinematic value and to their content.
