After watching the Next Action Star reality TV series, I was glad to see the winning movie right now. I was introducing this new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Of course Billy Zane was her usual big man, but Corinne and Sean kept her next. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (including the competition) in their co-roles. Seaman's character, not Billy, is hunting and his disappointment in discovering new rules in the game has been well played. Instead, Corinne walks between the rope character of the Sea symbol and is just for that money. I loved how the game was last played. And then beyond! Not a big movie, but an entertaining way and a great show for two people for the first time out of the gate.
