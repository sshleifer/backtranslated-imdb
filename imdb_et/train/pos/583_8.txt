In Montana's small town, two brothers grow. One is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is revered by Maclean and they grow up with their lessons related to religion and flight fishing lessons. In this film, fly-fishing is a bit of a life. <br /> <br /> The story is good and keeps your attention, although there are a few moments you need a little. The film is likely to have such moments because it is not really events, but a message. Some things happen. Norman goes to study in Dartmouth. After six years, she returns with her beautiful girl Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul has become a reporter and is called "fishing reporter". He is famous and seems to have a nice life, but he drinks too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well targeted, has a nice score and all the participants are good. The most beautiful thing about this film is cinematography. The mountains, forests and the river are very beautiful. When the film was only made for them, it was good enough to watch. Fortunately, there is more.
