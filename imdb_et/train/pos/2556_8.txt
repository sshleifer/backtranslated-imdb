And it was made for the film, this movie was good. it happened and the plot was so big. this is one of the only movies I've seen that I felt like I was thinking about my way of thinking because after I saw it, I was scared of killing Reaper on my computer screen. For this movie, only a few small things were wrong, but it has been very easily reviewed. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr played an excellent role in this film with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. this movie just has so much intercourse and it made me want more because I never thought that a low-budget TV movie could be so powerful. After reading this, I read the novel (four times) on which this film was based, and it was too big. If you see this movie on television, I'd look at it. The effects of this movie were pretty well done, I don't really know what a person would look like, but what the FX team did about this movie was impressed and all this shows that all these are bad for TV movies. there with low budgets should not be so bad to suck. <br /> <br /> Look at it. It's really good, really, it's!
