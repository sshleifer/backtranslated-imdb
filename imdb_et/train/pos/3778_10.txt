The first film had little ambition, so nothing left on the screen. It was a bad version of "Back to the Future" with zero charm. If it is accepted that Bill & Ted is nitwits, jokes will only be available to the audience so long before it breaks. <br /> <br /> It's a surprise. It's your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> Today's standards make it more fun. It was an abandoned release, sad, given that more talent is involved than the first time. We get 'Face / Off' photographer, 'Fugitive' editor, Burton's early work designer and 'Matrix' sound designer. <br /> <br /> Writers wrote something deep into their lower first outing. As it was occupied by the fanbas and the public, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It is not, it suits the material. As "Death Changes To Him" ​​and "Catch-22", it dares to be smart, but we like our movies "easy" so we don't buy it. Probably because it was daring to be different, it is why 12 manufacturers take it away. What's so good? <br /> <br /> - Happy self-analysis for Keanu; from the air to Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> Joss hates his work as much as he hates his colleagues, he makes his hatred. Evil B & T and "good robots use" have the same vocabulary as their original: smaller copies and a decrease in language value. <br /> <br /> - The motto of "duality". Nowhere else is it obvious than in photography styles, at a high and low angle. They even use Roy Brocksmith 'Total Recall' to highlight the point. <br /> <br /> - "Options" motif. I don't know where it started in the genre (perhaps "Ghostbusters"), but here it is used quite well. It can even fall to 7 deaths - battleship and club. <br /> <br /> - The film's own reference, even if it's against Death (Clue). It is wiser than the wizard or Brooks. Note that the Premier magazine cover is at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." Chronic as well as death and nomolos of "Die Hard" and "Lethal Weapon" descendants are also chronic. <br /> <br /> I still have some little nuts, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film are different media, so there's no point in why many scripts rotate around the former - especially in the teen market. Carlin is a big comedian, but he's wasted in these films. They may also not show this temptation, even because of homosexual jokes, but they can't kill the cat? <br /> <br /> So, despite Nickelodeon's production, it's very interesting. From this movie we got Beavis and Butt-Head. "We're in heaven and we just created three people." <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Average Material
