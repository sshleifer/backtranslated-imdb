10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British Indian doctor, currently in India. The word Beckham put me down, "I am a heavy Liverpool fan, and personally I think Owen is really cool. Because Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was DEAD sure I wouldn't watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet friends and I had an early morning flight, so I thought, "What the hell, let's take a look at this movie," "it was late night show. <br /> <br /> What was the moor. I should have seen this movie on the day it appeared. I think using Beckham's name was to attract the audience (which was burnt back in my case !!!), but then I can't really think of the right title for the movie. <br /> <br /> And Nagra Knightley (fallen dead gorgeous) and Rhys-Myers did a great job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, don't like Manchester United (or England), it's DEFINATELY for you. In fact, I am only 29 years old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a child. This movie has knocked "Star Wars" from my no.1 position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the Indian-British do not have much comment on this film. I do not know why? <br /> <br /> For this movie.
