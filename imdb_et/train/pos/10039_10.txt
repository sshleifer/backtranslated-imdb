Titanic is classic. I was really surprised that this film had no overall 10 in the IMDb list of users. Maybe it's just cool if Titanic doesn't get credit today, but when it was first made, it was really something. When the movie came out, they pulled into the theaters. When this video came out, I'd watch the sister and I do it twice a day for one month. It was safe to say that we were obsessed and for good reasons. Some catastrophe scenes were hard to forget, like a frozen child, or a boy who committed suicide after killing an unborn crowd. Many people died on this ship and it is difficult for James Cameron to face the challenge of direct and emotional filmmaking. Let us not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Was their relationship a kind of imagination, whether it was cute. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They know that hell gives Rome and Julia their drinks. "I'll never let go, Jack." Titanic is a great movie that is very core. It is a powerful story about brilliant action, excellent cinematography, beautiful music and a team of hard and dedicated employees. It really strikes my mind when someone says they hate this movie.
