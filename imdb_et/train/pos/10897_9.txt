What do you expect from "Surviving Christmas" and presented as "festive fun" like Ghandi or an English patient? There are many things I love about this movie, it's funny, it's very well cast, and it's perfectly written. I came to the movie as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort, but I was suspicious of reading the plot, it sounded ridiculous. But the film does not come together like this, because Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays its part perfectly, one minute a child like an adult, the next mature man who understands that he's all in life apart from what he really wants. In fact, we see that Latham grows up in this film when he encounters the problems of the people he envies and understands that their lives are not so good, he sees his own party not so bad. <br /> <br /> The film has less weak or dud scenes than many others have seen comedies. Comedy is so much harder than any other drama, it works or doesn't, and very few comedy writers get it right every time. Particularly I loved this dramatic scene where the family reads Latham's written parts. Enjoying the comments of Tom Valco (James Gandolfin) and Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). This is the dilemma of Tom Valco of greed, who has to bite his tongue, wear stupid hats or sing a Christmas tree to earn a prize money that keeps the movie well. <br /> <br /> The story of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) brings a pleasant romantic angle and why not a Christmas movie? Of course it is horny and alive; she is rich and beautiful, she is beautiful and lonely and so inevitably she and Afflect will eventually come down to the snow and find themselves face to face. Great! One thing I would have liked would be the festive use of music to increase the atmosphere, but I can't really complain. I got what I wanted.
