The deplorable social situation triggers a catastrophe: The impoverished Giovanna has fallen into the gutter but she still has a sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, the tenant of a fat-burning gas station, who has been around for years, chooses her from the street and offers her bed and home with her clumsy affection. But the physical contact that Giovanna is now confronting him only gives him a sense of disgust, so he doesn't see a benefactor in him, but a tormentor whom he must release. <br /> <br /> Gino's arrival as a young migrant will eventually give him a missed opportunity. And you don't have to ask him twice: At the first meeting, he gives him a sense of physical desire and a little later he lets him attract him without offering a resistance. <br /> <br /> The partnership must comply with the strict rules set by Giovanna. Gino's longing for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave Giovanna and start a new life far from being pregnant. Giovanna's goal is another goal: to get Bragana to kill, inherit and in addition to collect the insurance premium. In his hand, Gino degenerates into a means of self-sacrifice. Completely grateful for this woman, she becomes a killer of cold blood. <br /> <br /> But unlike Giovanni, he challenges the moral crime committed. Taking over the place of Bragana, which also includes sleeping in the bed of a dead person, causes deep sorrow. Later, after finding out what the future insurance premium is and seeing it look like Giovanna's insidiously developed plan, he also fills his lover's physical isolation and feels comfortable with a prostitute. <br /> When the Visconti movie ended at this point, it can easily be classified as a astonishing, computational and reckless portrait of a woman with mild social criticism. But then the last sequences will make this carefully constructed ideas collapse. Finally, Giovanna feels sorry for what he has done, and with his uncompromising revelation of his inner feelings, he succeeds in burning Gino's love again. His violent death as a result of an absurd traffic accident leaves him not only in the mercy of arbitrary destiny. It also affects us, while we realize that no acting character is responsible for their disaster. The culprit is simply a state of society that determines the path of an individual from the beginning. <br /> <br />
