It has some excellent spots, but the length of the film is not able to maintain a thin plot of wax. It's another seaman on vacation, zipper as Astaire 'Follow the Fleet', but not as good as 'City'. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is happier, but Kelly and Sinatra work well. The number of "If you know Susie" is fun when they sing this song. It's also fun with Sinatra, "I asked her", which shows how she's silver. The Sinatra solo songs are boring and seem to be added to show his song, not the story. Fortunately, supportive actors such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton have been achieved, and the unlikely but undeniable Jose Iturb himself to keep watching. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the star of the movie, though the third bill and it's interesting to see she interacts with kids that Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and locks Kelly's character. He also visits the school as a result of which he tells the children a fictional story of his life in the Pomeranian (!) Navy, leading his wonderful dance with animated Jerry Mouse. In the second scene, he dances with the charming Mexican Hat dance with the extremely frightening little girl Sharon McManus, which is entrancing and sweet. Very pleasant then, but a bit too long. Taster of better musicals.
