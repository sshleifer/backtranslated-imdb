This movie improved my opinion of Errol Flynn. Although Flynn is of course the best known for her own faire and sprezzatura (to couple a couple of high villagens in the European sense!), This film gives her the opportunity (though only a little) to stretch as an actor, as she plays in a marginalized social climber with a big ego and nerve feeling. Strong cast is great; everyone seems to be well-chosen for their roles. <br /> <br /> The story moves fast and though not very deeply (perhaps deliberately leaves the opportunity to make social comments about the massive uneven distribution of income over this period)), it will definitely attract and satisfy. About Jim Corbett, it seems that this story is reliable enough in history. I also enjoyed the great images of San Francisco in the 1880s. All in all, this movie doesn't really like it - it's worth it to watch.
