The biggest parts of Spencer Tracy, missed by San Francisco and captains, are this very curious film about war and its effects on some people. They gave her Gun stars Spencer Tracy and Francho Tone with the only movie they ever did together, and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tone are the first World War I, Toon is a weak character who almost starts behind the hill, but Tracy stops him. Tracy is still playing a lovable snowball, the younger Wallace Beery type MGM had for her when they wrote off Fox. <br /> <br /> Over the top Tone will be an opportunity and will accept it when it struggles to get to the church tower that reflects the German machine gun nest. He's learned to shoot now and he's doing Sergeant York. But Alvin C. York never changed the war, as Toon has. <br /> <br /> In a wounded fight, Toon heals in a hospital where Gladys George looks at him. Tracy goes to AWOL to visit his ball and he and George will get something. Later, when Tracy is reported to be missing, Tone and George are getting married. Tracy is broken when she returns and learns from marriage, but takes a step. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie deals with Toon, using the war skills he learned in gangster trade. He is now a hit man and George doesn't really know what he's doing for life. I think you can calculate the rest out. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that gave me trouble is that I can't believe Gladys George couldn't figure it out. She is a modern smart girl, her part is very similar to James Cagney, with Roaring Twenties. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the twenties, Humphrey Bogart's character is similar to the tone, although he was not the central character of the film. In fact, they have the items they gave him a weapon available from the taxi driver and Clint Eastwood's classic The Unforgiven. The battles of the First World War are very well staged by the director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason Leonard Maltin tried to catch this movie, I think it is much better than he did.
