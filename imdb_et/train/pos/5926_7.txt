Sleepwalkers are the creatures that get out of the human life to survive ... but they can only use the virgin (it is not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is the one who needs the food of his mother Mary (Alice Krige). She goes after a pleasant Tanya (Madchen Amick). Does he flee? <br /> <br /> On one hand, it's a big movie. Fast pace, plenty of blood and gore, and a nice, twisted sense of humor. There are many joke references to nightmares (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also great (who would have thought he could act after "Back to the Blue Lagoon") like Kirge and Amick. But I think this movie is annoying. <br /> <br /> It was written on the screen by Stephen King and it is madly vague. The dreamers have never been fully explained. Where are they from? Why are they called? Why does the son have to feed the mother? Why do cats hate them and kill them? What are their powers (at one point, Krause makes the car disappear and changes color and style!)? Why do they need human vitality? Why is it just a virgin? Why did the son have sex with his mother? None of them explains, leaving the story confusing. It's really too bad because these questions are out of the question, it's a great horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects. <br /> <br /> Fast, gory and fun. If only the script was better. In order to obtain an R-rating, a rather explicit sex story between Krause and Krige was also edited. I can only give it 7.
