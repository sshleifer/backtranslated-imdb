Fido is a lovely comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream mess that should keep us entertained today. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, this is hardly a real zombie film, but rather a sweet satire that uses Undead's fingers. Although there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way the movie is presented (with a 50-year style), I can't imagine anyone being really frightened or turned off by Fido and his associates. > <br /> Although most are good, I felt Moss and Nelson look out. Humor is not your face, but rather modest; there is a lot of attention to detail and I tried to smile gently in a good sense during the film. This is definitely not a cinema masterpiece, but it's not trying to be - instead, Curr will be able to offer a heart-warming black comedy.
