Having seen "Married Mafia," I lost almost my faith in the Korean film business. But it brought my faith back. <br /> <br /> Leading female character who is a university student forced to teach a corrupt, rich but charismatic high school student. She is actually the age of a female character. Through some fun quarries, these two end up being big friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that the newcomer kwan sang woo did his job perfectly. He was such a revelation! The actress Kim ha was also charming. <br /> <br /> This movie tried to avoid all the clich√©s that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And it didn't show us any unnecessary nude and sex words. It was brilliant, cute, fresh, made me see it again. <br /> <br />
