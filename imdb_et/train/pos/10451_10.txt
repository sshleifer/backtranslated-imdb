"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and it must be among my top 5 favorite films. Dialogue and action are great. I love the signs and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the film does not introduce a romantic Vienna (can't find a poet sitting by the river at night) and it is not possible to get to all places only one night, too (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But that's not the case. The relationship between the two characters is much more important and this story is not at all unrealistic. Although nothing will ever happen, the film will never get bored. The end is really sad without being a "Titanic" or anything. Even if you don't like love stories, you should watch this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the sequel that will appear in the summer. The first part is perfect because it's in my opinion.
