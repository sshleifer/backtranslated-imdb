Given the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea provides a multidimensional image of the community assigned to cabinets and resellers. But the funny thing is that it is not a focus or a short topic at all. But this is the most serious confirmation of these issues. A genre is a unique and not a typical expectation. This is almost an exit that first stands out, so looking twice is critical. The film has an aesthetic quality that gives itself a cinema to actual art. <br /> <br /> And this is the true art of Africa with a very rare voice. The film does not copy to achieve its message, it renews and provokes a fine stereotype (not a racial but a characteristic stereotype). From the writers' point of view, the film is brilliant. It contains multiple messages containing very fast character development. It should be remembered that this movie is less than 10 minutes long and it will be able to create a character very quickly. The use of color texture and music is also commendable. But given the director, Owen Alik Shahadah, the latest venture 500 years later, music is expected. From the point of view of the theme, it seems that the idea is leaving, but satire is indirectly living on a social problem?
