Who would have thought that such a hidden little movie could be so haunting and touching? I'm really impressed. Unfortunately, more people have not seen it. I always loved Hans Zimmer's score, as always. And what Bernard Rose directed his debut! But I don't know if I should call it a horror movie. It could easily be said that it is also a fantasy or drama. Well, regardless of that, I love this interpretative potential. All and all Anna's (played by Charlotte Burke) dreams are a real conflict in her life ... house itself, tree, Mark, lighthouse, etc. Many details, such as those that make the movie so good for repetitive viewing. I hope I will meet another little film full of emotion and psychological meaning, like this some time soon.
