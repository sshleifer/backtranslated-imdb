I say that no matter how hard I look, I never find a better movie version of Othello. If you love Kenneth Branagh's great masterpieces "A lot of respect" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as much as I am dead, you will also find Oliver Parker's "Othello" irresistible. During his career, Laurence Fishburne has had many great roles. He was a rather terrible "Boys n the hood" (1991) - I've always considered the fun role of his fun style to be his greatest achievement. It was, of course, before I saw it. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello and is probably the most difficult part of his entire career, but he does an excellent and fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just a phenomenal story in the most challenging role, manipulating the villain Iago. The wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite of Shakespeare's brilliant work. He deals with his favorite topics: curvature, jealousy, fraud and jealousy. This movie adaptation is definitely one of the best films I've seen on William Shakespeare's plays.
