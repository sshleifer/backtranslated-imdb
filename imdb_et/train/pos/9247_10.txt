I was expecting this film to be a romance of the 1930s novel. The boy will meet the girl, they will fall in love, the boy will lose the girl, the boy will eventually win. It wasn't at all like that. Clark Gable plays the artist Eddie with all his usual punishment and naughty eyebrows. She hides from the police when she breaks into Ruby's (Jean Harlow) apartment to find that the tub is covered with bubbles. Instant chemistry.It plays hard to get some time, but the girl can only stand that grin for so long. The heat between them is obvious and some scenes are definitely pre-production codes! When blackmailing goes bad and Ruby comes to "restless girls" boarding houses, she is unhappy and, thanks to her roommate persecution, she believes Eddie will never come to her. Harlow is playing a hard-fitting, fast-talking ruby. He won't let Gable get all the good features! There's a particularly moving scene where she plays "her song" on the piano that worked great. In the last fifteen minutes I cry every time. A truly sweet romance.
