Spirit is a unique and original appearance in the West for life from the point of view of the natural horse and the natives. The film focuses on friendships and the dangers that the wild horse Spirit faces in his life is very good. and Realism. The music is fantastic, Bryan Adams' songs and Hans Zimmer's music, who was also responsible for the 1994 Disney hit The Lion King's very popular music. The story is not very deep, but the fact that it is not as deep as some movies do not, in my opinion, damage the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that I really enjoyed and fit for the whole family. None missed. (10/10)
