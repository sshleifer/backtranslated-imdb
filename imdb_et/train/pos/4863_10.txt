Back when the musicals didn't show off to choreographers, we had such great movies. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was glad to finally see this movie. Not quite a mixture of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the humor of the American vaudeville, not the comforting jokes, do not contradict Wodehouse's British sense of humor. But in general, the American-style catcher makes American characters more real than cartoon caricature. <br /> <br /> Some ingenious productions for dance numbers, including a wonderful exhibition center with rotating floors and entertainment mirrors. The lack of Busby Berkley over the top dance number. They seem more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic. <br /> <br /> The absence of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not harm the film, but allows the emergence of a dynamic of different character. It is also nice that there is no reasonable cracking, strong interest in love. Instead, we have a gentle love interest that is much more in line with Wodehouses' young aristocratic women.
