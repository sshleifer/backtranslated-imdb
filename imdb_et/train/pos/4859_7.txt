I read that Jessie approached Matthews and turned to Damsel in Distress with Fred Astaire. Jessie Matthews never left his pond often to make any American music film. Had they agreed on this film, it would have been a one-time event. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Damsel in Distress has everything else going for it. Fred Astaire, Story and Author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for comedy and Gershwin Brothers songs. In response to the question posed in Nice's work, if you can, you can't ask much more about this movie. <br /> <br /> Except for the leading lady. Although Ginger Rogers made several films from Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only film Astaire who made Rogers during the team. Young Joan Fontaine was cast against Astaire. <br /> <br /> His character has no bites made by Ginger Rogers in these films. All he has to do in principle is to act sweet and void. He doesn't give anything musically. And when I had to evaluate all Fred Astaire's dance partners, Joan Fontaine came out. Poor women are the things they are looking for, just terrible. <br /> <br /> When he later celebrated music with Bing Crosby, Emperor Waltz, it is no coincidence that Fontaine is not given anything musical. <br /> <br /> is painted, and in that case I think it was really good. The idyllic lush green English landscape of P.G. The Wodehouse is really out in this VHS copy. Especially the number I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine in the garden. </p> </p>. The surreal queue of the amusement house is superbly staged. <br /> <br /> P.G. Wodehouse's aristocracy runs with Constance Collier for his haughty best and turns Montagu Love as Fontaine's father as a nice man on film. the best-known song about the British capital after the fall of London Bridge. It's done in Fred Astaire's best simple elegant way, it's one of those songs that lasts as long as London lasts and even after. <br /> <br /> A view of young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine with classic, classic, classic dance, classic comedy. Who could ask anything more?
