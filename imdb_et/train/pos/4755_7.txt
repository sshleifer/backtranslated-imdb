The snow during the storm is stuck in the bus full of passengers. The police have closed the bridge - saying it is dangerous and they have stayed in a small cafe until the road is cleared. But after a while, their boredom has turned to concern because it seems that one of the passengers is not originally on the bus and can be just an alien! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but also quite funny in a low-eyed way. <br /> <br /> This is another fun episode of the HÃ¤mar Zone. Instead of typical twists or social comments, it has no permanent message. But it is also very traceable, so who cares? Just what happens, you just have to see yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this one star John Hoyt - a face most of which recognizes countless old TV shows and movies. In almost every case he played real (like Charles Lane in the same era) but the boy I loved to see him - when he was perfect noise and at the same time funny.
