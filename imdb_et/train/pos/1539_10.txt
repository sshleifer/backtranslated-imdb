I saw it at Mill Valley Film Festival. It is hard to believe that this is the debut of the director, Mrs Blom, it is beautifully paced and accomplished. Large characters can be left out of Anne Tyler's novel, i.e. they are stratified by the backbone and the future of potential, lack of false remarks, a surprising sense of humor between self-induced anxiety and very real, if not burning, dilemmas. When you saw the "Best of the Young", you will understand how well the characters are going through small moments, even if the story moves quickly. I hope it will be shared in the US. I live in a fairly complex movie market, but we rarely get Swedish movies.
