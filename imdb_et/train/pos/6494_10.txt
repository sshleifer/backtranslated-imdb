This is undoubtedly the best documentary ever produced, giving an accurate and epic image of the Second World War in 1939 from the Polish invasion to the end of the war in 1945. <br /> <br /> The documentary presents the views of both sides of the conflict, giving the war a very human face. At the same time, tactics and the importance of battles are not overlooked, much work has been done on a detailed overview of the war, and especially on the high, low, and turning points of Allied Forces. British-produced documentary is the 26-part series focusing mainly on Britain, but the contribution of Russia and America is not overpowered, but one of a series of such lengths. <br /> <br /> Another worth mentioning is the score, the music and the feeling of the whole movie are confusion, struggle and perseverance. Like the film, this series of viewers undoubtedly leaves the difficulties faced by Allies and Germans during the war, its structure at the end of every episode of excellence, designed to coarsely form the Second World War. After all 26, the viewer is left with a broad knowledge of war and surprised by how much we owe to the members of the previous generation.
