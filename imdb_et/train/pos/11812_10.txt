These films are the best film for knowing the comic book. Sets, costumes and color are just as bright as it is like entering a comic book. This is the movie I mean when Mobi is mentioned, suits, hats and attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives comics like Mumbles and you can't help but Madonna is sorry if she tries and succeeds to win over Tracy. This movie contains all the classic clich√©s of the mobile phone - burying people in concrete, blowing people's cars, bundling a good boy and trying to break his girlfriend's house. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic word ever, even the camera angels cry in the comic book. It is so big that it would be possible to go back to the older film and see that someone knew how the comic should be seen as a movie after seeing mistakes like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! YOU HAVE THIS MOVIE !!!!
