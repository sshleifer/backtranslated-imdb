Alright it was a rather sensitive little number, but I can't think I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA movie I saw in Poitier called "RUBY RAE OTHER DAYS". It was also "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay. This does not mean that they are not delicious references ... just because they feel very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel it is closer to the advertisement (style and story) than the original and authentic auteur of the work. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is just ... pleasing to me. Too coral filter (or charcoal) for me ... too curved 12mm. That's why the whole impression left a bit distant - beware of art that too easily proclaims itself! French (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to have bought it like a jury ... but the selection of Cannes short films is far more conservative compared to its range of features, although I don't know what has happened in recent years.
