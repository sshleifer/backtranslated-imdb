I had no idea what Jane Eyre had seen before this mini-series. I had previously read and watched classic stories and believed that most of the classics were boring, superfluous, and highly appreciated stories, which at best had moderately interesting plots. This Jane Eyre minisers completely changed my concepts. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actor and she gives an excellent picture of Jane Eyre. His accent is delightful and silent, but his character is exactly the same as the young gymnasium. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and energy in the film make me believe that he was born to play the Thornfield Hall's incinerating captain. I couldn't sleep all night when I looked at this minisite. The plot is both haunting and inspiring. The stars are masterfully done and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre to appear on the film. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was amazed at how exactly the ministries followed to write Charolette Bronte. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see masterpieces that change your life, check out Jane Eyre's 1983 BBC version.
