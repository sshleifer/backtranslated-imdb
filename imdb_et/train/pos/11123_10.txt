Greetings from this Portuguese man :) <br /> <br /> I believe that the Sopranos are one of the best productions, with reality and fiction that differences are hard to see. It's the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits on paper as a glove! I would love not to end the Sopranos at all. It's perfect! It should be a school topic :) I saw Soprano when I was a child, but I was too young to stay awake until the episode ends, so now I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I watch all the episodes at home before and after dinner and I'm addicted as I did with Prison Break. I think Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best TV series. Both arguments are excellent and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on such work. <br /> <br /> Sorry for your English. Thank you for reading.
