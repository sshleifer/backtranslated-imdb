The first season was amazing, the whole idea that they adapted to the islands, while the secrets were studied (and we saw) were just phenomenal; full of upright, tons of rocks and an amazing plot. I mean, I love the whole idea, just to see how they get used to the island. And then first I saw the smoke monster really in my first episode. Ever since I was hooked. The second season was at its best with the first season, but slightly better. I completely loved the idea of ​​hatches and the DHARMA initiative. The whole plot and sequences were mysterious, horrible and exciting. I loved all the tensions around the archipelago, but the story of DHARMA was amazing in the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> The 3rd season wasn't as good as 1 and 2 ... but still great. I loved seeing the stories of others, seeing their camp, and seeing what secrets were further explored. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, though not so good, it was still breathtaking and fun, but the most exciting! Now, season 4. I had hope for this season and the first couple of episodes we're good at but then really started to be boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first couple of episodes ... and NOT ALL .... The 4th season removed something that made LOST perfect for the series: mystery, intercourse, comedy (Charlie gone) and overall excitement. Also some of my favorite characters are left.
