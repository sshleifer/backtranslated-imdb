I'm a tremendous classic cinema, but I'm just entering quiet movies. Many silent movies don't keep my attention, but Show People is a significant exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are just wonderful in this picture. In particular, Davies shows a wide range of choices because he morphises small girls from small towns that take too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show people is a fast paced movie with a fantastic array of incoming quiet era by the biggest stars. The film took my attention immediately and I forgot that it was a silent movie. (I know it doesn't make much sense, but it happened.) Participants are so experienced with their crafts that little dialogue cards are needed. <br /> <br /> Show People is the perfect introduction to silent movies. It's a fast paced, interesting movie with two silent stars. Adding Hollywood satire and Show People should be on the list of all classic film parades.
