Superbly developed characters into many funny situations full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting, unpredictable. The best point of the movie is the characters, then the humor itself, the story and the dialogues. Humor has "internal development" that is rare in Serbian films. So, this is the result of the testimonial, well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. It is also sharp, intelligent and passionate. Most movies, unfortunately, had built humor (shaped a joke and put it in the mouth of the characters) or a comedy of the usual situation, burlesque, farce. Some of the "immortality of art" is included in this movie. A little masterpiece, hardly achievable.
