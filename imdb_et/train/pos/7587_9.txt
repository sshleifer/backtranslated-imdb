I have to say that I was impressed that cinematography was an amazing, perfect frame, and a way he built a tension around a topic that sounds more than a terrible cage. two narrators, one seen, one invisible. They both try to explain the series of paintings that caused the scandal a long time ago. The film has everything about theory and explanations of opinions, but the conclusion is quite shocking. This is definitely a film that deserves more than 171 votes. Fantastic direction! I have to say much better than the poet's blood, which he reminds me of some strange reason. <br /> <br /> I think you can call it slang with "artsy". It's quite a lot of professional talking about different theories and stunning visual effects, but the team and Ruiz pulled it out. At least for me. Amazing movie.
