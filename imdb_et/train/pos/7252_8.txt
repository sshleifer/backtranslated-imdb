I saw this movie before the British Army joined. I went through my basic training, at first difficult and when I moved much easier. My time was spent during the NI worries and the Cold War. There were times when I asked myself what I didn't get myself because it was always training and you always react instinctively. The voice that the soldiers think is on the ground, although I would have added breathing and heart rate because it seems to get into the drums of your ear in certain situations. A few years later, I was in Canada where the family got together. My Aunty, who lives in the US and is a lecturer at Columbus Uni Ohio, had made paper on the influence of the British Army on the NI. He spent time there studying. Although he was ex pat, he was very anti-British. He made me a line and condemned me as a British soldier. My only answer was to see the movie "Death of the Long Day". It is closest when a civilian understands why a soldier does what he does. The answer is at the end.
