Gene Kelly raised some really big ideas during the MGM. Here he is at the cutting edge of his creative forces, working with Arthur Freed's music. It is hard to believe when you look at An American in Paris that players did not leave MGM. The magic of American In Paris is the result of creative editing under the guidance of Vincent Minnell and MGM-compiled bundles mixed with some background images. The idea of ​​the film started with Kelly, who just wanted to make a movie with a long ballet, with the participation of George Gershwin's son of the American. It sounded good to Arthur Freed, who turned to Ira Gershwin, who was well versed with him when they used another Gershwin material. <br /> <br /> Gershwin got to Gershwin's music, which Irving Berlin usually got. American Americans in Paris did not hear non-Gershwin music. Listen to some background music and hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me, which are not real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another man who was fair when writing lyrics, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote a story that is thin. The whole Gene Kelly played a former GI who, after World War II, did not leave France but moved to the left bank of the apartment and became hungry for the artist. He lives with an eccentric composer Oscar Levant and sounds like redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another alien American, played by Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor her as a painter when she interacts with other things. But Kelly falls for a boyfriend that Leslie Caron played in her movie. Caron also has a musical comedy star Georges Guetary here. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse for singing and dancing George Gershwin's music. In Paris, America's first film, which I saw on the first airplane ticket, takes place. I still remember flying to Phoenix from Arizona to Kennedy airport, seeing Gene Kelly rhythm. But my favorite number in the movie is Tra-La-La, which sings and dances in the apartment while playing Oscar Levant. At one point, Kelly is dancing on a big piano. <br /> <br /> I read in a quote from Arthur Freed, where he said that it was necessary to make French impressionists in the American Paris ballet, who he thought would be a realistic place on the streets as well as on the back. That's how it happened. Kelly had made long ballet sequences in words and music, pirates and the city. But it brought them all. Still in my opinion and it includes some of Gene Kelly's later films. <br /> <br /> With a surprised Oscar, America was chosen as the best picture in Paris in 1951, beating out the highly favored A-Bridge, called the Wish. I think fantasy won this year's realism. Big budgets are also the upper hand in these things. <br /> <br /> Still in America, Paris is one of the best movie music ever made, and since the studio no longer has this creative talent under one roof, nothing less likely to be repeated.
