Anyone who is new to the incredibly fruitful work of Takashi Miike could think of making this amazing film double the first experience of this truly pleasing director. In accordance with Miike's work practice, which takes all the work that is on her path and then puts her feelings into the script, it is a fairly common yakuza thriller, where a morally vague policeman travels to the gang that his lawyer brother has run into. What takes the film out of the same old worlds of the same old age is a totally unequal attitude, so some of the harshest and most terrible acts of violence seen in today's cinema. And this is not so nice and lovely, pure violence that is loved by the US cinema - this thing is nasty, painful and hurts! This means that the pace is broken, the characters are unusual, simply loaded with the eccentricity of the stock, Miike's sense of humor reveals himself and the most unexpected moments, and his camera is never quite where you think it is, making it difficult to look away from the screen, whatever he shows you! It has no "Dead Or Alive" at the end of "Ohmigod", but if you're not nervous, it's time to reach Miike's bandwagon before it reaches a "new John Woo" shopping list for a Hollywood studio ...
