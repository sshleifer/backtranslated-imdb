"The Secret of Lens" is probably my favorite of all time. Best and most fun Kajawari Yoshiaki, known for anime and buggy hentai-ecchi anime. I wish he did more camps. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the psychedelic CG sequence, parts where Lord Helum blows his failed commanders, party unrest Bill brings (one of the funniest scenes) and when my favorite character Worsle appears. <br /> <br /> Check it out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not intended for serious complex Anime fans!
