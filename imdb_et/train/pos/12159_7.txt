- After understanding their sons into a lifetime jail, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) are getting threatening phone calls because someone falls into their sons. The couple decides to move to California to escape the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school that will be very successful soon. One of the students is a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. Meanwhile, Helen has been engaged in rabbit breeding and has become a little exaggerated with the evangelist on the radio. It is only time before everything breaks down and women enter the world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can't help but compare What's with Helen? who longed for Aunt Root? as well as starring Shelly Winters. When this film seemed almost modest when it came to showing Roo's aunt's madness, nothing in this movie was Helen. It can take a lot of movie time, but when he clicks, Helen is one of Bad Mad Mutha. You don't want to interfere with her. The winters are so gladly demented that it was impossible for me to enjoy my activities. I'm not going to spoil the film, but the things Helen is capable of are up. <br /> <br /> - As good as Winters is, Reynolds is completely ridiculous in his golden role - a digitizing dancer. I had the impression that he thought he was in the film he was applying for. It's not a citizen of Kane! Stop it so seriously. Hey, Debbie, don't you realize that the main goal is to be the victim of winter madness. <br /> <br /> - I just love those former female star-twilight movies of my career. What's the question with Helen? is as much fun as everyone.
