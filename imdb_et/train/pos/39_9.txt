This is probably one of Shempt's first short shorts with Stooges. (This excludes him from many years with the team). But thirty comic timing is the best here. In addition to the intense impact, there are other finer but equally funny ones. Look at Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the picture for the camera. Or see what the real thing brings to the exclamation of Moe, "Oh ... very polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is confused by her. And the look may seem scary, but it is somehow funny. It seems that Stooges is frustrated and puzzled as they are "ordinary" people in other shorts. <br /> <br /> Shempi aficionados have this episode. It doesn't disappoint.
