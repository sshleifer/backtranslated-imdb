In the north of Hollywood, there is a satirical look at Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered a huge tax credit to films made in Canada. Most of the time it was treated as a shelter or a cheap way to get American movies. For example, Porky came out of it. Anyway, Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to adapt his beloved Canadian novel. But to get the money, he needs an American name card. He gets rid of the cannon and learns he has to compromise until the film is no longer similar to the book. It plays well in Canada, but it can't be understood outside of the White North. The Americans think we are satirizing ourselves, but we remember the point we are actually satirizing. Canadians 8/10 to the rest of the world 5/10.
