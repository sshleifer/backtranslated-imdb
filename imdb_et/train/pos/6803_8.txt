In one of her first films, Romy Schneider looks like Queen of the United Kingdom Victoria, as she is suddenly put on the throne at the age of 18, learns to rule despite the machinations of politicians, and finally romanticizes and marries Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (although surprisingly unbelievable for real events) is a romantic piece irresistible. Seeing this movie from German-speaking British kings adds to its strange charm. On this front, I wonder why an English film was made about the Austrian film; but then remember that in 1954 Austria was still an allied force, including the British occupied. Perhaps this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
