I like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I had never seen her to portray the upper class British to this movie. He pulls it out pretty well, though you see a mix of inspector Clouseau bits. It won't be interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect such a strong performance from the youthful Hawn. His timing was great and his expressions were invaluable. The way she sells alternately is a pleasant look to her. Verbal sparring as I have rarely seen in the film of this era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the movie will be flat. It's worth it down to see the first sixty. Hawn is a naked pair of famous seconds early. Enjoy it...
