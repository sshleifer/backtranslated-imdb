One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes. The next day we were at Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my dad and me, and guess who was in the aisle with us! Barney Phillips, but not a hat - at least, I don't think he has a hat. and everyone with whom he met that day asked him about it. <br /> <br /> Friendly man. We saw all sorts of character actors in LA these days. <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood Local and Residence 1947-1963.
