Batman: Batwoman's mystery is the latest animated Batman video / DVD movie released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot is being turned around by a new criminal winner, Batwoman, who for some reason seems to be personally involved in halting the main arms transfers. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is interesting enough, it is not as good as "Fantasm Mask", "Sub-Zero" or "Joker Return". The main reason is that it does not give the emotional appeal that other films made. At the end of this movie, we really don't feel sorry for anyone, as we do in others, especially "Sub-Zero". There is no real tragedy that made other animations special to us. Even Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (like Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly "rigid" and boring that the viewer does not care about what happened to her, put her in the mask or what happens to her at the end and there is the main reason. we don't get that special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I found the movie enjoyable. It has its moments, for example, when the audience knows who Batwoman really is, and see the return of the old villain who was last seen in the original "Batman: Animated Series". The action is also very enjoyable in some very alternating moments. <br /> <br /> If Batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than "Joker Return" in my book, but as it is now, it's the fourth (out of four). <br /> <br /> Animation is the same from the mid-1990s to the end. The result is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman movies, but still it is good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because it is enjoyable despite errors. But remember, it's not as good as other Batman animated movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
