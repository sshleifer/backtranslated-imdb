The last Dutch-language film Verhooven made me laugh. A movie that searches for all the small details and cross-references, etc., can be affirmed in any movie to anyone interested in cinematography, that this piece will entertain all the senses. I have not read the book by Gerard Reves, on which the film is based, but I believe that we will get honest pictures of a somewhat self-evident poet / writer who gets his (so - in some way) offense. An anti-hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions as it is. All this highly packed cinematography will succeed Paul Verhopven otherwise quite cute "gesellich (?)" Dutch locations transform the suspenseful film-noir device into impressive work!
