Ores is a great journey from beginning to end, thanks in large part to the magic created by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic with his best role in decades. Like any really good movie, this is the journey where the theme is redemption and the results of dreams. I can't believe it's hard to find this movie - I'd buy it on a heartbeat DVD, but I haven't found a socket yet.
