it was a real joy of joy ... I saw a trailer and all the ads, so I thought why not watch this vh1 movie? and as they said earlier in v.v., "I can't believe I looked at it all!" quinn and harris were believing beaten boys, and although the accents were sort of universal and were occasionally difficult to decipher, I found the dialogue credible. the film touched on the weak relationship between len / mc and showed how they were deeply two men who grew up close and shared a passion for music - but with different problems and personal needs. you find yourself wanting to have jumped in the booth to get into an impressive meeting that would have knocked off the world socks, but you will also be more appreciated for not doing it
