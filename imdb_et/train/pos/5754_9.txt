I remember seeing it when I was seven or eight. I have to find a circle of characters because I thought they had an impression that lasted a long time after the end of the movie. And the end, now it's sad, well ... for a 7-8-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie lately and found that the plot was too simple, character, two-dimensional ... I think it's a movie that can only be found with the innocence of a small child ... Damage ... <br /> <br /> I recommend small children to all your parents ... (I saw it in my original French version so I can't tell you if the translation is good or not.)
