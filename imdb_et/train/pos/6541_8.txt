In the mid-40s as an adult, I am not even close to one of Nancy Drew's basic demographics, but I was pleasantly surprised by the afternoon; so I can say whether a pair of sixty silver haired women pass by me. The older man who left the theater just in front of me praised this film for a 20-year-old female teacher (who said she saw the movie last night and really liked it). <br /> <br /> Another point, but: There were nine in the line before me - nine decades of girls lined up next to each other, popcorn and hot dogs and candy forward and back and strangled through previews. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, they immediately started watching .... <br /> <br /> .... and didn't do so much that they'd shut down to roll. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie; it does not pay a fairly high fee for its high school subfields, it is not quite sure about its tone, and its criminals are just hair that is far too critical intuitively. However, the adjustment of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot hangs quite well and it moves weakly between exaggerated cheeses and over-modernization sins. Last but not least, Emma Roberts is wearing a movie with astonishing love - despite Josh Flitter's excellent timing, it's a Robert's movie and he's pulling it out nicely. His Nancy Drew is the direct ancestor of Kristen Belli Veronica Mars and is also the successor of Jodie Foster's early and underrated "Candleshoe". <br /> <br /> In today's market, this rarity is a family movie that respects the intelligence of its viewer. As such, it is not for everyone's taste - but for decades it is the best film of its kind.
