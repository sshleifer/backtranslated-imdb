Some bad reviews here and I understand why, but treat it as a low-budget series killer movie and you can get more of it than most. <br /> <br /> I thought it worked so late that I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower, so it's somehow successful, isn't it? <br /> <br /> I would say that it is just the right level of slipping here to get under the skin, although action may be a bit too uneven. David Hess is only in this brielfy, so don't get your hopes much if you like the last house. <br /> <br /> Other than what you should look at.
