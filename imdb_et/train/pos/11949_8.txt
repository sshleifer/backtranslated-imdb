Woody Allen's second film in London. The Tarot Card Killer kills prostitutes in London. Journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) wants to be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She will romanticize her, but she will fall in love quickly. He has helped the production artist Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who doesn't like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like it better than last year's overrated "Match Point". It was shorter and moved much faster. The plot is old but I was entertaining and it kept me out until the end. It's not really a comedy, but a mystery with some very good comedy lines (all from Allen). It's not one of Allen's best, but it's much better than his worst. <br /> <br /> The actor is usually very good. Allen is bad, but he played this character a million times earlier and it's tired. But Johansson and Jackman are just big - they look fantastic and give two very tempting incredible performances. Also, Allen (surprisingly) works with her sex appeal - there is a sequence where they both have their own bathing suits to show their nice body. The only real debit is that Allen seems still insecure about shooting in London. He's not like he was in "Match Point," although he gets better than he goes. <br /> <br /> It is worth it. I'll give her 8.
