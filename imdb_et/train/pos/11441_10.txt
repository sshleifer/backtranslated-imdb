As a person looking for existence as a "professional" person with income supported by BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Administration, my peace of mind was always resisted by more artistic outside classes. My post-graduate courses were always supported emotionally and mentally by photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging and welding, and drawing art that also included silk screening. with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to distant destinations in California and nearby countries like Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Riding, walking and hiking can be found near one country to stop and watch and listen, as well as make and call. <br /> <br /> Against this background, I was obsessed with RIVERS and TIDES. I was also impressed with the documentary content of Andy Goldsworthy and the skills and smoothness of the director / operator Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually couldn't separate Goldsworthy's art from the Riedelsheimer camera track. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
