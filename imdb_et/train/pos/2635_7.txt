My Take: Funny take THE LION KING, which is a sequel. Surprisingly fun. Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another funny direct video that is worthy of a theater treatment. I don't see why Disney put this video straight out and theatrically releases crappy movies like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland". These movies are better seen in video shops ("new releases") rather than seeing their theater posters outside the theater. <br /> <br /> It's just the first movie's weak. "Simba's Pride" has not yet happened), Timon (expressed by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (expressed by Ernie Sabella). We see that they make fun of the first movie events. The original voices of the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give some fun comedies like Timon's mother and annoyed uncle. /> <br /> So it's not fun. Maybe not now, but look at it yourself. The fact that it's not so serious in the plot makes it more enjoyable. It's like MST3000 with Timon and Pumba. <br /> <br /> Video movie rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
