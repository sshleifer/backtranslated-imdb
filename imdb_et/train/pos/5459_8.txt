BABY FACE is a fast paced, clever cracking, movie knowledge that <br /> <br /> takes only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a smart 75 minute they are! To say that a story that covers so much ground can be said that in a short time most of today's filmmakers will be ashamed. Nowadays, <br /> <br /> screenwriters should look into the economy of BABY FACE and cut the swelling to <br /> <br /> go beyond their films. <br /> <br /> The story is not nonsense. An immoral woman first rises under wealth and then to the bodies of men who love her lovingly. <br /> <br /> Make sure that the production code pulled it down, the happy ending, <br /> <br /> but it is not hard to see what direction the writers wanted to go, so enjoy what's there, and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is terrible, like George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille, as an unlucky defendant. Not a big movie, but definitely enjoyable. If you have never seen a BABY FACE harvest, the next time it is shown on the cable, <br /> <br /> or rent a cartridge. It's worth the effort.
