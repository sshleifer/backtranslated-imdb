It's not as big a movie as many people believe (including my late aunt who said it's her favorite movie). But thanks to the better passages of this film, especially the fact that the "fun house" finale was just right, LANGY from SHANGHAI has gained a more prominent position as the key to true value than Orson Welles' key to Hollywood conquest failure. <br /> <br /> By 1946, the Welles Hollywood image was mixed. CITIZEN KANE was not considered an excellent film that has been held since then by Hearst press and Hollywood insiders themselves. Welles' attempt to fully manage their films (directing and producing and acting) seemed to threaten the entire system. His best work during this period was like Edward Rochester JANE EYREs, which was allegedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but was actually shot by Welles (with Stevenson's blessing). But the credit went to Stevenson. Only THE STRANGER, a film that benefited from the postwar warfare of Nazi war criminals, earned a profit. For five years in Hollywood, it was hardly a record. <br /> <br /> Welles went back to Broadway in 1946, hoping to rebuild his critical capabilities with his production around the world for 80 days. But despite the help of Mike Todd and Cole Porter, there was a musical error. His failure occurred while his wife, Rita Hayworth, grew up with the GILDA portrayal. So the marriage also went to stones. <br /> <br /> Welles had to make money - his Broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in potential film rights around the world to Todd (which he finally rue), and he also sold the idea of ​​a film about Henri Desire Landru's career to Charlie Chaplin, who was supposed to target it (and who turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX). <br /> <br /> The story goes with Welles' $ 10,000.00 tax to worry about, called Cohn, and offered a movie with Rita to make a deposit. Cohn was ready to do this, but of course he asked what the film was. That was a wise question. Welles was in a pay phone in a pharmacy in New York with a book department. He grabbed the book "LADY from SHANGHAI" and attacked it as a great thriller. In any case, Welles said that it is common for Cohn that Welles knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he was investigating rights and sending a $ 10,000 down payment to Welles. After Cohn's hanging, Welles bought the book and read it - and found it really bad. He spent some time rewriting the treatment and scenario that characterizes Rita Elsa Bannister. <br /> <br /> He is certainly curious about land development. Michael O'Hara is a sailor / longshoreman. He will save Elsa Bannister if he is likely to be attacked by gangsters in the San Francisco Park. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), who is a criminal because of a very good reputation. He persuades him to hire Michael as his captain. The cruise also includes Bannister's unhappy partner, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), and one Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia) who turns out to be a detective employed by Bannister to watch Elsa. If they can try to look for Michael and Elsa together, Broome or Grisby still looks up. <br /> <br /> Grisby makes a bid for Michael - he wants (for reasons related to his so-called fatalistic view of today's society) to give up, pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the plot becomes a target) he can still collect his life insurance (though dead?) And use it to the southern sea. He pays Michael $ 10,000.00 when he pretends to shoot Grisby. It also involves signing a murder document (Michael does not understand that such permission swept away the need to produce the body if all other evidence indicates that Grisby is likely to be dead). <br /> <br /> Of course Grisby is killed and Michael arrested for this and Broome's murder (with Michael's weapon). Michael is trying to protect him with Bannister and finds out that he is doing second-level work because he wants Michael to be convicted. Michael is convinced that Bannister is a real murderer and manages to escape just before the jury's decision. He falls off and is stored in an abandoned carnival that brings the famous "fun house" and the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly confusing film (as I commented on). This does not mean that it is not worth seeing - visually it is striking. In the quarter of the trial judge, acknowledge the battle between Michael and the police, where he captures the bailiff's judge's bookcase, the broken glass. Or, if the wise use of photography to capture Hayworth's diving stone, the tiny Grisby binocular is reflected. <br /> <br /> The actor is pretty good, especially Sloane (maybe this is the best actor's role in the film). Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway performer. He rarely made films before LANGY SHANGHAI and his sloppy Grisby is unforgettable. Ted De Corsia also makes Broome a very beautiful detective looking for his own interests at his own expense. <br /> <br /> For Hayworth, he will be different from most of what he had done before (BLOOD AND SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN and STRAWBERRY BLOND is an exception) and this is a memorable siren. Welles' O'Hara is a very unusual character for an actor - a pleasant but naive person who learns to hardly believe what he secretly wants to believe. This is not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, EXCLUSION, or COLD at high, but it's a good movie for that.
