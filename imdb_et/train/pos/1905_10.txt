Just the funniest and brightest movie comedy ever ... it's definitely on my personal top-level list. It also has ten voting rights. Millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged "child" who refuses to live in a mature way and avoids all the necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal butler Hobson (Gielgud) go to Bergdorf Goodman and got into a small larkenist Linda (Minnell). Arthur and Linda chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are fun sets. In one of these scenes, Arthur (drunk the whole story) hits the wrong apartment door and gets ear-breaking threats from the "siren" of man ("My husband is a gun !!!!") correctly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's loving but merciless grandmother, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire exhibition with its acidic inflorescences (He took this Oscar home) and Christopher Cross gives the main theme song (Oscar winner "The best you can do"). It's a shame that Dudley Moore died late last month (March 2002).
