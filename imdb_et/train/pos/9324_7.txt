I've read some comments and I'm a little sad that a lot of the story seems glossed. It's easy to do, because it's not a book, it's a movie, and there's just so much you can do in a movie - the US or Canada or somewhere. <br /> <br /> Colm Feore makes at least a return to "F @ g-Hag" like me, a great job not only for "friendly neighborhood" gay - playing sick. I mean, man really doesn't get much pale! Although, you may never know it down the ... um, end. <br /> <br /> If you need to empty, there are some SKing movies you like. <br /> <br /> Being a restoring Alchoholic daughter, the drug brother {David Cubitt} was a trick for me. I give him credit, he grew up quickly and believe me that it is good. And as an Aspiring writer, Moimme, I can complain a lot about my insights and insights. But I'm better than poetic. <br /> <br /> I can just be pleasant, but I enjoyed it. Nice story pretty well assembled, Canadians, surprise surprise. I just referred to the "Movie of the Week" line, which was missing when it was not pulled out, VERY ONLY evaluated. And it was pretty cleverly depicted.
