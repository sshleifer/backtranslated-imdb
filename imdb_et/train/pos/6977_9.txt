I'm very addicted to Caprica because it's really a good Battlestar Galactica prequel series. It really starts slowly, but it will definitely begin to pick up immediately after the new episodes. <br /> <br /> I've heard great things about future episodes and guest stars in the first season. br /> This Sci Fi drama is definitely a delight for fans who love a mix of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is doing an amazing job as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Willow !! <br /> Worth a look !! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica on Friday at 21:00 - 8:00 am in the middle of SYFY
