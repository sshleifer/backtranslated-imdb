Ya. That's what I think. Of course, this was still a great show in John, but I think it's better. <br /> <br /> I love CJ and Grandpa who live in the house because they're so funny together. <Br /> <br /> When John was still around, I didn't laugh as much as I do now. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to stop doing. (I don't think ...) because I would like to see new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. Poor Rory is almost always excluded. It's always Bridget or Carrie. WHAT RORI !!! ??? Frankly, this is a great show and anyone who has never watched it has to go and watch. I almost guarantee you laugh. well even smile.
