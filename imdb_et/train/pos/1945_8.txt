This last episode of Voyager will begin in the future for 23 years. Voyager has brought it back home. For many years, when he took it back, Vulcan Tuvoks has lost his mind. He suffered a disease that was too late to cure home. <br /> <br /> Captain Janeway is among aliens who have time travel technology. He understands that there is Warp Conduit in the Delta Quarter, which can bring home Voyager right away - if he could go back in time and report to Voyager. There is one problem. Conduit is deep inside Borg Space. <br /> <br /> Janeway visits Tuvok. She's like a child. He writes tho, obsessed with working with math problems or film reviews, or something he believes is somehow important. In the institution, Tuvok shouts, "Ask Janeway, please, come back to him. <br /> <br /> Janeway decides to drive federal transport and equip this weapon technology 20 years before Borg, hopes to go back in time and use this new technology to lead Voyager to Warp Conduit. <br /> <br /> When she goes back and joins Voyager, Janeway will meet her younger self. Two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok, asking him if he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits that this is true, but it cannot be treated with the ship's facilities, so he kept it. <br /> <br /> The young captain agrees with the older captains' plan. To increase their chances of success, Elder Janeway Borg plans to pull his bus. Borg actually hits Janeway and his bus. Borg Queen personally takes Janeway. But Janeway hopes it! The Queen of Borg has embraced the virus, which kills her. Borg's Queen Dead Voyager makes it through Warp Conduit back to the Federation's space.
