I wouldn't call "We are back! Dinosaur story" just "Jurassic Park" baby. I found it more interesting. Like the first one, it calls into question the timing of the security of beings to us. But it opens my eyes when I see who gave the votes: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronti, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. Paraphrasing that: a certain actor, "Cheers" wife, "Tonight Show" host, the most trusted name in the news, famous chef, "Young Frankenstein" police chief Lisa Simpson, one of three Amigosest and CNN boyfriend. <br /> <br /> But I think I should not just focus on pain. I thought this film had something for both children (fun) and adults (history of nature). True, it's escapism, but perception. In fact, I would say that John Goodman makes Rex's voice here as the predecessor of his "Monsters Inc." voice work. It's worth seeing.
