For those who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly appreciated novel, this film will definitely impress you because it is a respected adaptation. The debut of Sturla Gunnarson's feature films, with the exception of one small sub-block, is the almost deadly holiday of the book (up to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those who haven't read the novel, this movie can be a little tricky. This is certainly not a great story of cinematography. Instead, it has a strong element of reality, but I would not have it in any other way. The best way to describe such a long journey for film fans would be to say that it is a small-scale evaluator, Fiddler On The Roof. Instead of Jewish / Russian dairy milk, the main character Gustad Noble in the 1970s was a Bombay banker during a Muslim / Hindi war in Pakistan. She is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in her life, including her sick daughter, her individual eldest son, a distant friend who comes with her with some dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. The end is not happy, nor is it sad, but in reality it is realism. Such a long journey is a small little movie, but if you want to see it, then luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it is very small.
