At the end of the eighties, Warren Beatty created the literary epic Red Soviet Union, which was seen in the eyes of the iconic radical John Reed. It was a deep film of both entertaining and all-letter messages. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another epic with Dick Tracy, which does not pretend to be anything but entertainment with a whole range of the best actors who just have a very old time preventing it from under a ton of makeup. br /> <br /> Because both Red and Dick Tracy could come from the same person, he talks about what this person is like. In this movie, Beatt managed to get all the famous cartoon players and put them in one of the original scenarios. The film opens with rubbing Lips Manlis camping in Valentine's massacre style and then tie it to the cement coat. But Caprice's moves make him a Tracy target. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the third mysterious and odd person is waiting for Caprice himself. Does our hero solve this crime? <br /> <br /> This movie is truly contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvin, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong gets frightened to see comic cartoons by Chester Gould and then try to cut his biggest ham, you have to love that movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been nominated for the best supportive actor, but no one of these men could have it, just that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most screen time. Only Beatty plays it straight, others seem to play it. Dick Tracy won the Oscars for best art and design, Stephen Sondheim's best song and introduced Madonna, Earlier or later. The fact that he was even able to write Sondheim for such a film only shows that Sondheim wanted to have fun. As far as Madonna is concerned, the material girl is kept by all those actors, such as Breathless Mahoney, the singer of the club torch. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, Dick Tracy movies were sent to B-shots and worse than Saturday afternoons. The only thing rivals compete with this constellation is the radio made for the radio of the armed forces during World War II, which became vinyl. Do you believe like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and Andrews Sisters? Try and find a record of this gemstone. <br /> <br /> So far, Warren Beatty is making a classic comic for the big screen.
