Making such a film that is so sad, tempting, disgusting, and repulsive takes a very special type of person, but does it in a way that makes it a great quintessence for personal cinematographic release. Crispin Glover did something unique in all his "out" and "predispositions". In a world that has become extremely partisan, this film seems to have abandoned the traditional lines of creativity and art and amazes everyone. <br /> <br /> At the film, the film is far from the paradigm (if there is a model at all) and initially it shrows the temple behind the swastika and the naked women. man with cerebral palsy. This is a rather shocking stuff, but if you had the opportunity to have a Q&A session after screening, it will clearly open up a lot of worms that will let you wonder if it's an art or just the lowest common denominator. In both ways, you feel the tremor that this film ultimately causes. It is never accepted, not even by the supposed predecessors of the world, who forever speak of the human condition. You may not like it, but it is definitely worth it.
