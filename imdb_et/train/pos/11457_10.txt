As the jacket says, this movie is "Excellent shooting and masterfully edited" and yes, it's mesmerizingly beautiful. The timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and the incessant and flow of water make the ephemeral works of the Goldsworthy hands so that in their great ephemeris they point to eternity. <br /> <br /> And so the beauty of his compositions haunts us only with natural melancholy woven - or Matthew Arnold's words "Dover's Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! You will hear the roaring of the square that the waves will draw back, and will flee, return to the high chain, Start and stop, and then start again, with the cadence of crushing slowly and bring the eternal sign of sadness. br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Goldsworthy says, "Words do their job, but what I'm doing here is much more." I do not take myself offensive and not for a moment when I think he is strange because the combination of form and time, change and texture, color and composition, created by Goldsworthy carefully and intuitively, is more than just words. In the second point, he states that "What is here to stay ... and not." This is his subject. I think that artists sometimes, in the twentieth century, became acutely aware of how even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast scope of cosmic time; and thus they began to reflect this perception by deliberately producing ephemeral works. The idea was to emphasize the timelessness of art by emphasizing how short life is even the most powerful work of people. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is such an expression. He carefully prepares some kind of straw or leaves where the tide reaches it, or places it on the river where it is wiped; and in this process both the composition and its ephemeris are combined. <br /> <br /> Both our temporary and the timeless are necessary to understand our world and our place. And it is important that these works do in the context of nature so that what has been created would be within the limits of nature. So the stone walls and stones that Goldsworthy constructs are quiet and strong, but we know that they are not monuments of eternity, but remain for a while indefinitely and then disperse and return to a country similar to art as art , which should be spiritual like. <br /> <br /> In some ways, Goldsworthy's work is an independent understanding. It's just a time and form experience. In a sense, his work "responds" to Shelley's famous poem "Ozymandia", saying, even if the tide washed the job and even if the river scattered the expression, so art lives because of our experience. Likewise, it is believed that Tibetan sand paintings are so carefully crafted and measured, and as they are so beautifully and dignified, they are given the wind so that we can know that everything is flowing. <br /> <br /> In today's world, however, these works of art carry photos and videos. Goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer (I would say if necessary) and all his works, even if unsuccessful, tells us that he has been photographed so he can look back and see what he has achieved and what he doesn't need to circumvent if he The cinematographic production led by Thomas Riedelsheimer is beautiful and appropriately haunted by Fred Frith. This is one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen and one of the most spiritual.
