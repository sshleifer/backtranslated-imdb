If this is a movie and the adventure you want in the movie, it would be advisable to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it is a lazy day and you want a good mood with this mood, check out the Straight Story. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth puts great weight on both gentle and gentleman Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's riding on the three countries to see his strange brother who has had a stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels for a long and long time. journey, making friends of strangers and giving advice about the family of many grandfather types. The story moves as slowly as the rider, but somehow manages to keep the viewer looking, waiting for Alvin's next lifetime offer. <br /> <br /> Pull on the couch, relax and have fun. This is the only way to watch this very good movie, which evaluates in my book 7/10.
