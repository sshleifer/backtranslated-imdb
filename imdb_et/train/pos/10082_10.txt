The film is truly amazing, unique and exhilarating. The story is universal in that it is a fight between good, evil and the world. Most importantly, his rating is wrong, misleading and travesty. Blockbuster has rated it as an X rated movie. The truth is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read clear and simple headlines.
