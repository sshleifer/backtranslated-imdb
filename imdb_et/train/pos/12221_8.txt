It's a great job. Very sexy and familiar enough to keep your interest in the whole. The main disadvantage of this is that it seems to have been made on TV: full screen, and although there were several sexual scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but the boy did it close!). It is also strange because Netflix shows that it was rated R. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is very titillating and I would like Alicia Silverstone to have made such films. <br /> <br /> One Netflix reviewer said it was part of the series, but I haven't been able to find out what the series is. However, I would like to know because this movie was good. <br /> <br /> Walt D LV. 8/23/2005
