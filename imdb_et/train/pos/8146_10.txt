I can no longer tell you how much I loved this movie. This movie is one of the least known and one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. The film follows the use of rap group NWH (Ni # $% rs with hat). It goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after it is tragic. After the group, there is a documentary Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film has a budget for a flower constraint, but it doesn't seem to matter, it's very well done, a well-produced movie, and the performances of all these actors and actors are great. The main strength of this movie is writing, this movie has so many great features and take-offs, it's unrealistic. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> Real rappers like MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste, and Booty Juice (Grab Your Dick) are the starters. Etc.) Rusty Condieff has made an excellent film. In the movie he plays the rapper Ice Cold. The movie is not finished, it's funny from start to finish. The film works so well because it sometimes becomes extreme, but it strikes the line where it is funny without going too far there. Listening to the three wires trying to talk about some philosophy was one of the best parts of the film, such as Tone Def, which tells the record producer when you drive, then get there, and the manufacturer responds, ??? it's deep! "<br /> <br /> The NWH group has some natural chemistry for them. They work well together and they manage to pull the movie to which the film has no weeks. What really makes this movie so good is the truth about some of the rape time groups. Many rap groups had problems with violence, censors, and like NWA, the group became only popular when the company started a big deal on controversial words. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's offensive. Here's something to offend everyone with good will. The film's uproar is a good number of people who are outside the rap, Spike Lee's more fun creature. When they came up with this dialogue, I can't imagine. The film has a row after the line that runs on the floor. As I said before writing is just great. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that this movie was limited to a limited version. It's a smart, controversial and even thought-provoking film. It is too much for the mainstream, even though it is fun and almost flawless in its production. There are no big stars, but many familiar faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Look at this movie, at least for sure.
