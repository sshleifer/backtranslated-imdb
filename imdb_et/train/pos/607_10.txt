Maybe I loved this movie in part because I knew it in mines and it's such a lovely little fairy tale. Regardless of the reason, I thought it was the perfect pitch. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, great acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie made me happier than I have been for some time. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny and smart movie. The joke of the King's King's game of play and its consequences, the way magical influence is exerted by the witch and tens of smart little touches, stunned me. This is a lot of what makes it so well; it is a complex, special-effect film that has more story than most fairy-tale movies, but still has little attention to small things.
