I watch it on the Star World network abroad, which buys an American and Canadian series that lasts one or two seasons like The Jane Show. I was wondering how many female comedy shows that I can actually look at myself, there is Lucy, who is guilty, I dream of Jeanie (Barbara Feldman) and then my mind goes blank, which I can't think of. all supporting roles, not the leader. So for me, Jane Show is a pretty good company. One thing I was just thinking about. I've watched a lot of things done in Canada and I never remember anything that is filmed in a regular TV series that shows SNOW! It's all done in the summer, LOL! Allow it to be a great place to live in the summer, but you think they'll show Canada a bit in winter because it's part of a lifestyle. I think of SCTV, Just For Laughs comes to mind, because two comedies show that it took a long time to shoot in Canada and hit very little or at all with snow, although they both do a lot outdoors. I ground, but I stab Jane and her obviously liberal ways accused of racism with her neighbor, and I like bald guy and her madness, I found it in parallel with the UK series The IT Crowd (I Think), another office comedy female hob. In no way is the best comedy ever, but the man who says he can look at it alone, saying something. When I was with my husband, he could really enjoy it because it deals with sex in the office and things that could be a good comedy for couples. 7 out of 10
