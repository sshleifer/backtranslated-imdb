The meteor falls into the crater lake, the heat that produces the effect that causes the prehistoric egg to hatch. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the plot is just a trash. But even though it's obviously low, it's one of the most exciting and fun monster-on-the-loose movies. There is also a good sense of humor. Old full of so-called monsters that are no more than ridiculous men-rubber suits or lizards dressed and forced to hang each other (cheap exploitation styles), it is refreshing to discover that Plesiosaur is this small pearl of a great Harryhausen-style stop-motion creature . <br /> <br /> A fairly difficult movie that needs to be found, but it's worth it.
