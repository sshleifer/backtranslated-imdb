This film talks about Queen Victoria's life during her youth and her first years as a British monarch. <br /> <br /> "Young Victoria" is an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated with a clean detail. The Young Victoria is a very impressive extravagant costume, rich spot and beautifully designed gardens. I was astonished with thoughtful cinematography. How each person is well placed against the background or knowledge, each scene is well-prepared. I am most struck by the scene when Victoria speaks to Melbourne. Melbourne was placed in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's corner, while Melbourne's corner was Victoria, where Melbourne kept his hands on his hips. <br /> <br /> The story wisely, it's too compact to follow and understand a person who has no historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed or not explained. I was expecting the great scene of coronation and only a few seconds of disappointment. <br /> <br /> In general, The Young Victoria is a good movie, and it would have been even better if it was longer so that events could be properly explained without haste.
