"When I sit down, I'll never stand up again," this is what the mother (title) tells her son when she tells her she's resting (she's just a widow). It means that the holiday is what a woman has to do in her age and situation: to rest, to neglect. But he's not "resting", not yet. She also has a daughter who casts her in for every catastrophe in her life ... Suddenly a revelation comes up: sex and passion in a muscular carpenter's face 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, a brand new James Bond) when he "thought no one touched her again ". This is a story that makes you think of many things, especially what is for 60 women who should do their lives when his wife dies. It does not see that we have developed such aspects in such aspects. I mean, no one will be surprised if Sean Connery has a love affair with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what do you think it would be different? Old woman, young boy ... skin, you're not ready, are you? <br /> <br /> The movie has all-round lengths, except 2 or 3 sequences, in which the tones break and out of some clear and unpleasant dialogs. These vulgar touches and the way the son and daughter feel the love of their mother (rather absurd - you know what I mean by looking at it) are the only disagreements in the "Mother". <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
