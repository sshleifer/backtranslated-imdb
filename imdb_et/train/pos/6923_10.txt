Including a spoiler A possible exception, except for John Wayne, was no other actor in the western saddle than James Stewart, and this film proves it. This great story of revenge that focuses on the Winchester gun is just one weak point I mean: Will Geer cast a very uneven Wyatt Earp. The casting of the roses was good: Stephen McNally, the same crazy Dutch Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntire (versatile for both good and bad boys) as a sliding runner. The calendar between Stewart and McNall is great! I will put it against the western catches of modern Western countries. They miss the opportunity!
