I swear I could watch this movie on my life every weekend and never get sick of it! All aspects of human emotion are captured by actors, scripts, direction and the general feeling of this film. It has been a long time since I saw a movie that made me laugh, reflect the sadness and feel every sense of what is in this great job! We need more MOVIES !!! Mike Binder: Are you listening?
