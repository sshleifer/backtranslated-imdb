This two story, based on two pieces by Edgar Allen Poe ("The Usher House Fall", "Death of Death" (poem)), is actually quite scary from start to finish. It is similar to some old black-and-white movies about people who meet in an old robbed house (such as "Cat and Canary Islands", "Old Dark House", "Terror Night", etc.)). Boris Karloff plays demented inventor-sized dolls that terrorize guests. He is already dying at the beginning of the movie (or does it?) And the house's inhabitants are subject to many terrifying experiences. I'm not going to go into too much detail here, but it's definitely an old vision for fans of the mysteries of the old blind house. <br /> <br /> Look at it with plenty of popcorn and soda in the dark room. / / <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
