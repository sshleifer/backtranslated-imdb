For Columbo fans, like me, this is an episode of episodes that gave rise to why Columbo was so popular and how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (like ever) who is playing a terribly intelligent criminal writer Abigail Mitchell. It seems that Abigail calls his brother to sign some paper to be his heir. He never died of his niece and is convinced that his dead brother's wife (Charles Frank) did dirty actions. Talking more would be unthinkable. The role of Mariette Hartley is Abigail's personal assistant. This Columbo episode is a class in itself. This is a really well made television movie. I highly recommend it.
