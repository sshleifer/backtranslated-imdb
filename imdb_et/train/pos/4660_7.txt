"Hot Millions" is a well-written, well-functioning story about an embezzler who steals (heaps - too low a classic word for an offender, according to Peter Ustinov's lead) "hot million" from a London branch of a US corporation, creating shell companies on the continent and using a seemingly secure computer to transfer money to them. (Remember, spoiler police, this is comedy, not a mystery.) <br /> <br /> Since 1968, depicting the computers in this film may seem naive to today's computer user population; but if someone who has worked with computers before this movie appeared, I stated that even when it was written and written by computers, it is probably meant to enhance the comedian aspects of this British flick. <br /> <br /> If there is little entertainment, it may seem like the movie is dragging. Fortunately, this is a nicely packed end; unfortunately, the final credits do not use the classical music used in it - at the end of the symphonic section and in the middle of the piano-flute duet - just Lulu's song, which I can't remember.
