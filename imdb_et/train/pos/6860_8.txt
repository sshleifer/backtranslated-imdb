Psychotic transsexual Bobbi murdered a patient (Angie Dickinson) of a distinguished doctor (Michael Caine) and then follows a high-end prostitute (Nancy Allen) who hit the elevator at Bobb's eye. Liz (Allen) is suspected of a crime and the teams, along with the patient's son (Keith Gordon), are killing to kill. <br /> <br /> It can be summed up in a few words: it's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look good), it's very bloody - a type of gore that is usually meant for cracks, and the boy is well designed . The writer / director De Palma's script is OK, but it takes back the ability to make a human movie. It is very successful on the visceral level and I deal with these characters. I can observe Hitchcock's usual De Palma tributes - at least one Master's picture. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's professional and plausible. <br /> It was De Palma's third film with former wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies.) <br /> <br /> By the way, the dancer turned actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants. There's a bit of trivia for you. <br /> <br /> I don't think the thriller could be stylish and bloody at the same time, but that image pulls it away. <br /> <br /> One of the best things is the typical Pino Donaggio music score. <br /> <br /> 8/10
