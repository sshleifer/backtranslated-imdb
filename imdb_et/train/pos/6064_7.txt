I have to start by telling you how I got this movie. It was in Asia all year round in 1990. An Australian friend stayed with me and my girlfriend in an apartment shoe box. can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink heavily and watch something on television. I found this movie outside the economy that put it in a snow bank and right away it was a treasure. The best worst film ever.We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking as a fish. We looked at it so many times that we sometimes turn to the side of the TV or back up for better performance. real pearl. Laughing and coming memories will last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. You won't regret it!
