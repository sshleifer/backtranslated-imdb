Oh, what fun is here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has an enchanting comedy (Look Who's Talking), but here she seems to tell the actors that they're going out and having fun. Micheal Keaton blows through Johnny's role, simply as a result of his best screen. Joe Piscopo is great as a suitably named Danny Vermin, which was not taken by shame leaders. And I've even mentioned Richard Dimitri, who plays Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary. I don't think it's an accident that most of the character's name is written for MORON. <br /> <br /> Good films are sprinkled throughout the movie, Peter Boyle, Griffin Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner has given good features. Even small actors like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get good lines. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to a friend.
