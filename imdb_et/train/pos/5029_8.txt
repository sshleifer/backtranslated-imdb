I went into this movie, perhaps a bit confused with the hack-and-slash movies that control the screen today. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly dark, with a dark atmosphere. But even more surprising was actually a limited blood sample. Like most good movies, it leaves something to the imagination, and Bill Paxton did a great job of managing. Scenes made inside the car, as well done, and after watching the episode "Anemia" at the end of the video tape, it was good to see some fine but wonderful things I had noticed were intentional and not just "Oh, it looks good out, hold it "in the direction. It's a moody movie full of gloomy. But for a dark object, much of it is filmed in daylight, even in some disturbing scenes. It's extraordinary (Okay, I've always been a Powers Booth fan) and never goes over the top. Au Contraire, it's very weak, which works very well for this type of film. If there is any area in this film, this is the end that looks just a bit natural, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or message of the movie. What is a message? This is something that everyone decides for himself. In general, this film is for 1 to 10 scores for 8 people who like the South Gothic genre (ie "Body Heat" or "Midnight in Good and Evil") and about 5 for those who don't.
