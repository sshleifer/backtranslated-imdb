Most of the horror movies are actually terrible movies. They get the same ol'-same oil. The same oil pack every minute with some cheap excitement (usually "squirting") and nowadays they can pack packed with special effects every second. One of the genuinely good anti-horror goals is to stop the public from disbelief. For example, I saw both of the last Mummy films and got almost ridiculous special effects almost every day. Probably one million dollars per second will cost to make these films, and my incredible feeling has never stopped, it has grown roots. <br /> <br /> Perfection can be more terrible. Less is more. <br /> <br /> I first saw A & E in the "Woman Black" channel. After turning the standard 987 very poor TV channel, I stopped watching it. This film has almost "Masterpiece Theater" production. It was good for me, I've always preferred British TV and movies. <br /> <br /> Most viewers find this to be a slow pace. But the slow pace helps you to trust the story. The special effects are few, which strikes the viewer to think that this movie is set in the real world, making us a little uncomfortable. Ghost makeup and costume are considered simple and plausible. Hollywood would have seen him like his demon from glowing eyes-claws, etc. Hollywood would have made the crowd and centered on this idea. in the movie. Most of them are where it is far away and even it creates good fear. If he appeared too often, it could have worsened the mood that changes. But this film is so well done that much of the movie reminds us that it is there all the time, but not visible. The scene in which he visits Arthur Kidd late at night and we see him just a little near, is a masterpiece of horror. <br /> <br /> This is just an extraordinary movie that I think should be one of the best ever horror movies ever made. I have a copy of "Haunting", "The Changling" and zillion more. I've never seen anything that is "Woman in Black," although I'm still looking. This film is so well done that it even gives the most hardened skeptic (like me) a moment when I had almost another idea about the lack of ghosts. I joke to people that from time to time I get short fears that he may appear in the middle of the journey or that I see him looking through his window, etc. anger anger. This should be a really big horror movie. Like LaFanu's novel, the black woman pulls you in very slowly and surrounds her neck and before you understand it, she squeezes life out and is too late. <br /> <br /> The closest thing I need to criticize is that it was made for a small screen ... and it's a terrible shame that it's printed. I paid more than $ 40 for this second copy of this movie. Now I try to find an even better horror film that not only gives chills, but also qualifies as a sound drama.
