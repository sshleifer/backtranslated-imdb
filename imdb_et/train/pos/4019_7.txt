Being not a fan of Snoop Dogg as an actor that made me even more worried about this flick. I remember being interviewed by "Jay Leno" and saying that he continued to play a big role in Adam Sandler's comedy "The Longest Yard" in this film. So, obviously, Snoop had a serious task to prove that he had operational pieces. I'm not going to surprise Snoop in her performance "Tenants". Certainly, there is a better rapper / actor, like Mos Def, who could have done more with his role. But Snoop has done a good job. He doesn't seem to break some of his body's body movements and vocal trends, but that's something Jack Nicholson does. The thing is that I found her role between a convincing role and the exciting tension between her and Dylan McDermott. By the way, McDermott gives the best result in the film, although his subtle action is likely to overshadow Snoop with such a subtle effect. Being a great reader and an aspiring writer myself, I couldn't find those characters and find some fascinating features. It worsened me how Snoop's character asked McDermott to read his work and criticize him. But you know what? I am sure many writers are such. His character had to be faulty in his own way, like McDermott's. My only slight criticism of the film would be its end. For some reason, it just seemed to me to hurry, although the resolution was definitely worthwhile and was motivated by characters rather than plots.
