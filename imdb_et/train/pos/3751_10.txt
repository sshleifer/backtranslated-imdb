I know you have already entered it at film festivals (or at least I think it is, I can just do it), but I think it should be the "best animated film" in everybody. Bravo. I can't wait for the whole movie. I understand that you may not hear this often because of the strange nature of animation, but listen to it now and take it for granted. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Although I still mean it. And here's another one - WIN! - And I can't stop here yet. It is extremely annoying and at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I probably look at all my films with another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon". I have a lot of them. <br /> <br /> -R
