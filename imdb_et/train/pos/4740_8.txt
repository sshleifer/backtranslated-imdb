OK, this is not a perfect movie, but I do not agree with the general IMDb opinion that it is really very bad. I looked at a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990s and loved it harshly. I never saw a "black mask" and saw it for the first time last week. In addition to the embarrassing poor copying that my DVD copy did not give me the ability to turn off, the film contains the raw material and the bravado that went through Hong Kong movies during that time. I still stick with my weapons, that when it comes to action, these guys, irrespective of their budget, add the magic element of the screen, not Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I don't knock them out - I just don't think they have its spontaneity and feel too regulated). What is this? It is a feeling that filmmakers tried when they shot and edited, not afraid to leave in some stains to learn lessons next time. For me, it makes watching movies even more fun and dangerous.
