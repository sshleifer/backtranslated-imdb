This movie took away the breath at some point, I just loved it! I testify that character dialogues and the storyline could have been a bit better, but hey, it's just a simple (short) story of a couple trying to kill a dragon, nothing more than that! <br /> <br /> General design, atmosphere, beautiful landscapes ... it's all just magical! <br /> <br /> They've done a lot of love in this movie. The character designs were big and funny. A bit of Tim Burton-ish if you want. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in a great design that is shown in a simple but cute story.
