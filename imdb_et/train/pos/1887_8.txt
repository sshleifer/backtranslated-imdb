Arthur is a medieval rich child who drinks like fish. Arthur does what he knows and says whatever he remembers. She likes to boast about her riches and knows she's broken. He spends money on people he doesn't know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a higher-class girl to inherit a great treasure, but he falls in love with a poor speaker Liza Minnell (she looks very weird). <br /> <br /> This is a fucking funny movie. I watched this movie because the well-known Indian film "Sharabee" is based on Arthur's character. Although "Sharabee" is definitely inspired by "Arthur", I think they are two different films. Arthur is just fun. Its very horny at times. The film has so many fantastic liners. It's not a ridiculous government, but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his groom's father and he speaks of "moose". Duddley Moore has a definite comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved this scene where she talks to a couple sitting on a small country in a hotel and talks between a man and a woman in two different directions. John Gielgud got an Oscar for this movie. I don't know this actor. I don't think he did a good job, but it may be when I look more at my work I will accept in the future. The film has some flat spots, but not very long. look forward to watching.
