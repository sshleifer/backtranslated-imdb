Wow it was a great Italian "ZOMBIE" movie with two big directors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF LIVING DEAD") Lucio started this movie and was sick so big Bruno took over and surprisingly better than I thought it would come out, so if you've seen "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie, and when you saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and liked both or one topic, this is a necessary movie see that it has a great "ZOMBIE" make-up witch, which is a great "ZOMBIES" look, a funny "ZOMBIE" head and "ZOMBIE" birds that spit on you and turn you into "ZOMBIE" People), but they are mostly big "ZOMBIES" like Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So if you like Italian "ZOMBIE" movies or just "ZOMBIE" movies in general, check out this great Italian "ZOMBIE" movie!
