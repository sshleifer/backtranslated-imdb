This documentary allows you to travel around the world. It contains rare and stunning deserts. It shows how diverse and how fragile our planet is. The future of the polar bear is highlighted at the beginning and at the end. After all, this gloomy future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. However, this documentary is a simplified approach to such a serious environmental problem. However, it is easily visible to young children as it is mainly descriptive. Scientists may be disappointed because it is not Al Gore's documentary "Uncomfortable Truth", but frankly ... what description !!! Then the question may arise: is it not worth the beauty of our world? Since this documentary proves that in 2007 such beauty still exists despite different contamination. When living in cities, we tend to forget that we are an integral part of this nature. Everything that this documentary thought reminds us that we have a common treasure called "Earth".
