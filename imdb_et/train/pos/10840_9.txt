Hughie (Billy Connolly), the big 70's band Strange Fruit, said with a voice that starts with the film, the reason why lightning hit the rock festival to stop the Strange Fruit set was that God was sick of the 70s . Indeed, it has been a popular music era to put down and see that punk is this welcome antidote. Although I agree that the excess was so tiring (as well as the miscommunications that came out of it) and as a punk, I am still a fan of classical rock or glam rock, and this movie about Strange Fruit's long and strange meeting is a pleasing respect for these days. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why the film works is caring for people behind the scenes. Brian Gibson directed the love of Tina Turner (although I had problems with the dramatic parts of the movie, wrote the music very well), writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais wrote joint responsibility and were behind the music oriented British TV show OVER THE RAINBOW and the songs Strange Fruit played also alien Mick Jones (not to confuse Clash with Mick Jones) so it was a meeting with people who knew what they were talking about. Two cast members are also musicians on their own (Bill Nye, I don't know, even though the film gives him his song, and he definitely looks like a singer of that era, while Jimmy Nail was in another British) Music-oriented TV show, although I forgot his name and he was EVITA) and others are convincing. And as I said, many 70's bands like Strange Fruit behaved badly against women, the film does not make the same mistake (except for a woman who follows Timothy Spall); as a reunion leader, Juliet Aubrey is pretty good and plays a completely rounded character. <br /> <br /> The other actors are also good, especially praise for Stephen Rea, who plays a more dramatic role without sentimentality. There are a couple of parcels that don't work, but in general it's quite enjoyable. Oh yes, and the music is good.
