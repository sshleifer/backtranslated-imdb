I liked Longstreet, which followed Raymond Burr's successful Ironside TV series and was meant to compete with it. But this exhibition was canceled after a season because it was decided - I believe wrong - that Longstreet was unable to compete with Mr. Burri Ironside. <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot of this show was especially well done and very memorable. I hope that the Longstreet set will appear in the box. <br /> <br /> Writers should note that this story idea was only briefly investigated here and that much more could and should be done to show the shortcomings and interactions on television.
