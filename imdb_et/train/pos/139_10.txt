First, Riget is great. Good comedy and mysterious thriller at the same time. A nice combination of a strange "dogma" style that tells the story with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no "end". For me, this is unacceptable. I thought ... how can the story continue without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have a point. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure part 3 without Helmer wouldn't be the same. So here is my suggestion. Maybe a little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. Why not make a small experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create puppet-based animation (such as Trey Parker's "Team America") or even a computer's 3D animation. I know that this is not the same as the actual actors, but in principle I believe it could work ... only in this way can the participants be made alive again. For Riget fans, this should not be such a big difference - if the animation is done in good ways, the average "guard" will only consider it normal after the first couple of shots of the film. The most important thing is now the story. It is quite understandable that it is not possible to create participants at Rigas 3 today. Why not play with animation? And ... look for the opportunities it gives you! Even marketing! The big director finishes his trilogy in 10 years, using doll animation. Just dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Rigas 3 ever ... or even see only the script. I'm curious as to how the story ends ... and as I expect - everything is doing here. <br /> <br /> Welcome, Slow <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about "Kingdom" hospital "Stephen King ;-)
