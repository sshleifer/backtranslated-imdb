The best TV series is missing. First of all, it has great actors and wonderful leadership. Writing is a very controversial issue because writing was extraordinary in the first two seasons, but after the end of the 3rd season, writing was very complicated. Who is Jacob? Why are polar bears on the island? What's the mist? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people think that writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and secrets that they can't explain. I believe these people are wrong. I trust writers. I think if the secrets have now appeared all the magic series is lost .Everyone, the lost is arguably the biggest in the TV series and it will stay for a long time.
