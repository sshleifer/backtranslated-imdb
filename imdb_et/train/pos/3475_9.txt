Being a Beatlemaniac that I am, I approached us with a combination of fear and charm. Having seen "In His Life: The Story of John Lennon," I was quite worried that two of us would not heal. The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris look like John Lennon and Paul McCartney? even with some make-up and decent hair? didn't help a bit. <br /> <br /> But I was more than a little pleasantly surprised. This is probably due to the participation of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who led Let It Be in 1970, and so apparently well knew John and Paul that characters and dialogue came as convincing as they did. (Two credits for writing to us are given to a man named Mark Stanfield, of whom I know nothing, I'm sure the director Lindsay-Hogg had more than a manuscript.) Two of us are not the Beatles biography; it has a very small plot, it's actually all in one of New York. What he does is a meeting with John and Paul in 1976, while John lived in New York. Of course, this meeting is completely fictitious? although it cannot really be denied that such a meeting actually took place. But through this imaginative conversation, does this give us an overview of the personalities of these two great musicians? their intelligence, sense of humor, their different reactions to stardom and most of their relationship; which made them so big a team, and what they broke. <br /> <br /> As it is a storyline that is not only one-and-a-half hours in a two-character dialogue, it's probably all but true Beatles fans; but it is fantastic writing and storytelling and is both informative and relevant. For those people who are interested in these two musical giants, it is very urgent that you get shocked by how different actors look at their colleagues and feel that John and Paul were alive? so intimate and convincing is the script and so are the actors. Two of us give you an invaluable insight into the life and story of two genes that are both sad and funny. Definitely recommended.
