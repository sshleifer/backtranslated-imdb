Nothing is more pleasing to me than that-dun-it or a tense story that keeps you all about the whole thing. And that is what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on the cooling of Ira Levin ("Rosemary Baby"). <br /> <br /> And in that, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE do what Caine and Laurence Olivier pulled out of SLEUTH - almost as many skills and as many puzzles as ever were in an exclusively smart game. <br /> <br /> But because it is meant to frighten you, it will surprise you and think it is difficult to write an overview of the plot. Let's just say that what we know at first is all you need to know about the movie. MICHAEL CAINE is a madly jealous playwright whose last game has failed. When a young ambitious writer, CHRISTOPHER REEVE, sends him the script of his game, Caine understands that his own outburst solves all his problems and gets his reputation back. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, it's fun and the game is for the audience, because Ira Levin's story relaxes, he can fight Agatha Christie for the numbers. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve play superbly with each other, each with a certain dynamic tension. story, as well as some funny touches that come from a script that comforts humor. <br /> <br /> To sum up: It's worth watching - but not everyone is happy with this end.
