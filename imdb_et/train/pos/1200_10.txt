No illusions, it's morality. Granger is a worrying ex-buffalo hunter, tempting the plains to kill-mad Taylor. Granger sees that the tip is close, and feels deep in his flock, the Indians and the earth. Although Taylor equates the sacrifice of buffaloes or Indians with being a woman. Although the role of Granger's tortured hunter is great, it is Taylor, who steals an exhibition, such as a demented, immoral, "eternal" who is fast for the bush and good times. There's not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story is moving fast and we're treating Nolan's character. The theme of this story today is as poisonous as that of the people of the 19th century with earth and related and racist. Considering that this was done, the censors must be twisted with their bags during the scene in a "buggy house", in Taylor's relationship with the squaw, and to a great extent in the dialogue. Though it's down, it's really a great Western picture.
