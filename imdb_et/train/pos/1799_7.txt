I am 14 years old and I love this comic. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a great pair. This movie is really funny and I love songs. My favorite songs are "You can't keep a good dog underneath" and this song sharing, I think it's called "What's My Own". It was the last film by Judith Barsi, who played Anne-Marie's voice. My favorite character is Charlie, but I find Itchy's voice to be so fun to hear. While I scared some scenes, I still find it difficult to look at the scene with Charlie's dream and Carface scares my mess. Other characters like King Gator found really funny. The end was divine and was really sad, made me a little cry. I'll give this movie 7/10.
