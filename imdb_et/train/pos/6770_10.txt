Airwolf Film, a variation of the original 2-part pilot, but the film is shorter, includes a 2-hour pilot invisible Pilot is more pilot than film If the pilot film is usually the same (2 parter combined) But the film is actually a different change here and cuts there. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at, even if you have a 1st season DVD, I'd still take a copy of the "movie" It's still in some stores, like virgin, Woolworths, and similar media stores, although it usually needs to be ordered, but this saves the need to buy online (as many of us don't do or don't trust the online store), but looking around at Airwolf stores, <br /> <br /> Airwolf was really one of the 80's most discounted exhibitions. <br /> <br /> Full-size Airwolf is currently being built around a helicopter museum:) Information and ongoing pictures are finished at http://Airwolf.org Also in Airwolf's Flashpoint and Flight Sim games, he finally sews, stay :)
