Halloween is one of those movies that gives you the skin deep! In my opinion, it is a daunting film all the time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was just so terrible! What makes Halloween so special that there were no special effects where you can say how your computer is animated, it was low budget and had one character but managed to scare Hell. 25 years and this film still has the same effect as '78. . Dr Sam Loomis is after him and does something to get him back because he describes Michael as "pure evil. Most dull eyes, fucking eyes". However, Michael is on a mission to kill his second sister Laurie, played by the new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to have a baby in Halloween, while her friends are a party and of course we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie may be an opportunity because she is a virgin. D <br /> <br /> Halloween pays much to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolute terrible movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock, lock windows and turn off lights! "They will get you! They will get you!" Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
