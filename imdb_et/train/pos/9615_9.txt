This is a great movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where chaos theory is summarized in the wings of butterflies, causing on the other side of the planet's tornado. Well, Bug is all about it (or at least something, don't worry that it's not a spoiler) I'm not a sure type of religion and don't believe in predefined things, fate etc, but this movie definitely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists ... <br /> <br /> even more, the actor and the camera are also great, the other shows that it is still possible to make a good movie without zillion bucks
