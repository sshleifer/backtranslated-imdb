Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realized. It is not completely faithful to the book, but should it be? No, not at all. John Thaw is like Tom Oakley. His transformation into a gentle caring was so well understood, making it more powerful than the Scrooge Christmas song. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw's best lesson. Young Nick Robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing picture of the evacuation that was traumatized by his mother's abusive relationship, he answered seriously. The script and music made this purchase worthwhile, and you can also see Thaw playing the organ. Amazing! The scene where Willie learned about Zaki's death was the most, and then Tom told her about her dead family who died of scarlatin. Buy it, you love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
