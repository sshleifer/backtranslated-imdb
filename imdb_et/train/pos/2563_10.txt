I've seen several comments about Brando using the South Accent, some of which thought it was a mistake. In making this film, racism and discrimination in the south were very strong. Jim Crow's laws were still in force. Civil rights were at the beginning. Could it have been a subtle social comment, a southern man who loves a woman of another race? Similarly, was MASH Vietnam's subtle criticism of the war? Any idea? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made on Myoshi Umek, which appeared "cold". Anyone in Japan would understand. The Japanese people, at least my experience, did not show feelings to strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who met single women. Japanese Americans were completely strangers to this culture, and stupid attempts to meet women were shocking women. One of the hallmarks of Japan was a smile as embarrassing or uncomfortable as many American military noted that their progress was welcome. Also remember that at the time represented in the movie, Japan had just been hit and the occupation forces were reluctantly treated. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very reliable result of his situation. His communication with American actors brought back many memories of his country's experiences. I had the opportunity to meet a couple of lovely young ladies who, after persuading them, were not a typical American man, taught me their language and culture in their own time.
