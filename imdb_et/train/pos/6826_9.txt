John Cassavetes 'opening night' is fantastic and exciting; fantastic because it plays the deepest fear we have in our imagination, interesting because it never ends up surprising us. With a very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who appreciates the signs cannot take their eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actor, Myrtle Gordon, (Gena Rowlands), tries to play with himself, to fight with his demons; The "opening night" is not only about the woman who is on the verge of disintegration, but also about the complexity of the life of theater actors and the theater world. All Cassavetes characters are experienced people here who know the world of theater; so half of this movie is on stage, where performers do their job or are at the back of the stage, where producers and writers and directors do their job. <br /> <br /> Cassavets are so characteristic that this insecurity comes to the audience, but to the cinema. Because there is another audience in the movie theater who doesn't know what's really going on and laugh, because they think it's all about performance. And that is essentially what it is; It's just that the theater audience doesn't see "backstage" as we do. They did not experience the greatness of Gena Rowlands until she went to this stage, but most importantly; they do not know why it acts as it does. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to be with friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says he is an actor and that is the only thing he knows; and I imagine that if I had a friend who was a professional speaker, it would be really hard to tell when he was telling the truth, because I know he is an actor and he can fake something at any time. Many of the things that Myrtle does during the horrible experience of the movie? We suspect he is real; The remaining characters are also suspected. <br /> <br /> There is a writer, Sarah (Joan Blondell), who doesn't understand why Myrtle does not understand her character. There's director Manny (Ben Gazzara) who can't agree that his best actor can lose it; producer David (Paul Stewart) who does not know where to stand and Myrtle's companion, Maurice (Cassavete himself), who cannot deal with each other with his love. <br /> <br /> When he knows a teenager, the death of a fan; it all comes together and affects Myrtle, but no one knows if its fraud is real. They don't say anything because they don't want to bother him, but the film enters a subconscious that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes we can say that everyone has done it. At these moments, Cassavetes's brilliant script depicts a terrible brutal honesty in the words the characters say on the back of the debate; and not just what everyone is saying to Myrtle, but also what he says to them. <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they think, just like the way Cassavetes cinema is made. In this aspect, performances are more important here than "shadows" because characters are involved in a larger picture; A bigger story that comes out trivially. <br /> <br /> But in some other aspect, in the actual way of making a movie, this movie is no different from "Shadows". There's a nice thing about how Al Ruban's camera character captures. When someone talks, the camera doesn't focus on him, it lets him listen; so we see how it responds to what the other says. Sometimes they don't care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes destroyed. <br /> <br /> Improvisation can, however, be among all these great performances. After all, there is an unexpected scene where Cassavetes and Rowlands start talking, non-stop. Whether it was improvised or not, we don't have to wonder. We just have to look; and looking at both, exchanging life experiences and not seeing that words are really alive in conversation, which means much more than what it shows?
