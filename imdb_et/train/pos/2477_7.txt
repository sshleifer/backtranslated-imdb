The great epic, as it is, Kenneth Branagh's monumental example of what perhaps is William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy, suffers from four hours of play and will definitely take real power. Two completely separate sessions would probably be better to fully understand what is definitely a high-end film. While I admit this masterpiece as such, I have to admit that the pentathlon of old bards, his rhetoric (and he sends himself so well) and his many are booming with enthusiasm. "Hamlet" loses its effect by losing its grip. <br /> <br /> From Patrick Doyle's Music to Alex Thomson's Movie Tim Harvey's Thin Films is a film of visual and phonetic joy that enriches the fine cast. Branagh has taken three big coats, adapted, guided and played. His adaptation is great, his direction is strong, but by the time he reached Hamlet's role, it seemed that the strain showed; yet he does a good job on what is an incredibly taxing role. Derek Jacobi despises evil Claudius, and Julie Christie is the most dramatic than her queen Gertrude. Richard Briers is wonderful when Polonius, and Charlton Heston are once again a strong screen effect as a player at King. Many others fall, including Jack Lemmon (very small role), Billy Crystal, Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. However, Kate Winslet must be one of the greatest discoveries of recent years. He is the moving image of the most tragic indicator of this whole case, Ophelia. <br /> <br /> Finally (before this review lasts longer than a movie), I have to say that it is the length that really tests the viewer of this movie. Branagh is geared towards the goal of providing many important, influential scenes. Too many of them are welcome. Watching this movie contains a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we collect from it. "No lender or borrower" or "Be real for yourself". And of course, "To be or not to be". <br /> <br /> The two-hour opening takes a bit of determination, but if you manage to stay tuned, you are sure to be treated with a fine finale that will gain momentum from the tragic funeral. <br /> <br /> Monday, June 8, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon
