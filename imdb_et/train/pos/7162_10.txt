This is one of my favorite films of my time. I read the book and liked it, but this film extends to everything the book has made famous. The actor is fantastic, especially from Jon Voight, who plays Mr. Mr, very bad character. This film has a certain narrative style that keeps you together until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending. I also love how it is directed, flashing back and forth between today's and Stanley's ancestral stories. The story is written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story has been made for the film and Andrew Davis is doing a great job. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies.
