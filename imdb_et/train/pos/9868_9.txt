It is clearly aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it is different in its less comic sense (despite the intentional cartoons of leading creatures). The story is not what was in your form a very great moral end (it is more like the sleeves of your shirts), but decides to just talk about the relationship between different "animals". You know the result, but you can't do it. <br /> <br /> People themselves are much more than their voices (the advantage of less famous actors, unlike most Disney movies). They are strangely well rounded and completely believable. The group's dynamics are perfectly well presented and character revelations and quizzes are subtle and enjoyable. You'll find yourself a lot earlier if you want to think. <br /> <br /> Animation is brilliant as you expect, and you pray for you to go to the ice rink. Movie. You will love the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel, and its desperate attempts to bury their nuts. I came out who wanted mandatory goods, especially a sliding toy, only the next day when I couldn't find anything vaguely tied. <br /> <br /> Strangely, it makes the movie even cleaner. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
