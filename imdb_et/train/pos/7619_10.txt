Intriguing. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that only touch the top of the iceberg in terms of the great story that LOST talks about. <br /> <br /> Since rare visual effects have worked, LOST television is an important exhibition -fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, many and many secrets for science fans. <br /> <br /> Each cast member is so well chosen and so good in his roles that you love them or hate them, or visually want them dead. <br /> <br /> The visual effects that are used (which are rare) are actually quite well done, given the usual production of exhibitions. Be it a "monster of smoke," the polar bears, LOST is an incredible eye candy. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, nothing can be compared to the complexity that this figure has had for the viewers to withstand. Finally, consistency is almost perfect, the characters are advanced and the ever-evolving story gives answers to the questions so much crave. <br /> <br /> In general, there is almost no error in LOST. This makes the dramatic / sci-fi television that the seized development made for comedy: it has set the bar. <br /> <br /> I recommend LOST to those who are patient, intellectual and love every moment of travel. no matter how long it takes to finish. <br /> <br /> See this example.
