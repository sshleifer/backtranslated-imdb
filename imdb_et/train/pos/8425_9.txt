Finally, I looked at these episodes in 2008 and I had to go back and check when they were actually produced. They are absolutely frightening because they made fun what would be the future. Parker and Stone lived in Texas and saw Govi ​​Bush's idiotic or strange, terrible people paying attention to things. Boo, scary! Bush frat bros who invade the White House dressed the Arab rifles? Bush "inadvertently manages someone?" (No, wait. He did it like a gov.) It may have seemed a failure if at that time sitcom, but now it has to be considered glorious as spooky, conscious.
