I've always enjoyed Chuck Norris in the movie. While action may not be great, fighting scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills next to him. In my opinion, Norris Brothers has proven to be beautiful entertainers and it was another good product! I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
