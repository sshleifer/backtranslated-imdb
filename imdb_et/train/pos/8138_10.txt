CB4 was terrible, but it could make Cundieff the idea better. More than Spinal Tap, if anything else, the movie is smart from the start. Everyone who saw it back in the mid-1990s is surprising. Performances are played laughing, but not so much that they are cartoons, more Marx brothers. These guys are real and somewhat diverse. They respond to situations like every one of us. Well, we must not throw an attack when our performance hats are late, or pull weapons and beat the record company exec, but you get the picture. N (n *** as) W (together) H (hats) takes itself seriously enough to pull in. rent it or get it at all costs, even if you're not actually turned on for rap music, it still leaves it hard. Comparing it to CB4 is like comparing George Lucas Star Wars with Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers.
