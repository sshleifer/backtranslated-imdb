At the first time I found that the story was at least less annoying than the other Cannon Movie Tales. Much more, I think it's one of the best. Some songs are pretty bad, especially love songs, but two things stand out, making a movie, even a song, worth it. One is the direction of art. Like other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a beautifully decorated periodic piece; Each fabric and jewel (both with the larger parts of that film) will look fresh and new and will contrast with the peasant's traditional clothes. Even during the song of love, I find myself perfectly doing the princess dress and hair learning. Another thing is comic timing. Many movies are cheesy, but Emperor vanity (and his fun at the end), the suspicious guard, the guard Nicholas, and the stupid prince, were all pretty funny and seem to be entirely practical. And the sequence of the song Weave-O compensates for those songs that were not so good.
