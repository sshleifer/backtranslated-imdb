I thought the movie was really pretty good. I enjoyed the actor and it moved well. The director seemed to understand the story he was trying to say. I have to see the big budget that comes out today, probably they had a lot more money to throw it, but it was very traceable. If you see a movie for a small budget, you'll need to consider it when you watch it. Some things were better, but most of them are budget-related. The show was pretty good, F / X and the tricks were well done. A couple of standouts were the man who played the camera. and the boy who played the baby. Such films have worked in LA and it's OK.
