In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) receives a gift card official; there he beats together with his colleague James Stewart (Alfred Kralik). These two are not working because everyone is in love with the unseen pen palm. Watching Ernst Lubitsch directs these letters inevitably. Even better is the sub-block, which includes the shop owner Frank Morgan (like Hugo Matuschek) who suspects his wife's thing. Hiring a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms that his 22-year-old husband is having sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, painfully understanding, "He just didn't want to get older," and the supportive characters keep that movie old. <br /> <br /> ********* Shop around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
