Four teenage girls in the suburbs of Los Angeles are experiencing all kinds of difficulties: parties, drugs, police officers, mixed parents, older boys. Jodie Foster, a kind of parental chicken, is trying to keep everyone together, like a "family" (like a family she's never had), and the heartfelt thing about the film is that she can't. Slowly everyone is growing up and going away. Unfortunately, this exact plot, although underlined throughout, is unfortunately changed. Did we really need a long sequence where Scott Baio won his skateboard full of cars? Or even a longer sequence - including Baio - where Foster has a strange squat of pain in the illusion. In fact, some of the dialogues are really striking and I didn't care about the late arrival of the movie to death. But these are tricks on what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a close bond. And the face of Jodie ends. When the audience finishes it, it has earned it. It does not capture tears and does not ask for sympathy. It shows us examples of friendship and hope. *** from ****
