Maxx has a deep psychological introspection that is slightly hidden as a weird-out superhero story. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in an undisclosed dirty town with a criminal, and she has a lot of problems with everyone she knows. Maxx is his friend and client, a streetman who thinks he's a superhero with a costume - or is it the other way around? <br /> <br /> Maxx must not be a piece of art, a piece of art, or an excellent voice - especially late in the deliciously fierce Barry Stigler's main villain, Mr Gone, with a little evil voice. <br /> <br /> If you can see it, don't forget it.
