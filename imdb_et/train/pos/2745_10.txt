I've seen a lot of movies, but "In Cold Blood" is a class by itself. It stands out in every department. The fact that it contained little capital letters helps to push it up when you pay more attention to the characters and their story, not to the name of the subscriber. Blake and Wilson are turning to killer duo letters. The fact that a large number of films have been filmed in real places where crime was committed, even within the same house, is still accompanied by chills. Black / white photography darkens the mood and photography is great. There are many outstanding cinematographic works, but if I could only vote for one, it would probably be "In Cold Blood".
