I didn't laugh at this movie for a very long time. Hollywood's recently thrown garbage pulls me up! It was definitely fresh and witty. When you look at the demographic characteristics of ratings, only a few women voted! I don't want you to destroy the movie, but I'm sure every man who saw it ran into their computers to evaluate it and gave him a bad result, why? Because this movie puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of their true sense of humor and not because it harms men ... it may be a "7" rated movie!
