I saw this movie a long time ago, but I found it to be amazing and so far it has never surprised me. <br /> <br /> An excellent film describing a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink Japanese ships at the WW2 harbor in Singapore. <br /> <br /> These comos are caught in traditional clothes and are considered spies by Japanese prisoners. But something happens that hasn't been studied much by the Hollywood WW2 movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> There are dense and friendly bonding between catchers and prisoners. They begin to respect each other while the captured captain of Australian soldiers becomes the best friends of older Japanese prison guards. It is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really pulls your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, when two friends are chatting, the Aussie Captain learns to try some other prisoner and the Japanese ship has been killed in a Japanese port. <br /> <br /> He mentions that his team, and not others who had delivered their ships to their Japanese friend, heard the Japanese guard silently, because it could lead to his entire group being executed. However, the captain remains neglected to be recognized by the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities will tell them to death in the most respectful way they are in accordance with these rules. It is the highest honor given to the Japanese Resurrected Warriors. still not ready to believe why his Aussie friend admitted he was guilty. <br /> <br /> I will not end there. But it is more fun than you can even imagine and easily move to one teardrop. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent undervalued film that was not recognized internationally. Get one copy today and watch out.
