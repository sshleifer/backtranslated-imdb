This is Columbo, led by Steven Spielberg at the beginning of his career. This is not something sensational, but in this movie you can see a small hint for Spielberg. The film is basically in the same style as most of the 70's Spierlberg films and TV shows. This means that some characters tend to show some fraud and not. I'm not just talking about Columbo's character. Such a character, perhaps best seen in the 1975 Spielberg movie "Jaws". But with the exception of a few small tips on typical early Spielberg elements, you can't call this movie to work as a stunning director and an excellent example. Not that it's bad, of course, it's not, but as I said before, it's not too sensational. <br /> <br /> This movie really started very well and very promising, but after the fine opening, where the murder always happened, the movie got a bit slower and dull. Unknown, because this book is mostly a Columbo movie that has no real memorable moments, not boring because it's a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was quite brilliant and the notion that the writer of his writing partner's murder crime showed great and interesting potential. The story, however, did not explore all its possibilities. At least this feeling is that this movie was left to me. <br /> <br /> The film was still good to look at the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he's smarter than Columbo, thanks to his mystery / crime writing experience and trying to give him any possible tips that lead himself away. But of course Columbo knows better and he is his first suspect from the first moment, but he usually plays the game. <br /> <br /> The overall style of the movie is good and uses some fine camera positions and editing. It's funny to see that most of it was mostly in line with Spielberg's later work, especially some corners of the camera. <br /> <br /> A subtle and completely traceable Columbo movie, but don't let Spielberg's name confirm it will raise your expectations too high. <br /> <br /> 7/10
