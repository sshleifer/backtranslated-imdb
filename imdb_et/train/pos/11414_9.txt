Big message with message. Joan Plowright is great as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is fun as "coach" and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine" perfectly. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" makes a good result and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays his first leader very well. Jo-Beth Williams is the director of this film. Editing is the first rate.
