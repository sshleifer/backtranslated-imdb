I watched this movie a couple of times in the 90s and almost burst out everywhere. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but it's up to something else. She's so funny. Even P.C. Brigade would have fun. It has to look and even better if you have boys or girls for a drink. Michael Jackson's uplifting is like he's closing your eyes, you believe it's his singing. The things he describes are alive and you really need to get a sense of humor if you think it's not funny. My local video stores are no longer stocking this video, but I would like to get a copy to show my spouse and boys when they are old enough to appreciate humor. Anyway, highly recommended, I hope you enjoy.
