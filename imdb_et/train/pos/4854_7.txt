Curl up this one in the dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused, upset and frightened. A charming old plot about a phantom train that has said it passes through a lonely English county at night can be incredible, but it's a lot of fun. There are some wonderful old clich√©s like "ACCIDENT" that locals remember but don't talk about. But mostly a movie comic for Arthur Askey, to show his special brand between the humorous bits of humorous humor. Askey's nervous humor is not very trendy these days, but if you just let you wash it, it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askey movies.
