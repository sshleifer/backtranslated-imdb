This movie is a fun, fun and high quality movie. Following the book, the film follows the guidelines and tries to stick to the exact line. The actors are all right and you think they are part of it. They use famous actors who have a great influence on the film. Graphics are a bit uncomfortable in some parts and there are quite a few mistakes in the whole movie. For example, there is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard. The camp is not as bright as explained in the book, and they don't want to see the camp as much as the book. His whole group is called in the book a lot, but they are not in the movie. All in all, a great movie is rainy in the afternoon
