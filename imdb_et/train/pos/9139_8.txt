The movie is okay, there are moments, music scenes are the best! The soundtrack is a real classic. This is a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (at first, because it is a great party and a great tempo), Take Me With U (fun pop music ...), Beautiful people (cheerful probably the closest thing to R & B all this on the album), Computer Blue (somewhat angry anthem towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever, it makes a very insecure Appolonia) when Doves Cry (climax) for this masterpiece), I'd die 4 U, baby, I'm a star, and, of course, Purple Rain (a real classic, very good ending for its classic album) Film and album are both very good. I highly recommend them!
