I've seen this movie and even though I knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still liked it. I recommend it to other people. It is quite a lot for a lifetime movie network. And I mean, because it's close to Halloween because they can play more. So please see if you are interested in seeing it. I believe Alicia Silverstone played very well. I like her as an actor and a person. She looks so nice and on earth. Kevin Dillon was so good for him. I'm not trying to knock him or anything, but I believe his brother Matt would have been able to pull this bad evil series killer person better. Kevin seems too sweet to me. But I think he's fine.
