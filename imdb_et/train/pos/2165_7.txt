Watching impulse is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable movies are so rare, when someone comes like "Impulse", it is something to embrace. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give credible performances. It could have been played like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is much better than a boring "zombie" and originality shines through almost every scene. You feel that something like this could actually have happened, even though the script is pure fiction. From the "grabber" opening to the roll of credit, you are fascinated. Very fun and definitely recommended. - MERK
