I thought it was one of the best films I've seen for a long time. It was a great story and showed that people are so complicated in all sorts of ways. Have recommended it to all your friends !! I always have a good story and this movie was one of the best I've seen for a long time. I saw I have a daughter and do the same things Natalie did to learn more about her life and love. It showed how we not only live with our families; but we also have a part of our life that we don't share with them - because it may not be in their interest to know all the details of things we don't do that we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing you on this kind of movie and keeping an eye on it.
