A strange but emotionally disturbing cooler from a medieval man (William H. Macy) who finally decides to leave quietly with his father (Donald Sutherland) at the time of leaving the family business (for murder) (John Ritter) and flirt with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a top-notch thriller that looks like "American Beauty" meets "The Professional". Here are Macy and Sutherland. A remarkable debut for Henry Bromell, the first writer / director. I'm surprised that this movie didn't get in theaters for more than a few weeks.
