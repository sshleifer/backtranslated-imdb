I had waited a few years before this movie finally appeared in England, but I was very pleased in many ways when I finally saw it. There are many good things to do with the film, starting with acting. This is not something I need so much in horror, but the people in this movie did everything well. This and ever-exciting and interesting script that has a nice sorta Lovecraftian gives the film a true strong backbone. Add surrealistic nightmare images to it and occasionally the winning gore and movies. It is also my favorite type of gore, supernatural and splattery. Also, Marcus, angry bodybuilding transsexual and Daisy, his mentally slowed mistress / toys, are in fact comfortable and uncomfortable and give way, everything goes sick in the sense of madness that works well with frequent Freudian superpowers. This is one of the most impressive latest horror films that are much more shocking or out there than anything Hollywood can produce. My only handle was that I wanted the end to be darker, but it still works, so I would generally recommend it with serious nightmares.
