Artemis was yesterday late. First of all, I didn't think I'd like it, but if I didn't feel like I was still asleep and nothing else, I continued to look and feel intrigued by the young Artemis, virgin, pure and passionate. His romantic parents, Tass, created recognizable feelings. Although the film is based on a very romantic level and not on reality, I loved it much more than ordinary biographies or costumes. Great game, great cameras, great music and texts. I loved it and I want more! :-)
