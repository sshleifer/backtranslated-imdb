COLD BLOOD has been masterfully supervised and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is flexible enough to be realistic, sometimes more clinical than entertaining. Reflecting the brutal killings of the family in the city center focused on Truman Capote, who focused on small things, wrapping and the reader's subject AND topics! Brooks wildly departs from this approach for something closer to docudramale. Although he's shooting in real places, he keeps his distance. The killers are depicted as a spoiled imbee, which certainly was. They are not considered to be misunderstood souls (as in Capote's book) and the bravery of their actions is terribly blunt. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent killers as supportive cast, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as reporter (Capote's character?).
