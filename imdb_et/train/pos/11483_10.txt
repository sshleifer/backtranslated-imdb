What makes this movie so scary is how Andre and Calvin represent a (relatively) normal man. These are certainly not the people who want to become professional filmmakers because they go in front of the camera, forget the scripted lines, and so on. They only make the video a diary to show â€œsurvivors how normal their life was. Their parents just think the boys are filming family video. Studying other children attacks on these schools, Andre and Calvin learn what not to do, and they (usually in a stupid old house) inform any potential Andres and Calvins who watch this video. bombs, get weapons and not catch before zero day (attack day).
