This series was presented in the United States by cable television "Comedy Central". It was cut out of death and the sequence shown. It was sad for the audience he should have attracted. Fortunately, the cable company went digital at the same time and got the BBC. Thank you very much, because I had to see "gentlemen" in order, complete and endless. <br /> <br /> "Gentlemen's Union" is right there in England's "Monty Python Circus" and Canada's "The Kids in the Hall". But ... warning. <br /> <br /> The gentleman, however, is one step further. It is not just about dragging and illuminating cultural diseases, it is getting deeper and much, much darker. I can tell you many now - it offends some groups of people, it enriches others. But remember, its the only comedy. If that's not your thing, don't look. If you think you know dark comedy, look at it - if you get angry and upset, you don't know DARK COMEDY quite well. <br /> <br /> These guys got it right and click. They're great, they're great and I enjoyed creating each character. There's a complete story that is being talked about from the episode to the end. You can't watch this episode at once, but it's one of the charms of this series. Look at it in order. See how creative and stylish these men are very disturbed. Someone and nothing is beyond the boundaries. That, my beloved, is "dark humor". Bravo!
