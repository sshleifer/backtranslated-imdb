I laughed during this movie so hard that my face hurt. Ben Affleck was fun and reminded me pretty boy Jack Jack in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical A-production. The whole cast is funny, the story is pretty good and the comic moments are fantastic. I went to the movie that didn't wait so much so maybe I was so surprised that I had come out of the valve, calmly, and forced my face. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness and / or relatives during the holidays. The best part of this movie (anyway) was the gentle sense of humor that was trying to guard me completely and I had a laugh long after the rest of the audience stopped. Namely a scene that includes Christmas tree lighting. Go and see it and laugh!
