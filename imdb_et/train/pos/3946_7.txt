I found this one and commented on the film completely informative and totally too harsh, so I've decided to write it myself. I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and since then has been caught a few times more. First of all, let me say that, in general, what this film gets right is what makes it worthwhile. It does not matter that it has some low budgets and other errors. Worth a look. The idea of ​​creating a film with a narrowly-meaning Anglo-Canadian community that restricts Walt Whitman's visit to South Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The film discusses the humanizing catalysis inspired by Whitman. And in this sense it is exactly accurate. Actor - especially Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. Scripting and dialogue are strong and pay enough attention to the newspaper and newspaper. In general, what does not like? What's more, is Whitman alive?
