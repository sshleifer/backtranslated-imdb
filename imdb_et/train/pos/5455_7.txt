The infamous pre-code movie, really the movie that made people insist that the Hayes code be strictly followed. Barbara Stanwycki's stars are a young girl whose alcoholic beverage seller has no problems with customers. When he dies in an accident, he is released to the world with the knowledge that his married body will receive whatever he wants. She goes to New York and goes on corporate ladders with one bed. Although obviously no real sex has been shown, the film is quite stupid. Unfortunately, after the loss of the original shock value (about the time Stanwyck screws the rail wagon inspector for free travel), the film becomes repetitive and boring. Stanwyck itself is the only thing that keeps the movie worth it. As always, he is fantastic.
