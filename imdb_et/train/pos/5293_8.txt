It's a very light comedy about a wonderful family with a son, Pecker, because he uses Peck in his food. Pecker loves to take all sorts of pictures of people in the small suburb of Baltimore and succeeds in getting a group of photo artists from New York. Pecker has a cute sister who just goes over sugar for sugar and is actually ADDICT, taking a bag of spoonfuls of sugar. There are scenes of men who show their jockey pieces of grinding movements and pretty much the same. With this film it is quite difficult to keep your mind out of the gutter, but who cares is just a film that gives you some laughs because of the simple picture taken in 1998.
