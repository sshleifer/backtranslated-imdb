"Bye Bye Birdie" is not the best musical of all time, but it is very fun and accessible to many audiences. The original film could have been wonderful when Dick Van Dyke reiterated his role as Broadway, but rather created it with a plot so the film is very pleased. This conversion, which was delivered to ABC in 1995, is much more faithful to the original script and also includes some original songs used in the national circle that this film took out of which Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this film). br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is a very different type of Dick Van Dykel but he is well Albert as Albert (he started his musical theater before his "Seinfeld" days.) Vanessa Williams is perfect for Rose. Their work is also Tyne Daly, like Mae and Mark Kudisch, as Conrad Birdie (the role he played in the national circle). <br /> <br /> This movie is not without problems. Great responsibility is Chynna Phillips who, despite this, looks too old to be a teenager Kim. And George Wendt is somewhat gentle as his father, somewhat throwing a number of "kids" away (numerous original cast members Paul Lynde stole the show.) <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an amazing, well-made film that the material deserves.
