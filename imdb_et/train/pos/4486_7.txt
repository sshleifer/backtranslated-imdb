SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are classic comics with a flawless idea and almost every short is a pearl. Although I have to say that it is definitely a short short compared to other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, it is not that you can hate this comic. Of course, it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first episodes of Tom and Jerry, and I can say I agree, but the fact is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great, but some are just better than others. Well, it would fit with "others". <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom listens to the old frightening radio program and gets easily scared. Jerry notices how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates terrifying dilemmas for Tom, and Tom is afraid of fear and life. Then Jerry puts a vacuum cleaner on the page and checks it, so it looks like a vacuum. Tom finds Jerry doing all this and pursuing him. Tom accidentally bites the maid of the house. Eventually, Jerry finally comes to scare him after seeing his reflection in a flour dish. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is far from the best of Tom and Jerry who are short there, but it's still a fun and fun time. This makes me want more cartoons. The hell and gags that make Tom and Jerry famous are as short as ever, but it seemed like nothing was missing. It seemed slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. Anyway, it's a good short that doesn't match some other Tom and Jerry caricatures, but it's still nice. <br /> <br /> 7/10
