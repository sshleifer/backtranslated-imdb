At least something good came from Damon Runyon's erroneous sample to mute the mafia. "Guys and Dolls", a seemingly indestructible staging music, was filmed in 1955 for the movie Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and enjoyable film, with all the stars, including Vivian Blaine (original) Broadway show, Jean Simmons character is a strange similarity to Audrey Hepburn's "Rome Holiday") and two of the greatest leading men of all time, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of whom had recently won Oscare's best supporting actor ("From here to eternity") and the best actors ("On the Waterfront ") and were at the top of their game. One hears Brando's song "Luck Be a Lady Tonight" tells about where Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the exhibition Nicely Nicely Johnson, who brings the house down, sitting down. Common Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his rogue screen in the gangster gallery. The film has a bright, comic-like look that predicts pop art from the early 1960s. The characters speak of a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the social attitudes and gender roles of the film are dated, it is all very fun, and even the Salvation Army's delicate jokes are harmless and reflect some real hostility to organized religion. Seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is a good reason to watch this movie, but over the course of 149 minutes it offers many other attractions.
