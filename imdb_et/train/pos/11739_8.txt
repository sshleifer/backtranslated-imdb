"Elvira, the lover of darkness" is a kind of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with supernatural touches. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) walks on television as a horror film after a fresh update by the new station owner. He now relies on an exhibition in Las Vegas to conduct him, but learns that he has to come out with more money to start the show. Things seem hopelessly to raise money until he gets the message of his aunt's death, which then takes Elvira to read Massachusetts. The house, dog, and cookbook that needs to be repaired is all that his aunt leaves, and again it seems Elvirail has trouble finding money for a show in Las Vegas. Adults in a small and narrow-minded city make things worse, making Elvira more difficult. Only local (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers become friends with him. Elvira uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard) is pushing to make an agreement for Elviraga's cookbooks, but Elvira soon learns about her powerful legacy, including spellcasting and a couple of very effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell his uncle to his culinary art, but he has decided to get it, knowing its power. Then Elvira stands for the old sorcery of the burnt city and between him and his uncle. The plot is quite simple, but humor and well-developed characters keep it at a nice pace. "Elvira, the lover of darkness" is full of cute, dirty, terrible and clever humor, which is carried by many sightings, stunts, props, songs and parodies. Because of the film's occult touch, it is one of the best horrors of parodies. This is a well-made film where all the performers are acting awfully; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway ("Grease"). Many people (including myself) wondered if Elvira's character could wear a feature film and the answer was gratifying, YES!
