It was one of the best episodes. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car at '68. It is clear from the death sentence in the State of Death that he stole car heroin after shooting. His case will be reopened on the assumption that he is a police officer. <br /> <br /> His further investigation into a police officer and a human being shows a war veteran who is bound by banned love. This type of love was considered disgraceful and something that was at least kept at that time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the kind of love I personally support, he was still a policeman and a man and was not killed for it. The soundtrack was excellent (keeps me watching the DVR) and black and white mixed selective use to emphasize one object or special knowledge of the scene. I look at it repeatedly!
