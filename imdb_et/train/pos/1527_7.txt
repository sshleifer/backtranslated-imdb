When this movie came out, this movie looks beautiful and sounds good. Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews, and especially Anton Walbrook, an eloquently thought-out actor and a beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg's moving central performance. Preminger does not jump and shows that his long slow encourages you to listen and think, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity. the worse. Too many contemporary movies on "historical" topics cannot be resisted. What would Mel Gibson do about Maid? Probably many hanging shots on your racket will burn to the BBQ when the flames are closed. Preminger doesn't do that. Burning is mainly indicated by a susceptible reaction. There are some weak results, but not enough to cause serious damage. I hit this movie on television and didn't wait to see it, but I was caught. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, the story of Joan is an unexpected resonance.
