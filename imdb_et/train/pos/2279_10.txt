Before that, the wrong "slaughterhouse way" was the best. But the customization of this "Nightmare" screen is very correct for the book and keeps comedy, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, it wasn't a Hollywood or idiotized movie, "Champions' Breakfast". The other good thing about this movie is that you don't have to follow this book (as I think you make a slaughterhouse for five). This is probably also true for Champions' breakfast, but they did a bad job of reading a book and not seeing a movie! Nick Nolte did a great job in this film.
