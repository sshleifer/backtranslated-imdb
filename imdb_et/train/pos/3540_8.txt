I bought this game from impulse shopping walmart. I'm glad I did. It was very fun to listen to Sean Connery and play. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a movie / game remake. Bonus levels were very heavy! The Sniper One, which I thought was too difficult, made me so disappointed that I didn't play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people who shot you without hiding or living to handle it. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the upgrade system. I did not notice any difference between the upgraded devices with the upgraded devices, such as armor upgrades did not see that the armor would make more or more fill in my life meter. I really liked the Q-helicopter. I think the developers did a good job.
