I appreciate such films: smart and well-designed, entertaining, absorbing, well-behaved and well-directed. Someone - even Pacino - doesn't chew the landscape *, trying to stand out; one of the most effective moments of the film (Aielo, who pulls over his beloved ramp) cools down just because of this security system. <br /> <br /> Not as good as you say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL has a similar cloth: involving both the mind and the eye, ear and heart. Why do such well-equipped entertainment flop somewhere? <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino doesn't chew it in one particular scene, but just because it's necessary. Also a great scene.
