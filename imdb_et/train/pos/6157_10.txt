This is a movie I had never thought of until my 3-year-old saw it in a video store and grabbed it after a mirror image of animals on Nabooboo Island. We got it and we've been following it repeatedly; in fact we have rented it several times. There are very few non-animated movies my son is watching and paying attention to; What a nice change from Dumbo and Little Mermaid. The action is outstanding, the songs are convincing, they enter your head and you can't help but sing. Style, though specifically about WW2, is timeless on its roads and every time you watch it is something new. I've heard of it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different movies, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of the films that children want to watch over and over again, which parents don't remember. There are days we look at it before the sun and bed, and I don't feel this rush when he wants to repeat another movie.
