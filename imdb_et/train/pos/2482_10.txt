The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It is good that Robin Williams got the role of Osiric's comedy, otherwise it might be a bit strange to see him in such production. It is very nice that Kenneth decided to use the full version of the text, it will certainly not happen too often ... Thanks to this, viewers will see all of the non-selected viewers. I also thank God for the classic form of the film; NO for surreal fans! Though "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive, but Hamlet is a different story, at least that's my point.
