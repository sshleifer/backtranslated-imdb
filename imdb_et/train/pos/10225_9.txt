I have a good laugh, reading all the idiotic comments of this movie, because it is obvious that those people who criticized the film never saw it or were stupid enough to see it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to watch Elvira was a few years ago. Elvira made the film laugh as much as possible. <br /> <br /> It's a clever monster compared to hundreds of fearsome Americans. Much better!!!!
