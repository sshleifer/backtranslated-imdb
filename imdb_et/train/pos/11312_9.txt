Ossessione is in a very bad condition, but now it has completely recovered from a digital television lab in Copenhagen. The material used is the "Master Positive" 2nd generation that was originally printed to conceal Visconti's fascists. It has been scanned in Spirit 4K (2K RGB data) that was processed using DaVinci Revival recovery software. After that, the rest is manual and we do not expect to finish before the early spring. Next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully on HD-DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope that many future generations will enjoy the recovery efforts.
