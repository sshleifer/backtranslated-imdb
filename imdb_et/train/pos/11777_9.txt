"Jared Diamond did the first episode that other people in the world didn't have the animals that the Europeans did, but Europeans did that, which is why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines." --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasons for the documentary or the original. Please don't destroy this big piece with your simple mind. The reasons are much more complex than the one thing you mentioned. Please read the book as it is a great source of information. I enjoyed it a lot. This book is even taught as a textbook in some universities.
