We've been too light on the term "superstar" these days, but here's one guy who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I joined this whole show. The choice of the song was perfect - it contained only the songs that I really wanted to hear and cut with documentary during weaker new songs. I loved the band being just five men in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this strength you don't need an entertaining circus). <br /> <br /> The crowd shots were also amazing. How many performers can be influenced by the Beatles fans (now in their 50s and beyond), getting young children to jump out of the "Can't Buy Me Love" opening, and affect everyone? While watching, I also realized that after John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney immediately became a follow-up. Paul not only lost John and George (regardless of their final relationship, it is difficult to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife, Linda, and never really appreciated what Lennon got. I agree that the murder of Lennon was terrible, but only now did I realize that Paul was forgotten after that. I was very happy that he found love again in Heather. <br /> <br /> As for those who complain about audio / video quality, I had no complaints; both were crystal clear in my set. I think these same people complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format appears; they are never satisfied. My only regret was not buying a ticket at this show when I had the chance. Thanks to this video I was able to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they first remember their murder and then their music. I now have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney because, if anything else, he is first remembered for his music. We hope this will not change if the McCartney directory is pretty good.
