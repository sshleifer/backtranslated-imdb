Emma is a terribly flawed film based on Jane Austen's classic novel. I haven't read this book, so I didn't really know much about this plot and I predicted almost the whole plot. There were also many scenes that disappointed me because of poor writing or leadership. For some reason the film is very fun and I loved it. Of course, all the scenes I didn't like, but most were good and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the best performances of Emma's heroine. The film also marks Toni Collette (who is good but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger (who is also better, but here he is very good) here) and Jeremy Northam (who at first glance is wood, but actually quite exquisite, even if it was not so necessary) Jane Austen's books are much better adapted, but it is still very fun and worthwhile.
