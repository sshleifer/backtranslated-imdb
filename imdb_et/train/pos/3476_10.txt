Cut Chase: If you are a baby boom, you will inevitably spend some time thinking that in 1976, McCartney was in the hands of John in the private life of the city and spent the day with him. You also questioned how things went. I heard exactly the same reports that the film writer heard from John and Paul's point of view, and I admit that he reconstructed the meeting in much the same way as this film. But none of my imagination would have bought tears in my eyes as it does with incredible work and action. I found it to be amazingly viable, completely believable and 100% saccharin free. Could anyone explain why I didn't hear this masterpiece before the CBC showed it last night? I think it's three years old for goodness! And yes, if you're a Beatles fan, it's a must-have power! Even the subtle paraphrase of the Beatles melodies in the background is inspired.
