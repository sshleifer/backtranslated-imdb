I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. this is one of the few films ever made to be romantic. to try to talk about a plot or performance or technical details of this movie would be the words of Frank Zappa "like dance architecture". it strikes the nail straight to the head in a way that it captures those living moments that move us and then go away from us. it seems like a movie whose "Customization" movie was written by Charlie Kaufman's character. the end remains open and ambiguous, here is not happy, just a mystery. there are no deep life lessons, but a few horny and intelligent children who are exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ...... romantic love. <br /> <br /> Of 10 out of 10 look at this special lady and recommend it to strangers ................
