Here's my first David Mamet movie. Installation, because it was also his first. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and it moves along any con movie, from minor disadvantages to big worries to a comprehensive con. It's like "The Grifters," but without the action of this movie. (In this movie, John Cusack was kind of happy, but it was his character's character.) \ THe is very flat here (sometimes I wondered if Crouse's bliss had to be an attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never really gets good, but it develops over ten minutes after painfully rigid lines. At the beginning of the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines - how she reads them - are listening as if they were an inner monologue or a story they didn't. Mantegna accelerates with the arrival of things. <br /> <br /> The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be. I was expecting to split the ring-ding-ding lines that roll the tongue, but they are not. Everything sounds more read than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this movie and relaxed, but if not, maybe he should let others control his words. They are too valuable to them here and they lose their rhythmic jazz quality. What is more strange is that the film does not look or feel the game. The camera is a very cinema. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it seemed too much like a filmed theater, but in this movie the participants were not only achieved but relaxed and free. Everything flowed. <br /> <br /> I don't mind as much as it sounded like movie characters that talk about movie lines - or even play words, but here it sounds like game lines that speak movie (or even a book). It's a weird theater and movie game that just doesn't work. That doesn't mean the movie is bad - it's not, it's often a lot of fun. The best piece is in the middle. <br /> <br /> This is the usual movie stuff: a new boy (in this case a girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) takes part in the poor underworld. How he's tied: he's a psychiatrist and one of his patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help her through her gambling load, so she walks into a playhouse, a potty room where men work in the back room. I admit that setup is quite unlikely. (Did they expect Crouse to come in? Did they expect him to write a check? Was Billy inside of it? One of these questions has definitely been answered.) <br /> <br /> And here the disadvantages start. I found the beginning - the little ones - the most fun. We get both art lessons and Crouse. <br /> <br /> We see the end coming, and then we didn't see the other end, and then the real end I didn't see, but maybe you did. The ball bounces back and forth, and from the last scene of the movie we realize that the second Crouse stepped into the playhouse, he found a real invitation. <br /> <br /> I forgive the tedious opening, the unlikely bits and the strange real-time reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie looks static, stick with it. After half an hour it will really gain momentum. If you want a fun movie, here it is. If you want Mamet, follow "Glengarry Glen Ross" again - James Foley made him better. <br /> <br /> ***
