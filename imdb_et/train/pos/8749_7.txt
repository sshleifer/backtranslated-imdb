I loved the movie, but as everyone said, there were some bits that were not developed enough. I personally thought that girls were very coats of arms before they were put in prison; sure they were supposed to be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt they had no bond with the best friends. For example, in the assembly where they see it, how they held each other is very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Then there are some parts that were very unclear. I think it is quite understandable that the Danish character did not do it, but I can see how it can cause confusion. Why did the camera stay in Manat with a very grim expression after putting his taxi point in his bags? I thought it was something, but it turned out to be something. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the film was great. I cried when Claire Danes accused her; He is also a very good actor. <br /> <br /> I also wanted to see a dwarf Thai inmate throw her ass. Talk about no closing ...
