Sometimes I watch a movie and do I really get that impressive? and yet it is not easy to explain why I liked it. Does this usually apply to rare films? those who can hardly be compared to the rest there. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of those special films. There are many emotions in this movie? and the actor was so good that when I watched the film, I cried and laughed as the story went on. Young Nick Robinson? is a young boy (William) who was evacuated from London because there was air in the Second World War. Mr. Tom, played by John Thaw, is an old man who leaves the village where the evacuated children were sent. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Tom refuses any responsibility - like taking care of heavy boys? but agrees that he will remain without choice. During his stay, Mr. Tom discovers how terrible life has been for William? Aside from his luggage, his mother sent a belt and wrote instructions to his son? don't be afraid to use it. Is this belt entwined in the field? should never be used so cruelly. Mr. Tom offers William a real home and a boy is happy with his new life, going to school, making new friends and discovering hidden talent. Suddenly, in London, a letter to William is mentioned, saying that he does not feel well? And it starts again? only this time it gets much worse? There are many feelings in this movie that you can feel? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope? and many more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another British cinema masterpiece that is comparable to others, such as dear Frankie and Billy Elliot? if it's compare. I've really enjoyed watching it and suggest it. Before completing this review, would I also like to mention Thomas Orange's great performance in the role of Zac? reminded me of a friend from my childhood (:
