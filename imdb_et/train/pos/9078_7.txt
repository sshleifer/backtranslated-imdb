In general, the plot was much better than I expected. The joke was sometimes a bit annoying and slanting; however, this episode had enough real smiles to make up for it. My biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown on trailers. Especially Spade wasn't in the best of the previous promotions, but his character is pretty good in the pilot. There's enough eye-candy to please almost everyone and all regular characters seem to be the task ahead. Now that writers can just live what they have started.
