Ladies Man laughs loudly with funny, very versatile pain and has very stupid but great scenes (including a more fun love song ever written). <br /> <br /> Ferrell is his usual quality with a great side role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows is surprisingly playing an idiot and has written some of the funniest lines you can find in any comedy. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth buying when viewed every 6 months, bringing with it a hard laugh when you first walked around. <br /> <br /> I am thinking that at the time of writing, it was a small 4.7 / 10 and I invite you to vote! <br /> <br /> And I remember kids - "There's more movement in the ocean"
