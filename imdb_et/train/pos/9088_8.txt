When it comes to the Hollywood hotel, we could talk about one of three things: the real hotel, the radio program and the movie that was partly inspired by the first two. Dick Powell was a Hollywood hotel program on the CBS radio network, where Louella Parsons died out of a week's scoop. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons made their debut at the Hollywood Hotel Program in 1934, so in 1937 it was a fair part of the radio audience. Powell hosted, sang and caught Louella and her movie star with the guests. With the power he had in the column, he was able to go to different stars and combine something from his latest films. <br /> <br /> Then, the American Radio Artists' Federation stepped in and demanded that he pay the wages and win the case. It completed the Hollywood Hotel Program in 1938. Of course, both Powell and Louella went to other radio stations. The whole story is covered with Tony Thomas' The Dick Powell Movies. But before pulling the plug, this film came out of the Powell home studio, Warner Brothers, inspired by the radio program. Powell plays singer / saxophonist with Benny Goodman band who signed the Hollywood contract. But when he arrives in Hollywood, he meets himself with the actor of the egotist film star Lola Lane, the double real life sister of Rosemary Lane and Alani Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called, the Civil War is an epic that he does with Lola Lane, that is Powell's voice they use. Then Mowbray develops Lina Lamont's problem when asked for the Hollywood hotel radio broadcasts from the Hollywood Hotel. This is tizzy in the studio. Suppose the problem does not solve the way he sings in the rain, but Powell's head Ted Healy proves inventive. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer offer a really good score for the film. The big hit song starts as soon as Benny Goodman's band sings with Johnnie Davis, Hollywood Hooray. But my favorite is singing Powell and Rosemary Lane. Just listening to Johnny Mercer's lyrics about Ginger Rogers who run Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without his fan, this is a summary of American popular culture in the thirties. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley is doing choreography here and while the film is not hidden, the imaginary things his previous work with Warner Brothers has done are well staged. The big moment of Berkeley is the car where Powell and Healy are forced to work. The number starts with Benny Goodman, who is forwarding the Hollywood hotel, making Let That Be A Lesson for you and then Powell, Lane and all over the place to join the song with the excitement of owner Edgar Kennedy. And you know what Edgar Kennedy can expect. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman can show why he was named King Of Swing when his band consisted of drummer Gene Krupa and xylophone Lionel Hampton. It was with Frances Langford's song. And perhaps the last surviving member of the group was a companion who had a small radio transmitter. He died in 2004, but not before he became the 40th President of the United States. Ronald Reagan has always credited Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as two men at Warner Brothers, who were the most helpful to an enthusiastic young player who wanted to make his mark. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood Hotel is one of the most enjoyable and fun movies, dated but charming.
