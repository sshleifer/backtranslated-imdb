I've seen many PPVs before, but it's the most interesting, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. DVDs are worth it because they give a different insight into how the wrestlers work after the show (for example, chris benoit interview / edge interview), some glimpse into the Monday night wars, the first place in the title of the winning tag in Hogan, and some advertising. There is also a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Tag Team Table Match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 It was a very intense game to start the show. Not too much keeps and just pure raw physicality. Spike is able to play in his tables and Guerro and Benoit gave the mat a good clean wrestling skills. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight Championship: Jamie Noble w / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd didn't care about the wrestler and didn't care until Kidman did the shooting star. Usually, people expect a much larger flight at cruise weight games, but it was very small. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit her finisher, nobody cared or knew it (it can be said due to the lack of camera blinking). However, the end was fast. <br /> <br /> WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I've never really liked wrestling as a wrestler, he has no intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but he couldn't really show off his high flight, though he still made good stories and added that he needed a quick game. It ended quickly, which was suitable for this game. <br /> <br /> 4. John Price v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny, looking back at Price's first PPV, how he used to act, how he dressed and how he used to see it (see his interview, it's pretty funny). It was a good intense game with Price, showing a selection of a nice variety, suplex, counter and some antenna. Jericho was sub-par, but definitely helped Price start his career. The price won. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontenital Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good game. Both wrestler styles really fit the screen, Brocks' pure power and raw energy compared to the full range and speed of RVD skills. RVD looked good in this game (better than his later races at the edge and the price) and the whole game was fast. The final result worked great because it still retained Brock's unbeatable stripe, giving RVD his own desserts in his home country. <br /> <br /> 6. No Disqualification Test: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked some intensity as an RVD match, but still a good follow-up. Although it started slowly (which is always in a big show), Booker T was impressive and made the sick move around the table. Finisher was fantastic, the end ended with a lot of irritation and a big move up for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE tag team championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance Storm 5/10 This was a mediocre match. Hogan comes out as usual to have a huge pop, but his various moves lack that intensity and energy. Then again, Christians do not have the greatest athletic abilities. It ended at the best of average, but it was OK for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for Unquestionable Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Just a year's match. This is by far the best triple threat I've ever seen. It was diminishing, many finishers, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could predict who would come out of it. If you buy this DVD, I would buy it strictly for this game. (Ends? Look at yourself!) <br /> <br /> Generally it was a solid PPV with many additional benefits to keep you going again and again. Although it's hard to find (I usually have to pay more for this DVD than usual), it's definitely worth your money.
