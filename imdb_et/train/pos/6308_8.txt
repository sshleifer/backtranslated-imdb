Foolish, fun, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of sub-out-out team with "experienced" crook raise themselves out of their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the screw factor. <br /> <br /> It's good that George Clooney is really funny about making a difference. Casting is perfect and working standards are very high. Although it can be said that the topic of a looted crew is not new, I think this film deals with it in an interesting and unique way. Enough to make it look like before. <br /> <br /> Very well made boys.
