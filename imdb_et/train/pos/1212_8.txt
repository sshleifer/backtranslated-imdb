Care Bears Movie 2: The new generation is not a bad film at all. Actually, I like it very much. Yes, I testify that the dialogue is funny and the story has been sparse from time to time. But Darkheart, though very dark, is convincing enough to shave off, and Hadley Kay did a great job. Speaking of the voice, it was great, nothing wrong. The animation is colorful and some visual images were especially breathtaking at first. The songs and the score are lovely, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been their two personal favorites. The bears I like are divine, and the kids are well done. And the end is a real tear. All in all, a fun harmless child. 8/10 Bethany Cox
