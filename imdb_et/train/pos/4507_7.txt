I was really stunned, how many films that are over 60 years old can impress me. It is almost two hours long, with no letters, no subtitles, but still an interesting and exciting look. What impressed most of the film's realism. You could almost feel the ice in the cold because you saw the storms are real. This is the relief of the CGI world like our day. I was wondering how much work it should be for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Now, who wants to talk about Titanic? This is a great movie with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how big and realistic movies can be when they are focused only on realism instead of visual effects.
