I laughed a lot while watching it. It's a fun short fun musical piece and a lot of fun. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds a sense of humor. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last it seems to flow great. There's Max, who has probably led a terrible life. And there is Edward who's not sure what kind of life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's crazy boss. Tom has a short role but a memorable one. Highly recommended for anyone who loves foolish humor. And it's now online, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all Jason cartoons and can't wait to see what he's coming out next.
