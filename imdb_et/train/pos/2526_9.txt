It's awesome! In Nature mode, you are going from the punk to the pro. You need to complete goals that include skating, driving and walking. You create your skater and give it a name, and you get it foolish or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he rob himself and gets you out of the skateboard team (you can choose a team that is on) and then start your team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan and even II School (not part of the story mode though) from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skates like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. Create your own goals like SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can create a goal for the pedestrian and write what they are talking about. If you get bored, you can do it in a premade park. The only thing I didn't like about this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive cars. 9/10
