I wasn't quite sure if it was just one of those idiot night soap operas that seems to be the main time, but as it turns out, it's a pretty good show (not thanks to talented casting). Four female friends from different backgrounds meet and share their love weekly. An hour-long program follows each of them separately through its often screwed guests to find love, and it does it without boring or trimming. Sharon Small's "Trudi" is a housewife (supposedly widow after September 11) who gets a little preaching and annoying with her friends (who tend to be a little relaxed and more creative). It's nice to see a little back to t.v. because he was a great inspector in Lynley's mystery. Chick can act. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, attorney) is perhaps the most damaged, but still very sympathetic to women, because she wrestles with her kind-hearted, self-absorbing husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly "Spooks") of her desire to have a child with her regardless needs. The last two members are effervescent Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with someone and everyone, gender is not specific, and Katie (Sarah Parrish) is a lovely doctor who communicates with a patient AND her son has sent her career and love life out of control. Saying this, I'm now hooked and I hope the BBC will continue to launch this series because it's good, it's different and it's great cast.
