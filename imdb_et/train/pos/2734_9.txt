Just one of the ten best films of the 20th century. Cold Blood is excellent in terms of simplicity and realism of storytelling and excellent riveting. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake walks with the movie. The story seems to have been presented almost entirely from Perry's point of view, even though Dick is a pair leader and planner. The viewer realizes that Dick is more unstable, immature, and generally feeling that Perry wouldn't be drawn into this nightmare, but Dick and his need to be someone and draw a big score. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, with a special focus on accuracy, In Cold Blood is a western story of a murky and senseless murder of the Kansas family that is a cold, windy night because Dick has bought outdated rural myths about wealthy farmers safe full of cash in your home. As a "prosecutor" (a sign not given in the script), Will Geer plays so skillfully that their life is only bought for $ 10. Director Richard Brooks wisely decides that we will not share the details of the murder before the end of the movie, before we know that this has happened and we look at the life of Dick and Perry slowly because they try to escape not only being detained by law enforcement authorities, but also Perry own growing sense of impending punishment. He repeatedly remarks: "No one can get away with such a thing." Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel a convincing guilt over his crime, but an irritation at Perry. Indeed, after they have been caught, Dick first breaks, and suddenly crumbles when finally exposed to incontrovertible evidence that puts these two men at the scene of the crime. I felt a bit sorry for Perry from the beginning of the movie and more - as the events progressed, but I was playing Dick. <br /> <br /> The movie genius is an interesting way to play the story. We do not believe for a moment that we look at the actors who represent the symbols, but look at the actual participants and the events that took place. The story is uneven, the tear, the runtime that is just over two hours, seems a few minutes. <br /> <br /> For those who are interested in such things, I noticed a couple. "In Cold Blood" The pages listed on the IMDb page are incorrect or exaggerated. Like the "reverse" process, at the beginning of the movie, like Dick and Perry, they travel across the bridge to Kansas. First of all, it is not a process when the camera is actually on the back and the picture you see outside the windshield of the car is real. The big truck on the left side of Dick's Pontiac creates an optical illusion that they are going back because it is driving at higher speeds, but a closer examination reveals that they are really moving on and that is the real movie. from a moving vehicle. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, this is one of the tenth decades of the 20th century cinema, which is not recommended for very young people because of the language of the course and the implicit and supposed violence (the actual modern film in your facial studies would not be used), but thoroughly great movie.
