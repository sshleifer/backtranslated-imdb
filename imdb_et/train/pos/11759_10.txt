The Best of Times is one of the biggest sleepers of all time. Setting up does not charge your patience, development is stable, many interrelated relationships are loved, gags and bits are all working and all are funny. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell, who plays Reno Hightower, puts his best performances and Robin Williams, who plays Jack Dundee, is sure, as he used to be. There are also many great supporters cast. Jack's wife is the daughter of Jack Palance, who is cute, as is Reno's wife, a big comedian. I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie, how many times I enjoyed it, and how often I wanted more people to see it.
