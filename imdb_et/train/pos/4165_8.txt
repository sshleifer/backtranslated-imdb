No, this cheerful 70-year-old TV fear clinker is not deadly for a demonically acquired dessert cake. Nonetheless, this extraordinarily terrible but undoubtedly amusing and therefore enjoyable waste of cathodic radiation reaches the top of an astounding absolute, incessant stupidity and frightening, which is quite tasty in such a condemnable-just-awesome way. Richard Crenna, who looks at the haggard and maybe inebriated, and Yvette Mimieux, acting as he never missed the brutal rape he suffered under "Jackson County Jail", slowly depicts a nice and respectful suburban couple whose peculiarity A boring, sleepy little town exists as a ripped asunder as the cute German Shepard they take as a family pet proves to be some ancient deadly evil spirit. Pretty soon, Mimieux and his two cutesy children, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (Disney's "Witch Mountain" pictures), worship the crude figure of an unpleasant, ugly dog ​​unit. Boy, does that sound really frightening and disturbing? Well, scary and disruptive this ridiculously ridiculous slip certainly is not, but it is definitely funny, thanks to Curtis ("night rise") Harrington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoonist (not so special) effects, almost painfully dirty nervous plot and game that fights boldly absurdly logical (besides the leaders, Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong appear briefly as members of Satanic culture and Victor Jory has a nice firefighter as a useful Native American shaman). Favorite Scene: The malicious Mephestophelion-mutt puts a spider on Crennes, forcing him to put him in a virtually spinning lawnmower. Though fans of a dead end film can keep their nose at this perfect smell, which is really a smelly schlock, dedicated TV trash lovers should have this fun-robbing offspring who are equal to Alpo.
