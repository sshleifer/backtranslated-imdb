It was a very daring film for this day. It can even be described as the soft core of the silent era. It was talkative, but the dialogue was very limited and German. One doesn't need it anyway. <br /> <br /> Young (19) Hedy Lamarr got into an obsessive obsessive (stereotype) marriage in Germany and in a short time, probably never full, she returns to her father's home. <br /> <br /> Famous and funny scene, she decides to go in the morning when her horse is on another horse. Then he is forced to run across the field, chasing it because he left his clothes on the horse. The engineer is looking for his horse and returns his clothes - at a glance. <br /> <br /> They sit for a while and in the zen moment he will present him with a flower with a bee above. Then she thinks back to her honeymoon and her husband and insect activities. He knows this man is different. <br /> <br /> She returns home and finally looks for our young man and finds that he was forbidden by ecstasy. You can use your imagination here, but his head will disappear from the view and we will see his twist with joy. Since she has never dressed, you can imagine ... Certainly, the respect of the director Gustav Machat√Ω for women and shock for 1933 audiences. <br /> <br /> The only thing that marches this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt and the strange ending.
