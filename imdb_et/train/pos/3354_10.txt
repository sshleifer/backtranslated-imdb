This movie is finally on DVD in Italy (fully restored). I have seen this film so many times and I find it even today (2003) when Italy is again suffering from a certain brainwash dictatorship (or from the US on this issue). I'm glad that this movie has Mastroian's close proximity to those who can sing; maybe they can teach Sophia Lorens about the world how to be strong and fight to be recognized as people. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: As most of the people here have already mentioned, acting is wonderful, but the sound background is amazing. I have to assume that nothing is lost if you do not understand Italian, but I can assure you that playing the art of masculinity, distorting reality in this local local Hitler's visit to Rome can really be the way to tremble! <br /> <br /> Masterpiece! <br /> <br />
