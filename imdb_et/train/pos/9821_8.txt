I saw this movie in real movies (which made me skeptical), but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing plot twist or breathtaking dialogue (which is little), but because, in fact, regardless of what people say, I thought the film was accurate when portraying pregnant teens. <br /> <br /> Dawson's Creek, they are not graceful, cool funny characters who are sucking through sexuality and are easily aware. They are children and they act like children. They are blunt, uncomfortable and annoyingly confused with everything. Yes, it can be casual and they could just be bad actors, but I don't think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (if he doesn't want to be cool) a very credible force and I loved him for that. Patricia Arquette is bright and tedious, but she was pregnant and teens? The combination of these two is not just your lavender pillow. The plot was very predictable and what then? I believed them, his stress and inability to cope - his courageous but somewhat false attempts to bring them closer. I think no one else was really annoying and incredible, but they were not. This reflects the surreality of the situation that it sits in the classroom and walks with the kids on campus. I felt angry at it, I felt angry that she was such a child and accused her. I felt it all. <br /> <br /> Finally, I loved it and would recommend it. <br /> <br /> Watch this scene where Dermot Mulroney runs disastrous meetings - career opportunities.
