It's something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup and a few Irish documentaries are inside. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president, who uses the literacy of his power for his people and encourages them to read the Constitution, is widely used by private media as a dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc., without affecting national governments (such as by listening to them through bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods)). Oh, and they're still saying they're naturally suppressed. <br /> <br /> See how the media speaks about their role in the client's coup after they attacked the government by using rouge (how much can you get?). <br /> <br /> And see how the Venezuelan people go to the palace, holding the Constitution and reinstalling their elected government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it really happened against the US. The documentary is a historical masterpiece made from the center of action, an acute and completely embarrassing coup for the main supporters: Good, democratic, loving, benevolent US (who still directs large sums of money to Chavez's political opponents)) <br /> <br /> very fun and exciting. 10 points.
