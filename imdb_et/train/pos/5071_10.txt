I saw this movie in Hallmark and thought it was wonderful, especially since it's based on a real person. Pierce Brosnan was very good as a lonely English man who took the personality of the Gray Owl half-life. Photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film made me do more research on the character Archie Belaney is known as Gray Owl. I want to read her as much as possible. At that time, Richard Attenborough didn't know it. But I'm not surprised. I like all of her movies, whether she's acting or running. I gave her the highest rating. But I would have liked to have seen more movies about why he took this personality because it showed only the two aunts who lifted him up and his room in his house. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong with this movie if you're like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing the unpleasant language and creating special effects every few minutes.
