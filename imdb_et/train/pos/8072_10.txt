Excellent and unforgettable, amazingly atmospheric and perfectly functioning. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand which people create this masterpiece and give the voting rights 8 (and nine)! <Br /> <br /> It is John Ford's biggest film with the grapes of anger. I'd say Long Voyage Home is next, though pretty back. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10.
