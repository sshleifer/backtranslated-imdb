Such a delightful movie! Very heart warming. You can't fall in love with Gigi's love. She is divine as a child and grows into a sensitive artist. The whole movie comes up around him. He lives in a wonderful world? living the whole life? curiosity, desire and expectations. There is an older brother who is trying to steal his glory, but there really is a shadow over his life. The father is very stereotyped in Italy and so is the mother. Did I want my dad to come back with my mom in recent events? and let them cry and laugh. I would also like to have at least redeemed my older brother. His personality seems to be completely trashed. Passion and terrible? this is the key to life. And looking at the camera? focusing on small details and enjoyment of delicate life details.
