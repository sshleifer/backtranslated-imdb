If I didn't read Nabokov and knew nothing about chess, I can only look at "Luzhin's defense" as a movie. <br /> <br /> It really works as one of my favorite music. The tab is alive like tough competition much more than to say: "Finding Bobby Fischer", showing how hard mental work can be, requiring thinking, preparation, endurance and planning. I especially liked the special effects of chessboard on alternative games. <br /> <br /> Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris ("Antonia"), Emily Watson gradually strengthens John Turturro with his one-of-a-kind transformative relationships with a mysteriously intense chess genius. <br /> <br /> The Italian and Hungarian settings are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 27/21/2001)
