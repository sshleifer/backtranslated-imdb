I saw it for the first time, when they showed it around Easter 1993/4 and didn't think about it anymore, then I bought it on DVD last summer when I went to Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and enjoyed it now I am older. It's a good movie, but it's not the classic movie like music sound, West Side Story, Ozz Wizard, etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. There were some disturbing scenes like Katie, a little girl Joe Pesci played with gangster Frankie Lideo. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song on the film was Smooth Criminal. I think it was, in my opinion, better than Thriller.
