Red Eye is an exciting film by Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven is a story of a regular hotel worker Lisa. After a grandmother's funeral, she decides to take a red-eye flight. While waiting, he will meet the man named Jack Rippner (how is it?) And they will become friends. Ironically, both sit on this plane next to each other. Then this horror begins. This movie is exciting and for the weak hearted people who do not like the exciting / horror film, it says well that it is possible that they can pee pee. This is a great example of bone shaking. Wes Craven did the movie well. She chose the right actors like Rachel McAdams, an intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is careful about everything she's doing in the movie. Cillian Murphy, a scary and terrible actor who can act breathtakingly on his bones, which is a bad sign of this film, and his face can really expand his eyes. Wes Craven did a great job and I hope she will do more of these movies.
