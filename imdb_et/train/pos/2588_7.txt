Psychokinetic powers (yes, really) Brothers are not only for Debra Winger's beliefs, but really for the mystery of their childhood, which left them in conflict with their authority. <br /> <br /> There is a surreal touch (a firefighter that acts like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very similar to that used in London for every big Wolf song that they could get, but with fire ~ and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) by putting his own trailer on Rockin 'until' He ' is a lady - priceless price;) <br /> <br /> The best thing missing from the quotation section btw ~ 'If you have a clown, you will never go back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered it from DVD to USA) and if the comments written by people who would be more legitimate with blonde 3, don't put you out ~ try :)
