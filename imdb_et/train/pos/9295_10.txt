It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments with this star. I laughed through the whole picture, just like my whole family. The film clearly defined itself as an old-time gangster comedy - players were hysterical - I bet they had this good old time. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were excellent - and how these Everly sisters, both Falco and all divine music. Rob Reiner made a ridiculous limo driver and Gabriel Byrne a ridiculous neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the character of Sleepy Joe and the references of the whole graveyard and graveyard. Paul Anka was his usual entertainer, as Byrne decided to scare away for the fear of running when he decided to take his "My Way" greeting home to Vick. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a comic respect for Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I am also of the opinion that someone who has no age should not even think about imitating the actions of this film - this is a joke - not a scary "gangsta" movie. Cars and clothing were impressive, as did the "Vic's Place" decorative. <br /> <br /> Really, I think "Mad Dog Time" is a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, TV crime dramas, and chat rooms. I recommend the video for family entertainment.
