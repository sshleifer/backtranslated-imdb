RKO studios decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, one of the biggest budget efforts to receive cash. They succeeded somewhat. Many people forget that, in addition to Nick Charles, Bill Powell also played a role in some of Philo Vance's films. So he was pretty good by then. Doctor Bradford does not do as much liquid lunch as Nick Charles, but the main blas√© Nick is still there. One difference is that even though Nick Charles married the heir, Bradford is a doctor. It helps to discover her and in fact in this movie. <br /> <br /> He has two murders to be resolved. Jockey falls from a horse that arrives at a great competition homestretch and dies for no apparent reason. The trainer suspects that something is going on, but he has been hit by the more conventional ball method. This is after he comes to help Bill Powell. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy had a more stable effect on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays it more because of dizziness than Loy. But it works here and he and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> Every dependable James Gleason is in the role of Police Commissioner Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. They all needed Asta here and sometimes Eric Blore, because Powell's butcher was an essay on that part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur were signed in this studio, we could have seen the whole Bradford movie.
