Don't want to give anything here *, I would just say that this technically excellent, flawlessly functioning and resurrecting little flic will give the reward a great hour and a half of entertainment: it will entertain, surprise, maybe embarrassing from time to time, and will almost certainly pull your heartbeat from time to time, because it approaches inevitable, but not obvious, ending without clich√©s or unpredictably in some way. Definitely recommended. <br /> <br /> The previous user commentary gives 8 out of 10 film and 10 10 outstanding performances by Branago and Bonham-Carter - I totally agree.
