Although the Lang version is more famous, Borzage's work is not interesting, far from it: its "heavenly" sequences are even better. The train's metaphor (perhaps borrowed from the end of the Abel Gance table) is finally more convincing than the "upward" heavenly world. <br /> <br /> Borzage's tenderness towards his characters shows Marie's character and love outside the grave as one of his favorite objects (the end of the "three comrades"). The park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in Marie's poor house. I don't think the kits are so big cheeses that they are stylized to blame. The Mess is Almost a Sci-fi Feeling Borzage will never forget his social concerns: On a heavenly train that goes up, Rich cannot enrich with a riffraff but as a "chief judge" says "there is no more difference here". <br /> <br /> Not a great job for Borzage (not even Lang's version), but to find out if you're interested in a great director's career.
