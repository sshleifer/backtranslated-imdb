Another powerful chick flick. This time it turns around Diana Gusman, who is always in school fighting. Instead of being expelled, he takes his anger away, into a boxing ring. She trains as a boxer and meets African and Adrian and falls in love with her. This film has a powerful message about taking your dreams and accompanying them, even if no one believes you (in this case, his father does not believe him). This alone makes the price of the movie worthwhile. enjoy
