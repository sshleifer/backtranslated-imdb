So I consider myself to be a pretty big anime scene. <br /> <br /> This exhibition would recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> Quite probably the most original series, it's almost everything I wanted. So talked about the uncompromising love of the side story, which can NOT be tolerated, very blatant comedy, as well as very well-assembled voice (both Japanese and American). <br /> <br /> Not that terribly funny side, it's just an anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I have noticed, this is "love or hate," the very few people I saw in this series will be uncomfortable for it. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> / p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </p> <p> </p> I'm ready to assure you that you enjoy it.
