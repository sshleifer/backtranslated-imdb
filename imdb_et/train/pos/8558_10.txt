Always enjoy the great performance of Drew Barrymore and his great performance in this movie, where he plays a very sophisticated youth, (Holly Gooding), "Skipped Parts", 2000, who leaves New York and travels to California and shares an apartment with the upcoming writer George Newbern (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", 96. Holly is going to have many strange things going on and she's trying to find her brother in a mental institution after her father's killing. When you look close enough, you actually see Drew Barrymore's mother in real life as her mother sees in this picture. If it wasn't for the good work of Drew Barrymore and George Newberg, this movie should only be seen at Halloween night! But it is definitely surprises END !!!!
