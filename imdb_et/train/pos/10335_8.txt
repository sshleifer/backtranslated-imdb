The only reason I give this movie is 8 out of 10 because I think there are a few movies that are perfect. This little B picture is a nice story, well-said. Alexander Knox has always been interested in me, but has seen him in very few films. Here he plays a sad little man, Wilhelm Grimmit, who becomes a monster. She puts everything and everything without losing her dream. Play is one of the coolest shows I've ever seen. After World War II, the Nazis or other criminals present in the films are partly Oscars. I imagine that because it was done during the war, the Academy knew that such a performance would be honored like respect for evil. But Knox puts this kind of presentation - the man so bitter and innocent, that he doesn't think anything else is to suffer. I still can't get it over. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays silver or a social butterfly, is opposed to the type, probably the best I have ever seen. Maybe not the Oscar, but the best career. Nothing against him; I've enjoyed him in these "small" roles he often played. But here he proves that he is performing the task of a more difficult drama. <br /> <br /> If you like human drama stories or stories about people who suffered from the Nazis, I would recommend a very little movie.
