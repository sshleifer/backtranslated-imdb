This video is so funny, it makes Eddie Murphy everything that seems very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just shows you how good it really is). Frankly, I don't think I've ever laughed as much as it is, naked and rarely seen Bargearse. This show is amazing, although it has to be said that it is definitely filled with a word that starts with F, which is four letters (plus an extended version that starts with M) but it didn't bother me. See this, the most fun thing I've seen and probably the most fun.
