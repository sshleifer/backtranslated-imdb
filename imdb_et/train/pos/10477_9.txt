Being in between comedy and drama is one of the hardest things in the cinema. How do you laugh at the misery of other people and not feel bad when it goes too long? <br /> <br /> This surprising little pearl of the movie offers a great big smile, a beautiful landscape and a pretty good buzz. I especially like the notion that the trick of history made alcohol legal because white Europeans liked it, and marijuana illegal, because "these other races" used it ... no doubt true and reveals the racial side of marijuana laws that are publicly flourished by the population worldwide . <br /> <br /> Extraordinary "DVD Extra" comment ... two of them actually ... run through the movie with both actors and writers. I saw things I was sure they weren't in the first movie, but then I realized how easy it was to leave a lot of first-class comedy in the first race. What a hoot! Don't miss it! 9/10 stars
