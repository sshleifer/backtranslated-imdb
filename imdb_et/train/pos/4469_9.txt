Typically, in the 1940s, musicals had a fixed formula - and when you learned movies, you know what I am talking about - with some running length, very "expressive" performances that were big on the surface but never reached real personalities. characters, etc. <br /> <br /> This one is different - and the light years are better, and it's worth calling the best picture of the year - 1945 (though they didn't have the chance to win the last winner - the lost weekend). <br Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of her career - yes I know "America in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". It's different. He really gets into his "sea wolf" thinking (at first) that "picking up any girl while on holiday" is nothing more than a smell. And if you had a "story" to get him - be it - up to. Sounds like a Music Man when he gets "his foot to the door". The ultimate fun of the movie is mainly due to the attempt of her and her new ball (Sinatra) to make a "story" for "getting a girl" that she really and unexpectedly falls in love. You have to watch a movie to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a lot of other great movie elements, a classic friend story, nostalgia for the time when the Second World War was almost over (war ended about a month after the movie was released), the notion that the man who always laughed, you can find out that he is really a big person, big songs, and probably some other elements of classical film making that I can't think of right now. <br /> <br /> Why not 10? Nearly near - almost 2 1/2 hours will seem a bit long. There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does, which had been felt in 1945, but it seems dated and seems to just add minutes. But in general it is a winner at every level.
