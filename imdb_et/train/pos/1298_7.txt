The real anomaly in French cinema, this desperate job is not the same in modern production. One should rather look at Louis Malle's "le feu follet" (1963) (fire) to find something that is not entirely different from Harel's aspiration. Art and cynical, having lost all his illusions, are not a hero, a computer scientist, more no reason to live.Secondly no one.Small in the human race that he lives his life as a kind of entomologist, learning from his colleagues.One of them strives for his attention: Tisser-JosÃ© Garcia plays the most humiliating part of the decade. Then Tisserand will be some sort of prey: all his pessimism rubs the poor man out of it. The club manages strange relationships: the hero tells his victim that his life is always unfulfilled when he is not. Well, now the film takes a more traditional course (Clouzot's misanthropy maybe), but just for a while. > <br /> The form is weird wo-voices from the commentary, one to the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero", one to the above-mentioned hero. The story is now in Paris, now in Rouen, Guy de Maupassand. his contraction, the hero, says that the writer's madness was only his resentment against Man, and he draws a parallel between his despair and the Maupassand one. <br /> <br /> This depressing film is only suitable for an informed audience. For very short excerpts of X-rated movies, but since you can watch it, you can feel at landfills.
