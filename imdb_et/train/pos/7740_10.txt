It is rare for someone to experience the film so flawlessly. It's really one of the best, most closely structured movies I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in a number of ways that are related to each of the three main features. The film worships the inner networks of motivation and the double crosses that lay you down and refuse to let go. Add to that, the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye is as mobile as all that is ever dedicated to celluloid and you have the components of the perfect movie. It reveals the romance of films such as Titanic, which is their trite. If you are looking for a movie you want to watch, this is not the case. You have to make this movie for yourself. You can't get out of the chat room and get out of there. This film requires your attention. Keep it with respect, what you deserve, and get a lot out of it. If you don't think "Titanic" is the biggest movie ever.
