Pickup South Street (1953), led by filmmaker Samuel Fuller, includes stunning, which creates a double complication. Subway rider Candy (Susan Peters) hitting Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark dipped in Sinatra tones). He doesn't know he's wearing a valuable microfilm; McCoy is not aware of this. Both are not aware of the observation of two federal agents. So the grift begins with some knowledge. Candy is double reviewed (jump and police) and thus double naive; Skip, overconfident petty thief, is only aware of being involved in federal agents; all known covers are finally helpless. They cannot stop the spread of government secrets or communism.
