David Webb Peoples will meet Paul Anderson ... if it looks weird, you are right because it is. <br /> <br /> Peoples are known for their scripts, which have a moral effect on what is right and wrong, the value of life, and so on. ... He covered these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and in almost all of his scenarios there is something like that. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful film was a violent thriller. Not surprisingly, it's all his other movies! And here's a violent thriller with moral consequences. <br /> <br /> The Script for the Nations is quite obvious on the first half of the movie. Soldiers trained since birth taught to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better ones, genetically modified soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, left on the planet and left dead. There he has to deal with a group of refugees, some want others to hate him and there is an interesting drama here. HOW TO ... <br /> <br /> The balls are going to run when new soldiers ride to the planet for military exercise and try to kill all people. Big, violent, loud activities and the Peter's script will become Anderson's main act. It's hard to believe that the script was originally written, but the end product is better than I expected. Somewhat entertaining, though not very, thoughtful and exciting, when the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> R: A lot of violence
