Gosha's last big film from the 1960s. A strong stylist who has a great idea for his films, Gosha joined Shintaro Katsu (Zatoich's fame) to produce this frightening accusation against meaningless national loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (Heavenly Judgment) is the word loyalists worship emperor as murdering enemies or "raids". Ksu plays his character against a simple-minded manipulative politician, all for patriotic pride. Anyone who doubts a politician is labeled "traitor" and becomes a murder card. <br /> <br /> One of the best photos ever made, many pictures are incredible form, color and light compositions. Fighting scenes are frequent and very bloody and cruel. Blood is part of the color palette that Gosha uses for his pictures. Gorgeous and disturbing. Although it is easy to follow a personal story, the historical background is difficult, and while the historical lesson in Japan at that time would be very useful, you can record it without a movie. The few drawbacks of the movie are the piece of music, the length, and the chance to chew on the random landscape. He has a drunken scene that is at the top of the film, but in fact it is a very accurate image to drink. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest chambara movies.
