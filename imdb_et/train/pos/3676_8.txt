Together with me, I took my 19-year-old daughter to see this interesting training in film making. I always find it interesting to get views and opinions from different generations, especially when I'm so cynical. It is good if someone who has not yet reached the end of each film has come to the minds of dreams. I'm happy to say that we both really enjoyed it and considered it a successful mother / daughter. Far, far better than seeing some brain dead "chick flick" I collect, what should we enjoy by demographic data? <br /> <br /> Eighteen directors were asked to write about every Paris arrondissement that I haven't been to for 20 years. But I wish I had. They are loosely connected by combining shots and representing different love approaches in a city that is considered a popular culture as the world's most romantic capital. Some movies work better than others, but as other reviewers have said, it never goes too far into the kitch. Some are funny, some are sad, some are intriguing, and some are simply puzzling (I will try to point out some deep inner truth in the "Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon" hairdressing salon.) Some are just fun and may not have given too much meaning (like a vampire and a tourist) ). Perhaps my only criticism of the whole film is that it makes Paris too good. It can also be cold, wet, blurry, indifferent and unhappy, or baking hot in the summer and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine who can see the queue for hours to see all the sights. But I'm kidding. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was far from Coen's brothers, filmed at Tuileries Metro Station, starring Steve Buscem, a wholly cast-in-the-box tourist who involuntarily finds himself in the lovers tiff. Absolutely perfect and very, very funny, without Buscem. I also enjoyed the work of two mime artists, which was probably the closest to the cutesy - it is definitely on the kitsch, but it was just right. Rufus Sewell and Emily Mortimer got an overview of the meeting with the tomb of Oscar Wilde, leaving me quite indifferent, and Juliette Binoche tried to make me very, very uncomfortable with the death of her little son. I thought that both Bob Hoskins / Fanny Ardent and Ben Gazzara / Gena Rowlands fell slightly flat, but Maggie Gyllenhaal was good (is he in the corner junkies? I watched Sherry Baby last week.) <br /> < br /> But I felt that two pieces of "social justice" (as a better way to do it) worked very well. That's why I am thinking first of all of a film about a young mother who leaves her child in care to go and watch someone else's baby. And then a film about an African immigrant trying to coexist in indifferent societies, young and struck by the new parameter on the street. Another murder statistics in a world that sees thousands of immigrants every year dying in battle to see a better life. I thought both pieces were very well observed. <br /> <br /> Final movie, 14th Arrondissement, where Margo Martindale plays a postman from Colorado, presenting her first trip to Paris? very badly stressed in french? his night school in french class, moved me. Perfect end, good, intriguing, if not quite big movie. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea, but it works pretty well.
