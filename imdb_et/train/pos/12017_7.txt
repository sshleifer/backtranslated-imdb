"The Last Hard Men" is a typical West for the 70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpa. This one, too, but director Andrew McLaglan is a student of John Ford, and it may be shown in many scenes. The start of the IMO is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the audience travel from civilization to the desert. In the third part there are some illogical mistakes and I complain a little about Charlton Heston. He must play the name of the old former lawyer Sam Burgade, but he is in fantastic physical form. I never felt that he really had problems with climbing a horse or stone. For me, he didn't seem very motivated, as he usually does in most of his epic films. The same applies to the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the sheriff's daughter. Maybe they both had problems with the director or were not happy with their roles. Hershey and Coburn are not showing their best, but they are still good. If the scriptwriter had John Wayne's mind as Sam Burgade? Michael Parks, as a modern sheriff, is also a bit underused in his role. On the other hand, James Coburn is forbidden by Zach Provo. Coburn is a very big villain in this. He is a mischief between manic anger and wickedness. His role and action are the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and shootouts are terrible. Shooting scenes are bloody and violence looks realistic. Zach Provol and his gang had nice and violent scenes. What I miss is a typical western action in the middle of the movie. I would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar. Generally, this is an entertaining west flick. Not a big movie, but above average because it's a great Coburn, a great start and some gory and violent scenes.
