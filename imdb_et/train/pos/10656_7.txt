What a great Barbara Stanwyck movie I happened to see the other night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was done in 1953 and probably for a double bill, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who, along with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker), is driving an isolated fishing spot for a vacation in Mexico. The man falls into the harbor and the only way to save him is when Barbara rides back to a rope back to the garage. <br /> <br /> Although he runs to a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites) and the next is a cat and mouse game, as Barbara tries to get everything in her power to get her back to release her husband. <br /> <br /> The film was so enchanting and such a surprise - I didn't expect such a big movie. But I think I should have understood - does Barbara Stanwyck do anything other than wonderful?
