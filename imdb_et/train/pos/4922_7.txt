I don't know what the viewers of this day are when they put their eyes on Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Certainly he looks like someone else since then, this skull-like face, the flatter nose and the elongated body - even now he's still a confused presence. And what could be more appropriate than its development from those unpleasant New Orleans slums that look like a birdie Blackie will lose the city. I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very cleverly assembled? Black Body Humor, Widmark-Douglas Interaction, Tourist Areas, Battles among Officials Everything is woven into a tightly realistic thriller that is dangerous, unlike other times. Even Widmark's home scenes that put the woman on the Bel Geddes tent are not too distracting. Chair Kazan will definitely show his suitability for managing a studio (Fox) product, no matter how he felt from a commercial point of view. <br /> <br /> As a public health care professional, Widmark is working on a fixed low-key job. But my money is one time Zero Mostel. There was ever a more powerful performer who could be louder or more than a large-scale autumn man (eg Enforcer, 1950). This scene with Mostel, where Palance claims Mostel's shameful wife (Liswood), is a pearl of revenge, because Mostel tries to calm everyone like a little pinball. Too bad he lost so many years in the blacklist. (Interestingly, it was his commissioner Kazan who named him.) <br /> <br /> But colors are not only added to professionals. The locals add both reality and authenticity, especially two Asian police interviews. This whole scene has improvised air as if Kazan had recognized his potential and saw a terrible little scene on the spot. Also, this colorful rental space with all the decks is a pure inspiration. And what are the flea-bitten cafes that go to my nearest Denny. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is still a well-staged, riveting thriller with apocalyptic air that strangely anticipates many of today's mega-hits.
