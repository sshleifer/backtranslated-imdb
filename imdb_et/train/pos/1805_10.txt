I saw this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was 7 years old and I soon remembered. so I looked at it 10 minutes ago and (I may seem like a child because I'm 12 ha) I started to cry, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was mostly sad for Anne-Marie because she said, "I love you Charlie and also:" I miss you Charlie, I just made me cry ha-ha. it must be one of my favorite films all the time, it's just a movie that you should watch. WATCH IT ha-ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but I love this movie, the real classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
