I find this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easy to digest, humor is light and clean, and since erroneous identity is quite common, I find that I expect this film to make this story flesh. It turns out to be very nice. The presence of female lead is admirable; his imagination of an innocent, naive girl who was trying to make a lie in Belarus was very charming. I find Vera dance very well, very well. I find myself pulling my toes as he struggled and flawlessly staged. <br /> <br /> For those who have enough robberies nowadays, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly.
