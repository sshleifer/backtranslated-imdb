Not everyone's movie, but this movie is my top 10. I'm a black comedy lover. What's in the lead is Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London'), then these lines can't be dry. Supporting cast is the almost dead center. Counting small bugs in the film: Ellen Barkin's make-up gave her a face wash; Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor had a couple of Gimme cameos that were not practical, and Michael J. Pollard's screen time was too short. First of all, it was simply unbelievable to cast the egos into a fine script. If you've seen Underworld (a dark crime flick) by Larry Bishop (writer, director), you'll enjoy it. Her next outing (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
