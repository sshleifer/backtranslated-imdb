This movie is my favorite piece of cellulose. There isn't really much here or I want to say here. With the exception of "Watch this movie" and "Enjoy the great work of Daniel and Pascal", who will take you through this nice, funny and heartbreaking story of "spending your eighth day" - your day! Seeing this movie made me seriously think about how I spend my eighth day = my life! Some of us seem to waste valuable time doing things we have to do. Whether it's a pleasant career or simply consuming TV shows and ball games. What we tend to miss is satisfaction with the fact that we are someone else - the difference. Spontaneous and vibrant space and time - now! (on the eighth day) ... At least what I got from the eighth day.
