Quickly connecting scenes in the shelter of hidden people and editing / displaying images and vague, intertwined narratives is a very difficult film. Obviously, a man (Masue Inoue) will take a porter or caretaker in the shelter so that he can be near his imprisoned wife and maybe save him. But she's obviously crazy, helldled on the floor, a lot of free vocabulary of the time and fear, misery and confusion that she has written for the rest of the time. The filmmaker sometimes switches to his point of view, and we see him with vague images of a child being drowned or a drowned child. She tortures something. When the viewer shifts to him or other crazy people, the filmmakers use such objects and things that show us what the mad people see and how they react. And this place is with crazy people, laughs, hides and in one case dances forever at night and day. At one point, the man tries to take his wife out, but the door outside him scares him and runs back to his cell. Gradually, the man slips into a nightmare where he cut off another attempt to steal him, and he kills the doctor and many attendants, and all the time the crazy people laugh and laugh. When he wakes up, he is lightened and picks up the floor. Some pictures of Japanese life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.
