First of all, I would like to explain that Kaakha Kaakha is part of the Tamil prayer and that it has been roughly translated, that is to say "to protect". By contrast, Khakhee refers to the color of police uniforms (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> The Tamil film industry is also quite full of purely commercial ventures, any Rajnikanth or Vijay film would be a testament to this statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is a great movie with a great soundtrack. Definitely very stunning in the last scene, especially love the end (which is definitely unexpected!). Gore is sometimes too much, but it is definitely a great movie!
