Winchester '73 was a film that moved Manni's b-movies into a big league, rescuing James Stewart in the post-war postwar career, casting him into a controversial hero (although since he was a project from Fritz Lang, perhaps Lang deserves it). Both men would go to much darker places - Mann with the very evil Devil's Doorway, which remained on the MGM shelf until Broken Arrow managed to convince them to release them? but a movie about a man who is chasing his brother, because the title rifle is given from person to person along the trail, before it reaches one of the director's beloved mountain attacks, is still a stronger flesh if you expect a system in the studio. Great dialogue, impressive supportive cast ??? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them? and Mann's remarkable visual feeling will raise this bar.
