I love cartoons. They can show things that movies can't do with 'real' participants and the landscape - although the effect of the computer is changing it more and more. They can push satire ('Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). In the "Ice Age" there are good examples of this, for example, when we see the rapids that migrate on the terrain, which are now extinct mammals, talking like old friends. Such scenes are a joy to watch because we know both familiar and strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. Although the Ice Age is not as good as the animated films of all time, it is a very fun movie. Sit back, enjoy deliberate anachronies, love backgrounds and laugh at your belly. <br /> <br /> The story is followed by Manfred, a dirty mammoth, Sid, an idiotic bitch and Diego who is a sabretooth tiger. A human child returns to his tribe - for very different reasons. Of course they have a lot of problems. Throughout the journey, Scrat opens up the most unpleasant rodent in history, who is desperately trying to bury the grave for the winter: glaciers, dead trees, ice caves. His scene is classic. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story that has a very predictable ending and in the middle, which is just a series of funny incidents that have some moments of signing, but some scenes, such as changing diapers or going, are fun, animals are like and looks good. There is also a rather touching moment when mammoth cave paintings appear in front of Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> Not a must-have, but a good fun hour or so. <br /> 7/10
