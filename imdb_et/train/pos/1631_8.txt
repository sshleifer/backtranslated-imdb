This movie is everything. Vision, subtle jokes, games with words and verses. This is a towel group of guys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to win a common enemy. If you look at it more than once, you'll find that you quote it like Animal House (and yes, I also love Animal House). I put 15 of the most fun movies. The Boys' Military Academy Major is paranoid that every child is bad and wants to cause problems (in this film he is right). He is sadistic, reckless, cruel and must be taken away. A group of guys who don't go first will end up with the survival and discovery of the resource only with a mad plan. Mad Magazine could write. Must See - You Love It!
