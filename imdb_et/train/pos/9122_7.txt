Purple Rain is a great film if you're a 40-year-old musician who participated in Prince's music in the 1980s. The story is a much used formula: the growing musical talent must overcome personal and professional barriers to finding your audience and self-esteem. The prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially Purple Rain / I Die 4 U, is worth the movie. He is himself and an actor, on such a powerful stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, Thriller. Former Prince Protégé, Apollonia Kotero, is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with Prince, but his script doesn't let him go far. Morris Day and other supporters provide comic elements.
