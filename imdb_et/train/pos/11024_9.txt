This movie is just great. It's fun from the beginning to the end, you're always around your movie. In my opinion, critics have underestimated this film. <br /> <br /> Sly is perfect for the role of well-trained mountainous Gabe Walker. With him, Michael Rooker has a very good look than Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen him as a cable. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the movie is on a hill with lots of bad guys in it! <br /> <br /> Great movie!
