Creature Comforts in America should have been released from some other network or at least given them the opportunity to fully use episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that American audiences (seemingly) have a sense of humor when it does not contain abduction capabilities, or when it is related to sculptural functions (both sound and smell), it shows that it is a little and far away. One of the main problems was that it was great, it was meant for a rare audience who knew what to expect, but what was seen by the audience and the desktops that had no idea what they were watching. What is sad but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three seasons of this era, even if it was produced directly on DVD. The materials and interactions of the creatures were rich in subcontext and there were other conversations that were waiting under the surface. However, due to political correctness, such conversations only take place in my mind.
