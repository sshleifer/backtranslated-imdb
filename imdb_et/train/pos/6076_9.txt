... or was there an honest Iago who died at the end when he died? <br /> <br /> Loved the way Bard's iambic pentameter just rolled out of Fishburne, with great clarity and emotion. <br /> <br /> And how Branagh made honest Iago feel his own evil ... <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I have often thought that Shakespeare is not film-friendly in nature: It uses words in its thoughts to create images that create a multi-year battle with the camera that only knows what we need to think and feel. All efforts to film Shakespeare should really be celebrated. It's not an easy thing.
