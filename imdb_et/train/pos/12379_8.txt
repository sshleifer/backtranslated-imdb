I was in the old theater of Northern California when that movie came. As good as it is on a DVD, it's big and horrible on the big screen. Although it has been seen, it has been around for 9 years, but it is still one of my favorites of all time. At risk of failure: "They just don't do that!" If in the sixth sense you are puzzled at all, this movie is definitely for you! Great story, incredible number of characters, malicious provision; even the soundtrack has a haunting quality. I suggest you look at it alone. What the brown tile rented alone in 1977 is busy for you (at least 10 times the price today).
