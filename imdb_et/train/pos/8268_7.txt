This is probably the second remake of this movie, filmed before 1911 and 1918. And so much it reminds me of a later movie A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films touch on the imaginable impact resistance that arrives at one of the world's top schools, and both ultimately show shock-resistant slow learning about teamwork and dignity. In this movie, William Haines "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" plays Frances X Bushman. And in a supporting role, Jack Pickford is always remembered as Mary's brother. Of these three, Pickford is the best as a lucky loser who gets Tom's palm - he actually has some good scene and a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the usual clich√©s exist and the film, because it was done so many times before and after, offers a few surprises. But this is a pleasant movie and enjoyable viewing. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN for a better silent college movie - it is more exciting for football scenes and Harold is much more pleasant and likeable than annoying Tom Brown. FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture ever since. Another reason why there is less in BROWN HARVARD is that William Haines played the same and again and again with the same specimen (like WESTPOINT and SMART SET) - and if you've seen these movies, you've seen them all. Well done but definitely NOT original! And since it is just a transformation of his other films, anyone who gives a score of 10 to the movie is strongly advised to see these other movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this little movie was the highest rated movie from IMDb since 1920! Talk Overpriced! There are dozens and dozens of better movies - how this movie got # 1 is someone's guess.
