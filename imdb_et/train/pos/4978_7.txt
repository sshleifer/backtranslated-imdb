Nice Shirely Temple Short. Children's actors who scream their lines seemed normal to that day and time. Maybe you need to see it and not hear it. It is also fun. Due to the age of the film, there are certain aspects of the matter, from a social point of view, that strikes me as both progressive and liberal. I'm not going here, I wouldn't want to spoil it for you, but let you see it yourself and see if you notice these elements. As early as it was easy to see, there was already a magic for the temple. This makes it worth watching when you are a fan of Temple. For others, this is a cool way to kill ten minutes when you wait for your good evening meal to heat the stove.
