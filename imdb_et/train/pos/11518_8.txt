You can do a lot with little money. Blair Witch proved it. This movie supports it. It is no longer than long and complicated. But since John Cleese has Sherlock Holmes, he has managed to have fun even in a budget that couldn't afford a pair of shoes. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as a sincere, worshiping Watson, his twilight and slow-motion foils in Cleese's rapid hardening. If you ever drive over a movie, look at it for a strange laugh or two.
