This film was made in 1948, but it still rings today. Very very funny. It starts with a family who wants to buy a small place in the country and "builds" it there. Anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very pleasant. Excellent cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are wonderful in this movie. This is a classic black-and-white film that reflects the great style of the 40's. Clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the cost of things and these comparisons with today's costs are quite amazing. I can't imagine that no one can fully enjoy this movie. I'm surprised at the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. Real classic.
