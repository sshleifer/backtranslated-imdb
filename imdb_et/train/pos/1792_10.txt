I was delighted to watch this beautiful movie last night, followed by a wonderful addition to the director's question and answer session after watching. I suspect that the first commentator has never died of his parent or anyone very close. I have had many such losses and this movie told me. One of the main topics is how we do not deal with issues / questions / stories with our loved ones before it is too late - before that happens too little. Talk to your loved ones, listen and record your stories, tell people you love them, solve the differences. I loved the message that there were no mistakes. I love the director's image of the relationship between two daughters - as one of the six siblings, it is clear to me that he understood the complexity of these relationships. His filmmaker's history comes loud and clear - what a beautiful film! Casting is outstanding - the movie must not be skipped!
