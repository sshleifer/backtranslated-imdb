This film is outstanding and excellent. Prince's Oscar for music was richly earned (many people don't know he won one). I think this is one of the best movies to watch on a couple of late night DVDs. A big surprise: the prince does a good job and is pretty good at delivering the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at their support. Very cool landmark film.
