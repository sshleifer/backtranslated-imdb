Rod Serling was, of course, a genius, and his wonderful, playful, creative mind remained something from the time he lived, and examples of television at this stage of development. There are no such exhibitions right now, but rather the "Housewife" sluts in the area of ​​Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the merciless humor and funny laughing that nestles our high-tech screens. <br /> <br /> Jack Elam came up with an episode with a working precision and a common madness that I can't help but think that Rod Serling had adapted it around Elami for a long time, even though he was a story beside the streams. This episode ends as usual, but the shock and humor are particularly mixed with "Serlingesque" skill. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
