Merisiga: The devil's experiment is undoubtedly ***** stars at first sight, its raw realistic horrible and disturbing look on the dark side of human nature. This movie gets in the right place, you can think about what? The thing is to satisfy extreme violence and gore fans. This film has some gore, more or less simply torturing women violently. There are really only 3 scenes that could be considered gorees. I'll tell you one thing, though a guinea pig: Devil's Experiment makes hostility to Sesame Street. If you thought Host was crazy about a brutal disruptive torture of torture, you haven't seen that party until you've seen a guinea pig: a fucking experiment. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0- Mermaid: Fucking Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
