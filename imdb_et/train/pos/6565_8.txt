I know the snob of the movie is nervous. But if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride in the B-movie jungle, try "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> Slightly thin occasionally, but with one liner and more than that for more. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to have fun making his role as an ultra evil white slaver. Crawfords noble, Jake Speed. He adds a dimension to the film that only Hurt could be offered. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, although you don't know why they both agree. But both Crawford and Christopher together with a team are just so much fun that when you get over for a while you can find yourself like a boy again in situations and in the spaces they offer. Tasty Karen Kopins does a great job as a girl in distress, more concerned about her rescue motives. <br /> <br /> I have not yet found a movie that is just as fun to get preached, or by dragging a movie, trying too hard. Not every movie needs to be the last "Citizen Kane". And trust me, Wells was the original. So I remember that sometimes movies are fun. There is no social comment or an attempt to influence the public politically. But precisely because we live and live at a time when our hero lives in a celluloid.
