I think this is one of the best examples of Superman on television, as well as one of the most loyal to a certain comic period. <br /> <br /> This series honored both Superman movies and the 70s / 80s and Superman comics series "reboot" from 1986 ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics", " Superman Adventures' etc.). Opening score and titles were mixed based on John Williams' scores of films that were refreshed for a Saturday morning series. Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors to the comic book reboot ("Superman Adventures" writer), was the perfect choice to participate in this animated series. All in all, the series was more mature, still very child friendly. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented as a credible, strong and iconic. His repeated nemesis was Lex Luthor's incarnation of his megalomania / chief executive. The Daily Planet's Lois, Jimmy and Perry were well represented. One of my favorite exhibitions was Wonder Woman, and the story turned around to her homeland on Themyscira Island ("Paradise Island"). Both her design and her mother Hippolyte were in line with the era's similar reboot with the Wonder Woman comic book, and it seemed that she would be able to work out a well-made animated series. <Br / One thing that is hard to believe is that it is not published on DVD / Blu-ray! That's worth it.
