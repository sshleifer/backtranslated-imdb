Possible spoilers: not sure <br /> <br /> While watching Lion King 1 1/2, I was not able to mix feelings with the whole movie. It's definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there's nothing that would give you the same feeling that Lion King did. A story that has not read other comments is how Timon and Pumbaa meet and how they affect events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> Movie. My favorite thing is when they show a pair that raises Simba. But for me, the worst parts are when they show Timon and Pumbaa directly the original events. I can never watch "Life Round" or "Do you feel love tonight" in the same way (I'm fine "I just can't wait to be king"). <br /> The talents of the voices are great. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a wonderful job, just like Matthew Broderick, the man who makes Rafiki and hyena. Even the actor who makes the young Simbat sounded like Jonathon Taylor Thomas for me. But why were they even for the Zazu voice artist? He literally was only 2 lines and neither was very necessary. The additions by Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller add only talents, although you still can't hear Timon's mother's voice and not think of Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that are not compatible with the original, the one who comes to mind when they are proud of the stone at the end. How did they have time for the initial struggle with the hyenas? <br /> <br /> For DVDs, you can't feel that the special features of the 2-disc are particularly inadequate. They could have just commented on disc 1 or some other relationship. I liked the "Who Wants to be the King of Jungle" game, even if it is the most shameful example of how I've ever seen. Some questions are really complex. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, though not nearly as good as TLK or even TLK2.
