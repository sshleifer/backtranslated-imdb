I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon on television in the 1950s or 60s. It was well presented, but I remember that the escorts had one desperate message separated from the last manic condemnation of the impending release. I'm not sure the squares are factual. <br /> <br /> However, the film is well done. The German High Commissioner misunderstands without emotions "The Russians are going down to Fredrich Strasse, as if everything had gone according to plan. <br /> <br /> This was my impression that this movie and the later American made television to knock off based on the British historian Trevor-Roper's account, similar to "The Last Days of Hitler". I was surprised to see no credit for Trevor-Roper. <br /> <br /> I agree that the newest German film on this topic DOWNFALL was as good as the classic. American knock-off was a bit flat. <br /> <br /> Few figures have stuck as much attention as Adolph. However, I find it interesting that none of the many films and books ever came out of Hitler's double references to John Toland's excellent historical work. <br /> <br /> Was it gib?
