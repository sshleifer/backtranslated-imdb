Young Erendira and her tyrannical grandmother offer great fantasy from the new world. This interpretation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "La incréible y triste historia da la cándida Eréndira, ..." may not rub Marquez's sails in the right way, even though the story remains intact and still bears the full force of the work. The strength of this film is especially Papas as a grandmother. Marquez fans and Marquez novices enjoy this movie with their real sharp brand witt.
