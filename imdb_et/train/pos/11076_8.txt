First of all I say that almost everyone has earned it wrong! The fact is, no one was expecting it, especially Guy Ritchie. All that everyone was expecting were "cigars and good linings" "Do you like dags?" etc, but it is much more mature than its previous work. I agree that this is confusing, but all the facts are there for us, because we have to see them and listen to them harder, this film requires all your attention! Look at the cool and dazzling look of the film, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances, and I think we can all understand the film more thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is influenced by modern classics (fighting club, cellulose fiction, etc.), but it's all in the original, both in direction and in solidification, the music score is no other. I feel that if everyone would watch this movie over and over, they would understand it more and maybe appreciate it for the subtle part of the contemporary cinema, and I also hope that Ritchie will continue to do it in vain because I prefer this much to my mockery "masterpieces" .
