The running man is often left aside, as it is just another thriller of Arnie's action, full of explosions, bad punches and a firearm, and there is a lot to be fair. People used it to look and compare it with the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorest Schwarzenegger movies. <br /> <br /> But give it for 18 years and you will find that you can judge it in a different light. Instead of being just another meaningless film, it actually acts as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different from Stephen King's book, but I doubt whether Hollywood, who would love to have a fun ending and the so-called ordinary boys who turned out to be skilled commando skills, would have adopted this form. <br /> <br /> But with an overview. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a police officer who works in the United States where democracy is a thing of the past. and the whole country is dominated by the government / media conglomerate. The economy is tatters, food is scarce, and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows to watch them, like jumping dollars, where people jump over money in well rabies dogs, and the most popular is Running Man, games organized by slimy Damian Killian (played by entertaining Richard Dawson ), where alleged "criminals" have hunted by theater, wrestling and stalkers. <br /> <br /> Some, however, are trying and talking to the government. When a group of hungry people protests in the city of Bakersfield in California, a Richards-led helicopter is sent to a "peaceful" (ie kill) protest. When Richards refuses to blame innocent people for fire, he is arrested and gathered to kill the crowd. He is being sent to a slave labor camp, but escapes with the help of the resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and runs. <br /> <br /> But his freedom will not last long, and after being abducted by Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso), trying to escape from those who follow them, he finds himself in prison again, but this time he is forced to appear to Running Man. <br /> <br /> And there, of course, the whole movie is filming in the usual Arnie mode. Richards is opened in the Los Angeles Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) And forced to run from stalkers with two other prisoners who fled from his work camp. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' innocence and finds that he was framed. Guess what happens to him? So, when Amber, Richards and the other two men are running around, trying to avoid stalkers, we will soon find out that Richards is not an ordinary policeman. He is Super Arnie, an unsatisfactory army of men who can destroy evil dictatorships and fight obese men on Christmas lights while being your average American man with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the movie becomes stupid, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun. There are many exciting struggles, the terrible sticks of the mark ("He had to share his favorite") and the overall formulaic final confrontation and the happy ending. It's fun to see how Killian responds to this typical "healthy" gameplay way, and some of the funniest moments in shows are in contrast to his communication with the crowd as a seemingly benevolent host (be careful) and fuck the old woman!) And the cold man he actually does something to increase ratings. <br /> <br /> If you expect a high-end, intelligent movie, you're disappointed. But if you want a big 80s, that's it. But the big thing about this movie is that it was quite prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you look at the entertainment that is happening today, you have noticed how reality TV is going today - that people want to celebrate five minutes of fame and manufacturers who are too willing to let them down on television. This is not a big leap to imagine that some of the whistles on TV exec have attempted to get people to show TV shows. However, we have already had the videos posted on the internet posted by the hostage of ghoulish al-Qaida. In the current situation, it seems that at least some people are perfectly perfect, watching their TVs for real death. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, and with the fact that all these days seem to be the revival of the 80s, you must impress the ambition of this film. Of course we have not yet reached, because it is more of a terrorist than mainstream media who have bought us easily accessible programs that have real human death, but you just have to think about how long it will be before some exec decides if it can find a way how to show an exhibition that unites people's desire for entertainment and a desire to let their ill-cursed ...
