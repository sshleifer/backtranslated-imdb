I'm too old to find out (or take care) exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is. And if it's Canada, it's likely that I've never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. But I thought this movie was very funny when I saw it, a bright little satire. Hip-hop culture is so wide-ranging today that it is no longer difficult to hear. (If we could only say the same about puppy music.) I got most of the jokes (at least I think I did). Of course, this is derived from touching the spinal cord, but there are many goals that could affect the treatment. Just not carpenters, they're holy.
