There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies can act because of the right qualities; he is wonderful in comedic roles. William Haines could act and you see why he was one of the most popular men on the screen. (Until the potential scandal forced him from the company). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit tiny, but it is so beautiful that you don't notice. King Vidor's direction is one of its main reasons. Manufacturer? The boy's genius, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> This is making movies and you will see the process, as it was done in 1928, with cameras, kits, leaders, and actors in emotions. You see (briefly) some of the most important stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin, in turn, turns to the autograph. You will also look at Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are simply names and old photos. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a silent fan, take the time to catch this movie if you can. It's really a terrible journey back in time.
