I loved watching "Sabrina, a teenage witch" Friday night at ABC TGIF. I think it was one of the best shows in TGIF. My friends and I used every Friday to see this example and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was divine and funny. I also liked Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey. He was hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: Teenage Years". These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> In general, I missed this show. I hope one day ABC brings it back with new episodes. I'll give this exhibition the 10/10 stars.
