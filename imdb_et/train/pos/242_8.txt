I thought this movie was very well done, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also very good and credible. If it is true that what really happened, I have no idea, but it depicted why people sometimes change what they do. Maybe those who are in power have always been corrupt and I found it interesting that over 30,000 signed the Ned Kelly statement for no hanging, so maybe the film was more truthful than the first thought? In many cases, he reminded me of Cold Mountain, another good historical film. All in all, I would like to recommend this movie very much and I am somewhat confused about why it doesn't fix in cinemas.
