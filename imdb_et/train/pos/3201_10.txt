This is the early film "Pilot" for the Canadian TV "Trailer Park Boys". It was presented by drivers on some networks before Showcase decided to sign them for the TV series. A good actor and very funny light make it one of the best cult comedy films. The plot of the movie is that these two little time criminals go to the money to "destroy money". If you have a neighbor with a dog that grabs all night, the men you go with! But they get into trouble when they come across too much work to cope with them and shoot. Watch this movie if you want to understand the start of the TV series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> R for swearing, violence and drugs. <br /> <br /> It's not too offensive too (they don't really show the killing of animals)
