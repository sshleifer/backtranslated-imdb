ODD COUPLE (3+ 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the final "Odd Couple". Their incredible work in the television series from the beginning of the 1970s to the mid-1970s was at the same time a high-profile television ... easily crossing the stage on stage and on the screen. Nonetheless, how do you get Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau wrong? Matthau is in a particularly good shape like Oscar, slob. Lemmon rarely gets used to Felix, especially if you've seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance before. The script is good ... certainly Neil Simon is the best. (I am writing here saying that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, overestimated actors in the American theater.) The story is simple: Felix, a pure freak, and a new wife separated from her husband are moving with an Oscar, a slob who needs help to save money to pay for maintenance . Their way of life changes just like marriage, which culminates with some fun tiff and spatula. Lots of fun and some great linings.
