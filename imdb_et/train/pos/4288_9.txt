Rain or shine outside, you enter the cinema. It will make you happy. (If not, come out right now.) The lights go out. You live with ice cream. Moving images start flashing on the screen. You know the content. In the dark you are at the beginning of time. Sitting at the campfire ... looking at the flaming version of flames 24 times a second and sharing the joy of discovering unknown turns and scenario twists with your rest of the clan / spectators. <br /> <br /> Those who are not satisfied should not write comments. (Live Romantic Comedies ...)
