I believe many people appreciated the film, not because of lack of quality. But it didn't follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some conflicts have not been resolved. The end is a bit too real for others, but the journey that offers rich signs and a long list of supporters is both provocative and fun. Even cinematography is excellent, considering the urban environment, management is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 year old book in my book that takes you to the usual and anticipated Hollywood script. They took some risks and did some things differently. I think it worked well, deliberately trying to avoid direct references to the film because seeing it itself is the best answer, not interpreting anyone else.
