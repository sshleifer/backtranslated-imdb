It's really a nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It is about two dogs and a cat who will be taken for a while to live with someone, but the animals will not understand and they will flee and go to find the family themselves. The cat is called Sassy and she lives by her name. The opportunity is a younger dog who knows a lot about life inside the pound. Shadow is an older and smarter dog who knows things. Put these three together in an adventure and make it a happy and fun time. There are no special mouth effects so it wouldn't be any cheese at all. This is the best talented movie I've ever seen. It's really a good movie for families.
