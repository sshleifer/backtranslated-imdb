Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I think I'll start with the plot. His family home comes from a fianc√©e (Lucy) in France, a husband (Mathurin), where they are waiting for a bishop or cardinal or someone to marry a Catholic church (for will). waited, young Lucy is studying the legend about the beast who traveled centuries earlier. In bed, in the evening, he began to imagine Beast and his rape-turned consensus over the house with a former lady. That's interesting! The plot is really fairly thin (and it seems to slip in the middle of some time slipping), but the filmmaker gives the awards (?) To those who make it to the shocking and fun finals. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great cinema, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a far-sighted movie about parchment (which almost gives a sympathetic look to the object), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of it. Outside of horse-horse activities, "actions" in the beginning are a real comic, IMO)
