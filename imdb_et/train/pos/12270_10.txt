I was looking for this movie for years, probably not available in these countries, so I bought a copy from eBay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends are looking for a forest. it has probably killed several campers. What they find is a former Vietnam veteran who has gone crazy (he kills some of his victims using gloves with long metal finger nails la Freddy Krueger). As soon as the night falls, one of the girls, with a short argument, goes with her boyfriend. After one group finds their body, they all hide in their tents waiting for the daylight. When the sun comes up, they try to do it but fall victim one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not many gore, but few good murders, especially girls, deaths. The boys are killed somewhat bloodless (the car is blown, killed, a knife through the head). In general, INFERNAL TRAP is a beautiful film at the end of the 80s. Something new, just working well, fast paced and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10
