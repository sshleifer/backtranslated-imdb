I watched Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10. That was right after the Bay City roll. I saw it one day on a family channel and recorded it for my three-year-old daughter. I forgot all the things I would love as a child, magic flute, zoom, Witcheepoo makeup. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is a decisively low tech. The mayor is certainly a precedent for Mayor McCheese and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying eyes. But the kids love this stuff. They would, but would rather watch the boy work with a sock knife to sit in front of high-tech computer animation. There are (soft) shockproof, but adult subjects like sex or people don't die, and kids accept Jimmy schemes. The kids think it would be nice to carry the bag and convince someone that their house was a fire, and I loved how every time my daughter saw the sky flow, she thought Witchypoo was flying. The music is old but you are used to it and my daughter really loved it. He sang the car "unlike heavy, different is lonely". My daughter looked at this exhibition at least once a day for about 5 months and it is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see a new Pufnstuf in the works 2000. I really hope they try to keep the old taste and do nothing like computer-animating characters etc. I think the whole new generation would love Pufnstuf.
