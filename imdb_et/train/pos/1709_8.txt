After the Orson Welles classical radio tuning to Halloween switching over to Halloween broadcasting broke the true Mars invasion, a group of moral Marlons will appear who want to conquer only their plans in a frightening way when they find themselves really away from the element and actually alone. <br /> <br /> It's often pretty good and funny, with some good lines (just check out the memorable quotes) to run them. This is likely to turn to Sci-Fi fans. It has passed a test of time because it saw it again recently, it turned out to be much better than I thought it was. Regardless of the alphabet, which is made up of letters about names, it may be just a more funny Mars invasion that has ever been filmed. Interestingly, the martyrs themselves seem to be almost all the classic Action Hero / Sci-Fi Hero stereotypes (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, daring soldier and kooky scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare DIE! Earth Scum!"
