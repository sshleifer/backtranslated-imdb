Originally I bought this DVD because it was on the SRK and Aishwarya Rai cover and I thought hey! another movie with Aishu and Shah Rukh, a little I knew that Aishwarya will appear in the last quarter of the movie only in the numbers she shares with SRK and will help introduce her character, who is in the film for about 15 years. Shakti is a film about mother's love and endurance. This is a film about transformations, ignorance, aging, knowing and the harsh realities of life. The picture number in which SRK and Aishu appear, has nothing to do with the film. In fact, it is the sequence of dreams that occurs in the SRK drunken character by tapping unconsciously. She dreams that Aishwarya Rai is the sexy street girl who will appear in her favorite hangout one day, dressed and start to seduce her. The song's title is "Ishq Kamina" (loosely translated as "The Bitch of Love!") And it's just hot smoking! Don't miss it.
