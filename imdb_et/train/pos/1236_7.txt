Eddie Murphy spends her time looking for missing children, so if a very special magical child is kidnapped in Tibet, sexy Charlotte Lewis asks her to help the child save her from the evil conjunctions. <br /> <br /> Although the story is a bit stupid, it's never quite funny, despite the comedy fun of the whole movie; Charles Dance compensates for comedy with his very serious and dark characterization of evil that keeps the child hostage. <br /> <br /> The Golden Child is a very funny, action packed and really pretty charming, almost magical way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Excellent for all generations.
