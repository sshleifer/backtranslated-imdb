Kurt Russell, whose career began when he hit the World Fair at the time of the REAL Elvis strike, probably never exceeds his performance as a king in this two-way and shocking master Carpenter. There are times when you feel you're looking at Elvis until something clicks you into reality ... maybe memories of an unhappy Don Johnson in Elvis and Beauty Queen? All the performances here are excellent: Hubley's Priscillana season, Pat Hingle's colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to render Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt's father Bing plays here Elvis's father Vernon and Robert Gray are subtly undervalued as Elvis's friend and bodyguard Red West. <br /> <br /> There must be a rock n role for fans.
