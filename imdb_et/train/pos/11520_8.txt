An important road movie ... if your idea of ​​making a film consists of three possible magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani. (Well, one in four is not bad ...) No talented band with an outstanding show (Max) looks at a highly qualified pocket (Hugo) who travels with her in New York. After Hugo's conviction that he (Max) is a) spiritual and b) desperately needs a partner to make his dreams a performance artist, the non-dynamic duo needs to use the illusion inventor's management knowledge (Milo) and the ah, delicate attributes of the Lydia. Unlikely Fourth Cube (which Hugo got ... you think where it came from) and head to Vegas. Havoc says. Anyway, it's funny, it's well written and the end is surprisingly good. Solid comedy with a warm heart and the better it was completely unexpected.
