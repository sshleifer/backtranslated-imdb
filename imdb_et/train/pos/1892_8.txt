After seeing several times on Arthur's television, I laughed so hard at Dudley Moore as Arthur's lucky drunk millionaire, which was hysterical, but John Gielgud as his servant / father's figure Hobson was just as charming. I bought the DVD a couple of weeks ago and watched it despite being almost as enjoyable for almost 27 years as it once was the role of Liza Minnell, because the interest of love was fascinating chemistry between the two was magical. <br /> <br Arthur Bach (Moore) is a spoiled millionaire who has a bar, which is like a public debt that he does not want to grow and enjoys like a child. His activities are followed by his dry English butcher Hobson (Gielgud), it seems that no one cares about Arthur except him, Arthur's father (Barbour) offers ultimatum when he does not marry in a terrible blonde, Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) for four weeks cut off his son a legacy of $ 750 million. <br /> <br /> But Arthur meets and loves Linda Marollat ​​(Minnell), a young working class waitress and a binding thief, now has a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows and crushes it before the wedding with Susan, leaving him both money and true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for everyone
