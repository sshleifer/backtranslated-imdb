First of all for this movie, I have one word: "wow". This is probably one of the best films that touched me, between the story and the performances so wonderfully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. This last one I was very impressed with, because he brought the depth to reality because it was a very difficult role. However, these two pairs that surprised me, from the beginning to the end, showed the way, with a loving friendship that develops throughout the day, the film was placed. The story takes time because the introduction of the characters is long, but finally the wonderful story of love and humanity is compensated. If you have a chance, look at it, because it's a movie that will be remembered many times in your mind. Just amazing - 9/10.
