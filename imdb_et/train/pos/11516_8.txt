I'm not a graduate of John Clees (although I thought Fawlty Towers was great), but I'm a fan, and when I saw this session, I ignored my local Blockbuster shelf that I decided to try it out. a surprise and one of the fun 50 minute viewing experiences I've ever had. Writing is a typical English goon show schtick. that can create a lifelong British comedy fanatics. Arkin and Seller "to Inspector Clouseau", but Cleese has such a skill for physical comedy that he has more than his own but unexpected place Here is Arthur Lowe, who plays "Watson" as a brilliant but unintelligible imbekil with such an excellent timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film. I didn't listen to Lowe before that (his background seems to be a vaudeville and a musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Some people may not take care of "Strange Case ...", especially if the British are not their "cuppa tea". But I'm very glad I saw it before it disappeared from sight.
