I had time to really appreciate John Carpenter for Halloween. Like a child, I remember that I really enjoyed the queues, especially the return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best sequel to Halloween. But I thought the first one was slow and took too much time to reach the point. I looked at it a few times recently and now I know I'm wrong. Today I really understand this film, its meaning, the feeling of the whole masterpiece of this horror. It's not blood and gore. It does not touch bare chicks and hips. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode for a short lifetime. It's about night when his demented brother comes home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is meant to be scary and I think it works very well. It is also one of the first films I always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis. Can I say more? Anyone who has never seen it, a spooky fan or not, should do their cinematic homework right now. Highly recommended!
