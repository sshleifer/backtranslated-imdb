*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956 and considered quite awful at that time, Douglas Sirk is still a great thing about candy-colored melodrama. The plot is an oil-rich dysfunctional family of Texas, which includes a great brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, wounded and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very touching and disgraceful job, and his sliding sister Marylee played extreme Dorothy Malone. The presentation of Mrs Malone is telegraphed by her eyes, which she uses for us to show our emotions, mostly composed of lust (Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actor I've ever seen in movies that enter the room. Now, get me wrong, his performance is the least of the absolute horse, and it is one of the highest in the camp in the 1950s. But it is also terrible because as pleasant and attractive as Malone, she is not a very good actor and she is not capable of fine or shades. His performance is one remark. She can't do the evil Mambo, and on the big assembly, like always the death of the good Robert Keith's unplayable fathers, climbing the stairs, Sirk interferes with this almost mad Malone who does orgasm dance when she's undresses. The Stack (who could have won the Oscar) and Malone (who won the prize but shouldn't do it) are the real stars of the movie, those who put all the hysteria, both sexual and otherwise, while the "true stars" movie Hudson & Bacall disappears gray and brown, which are the colors they mostly wear. Hudson, who was a better actor, hoped to play Stack's childhood and the best friend loved the interest in Malone who, with the majority of the film, was bothering and swinging. But Hudson doesn't want to be a part of him, but is in love with Bacall, who is married to Stack. No one is very happy and no one is very long. Stack-Bacall's marriage falls into one year for a long time, and Stack drops into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile and can't give Bacall a baby to prove he's a man. Sirk, a very intelligent person with a long and exciting career in films and theater in Germany, graduated from his Hollywood career in the mid-1950s with several intense, vividly colored "female films" or melodrama. Although they were mainly adapted from medical or trashy source materials, they received Sirk's masterpieces of genre. Sirkil had a great sense of color and design in these films, filling his wide-screen spaces with characters who played their emotional life among strange color combinations and light, shadows and many miraculous reflections. "Written" characters are always kept out of the windows, listening to doors or slipping around. After all, after a lot of violence, casual murder, miscarriage and more, Sirk finishes the movie with a final and amazing scenario of "reborn" and reformed Malone in a man-made dress, sitting at the desk of a miniature beer center. .
