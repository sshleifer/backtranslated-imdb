It's about embezzler, Peter Ustinov, who invades a British company, Texa-Conn or something like that, posing as a computer quiz and security expert. He secretly learns to hack on his computer while collecting admiration from his superior Karl Malden, his office rival, Bob Newhart's enthusiasm and the love of his inert secretary Maggie Smith. The business details were a bit tiny for these non-commercial eyes, but they are credible enough and got a general idea. Ustinov, peculiar Peter, creates counterfeit companies in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart and uses a Texas-Conn computer to send all sorts of money to these ersatz companies. Foreign companies, of course, are nothing more than Ustinov, and the addresses are the attic of an abandoned artist in Paris, a hair salon in Rome and a bakery in Germany. He just visits them to collect his own checks. <br /> <br /> I didn't think I'd like it in the first few minutes because it seemed rather slow. I was expecting something faster pace and more resentment, "Pink Pink" or "Lavender Hill Gang". But this film puts you in your good graces if you appreciate undervalued humor, testimonials, and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It would probably be a bad idea to give too much of a gag, but here are some more noticeable examples. <br /> <br /> Ustinov Secretary Smith: "Allow me to be the property of these companies." Smith: "Assets? What are they?" Ustinov: "Little woman's asses." Nothing has been done about this little change. For each laughter, there is a quick cut and delay, which is appropriate because the reaction is more likely to smile than laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov is looking for this hard attic in Paris. It is covered with networked networks. Bricks have been worshiped and a few former riders have been left behind. The landlord does not speak English and Ustinov does not know French. Ustinov points to the painting of a nude woman's child and laughs, "Ah. Fam fye, eh?" The landlord also laughs, "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE, so it's his name!" Hosted by "Oui?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" (Mes amis, when I got these sexes wrong, je m'excuse). There are direct consecutive traffic signs. "Beware." "Placed." "Make your way." "Yield." Finishing with strange "STOP / CHILDREN". There is another assembly when the Ustinov scheme is discovered by the boards - blurry roofs, police cars, goodbye from Maggie, ending with: PRISON, wormwood cleaners. Well, maybe one more. I still can't get over from Malden, deciding decisively: "I've never agonized decisions," I get a handful of pills and wash them with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> Operation is undoubtedly good. This is the best role for Bob Newhart, for example. Not that he had so much, and not that his choice was not limited, but he was perfect in that regard. The musical result of Laurie Johnson was obviously a lot of trouble. He seems to have written a short flute concert. Ustinov's passion is music, and his overseas departments have the wrong names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. Stuttgart's fake president is someone called Schmidt and he is an anomalous clinker. Maggi Smith is beautiful, sexy, civic, and it's not nearly as stupid as she looks. <br /> <br /> Nice, in a quiet way, but don't wait for comic.
