This film repeats the term "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, who is one of the group's fat, shows his talent, as did the generation of Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "The King of $ 1 Contribution", shows that he is no longer in Kansas, steadily raising his stakes. Kyle's laugh is really infectious and also offers women some eye candy (like Matt). The dwarf, even though they have moments, didn't do the Mexican hat dance as it deserves. And finally, we have a protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all our worship, stumbling, gangly, pale people who are still looking for that special someone. And this hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. Although this explosive just remained in theaters, it is rentable because we can all associate with one of these spring Breakumentarions.
