I've seen a freebird movie and I think it's great! Its fun fun, about the time the British film industry came out with something fun !! it is good how the boy who met them at the service station mentioned the film of the news agents, nice contact. The actor was convincing (I'm a biker), reminding me of some good time I've had on the bike arena. It was good to see that the film director came to the actors, well done! Finally, a new crop is mentioned, is Ireland the second basis for the film? Hope to keep them in the future. Great movie, well-written, realistic characters!
