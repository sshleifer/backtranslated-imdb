The story of four teenage girls growing in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is in the bunch at the highest level - but wants to leave her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and her father kicks. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) is a senior defense parent. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than the rest. <br /> <br /> It's not new to what we've seen a lot before - but that's one big difference - that's right. I finished high school in 1980 (when I first saw the movie) and was surprised at how realistic it was. They got the dialogue, clothes and attitudes right. Even the main song of the movie ("Donna Summer" on the radio) was a big hit before it came out. This movie hit me harder than the other teenage movie, because I can understand and relate it to the characters. The movie is (of course) dated, but it will take some time we will never see. <br /> <br /> The actors are good at all counts when Foster gives the best result. The relationship was realistic and well done, even Scott Baio (who has a little girl friend) played a more or less realistic teenage boy. <br /> <br /> Very good movie - important viewing when you were born in 1980. earned R-rating (abundant drug use and swearing), but it should be looked at by all teenagers.
