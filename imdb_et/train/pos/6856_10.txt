This is a close stop Brian De Palma with great performances everywhere! It is extremely tense and often scary and the score is fantastic, plus all the characters were fantastic. Yes, it pulls a lot of Psycho, but it is still a wonderfully done horror / thriller with a fantastic opening and a shocking and unpredictable finale! It's undoubtedly one of the best horrors / thrillers I've ever seen, and the elevator scene is one of the most memorable scenes that Michael Caine is just amazing! The end is great, and near the end of the hospital scene is absolutely daunting. It never left me out, and the stem lines are completely brilliant, and Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon had a fantastic chemistry together! It's a tight stop by Brian De Palma, with amazing performances everywhere! The direction is incredible! Brian De Palma is doing amazing work, amazing camera work, incredible corners, fantastic color usage, fantastic zooming, and great POV shots, and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! There's a little blood in there. We get bloody gaps, knifes, bloody wounds and 2 bloody slits. Action is amazing! Michael Caine is AMAZING here, he's an actress amazing, horrible, is very pleasant, was mysterious, and really just made amazing work in general I loved him! (Caine rules!). Angie Dickinson gives a memorable result here and was pretty beautiful and had a good chemistry with Cain. Nancy Allen is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! And this is awesome here, it is extremely pleasing as a whore with excellent chemistry with Keith Gordon and a huge show! Keith Gordon is very good with her child, she had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen and was very happy! Dennis Franz is a good detective. In general, it is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made, and I say what you are doing right now and see it! ***** out of 5
