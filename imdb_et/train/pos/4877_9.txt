In fact, one particular person / character is not "there", but the line of my summary refers to the power of the film. And all this has been achieved without moving the fancy camera and / or large product sets, but with a great story and great (plausible) and good actors who are transmitting the story (arc). <br /> <br /> You can call it a companion piece for a big Japanese movie / cinema (like Tokyo story, etc.), not so much a natural story, but more mood! Great actors that are truly gems. If you want to experience the story and want to see a movie that touches you emotionally, then this is what to go. As you have noticed (as with many of my evaluations), I can't get the story. There are places in IMDbis where you can watch them, I'm not talking about the story at all!
