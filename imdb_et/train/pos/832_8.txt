Interestingly, how much more realistic Brosnan's performance is compared to the original James Bond novels compared to the bond movies. She is a neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and female woman. It's a perfect break for him, even so much that he's joking about the bond icon. "I'm crap, self-parody," he says. It does not improve it. I finished reading Dr.No and that's a lot of how Ian Fleming depicted James Bond. Personally, I didn't like Brosna as Bond because he fits the icon too tightly. There was nothing personalizing for him compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It is great to see that Brosnan plays both in reality and in the extremely tasty character of the wall. A low figure trying to understand the deeper emotional and psychological problems he has no background. This is an impressive imagination and Greg Kinear's grounding is just poetic. This film reminds me of some of the dynamics that have emerged between the main characters of "My Blue Sky", but more real in their coping mechanisms.
