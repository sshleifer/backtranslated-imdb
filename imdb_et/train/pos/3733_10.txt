I had suicide in Vietnam who wanted to come back afterwards. So when I saw part of this movie on a paid channel overnight, I was interesting. I wanted to know what my uncle went and felt when he got ready for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it is the closest movie I've ever seen. I bought a DVD right after renting it. The way it pulls you in so many different directions is something I've never experienced before. As far as Vietnamese films are concerned, I think it is the best, although Plato runs in a closed second. In addition, I think this is also Colin Farrell's best actor. I like it in most of my movies, but it was incredible. I gave it to 10 ratings because it is one of my top five favorite films.
