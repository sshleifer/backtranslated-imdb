I enjoyed this movie a lot. It has a great direction, already known by the famous Bigas Luna in Spain. And in Spain, this film is going to be more precise in Catalonia. <br /> <br /> Luna is once again investigating the call for action, in this case the appeal of young boys to women. milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as the rejection complex that the older son knows when his brother is born. In the film, this is what brings the young boy who suddenly sees his mother's milk to his newly born son. So she tries to find a breast that can feed her. She thinks this is a woman recently arrived and here is the film. <br /> <br /> This movie lives a lot of pictures, more than the story itself, the observer catches certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the film deserves a rather thorough analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually means something ... ). Environment, region-specific landscapes, as well as symbolic symbolic surreal behaviors, and Nicola Piovan's excellent ambiguous soundtrack transport us to another dimension that is not parallel to the real world, but that crashes it occasionally ... It's worth living in this world, it's worth watching this movie, though we can finally and for a moment get tired and a little sick under an excessive call that may be overcome by the borders ... <br /> I liked the protagonist's performance ... 8/10
