There is a very good point: "only elites (upper class) would both have access to the Internet and would only be able to communicate on an English-speaking site, such as IMDb." Some may think that the Internet is not a reality, but this perspective really puts the media society and democracy at the forefront. : You probably are right. Even if there is an internet caf√© in Venezuela, most Chavez supporters cannot even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Turn you into a fascist upper-class rich right-wing capitalist liberal intellectual pressure device. It's probably your first time on the Internet;) ..
