Look at the documentary about Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. The Hollywood North is a comic story about their struggle, despite a number of controversial yarns. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North works as a movie very similar to why it is a spinal tap (1984) so ​​well. Namely, although it is in some ways exaggerated, it is very close to the truth, and the truth lies behind the "scenes" of facts that are very different from the public side of the industry. The movie is not easy to do and must be particularly difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Movies include dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have incompatible desires, motivations, and personalities. Funders and screen talent are particularly important, because if a film has fallen or become unchanged at some stage during production, it can endanger the whole thing, which requires a major transformation or abandonment of the film. <Br>> <br /> So it is not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on such relationships. The result is a great movie that is both fun and tragic at the same time. The script is flawless and performances are top-notch. It is a black vision for every budding filmmaker and someone with a serious interest in making movies. It should also be more than entertaining for all the viewers who have a sense and sense of humor. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 of me.
