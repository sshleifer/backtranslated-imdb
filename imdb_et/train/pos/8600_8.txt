There was some hesitation about what this movie offered. For starters, the pain didn't seem right. Kiefer Sutherland had done very well with "24" and the preview didn't offer him or the audience any challenge. Eva Longoria seemed inappropriate and the rest didn't seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the movie finally came to an end, I was not completely satisfied that I had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better if the responsible parties had taken a little more care of caring for the narrative gaps and gave more care to the character development. We have seen this type of danger before and it made the major conflict much more difficult for writers. Like the audience, we don't want to sit through the same old story again. We want to see something different, be excited and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with casting. Kim Basinger's tasty first woman. He carries enough grace and sex appeal to make this part memorable. Michael Douglas has done it and done it. Unfortunately, the President is largely a unit that cares about his destiny. Sutherland reiterates its "24-year-old" approach, which has the strength to make it big enough for a big screen, and Eva is a newcomer to a satisfactory job. <br /> <br /> Do not wait as many turns and fireworks as some of the classic ones created ("North Fetus" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations out and enjoy what it could be. It's OK.
