A single depressive French boyfriend Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) is on vacation and falls in love with Cedric (proud Stephane Rideau). Quiet and slow this is a very depressing film. On the one hand, I absorbed it and really felt for two boys. On the other hand, I started to bother me - the movie continues to blink from the past without a primer or reason. It is very confusing and pointless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> There are also tons of holes in the plot - Mathieu is at one point doing something to stop the hospital. What is it - we never said! Then he breaks with Cedric and tells everyone else he's living with him. Why? We haven't been told. Then he unexplains with another guy. Why? There is no explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves that Mathieu and Mathieu live in the same city, so ... But this is a tribute to the film you care so much about the characters. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> The eldest than Mathieu is not good. She is tall, beautiful and has a nice body - but she can't work. His idea of ​​acting sits on his face with an empty view - all the time. But Rideau is great. She is very beautiful, she has a very nice body and one hell of an actor. He also has incredible sexual magnetism with him. In the film, there is great nudity in the front man, a lot of kisses and a rather explicit sex scene that is great - most movies fail to show male male love scenes. It is not and it helps to see how the characters care and know each other. <br /> <br /> So, a depressing movie, but somewhat worth seeing - especially Rideau's nude scenes - ie if you like beautiful nude young men! <br /> <br />
