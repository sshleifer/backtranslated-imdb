Citizen X tells the story of Rostov's rider Andrei Chikatilo, who killed 52 people, mostly women and children, over eight years. This shows how the investigation was hampered by Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate crimes. It works so wonderfully that it doesn't leave anyone intact. At first it may be a bit slow, but it really grabs you as the story develops. I can only say that next to "The Silence of Lambs" is the best film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say which actor's performance in this movie looks the rest. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as an inexperienced forensic expert who is responsible for investigating. The performance of Donald Sutherland as his cynical superior and the only person who wanted to help him in the Russian government is as prominent as Rea's. And what about Jeffrey DuMann, who plays the serial number? DuMann created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred. Yeah, he's a monster, but he's a sad figure, his wife, his boss, his co-workers pressed and ridiculed ... He's tortured, ashamed and extremely cruel. <br /> <br I can only recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a well-made documentary drama, where actors are still more important than special effects. It deserves at least 9/10, maybe even more than you ask me.
