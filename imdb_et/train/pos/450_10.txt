I am biased in every film that paints the rich picture of Italy - the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was relatively short, abnormal for some time, and somewhat less cinematic. But this is a great story. Four women start a much-needed relaxing vacation with problems in their minds. During the film, they understand their problems and begin to approve them. They believe that San Salvatore, the fortress where they are, will impress people. "It's a bath of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can look at their gradual change of dissatisfaction because the Italian seafront is working with their magic. <br /> <br /> All of their problems and solutions are plausible. The actors were great. The background music seemed to be very romantic for Italian. All in all, it is a 10/10 film for me.
