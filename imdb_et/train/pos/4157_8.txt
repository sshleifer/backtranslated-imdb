This early Anime movie was a pretty good film I ever got on the Science Fiction channel when Anime was really popular in America here, not a rating catastrophe that adult swimming claims it is on cartoon. To be honest, I think it is less related to the fact that it is less popular and more that people tend to buy DVDs than watch online unexplored episodes. This movie probably did not have all such cuts and the casting was good for the dubbed film, although I would rather look at the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children that are dubbed. This movie has a young boy who puts a train called Galaxy Express in the hope that he will get to the planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot. He wants to become a robot for his mother, who was brutally murdered by a robot who shares people with fun. In his adventures, he gets friends with various staff on board the train, as well as a woman who resembles his dead mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who has the secret of most Anime movies, which can be really good for our young hero or really bad. He also goes from planet to planet because the train stops and he runs a space pirate named Captain Harlock, who apparently saw his animated film series, so basically the Galaxy Express in this universe. All in all, there is a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected end. This is followed by a sequel, but it was not as good as it was, but the end was a bit final than here.
