I've read a little about Che before watching this movie, and you want to know something, he was a real hero to the people because he just wanted to see equality for everyone and hated what the other Latin American people did to oppress their people! Now, I don't know about others, but for me he did the right thing, wishing socialism that everyone had to pay their fair share. But obviously the powerful elite couldn't do it. So, instead of understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to suppress him. It didn't work because there were too many other followers who took only where he left. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As far as I am concerned and Che said he himself was before death: "If you kill me, it is good. But you only kill one person, you never have to kill!" I couldn't say it myself better. <br /> <br /> But ... NOT always ... that's why I give this film to 10 out of 10.
