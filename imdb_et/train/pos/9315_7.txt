The prominent lawyer Walter Pidgeon takes the pro bono of the murder case, wins the acquittal, and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of a blackmail ring that reached the highest eschelons in the city. Because of his involvement, he conducts an investigation, stumbles upon the identity of an "unknown man" who directs and murders a syndicate. <br /> <br /> Ironies deals when Braselle is accused of murdering another and Pidgeon must protect him by pointing to the existence of another "unknown person" - himself.
