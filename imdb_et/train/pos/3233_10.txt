This year's top Finnish film, although Tango Cabaret is close. Director Lampela made a nice little film a couple of years ago I loved the desperate (I was in love with a desperate woman) .The river is a really beautiful movie in a small village / town on a Saturday afternoon. The characters may not be as beautiful or beautiful, but they work beautifully. that many of them will get JUSSI shape (Finnish OSCAR) next spring. I think this movie is also abroad.
