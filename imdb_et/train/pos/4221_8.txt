I loved the episode, but it seems to me that there should have been a quick reference to the secretary, who is punished for actually being an accomplice. Although I like the unexpected twist of the Columbo episode, this resolution should be part of the episode with the revealing of the murder. <br /> <br /> Peter Falki and Ruth Gordon are invaluable. At one point, Gordon's famous writer makes some comments about the enthusiasm of his fellow colleagues from his famous colleagues, making a tongue-in-cheek hint of the real fame of the detective as a crime solver. This is one of the best many great Columbo parts.
