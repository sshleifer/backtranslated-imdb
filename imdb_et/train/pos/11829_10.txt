I've been watching "Dick Tracy" for years and as a result, it has become a vital part - it was with me throughout my childhood and I saw it quite often. Looking at it now as an adult, it is still a very good film - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing you can say is the Oscar nomination for Pacino - it's rarely spoken and didn't come out much when it came out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is on top but with good effect if he has a lot of fun. Beatty is great, because behind Dick Tracy and the camera, film noir is better than a comic book than any other movie I've ever seen. Watching one movie scene is breathtaking. Lighting, velvet and smoke / smoke produce a great effect. <br /> <br /> There are some really funny places, one of which is Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles", and I don't think there are any mistakes at all - even a mandatory badge is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a really good movie that has misunderstood over the years since its release, and which is incredibly underestimated by just 5.7 / 10 in IMDb. Critics' evaluations are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the movie again it is not hard to see why - this is a great example of the comic book's nature, style of eccentricity. > <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 stars out of 5.
