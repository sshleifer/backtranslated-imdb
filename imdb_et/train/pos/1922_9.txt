Let me first say that this exhibition was top-notch when there was John Ritter. In the event of his death, the exhibition fell slightly, but the producers did not give up the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the usual pain in 2003-2005. <br /> <br /> Exhibition centers around the Hennessy family Paul (John Ritter, he can rest calmly), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son Rory (Martin Spaniel). When Ritter was in the show, I started to laugh (and I'm proud to feel it), but now, when she's gone, I'm just laughing with a little laugh. I am very glad that I fell into the trance of this exhibition after Ritter's premature death because it made epsit so much better with Ritter. <br /> <br /> Ritter's character has worked so well and round that you can't help but love him. She's always on the bossing of girls about dating, but she really wants them to be happy. This is the ultimate father who hates boy-entertainment. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also great, and she is also a pleasant character. After Ritter's death, his character gives both good influence and strength not only to his children, but I believe that Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson and Spaniels because he and Ritter had been long friends. <br /> <br /> The most fun person in the show should be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, but she's a smart person. She has innocent "blonde" humor and, if she is deliberate, has fun on the wall. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson gets annoying to Kerry, but it's the purpose of his character. The only mistake in the show is that the show never makes Kerry happy. He's always after Bridget and his character feels like he's been there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spanjers as a single Hennessy son is hysterical and when Ritter is on the screen, he is mostly comic. In the case of Ritter's death, this exhibition gives Rory a story. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are nothing more than a laugh, a casual story about the character of C.J., Spade. Garner plays some background information on Cate's father. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'll give it a great overview, because it's a great show that happened with a tragic event that paralyzed it. You enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - Spy
