It's just a short movie from David Lynch in just 8 minutes, but it got all "Lynchia ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, unclear, terrible and strange; And before the blonde girl starts talking, it's even a little scary! Music is extraordinary to create this strange atmosphere because it is also evil and mysterious? <br /> <br /> The device itself is not "traditional" red curtains, but it has purple-colored walls that give it an equal effect on ethereality. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl who is locked in a dark room and she cries for help; there will be another girl who will talk to her in a mysterious way, saying she's just because of her fault? We don't know what happened or what will happen next? it ended unresolved and puzzling because a good Lynch movie must end! <br /> <br /> This is very short, despite some amateur action. Girls are professional actors, but I think their action could have been short.
