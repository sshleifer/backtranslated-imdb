I really enjoyed watching this movie! First I thought about the poster that it was just one simple romantic comedy ... but it's just more than that! I personally believe that this idea (that I'm sure a good part of the viewers were just before the movie was seen) is another important part of the big concept of this movie (or even its marketing strategy)! What I mean is: Today we are slaves of pictures! Sessions! I went to the cinema to look at this movie that has the wrong impression, wrong expectations, and finally I felt like I was superficial! To illustrate this, in my opinion, what ends with the end of Sidney buying a flight ticket to go back to New York and when he is asked to "give an autograph", which means signing a ticket, he believes it is just because I got the TV thanks The scandal in the awards he is now famous for. And I believe that this is the main topic around which films films. I believe that the film also offers us a solution for doing this, illustrating the whole film with Sidney's attitude: don't become too serious about yourself or someone else ... "even the saints were people at first" ... as Sophie once says in the film. The current holidays are stars. We attribute to them the "aura" of perfection, eternal happiness, but the reality is much less. Even the saints of every religion are images, ideal models, how to live and how to live. Even they were not real ... they got "real" after death and we looked back at them. And that's the catch: we need our saints! we need your stars! We strive for them as if they were not trying to do something for them. And television and all other media are the means to create and capture our aspirations. We desperately need the criteria we measure ourselves. And so we got to watch this movie first in the cinema: to see if we can match the benchmark or whether the benchmark is small for us. This time it was bigger than expected.
