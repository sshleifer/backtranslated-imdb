My older sister was born in March 1985 and has brain damage. At the age of 22, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school, which are also with other disabled children. I have been the butt of everybody's jokes because my sister is disabled and I still think that nobody is or will never give her and her status a damn. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were happy. Christy could talk, she could communicate and had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't say the word, and she can't use her hand to do anything but grab things. but this film made me realize that there are other people in the world, like my sister, and the end (telling the truth) made me cry. AND I am SHAWSHANK !!! This movie is seriously underestimated and should not. This film tells people something. that people should be proud of their lives. do you think you can't write well? this man wrote his leg. do you think you're not attractive? this man got a lot of girls because of his condition. not a faster runner? Christy couldn't even stand up. <br /> <br /> My Point: Parents of Babies, I encourage your kids to watch this movie with you so they know that next time they see someone on the street in someone's wheelchair, they are not stare at them like aliens. My sister got millions of stars, and it interrupts my heart to think that it is going on with many more people. This film teaches people that people who may not be "normal" are also people. 10/10
