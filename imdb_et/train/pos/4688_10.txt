I showed it to my sixth grade about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I also loved it. The story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing. The casting of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is a truly classic film. <br /> <br /> Alan Root has done some incredible camera work and it could have won the best documentary Oscar. I do not have this copy that would tell about this Orson Welles (Derek Jacobi) and it is not called "The Mysterious Clay Castle" but "Clay Castles". It makes me think that this must be done by adding Welles to star power and Oscar. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to find this VHS recently and it's now my favorite movie. They brought this latest family collection to the Disney movie. If you find this movie, you are really happy.
