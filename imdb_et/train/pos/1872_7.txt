When I didn't see the movie in the original theater release, I was surprised when the DVD arrived, because this film did not have a wide spread that it deserved. <br /> <br /> The Denzel Washington director's debut and final product have nothing to envy other filmmakers with the same theme. The film has a very professional look. This shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot about the other side of the camera. He brings a different angle to this film. He is an actor who undoubtedly goes far with the right instructions. He has done it with him when he has worried about a young man, now his life, instability and suffering because of a bad hand's life. His opposite is a beautiful man with pain who is basically very good and who has so much to give, but no one seems to have such a character on his side. <br /> <br /> At its worst time, Antwone is being sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, was very nice, but somehow modest. Because of Antwone's rain he has the opportunity to open himself to the man who wants to help, but because of the restrictions he puts in his office, he has only three sessions and then he has to dismiss his patient. <br /> <br /> Things work out because Antwone can convince the doctor to work with him. Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The violence she carries on her mother, Mrs Tate, is violent. Catching an older woman in a Tate household of sexual torture gives Antwone a bitter taste that remains with her throughout her adult life because she is frightened by the shame she brings. <br /> <br /> Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to see another world she loves and supports. <br /> <br /> Lead performances are really great. Denzel Washington Dr Davenport also has problems. He's not a happy tent. He can help Antwone, but he can't help himself, nor with a woman who loves his relationship. <br /> <br /> The movie's talent is incredible. Joy Bryant makes fine Cherylik. Novella Nelson, a financial scientist, is great when Mrs. Tate, an abusive nanny. <br /> <br /> Antwone's reunion with its unknown family is a bit too sweet and sentimental, but of course, if it is to believe that Fisher will eventually find happiness, you must also accept that part of the movie.
