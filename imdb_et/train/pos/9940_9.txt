This animation television is just the best way for kids to learn how the human body works. Yes, it's biology, but they never say it. <br /> <br /> I really think this is the best part of the "educational cartoons" stream. I remember finding small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton and, of course, organs. <br /> <br /> In the same stream you will find: "Il était une fois l" tomorrow ", which connects the great bang of human history in the 20th century. Also:" Il était une fois l'espace " ), but it is more of a fiction than a description of reality, because it will happen in the future.
