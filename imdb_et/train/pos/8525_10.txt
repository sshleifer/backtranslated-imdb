To judge this movie fairly, you need to think about the genre that it should be: kids. They had more instructions to make this movie (that is, it didn't get rid of the first humor and language), taking everything that was fun and enjoyable in this movie. Usually I get nervous, but it did pretty well. Knowing that he had no Fraiser star power than George, they used humor and I believe Showeman took the lead. A plot that is easy to observe and perhaps campy at times is well suited for a younger audience if you want to watch a movie and count on the award for an academic award, that's not the case, but if you want to watch a simple, fun, energy-saving movie you would make a good choice.
