Another attempt by modern Japanese leaders to redefine the Chambara genre. Successful and not to varying degrees. <br /> <br /> Buddhist monk has a vision that he must kill the Gojoe Bridge with the legendary (and very active) demon to reach the lighting. Although the Buddhist idea is not at the forefront, it is at the heart of the film, like Kurosawa's "Ran". It probably made the movie most interesting, even though it's "Rani" too close. <br /> <br /> Stylish visual direction and excellent photography will keep the movie interesting for the whole two hours and eighteen minutes. Leading participants are equally excellent. Music is really good. Two weaknesses are story and fighting scenes. The movie drags in the middle, which could have been fixed by some careful editing. And fighting scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups. It works for most movies, but the finals seem to be fooled. Another recent film is Tsui Hark's "Seven Swords", a great movie, but the allowed fighting scenes are disappointing. Asano really does not move like a sword fighter, his action is great, but he would be extraordinary in the usual chambara fight. <br /> <br /> A good movie, probably it's just just t wait for traditional swords.
