The slowest movie? Wow, who's now. You can't be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all you expect from the movie. I live in Oregon, so I was able to enjoy beautifully filmed photos of familiar but still amazingly beautiful Smith Rocks and other Central Oregon regions (as well as our own nice dwarf Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs who looked at the baby's Sissy cradle) at the beginning of the movie). These alone were enough to encourage me to improve the "average" score in the movie. <br /> <br /> Or .... Maybe it's all about what you expect. Having read the book AGES back and thinking about myself "goodness", no one from this interesting, peculiar, strange book could make a movie ... especially 20 years later, when the mores (MORAYS - can't do it) accent online) have changed "- I was actually quite pleasantly surprised when I was watching the movie for the first time in 1994 and even enjoyed watching it again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was finely cast, and I don't care what you all say, I was also pleasantly surprised by Rain Phoenix and John Hurt's performances: I'm not a lesbian or a bi or trans, but I've met many people who are similar to the people they were supposed to portray - and these "real" people did the same as these actors. - always a little "in." Gus Van Sant is one of the strange native Oregon, but he did a good job of adapting this crazy book IMHO.
