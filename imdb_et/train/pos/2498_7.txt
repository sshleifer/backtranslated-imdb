I chose this box "Danger after dark" and watched it only because of the interest in Hyde and Gackt's performance. I was waiting for a scary horror film that was a great gore festival and a very bad dialogue. What would it have been if it had been made in America. Instead, I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters and how Sho (Gackt) develops as a film. The skills of both stars were surprisingly good, given that they are not professional actors, and the director did a great job of doing it, in the future, minus flying cars and holographic stands. On one side, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film I saw him is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this movie he seems to be exactly the opposite of Shogo. Toshi is a brilliant, exuberant, and hyper, sort of comic relief with its antiques. Shogo was a big tough guy on the island who killed him without that thought. So look out for your performance if you're familiar with Battle Royale, so you can be very surprised. <br /> <br /> But don't throw the summary box on the back. because it's not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire. The fact that Hyde's character is a vampire is almost the background information that really happens in the foreground and who you love the last scene. This is really a moving image at some point, photography is really well done. This is definitely something to pick up next time at Blockbuster.
