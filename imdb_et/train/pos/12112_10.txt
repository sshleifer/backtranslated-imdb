Bread, all things based on the plot, is a prerequisite for this series of anime! I really laughed. The main character has a special power of bread that he was born with, and he goes to the bread baking school. I want it to be available on DVD, and it doesn't matter if it's subtitled or dubbed - that's so good. Even the thematic song is funny. At one point in the theme song, the horses are wearing an African-Japanese man with a French baguette like a samurai sword. These pictures don't make sense unless you see the anime. You laugh until your parties hurt. This is definitely a unique anime I've seen so far.
