Hasn't released the movie for the first time, but it was memorable. The performances of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were excellent, photography was a great, moving story and everything else was the highest. However, it seems to be pretty much forgotten <br /> <br /> Maybe because the UK is a strange market for that, but I haven't seen a television or video movie that is sad. Has it been more successful in the US than it may be rightly considered a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always keep in mind that 50% of the good movie is music, and while I'm not sure I think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo "What a Friend We Have in Jesus". The film then went against it. Am I right or wrong?
