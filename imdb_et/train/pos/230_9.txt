When I first saw this movie on the cable, it immediately became one of my favorite films. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film has an accurate picture of lunch and a racist attitude. Most attitudes came from Soll, an old plant owner who uses convicted persons as labor. Soll is what makes movement, his funny ramblings give us an overview of how the South was back. I think if Soll lives today, he would diagnose Alzheimer's. However, his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to him and to the convicted are difficult. Although he has racist views, he has grown up to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convictions he trusts are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the film, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler are both but big performances as well as Hass. <br /> <br /> This movie should be more known. But it's a DVD and it's worth the money. <br /> <br /> Raywyn
