From a third or fourth look back some time ago, I have been abandoning the DVD while waiting for La Mama et la Putain. In the meantime, I have read both the French scenario and Alain Philippon's monograph on Jean Eustache. The latter ends with depressing filmography, eleven films, fiction, dock and midway, impossible to see, or Honey in the amoureus of pets and Le Père Noël again. <br /> <br /> Some questions that hit me now: Polish Véronika French is a lot of spoken (and max d '"and maximum d" "). But does he have an accent? I think I can say that What does the lack of color add, especially in one place where the eyes are on the edge of the city? How does this friction differ between sleep and the journey that separates the worlds of Tempest and the winter story? Ditto Alphaville. We can imagine that past years have done it but is Eustache deliberately limiting the film's milieu? Is it a charming island? Is Alexandre a fairy tale? Alexandre is always choreographic, worried about how or where to stand or walk, what to say, when declaring those decisions to those who care less than he does what he does. Or is it his way of trying to chore out others by doing it himself? How different is he from Vertigo Scottie? (I say, I think, very.) What's the difference and is there one Eustache Léaudi and Truffaut and Godard? How different is the current one Isn't she still doing it, no matter what it is, the latest roles, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, whatever is approaching aging? When I arrived early in the Truffaut movie series by Antoine Doinel (Léaud's character). Already for a long time, every three or five minutes, twenty something men, a coat of hair, Léaud's hair, a nose looking in the direction, comes along the aisle. I don't know if it was a conscious or unconscious mimic. I was that age, but I have no idea what I saw. Not at least I recommend. But I have a brother who seems to have learned his carriage from Bresson.
