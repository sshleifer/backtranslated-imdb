Anyone who loves rheostat music, enjoys this movie. I have some small complaints, mainly related to the pace and the election of certain actors (not Maury) who are not really convincing in their roles, but I don't have time to write a detailed review. I want to warn anyone who has seen this movie or is going to watch this movie in Canada when it is CBC television: the version that is CBC is like the reader digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- don't look at it. It cuts out all the scenes and subplots (if available) from the movie. The CBC, which presents most of the intact movies, took out half of the internal from WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. It's terrible what they did with the film. Rent a video or watch it in the theater but don't watch it on CBC television.
