Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses her reality when she knows the death of her fan. He becomes more and more misleading about reality, and his emotional instability penetrates his actor. In the sense that he interrupts all the rules of operation and improvisation, but still succeeds in engaging his audience, the film makes it interesting (as a bit self-evident) for Cassavette as a filmmaker in parallel with his own struggles. There are so many ideas thrown around, and as a result, it becomes a bit confusing (I still think a lot about the connection between a dead fan and Rowlands), but the way they consistently present an interesting and thoughtful film in their raw form. It would be great for a double bill with a multifunctional ride. <br /> <br />
