This movie is not a dark, sharp masterpiece. I can be biased because the era of Apartheid is an area I've always felt. But I would say it is with Cry Freedom and Cry Beloved Country. Unfortunately, until a few days ago I would never have heard of this movie. The film is the least undervalued in the room, probably because it was a small film company. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actresses, is still plausible and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his dirty role well. Don't look for humor in this movie, no one. It is the last real, wild and sharp, and sensitive to bringing the box to the box. But the movies are as big as it makes you wonder why the biggest movies have never heard of?
