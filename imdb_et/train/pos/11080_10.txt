First, when people hear "GUY RITCHIE", they immediately think of SNATCH. Yeah, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone gets Guy Ritchie Snatch. They don't expect him to explore new boundaries. This film REVOLVER is different from the look; it is much darker and very complex. The reason I gave the rating 10 is that I had to look at Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie toys your head. It's very cleverly written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It was great, the cinema is beautiful, and you can recognize Guy Ritchie's personal touch (leadership style). <br /> <br /> What won me was the complexity of the protagonist and how we get more questions than answers.
