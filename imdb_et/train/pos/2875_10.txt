Cinderella In my opinion, the greatest love story ever said was that I loved it as a child and I now love it as a wonderful Disney masterpiece, one of my favorite movies I love about Disney. I can carve the Cinderella and Disney all day, but I don't give you a short description. When a young girl's father dies, she must live with her evil step with her mother and her same ugly and disgusting sister Drusilla and Anastasia. It's all day bad housework. Cinderella is only small mice that laugh around the house and her dog Bruno. If one day a letter is sent to your house telling all existing women to participate in a royal ball. Cinderella's evil step mother and steps sisters try to prevent their presence Cinderella finally gets her dream and desire and is able to take part in her captivity, genistics and beautiful nature to help her win her prince.
