I saw this movie two or more and found it well done! World War II was freshly finished and the so-called "cold war" began. This film can thus be defined as one of the best "propaganda", which is a patriotic film made by Americans, and secondly, people who are still formed from "Western NATO block" countries to cope with the next result. The film marks the centuries-old US power, predicting itself to have ended the war. A nice and funny way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and the real "espisode" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunken local India .. Must see it (at least once, curiosity in fashion) during propaganda time)! :)
