Valentine is now one of my favorite films. Death scenes are complex and most act well. Marley Shelton took the lead of a great woman (much better than in "I know ..."). David Boreanaz, for whom this film was the main reason, had a rather small role, but he played it well. The exception to the list of good players is Denise Richards. He was terrible in that. The only scene that I was pleased to see was his SPOILER * his death scene. All in all, this is a good movie. You should definitely look at it before seeing "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
