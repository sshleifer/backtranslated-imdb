This movie is great. It concerns the complexity of loving relationships, meaninglessly, but never lectures. The script will never let any character, not even the unhappy Johnny. It is also useful for on-site guidance, production planning, casting and shows. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the film and unlike "Cher" when he has ever been is a miracle to me. I look at Moonstruckit at least once a year and I looked at it again this Christmas Eve with my 16-year-old daughters and they loved it too. It is something with the heart to everyone and will leave you with joy.
