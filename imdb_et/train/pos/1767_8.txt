Steve Carell has made a career to portray a somewhat unusual straight man, first in The Daily Show and then in various support roles. In Virginia, Carell has found a smart and fun script that takes full advantage of her strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a medieval man who lives in a quiet, secluded life. Andy is a bit strange but uncomfortable guy. One night, Andy, for the first time in communicating with social workers, knew he was a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen), initially persuaded Andy of his situation. But it is clear that all three have a firm respect for the dignity of human dignity that Andy is, and they decide to help him by helping him stop his innocence. And so begins Andy's becoming an adult. Andy is the main innocent and most of the humor comes from his na√Øve situation in the film. Some of the humor is crude oil, but most of it is just a well-made intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film that really touched me, because Andy finds both romantic relationships and friends who might have been in her life for the first time. I'm not trying to portray a movie as a story of love or drama; this is your seat comedy. But every good comedy I've ever seen contains enough conscience to take care of the characters. A good comparison would be earlier this summer "Wedding". Virgo humor has a sense of humor, but some jokes might be a bit vulgar. I especially loved the end of the movie, which I thought was a great way to end the end. Without giving anything, he reminded me of "Something about Mary." Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you feel at the end of comedy. I highly recommend.
