I thought it was a fantastic movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me somewhat was in the beginning if everything had to be normal. It was very weird and unreal. The big cable company is mostly what I'm talking about. Moreover, the film was very creative. I think all the actions were well done, the actors acted perfectly as the characters of their characters. Everything fits well. It's really a shame that they don't have a sound. It would have been great! Because it's a Canadian movie and because it's one of my favorites, I'll give this movie out of 10!
