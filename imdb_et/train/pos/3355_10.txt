May 1938 Hitler in Italy. Preparing for a historic meeting with Mussolini. empty city, housewife and journalist. Meeting with two different worlds. Escape the sad life of the mother. Short execution of a classic victim. The story of loneliness and silence. The way of life and the desire for a form of fighting. Great Character - a talented book in the spring afternoon. This film is a poem that is characteristic of art to describe the tone of common loneliness. Request for an insignificant relationship with reality. And with your indoor environment. The images of Il Duce, the clumsiness of Antonietta, the patience and weakness of Gabriel, the art of the director, which gives the script to two great actors of grace, makes this film a subtle, subtle delicacy, a wonderful film of hypocrisy and admiration. an arbitrary decision about the nature of life and the reluctance of tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are masters of amazing intelligence. A clear masterpiece.
