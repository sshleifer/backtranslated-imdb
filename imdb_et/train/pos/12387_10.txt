None of the seventy films could prove a good and evil battle like Sentinel. Yes, yes, there were films like exorcism and others; but none of them hit such a protagonist's human element. If you have time, check it out. You may not be able to get past the dated devices, but it is a story that deserves to be hit. Then there are all the stars and soon the stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are subtle hints that will also lead to what's going on. Observe carefully. I had to look at it four times to get all the strange statements like "black and white cat, black and white cake". In addition, the books are very good. I'm just sorry they're not going to make another book a movie. It's so frightening to cross that movie.
