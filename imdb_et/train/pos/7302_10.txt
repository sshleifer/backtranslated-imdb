Since writing, John Carpenter's "Halloween" is almost 30 years old. Since then, it has created 7 sequels, remake, imitations, and every year around Halloween when they make these "Top 10 Scariest Movies" lists that are always there. This is quite an amazing film about a $ 300,000 budget, which was almost completely unknown and coming from young talent. I can go on and on, but here is the big question: how does the film hold on today? And all I can say is fantastic! Pros: A simple but spooky opening credit sequence that really creates a mood. Unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score directed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinema. A zodiac sign that holds up high carries some great shots and is careful not to show too much of your villain. Good performances then mostly from the unknown. Good sense of humor. Michael Myers is one scary and evil man. A lot of terrible moments that stay with you. Speed ​​is slow but steady and never pulls. Unlike most other films, it is more temporary and sharper than blood and large body numbers. <br /> <br /> Cons: It's probably not as scary as it is today. Many horses really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I want to start this section by saying it's not my favorite movie series. I know this is not a popular opinion, but it's really the way I feel. Despite this, it is really an important film that keeps the new generation of film films. And just because the new generation has been rebuilt, it doesn't mean it is forgotten. No way how not. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 5/5
