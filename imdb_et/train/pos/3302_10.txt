Perhaps Pakeezah does not belong to the most polished and achievable band of most films from India, usually associated with a Bollywood film (ie stickiness, farce, wholesale and successful western film / genre imitation). Pakeezah is an indigenous continent and authentic, almost Mrs. Butterfly. The characters are well developed, the direction, although sometimes they are not felt, sensitive and persuasive according to today's standards. During Pakeezah, Urdu was a militia of underestimated masters and how the dialogue gives the nuances of the dialogue era! The actors (especially the "look" and the dynamics of the symbols) are happy to see, although the nuances may disappear for modern viewers or for those who do not know the Muslim practices and customs of India. <br /> <br /> With an enchanting scenario, there is a beautiful musical score, complemented by the main character with classic Indian dance (kathak). As with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but he does not leave the audience without the viewer's feeling that he has been in a truly memorable cinema experience. Pakeezah is definitely what Indian cinema has brought and is unlikely.
