If I had just seen this exhibition as a pilot, I would have appreciated it 10. I was right on this proud new world. The following episodes have not fully fulfilled the promise, but I follow and hope it will improve. Production values ​​are incredible and performance is first-rate. I do not mind that it does not seem to be perfectly aligned with the BSG, because I am so interesting about this assumption and to be faced with two different exhibitions. I'm glad that both Esai Morales and one of my all-time fals Eric Stoltz have come back in my life (if only in a week) when I don't both. This is an exhibition that needs some thought from the public, and it's always a good thing. You have to turn your head around certain facets; things are not always the way they look and are definitely gray, both verbally and figuratively, shades, lines, characters and of course different virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the trip is quite a ride.
