I can't help a lot here, but praise the cue and the team who developed the Talespin and the others they did throughout their childhood, just as everyone who commented here has thoroughly enjoyed not only the quality of the animation, but the story. lines and characters. <br /> <br /> To classify this artwork as "Cartoon", one can never speak of justice. In fact, this offense is to classify it as "Cartoon", Talespin is an animation and nothing less. It is probably the greatest brilliant work that Disney is currently producing. When Disney "pulled" little from the air, they realized what they were doing and I am sure their souls have been tortured since then. br /> <br /> I'll take a moment to explain. From the first, which I think is the Darkwing Duck, Disney has been bothered by political correctness and has taken Quantum Leap back, They prefer Quantity Over Quality now let alone the space full of Monkey's story, I couldn't look meaningless when watching my kids " cartoons ", which they are now casting out, fear that they will all come to the homer Simpson in the future and 50% of the accusation would not have been allowed to look at me, I couldn't let that happen, which is why I have ALL since the late 1980s the hard disk drives shown until the mid-1990s, so one day my kids could not be injured in Cartoon Crap. today and enjoy the last childhood I have and what I had to hold on and I owe it to every Talespin. <br /> <br /> Talespin is undoubtedly the best animation ever created in the world for its depth, Charm, Wit, Compassion, Emotion, and the Truth of a really poor quality and story, many of which have been seen today, do you see it saying, "Ed, Edd and Eddie, or something else you mean?" Today's garbage can be compared to a 3-year-old uneven Hyroglyph that depicts Picasso. <br /> <br /> Next time you watch the episode e Talespin; Look at the wood grain on any timber object or building, such as higher rentals, and spit the quality and effort of this animation, even the backgrounds of one picture were made as they would use them again and again, buildings look at the Art Deco movement, which was popular over time, even when the vehicles are alive, OK, not all episodes were fantastic in the animation, but lower-level scenes were covered with a higher scene, so everything at all made it out at the end of the episode and you have probably never noticed if you are not focused and you have details attention. <br /> <br /> One thing I love is what I would like to call each episode of "Intentional Errors" or "Proposed Errors" and some have two, for example, sheep skin, where rebecca says, "You are something Baloo and Baloo Answers "Who, Me!" as innocent as a schoolboy, "look at rebecca's eyes, I won" t break the rest of the Balloon, but keep your eyes next time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who comments on comments is odd and 100% correct, I have nothing to add, something others have not already said here, Disney, WAKE UP, and coffee, You've slept for over ten years, stop production of garbage and return quality to animations and finish production of Cartoons, we have seen evidence of what you can do and want to do as soon as possible.
