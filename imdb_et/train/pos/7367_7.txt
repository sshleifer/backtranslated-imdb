Now I'm doing film studies at A.S level and "it's not a love song" is the movie we watched, and I think it's a very simple but complex film. When you scratch the surface, you will find a two-man rolling thriller-tracking film after the murder: - "sounds quite exciting". <br /> <br /> However, you must go deeper to reveal the true feeling of a true genre. As suggested, this is a love story between two homosexual love that is full of trust, deception and betrayal. We are not talking about this "love" directly through the film, but through the events that happen through, for example, how Heaton is acting towards Spike, this inviolable love affair is punished by our face. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a good example of why British movies should not be left "prachy" simply because they are made with a small budget. <br /> <br /> A good movie that has a tricky story, but it is definitely a taste of taste and may not be suitable for Hollywood fans.
