"May contain spoiler * <br /> <br />" All dogs go to heaven "is a great movie. I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old. I didn't understand it well, but when I saw it more and more I started I love this song. I love the songs of this movie. My favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon You Come Home." These are beautiful songs. When I was little, my sister couldn't even look at that part, except that this movie is great. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie fly around in the sky in the movie, and the "watches" are very smart, I also love itching, actually I have 3 eggs taxi, which is so cute. <br /> <br /> In general, I love this movie and recommend everyone to see it.
