It is a comedy of morality, so that occasionally bitterness occurs, but lightness softens all sarcasm and irony until suddenly one moment stops your heart and changes everything. <br /> <br /> This movie is wonderfully written and guided, a gem that looks great, everything works beautifully. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual and Romy Schneider is the perfect and glowing gem that should not be missed. A truly wonderful movie!
