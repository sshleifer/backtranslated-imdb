Just 9 out of ten directors' films we continue to admire. But don't look at this movie that hopes for "entertainment". Ang Lee takes an objective look at the relatively unexplored aspect of civil war. The film is beautiful, like all Lee movies, that it doesn't mean its characters. He creates characters, embodies them with life, problems and ambiguity ... and gives them a reality that often hits a lot closer to home with whom many are comfortable. This film has an action, but it is not a lover because violence is deeply disturbing and far from free. It's like characters. And as you might expect for one of the most horrible wars of humanity, violence is terrible. <br /> <br /> But to explore the greater human ambiguity that surely lived in the civil war, it is a masterpiece. Is war against slavery and abolitionism? Lee seems quite ready to blur a line that is so popular in images like blue and gray. Nor is it ideal, as shown by Gone with Wind. It is freedom, the desire to get something that is yours and fight for it. When you look at the characters, you ask yourself, "How can they fight to maintain slavery?" The fact is, I don't think they really are, and the fact that the film shows the problem why so many were forced into a civil war. <br /> <br /> The fact is that many of the characters we learn are fighting for "home" loyalty, although they may never have looked at what the home represents or do they really support its values. The message scenes are very mobile and still fine. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty that extend to the limits. And when the tension finally strikes, and these signs suddenly get "free" ... we see the birth of new men. <br /> <br /> It all interfered with Lee's beautiful integration of the human environment with breath-taking and frames. Lee has his own style, which is his, "somehow European" in his "art" (slow camera, unbeaten), Asian in his epic and story development, but somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many North Americans. /> <br /> Relax, let your perceptions of what civil war is, what a "western" genre, what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you to a world that is so fragile, so real, real that few of us see it comfortably. <br /> <br /> Lee continues what he did in the Ice Storm. Again, the film is a slow pace and without the obvious "direct" ... a definite sign of Lee's ability to direct without "putting" himself into the story or the screen. His direction is reinforced by what he brings out of Jewel (yes, singer), an unprecedented actress that puts amazing performance. <br /> <br /> Film for those who love film and are not lovers. standard Hollywood epic.
