Most of the feedback I've heard about the cutting machine has been quite confusing. The couple even says they think it's sucked. Well, for the people I say, get the f @ ckin imagination and go f @ ck yourself. It was a very fun flick. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical bug that attacks and transforms its hosts into those Gwar costume-seeking, deathbots called Necroborgs. Finally, you will learn that these mechanical bugs also add you to a small parasite that can control your activity due to the hot wires in your nervous system. Unfortunately, two lonely young adults who are looking for love are going through a path of mechanical error and before you know that transformation is taking place and blood is being sprayed. Is it possible to stop the transformation? Perhaps the way to stop this mechanical risk? Why are Necroborgs fighting with each other? Can two desperate individuals be able to express their feelings to one another and take disgust? Just one way to find out. <br /> <br /> When I hit the Meatball machine, I was cautious because of the mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a big surprise. The only weak points I mean are some unanswered questions, some average actions at times, and a bit confusing end. Anime feeling that parasites are changing little characters, and even with a small budget, it seems that this film hits the better mark much more than it can't. With an ever-evolving story that is interesting enough to keep yourself afraid of the whole mixed cool make-up effect and blood splatter, it's one of the flick fans of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans should check out. 8 out of 10
