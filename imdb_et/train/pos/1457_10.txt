I've been watching this documentary twice - and while I'm a big movie, most documentaries don't keep my attention. However, this film was enchanting. Almost every shot is perfect - so much more than a voice comment (which is not in this documentary). <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is amazing, I can't praise it. Mardi Gras Beads - Who Would You Think? <br /> <br /> Amazing and great choices from interviews - movie footage from a factory in China - the film makes you feel like you are. <br /> <br /> I am politically aware - and I have read a number of books on globalization, so there was nothing surprising about this film. But it made me think so much. <br /> <br /> I want so much that this world is a better place. <br /> <br /> Million cue filmmaker and thanks for making this movie. <br /> <br /> I want everyone to see it.
