I have to give it how it moves almost perfect because the content is really great. As the previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this movie has reached the bottom 100 of IMDB! That's totally ridiculous! Other films - especially those that share a dance theme - cannot wear candles by combining high, incredible and amazing dance courses. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the underlying story to complete (it's not just winning the race) is very easy to get into and surprisingly realistic. None of its main characters are in any way two-dimensional and at the end of the film it is very easy to feel emotional investment in them. (And even if you're not a crying guy, you can get a little nervous before you roll out on credit.) \ TI would definitely recommend this movie to dance lovers and even more so to those who appreciate a nice and well-functioning story. How is he not, of course, perfect (what is the film?), But it is definitely a movie cut that uses a pretty face to hide a semi-burnt plot and / or characters that lack substance. The actors and settings of this movie make a very realistic ride that is equally pleasing to the amazing dancers!
