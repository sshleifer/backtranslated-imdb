"Once in a lifetime" is a very good movie. However, this is not good for everyone because vulgar language is widely used and violence in some situations. In the film, anecdotal, credible way to represent "life" in NYC districts where drug problems are important. This image, in turn, is used to design the most thoughtful and suspicious drama supported by powerful dialogues (but some of them I realized because English is not my native language. The video is OK). Sometimes it has been a bit overwhelmed, but I think it fits well with the general orientation Fishburne gave to the film, which gives more thoughts than just performing a good style, especially in managing time / action. Characters, though not simple, are easily linked and the actors do a good job of doing them. By the way, I enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you're not too prude, you should enjoy this movie once, twice, three times. I rated movie 9/10.
