Director Sidney Lumet has done some masterpieces, such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico.But, he did not have too much luck in his latest works. Now, Lumet brings her best film for decades and I think it's a real masterpiece: before the devil knows you're dead. I think this movie is like the rebirth of Lumet. This movie is a great story that deeply, I have a lot of layers. I also think the movie's finishing is perfect. Performances are brilliant.Philip Seymour Hoffman brings, as usual, excellent performance and he is undoubtedly one of the best actresses of our days. especially, the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances that were unfortunately neglected by the pathetic Oscar. The film has a good intensity, partly tha nks to performs and partly thanks to an excellent scenario. Before the devil knows you are dead, the real masterpiece is with perfect direction, a great scenario and great performances.
