Whoopi was the only reason I looked at Oscare this year. He's fun. Of course, the exhibition had a serious serious side. He was great not only because he was funny, but also because he said some things to be said in a public forum. White people should be reminded that Hollywood award ceremonies, employment and representation are in a racially balanced way. "Black" awards should not be required. White bread, milquetoast candidates and judges must bring their heads to the sunshine and see that the great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. The release of Woody Allen from the air was a bad taste. He had no business there. The thing is that it is the first Oscar presentation I watched because The Color Purple was the prize. The failure of the vote was painful to me while I was in the exhibitions until 2002. This does not mean other performers. Billy Crystal is a rebellion.
