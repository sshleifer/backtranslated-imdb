IQ is a lovely romantic comedy with two great actors who look good on the screen. The plot is the girl's wrong man, the boy gets the girl's form but makes a definite point to love with the heart, not the mind. Adding Albert Einstein and his genius games provides a great comic book. In general, it's a good movie. Not big, but good
