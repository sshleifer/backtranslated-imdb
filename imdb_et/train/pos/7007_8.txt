The first scene gives you tips on what's going on here. It becomes more and more apparent when the story rolls. Acting is a great collection and these actors touch your soul. Even if I knew what was happening, the motive was very confusing. I'm still confused about why Ben did what he did. We saw "other thoughts" on our face, but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to contradict his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and moving story, but it left me confused. Maybe it was a movie point. I liked the movie and Wil Smith being able to make another good movie. This man knows how to attract the audience!
