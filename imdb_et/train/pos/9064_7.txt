Watching this movie, I sat with my children. We all found it to be a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, the fifth class will tempt him and lead to worms. <br /> <br /> Betting and Billy only has so much time to eat 10 worms. From that moment on, the bully and his friends try to eat, fry or bake worms to try and get Billy sick so he can lose his bet. <br /> <br /> Billy remains strong and eats her way more and more like everyone, even tempting her friends. <br /> <br /> I won't tell you if he wins the bet or not ... you just have to look to find out, but I think if you like good movie movies that are right for you. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this movie is not just for boys, I have all my daughters and they really liked it.
