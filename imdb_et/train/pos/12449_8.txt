Finally, a good film by Modesty Blaise appeared, which not only tells the story, but actually talks about the "real" story. I admit that this is a bad movie if you expect an action roller, but when you stop on your journey and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that this is a story that is very close to Peter O'Donnell's original. You have a story to tell about how Modesty became the great person she is. It's not a movie that attracts new fans, but a movie that tells a real story. Some things might have been better, but if you do not forget about the movie '66, this is a great movie. So whether you're a fan, sit back and just have fun with the actual story with a cover book to change Modesty's story.
