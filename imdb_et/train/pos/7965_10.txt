This movie was fantastic ... it made me laugh, made it stupid, and most importantly it was talking about it in animals !! this movie should be seen by all kinds of people! this is one of my favorite films and I love it so much that I just had to comment on it! it is both a feeling of heart and a wonderful story that forms a wonderful and cordial film, my favorite sign is shadow. This is because I think he is the most interesting and charming. I had a golden retriever like a shadow, I miss him so much !!! she was my best friend and I knew she would be happier if she died, but I miss her with all my heart! this movie is the best I love and everyone should! Love your pets no matter what they do, pamper them forever !!!
