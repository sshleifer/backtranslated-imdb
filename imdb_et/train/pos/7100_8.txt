I saw his movie in Dallas, Texas, when it appeared in 1986. I remember giving them prizes to show the movie. After seeing the movie, I see why. The film was neither bad nor excellent. The problem with this movie was that he tried to talk about the side story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to surround it with the Masters Saga. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about the second wave of Robotech masters who attack the Earth. They even used the same scenes from Master Saga, but with a different dialogue. As a child, I loved the movie. But unfortunately I haven't seen this adult and can't give a better overview. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would like to see the film and reassess my position. By saying, does anyone please release this movie to the world to judge? I love Robotech and can't wait for Shadows Chronicles.
