I only know one other movie that could compete with Open Night and that is Bergman Persona. Both movies are just amazing, they have many ideas at first glance that are hard to understand. We have a deep meditation of the relationship between art and life, because one actor, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds himself more than he does on stage than he wants. One of the casual deaths of his fans, a young girl who announces his love for Myrtle and then gets hit by a car, leaves the actress a deep sign. He asks himself the question of his aging that will affect him until the only solution becomes alcohol. But it doesn't help much and Myrtle is one step away from madness. The scene where he kills a dead girl's imaginary (or not) spirit is one of the most exciting scenes I found in Cassavets. The film ends with a brilliant display on behalf of the director, filming the theater scene, where he and Gena Rowlands improvise the scene, because Myrtle is too much drunk for the opening night to fill his part exactly. This scene was spontaneously filmed with a lively audience, laughter is genuine, chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely amazing. If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers great entertainment with great entertainment, this movie is right for you.
