ODD COUPLE is a classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous feature film, featured by Felix Unger, an obsessive pure freak who moves with his best-friend Oscar Madison, an athlete and a complete slob. Frances throws her out of her apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets the moment he does it. Neil Simon's classic comedy came first to Broadway, where Art Carney played Felix and Walter Matthau Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes over Carney in a movie version that has a memorable result like Felix Unger. Not only is Lemmon not only in a terribly funny role, but so vividly real that he puts the element of melancholy on the face of fantax Unger. Luckily, Matthau promised to re-establish his role as an Oscar, a single comic book gem that gives his entire consistently laugh. This merger of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be a comic book that was re-visited in nine other films. With both participants no longer touching us, watching this classics becomes more touching, but no less fun. Simon's game has been nicely extended to the screen with a silent prologue that crowned the depressed Felix suicide attempt, which is the winner. Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner Oscar poker games and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Piedgon Sisters, blind Oscar and Felix dates are in the backdrop of supporting pain. Of course, later it was a great TV series Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but nothing like the original. Pleasure from start to finish.
