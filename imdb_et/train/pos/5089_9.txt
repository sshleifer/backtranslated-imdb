True, it doesn't follow the book very closely, but it's still very fun. Swayze's role was much better than I expected. And Doody excluded the "foolish woman from desert depth" image, most of which we probably had expected (cf. Kate Capshaw "Indiana Jones & Doom Temple"). <br /> <br /> It is amazingly better than Richard Chamberlain's amazing pair of Quatermin tights. <br /> <br /> It resembles the West in many ways. The only thing I didn't care about was the whole mystery, but I think it's an integral part of the genre. As "how do you have an African adventure story without witchcraft teachers and irregularly wise migrants?" Heh.
