We don't have to lose this movie, it's one of the biggest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the film is one of Unuvelle's fashionable unforgettable. Jean Eustache is no longer on this land, we have only those black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most valuable French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> P.S.: Excuse English ...
