I remember this movie when I was about 7 years old; and when it shocked me. I had seen a violent film before, but I never saw the effects of the film on violence and reality. This movie not only shows it, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this film did and the crash couldn't do was to be true. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had built-in anti-Asian prejudices) and came to a morally higher position. The Grand Canyon came from such a raw and realistic point of view that it actually reached a higher ground than a crash. Especially when comparing the end. The end of the crash is this purely small end that binds everyone up. Although the Grand Canyon just ends in a silent note, where you don't know something that changes in the character's life, but because life goes on, there's no end to it. No matter how good ... bad you are. There is no end to the second chapter.
