I've seen this movie a dozen times and it's awesome. But the only thing was that at first it was too much to talk about who went with whom. I think it would be interesting to do that. But on the official site they said they didn't do it because so many people have saved it while watching it. What happened to Patty Dunning? He's a pretty good actor. He has made several other films in the 70s and 80s, but we have not heard of it since. I know for sure that Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, is working on RD Films accounts. In general, I have to say that the series itself is like the Left in the old school.
