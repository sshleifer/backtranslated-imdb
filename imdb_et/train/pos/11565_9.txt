SPOILERS <br /> <br /> According to Jean-Paul Sartre, "other people in Hell" are. "Odd Pair" shows Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau how accurate it is. Like Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau, they create two good friends who decide to live together. Since both are getting more and more frustrated with each other, the laughs come thick and fast before Felix leaves, leaving the Oscar changed and purely individual. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon, as Ungar, is absolutely perfect as a neurotic, cleansing obsessed with divorce living as one man. Unlike Lemmon's character, Walter Matthau is just as good as a slippery sports writer who just wants to play poker to make money for his child benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are excellent in their chosen parts, to some extent Neil Simon depends on a beautiful script and at the same time because they work well as a team. As two friends who are fundamentally different in their lifestyle, although they are similar in their relationship with spouses and children, these two late major actors create a partnership that is practically impossible to restore. It is so great that the world yelled so much like that two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemmon were again connected again. The idea of ​​following Hollywood's obsessive obsession with the aftermath could have worked to some extent, but at the same time it could never originate from repeating the original movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's not really possible to say anything else. Simon, with an amazing script full of humor and laughter, was already hit by the creators of this movie. However, casting Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Hungary and Oscar Madison is still the most important part of this film. "Odd Couple", its traditional soundtrack (which even got the "Simpsons" tribute), it's a great script and it's genius-leading men, a tribute to cinema and memorial.
