WEDNESDAY WEDDING is a great example of RAPTURE in the coming weeks and the week after that. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the value and content values ​​of this independent Christian film. <br /> <br /> PRODUCTION VALUES. Hey, this is an independent film with a shoe-string budget, so it's a bit hairy (if your standard is the A-list Hollywood price). But when it comes to other independent films, this film is perfectly acceptable. More important than the exemplary style, costumes and music are the narrative itself. Is the story appealing? Do dramatic moments work? Does the story trajectory build a satisfactory climax? The answer to all these questions is unqualified "yes". The side note is really important technical things - consistency, sound, lighting - good. The viewer is able to look at this example without sloppy finishes. <br /> <br /> TABLE OF CONTENTS VALUE. The film's message is great. If you think how many ideas a filmmaker developed in a short 69-minute period, you will begin to appreciate your art. He presents the message of salvation, the consequences of unbelief, the threat of rebound, the jerk of truth, and the threat of a world-dominated satanic government with burning, imagination and, most importantly, the evangelical film - with the accuracy of the Bible. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker is a good storyteller. For example, he develops the message of salvation in two essential ways: (1) He shows us, through action, the reality of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for us. This is accomplished on a subspace where the zoo is a little poisonous snake and almost dies. The only treatment is blood from someone who is immune to snake venom. The poison is like sin; treatment is like the blood of Christ that is on the cross. (2) The filmmaker also develops a rescue message through dialogue. He has different signs that explain the truth about man's sin and the need for salvation through faith in Christ. So the filmmaker uses both the story and the dialogue to tell their story. <br /> <br /> As a side note, the Evangelical Christian film actually contains dialogue and scenes that deliver a clearly defined message. A field of salvation that is clearly spelled out in the Evangelical Christian language, images and theology are also perfectly acceptable. Criticizing this film for the Christian nature is absurd; it is similar to the Nike commercial crisis to promote sportswear. What else would evangelical Christian filmmakers, if not a film that tells their case? Moreover, the fact that the filmmaker uses the idea that the incredible is left behind in the ungodly world is again perfectly acceptable. The filmmaker uses the dramatic potential of this idea perfectly. How do I know? I heard a vision of a woman who was back in 1974; he lived in his memory for thirty years later. How many movies do you want to say about it? All around, a very enjoyable, thought-provoking show. I plan to show it to my other group in the church.
