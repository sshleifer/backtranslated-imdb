It seems that it is becoming fashionable to hang "Basic Instinct 2", so a significant part of the audience (including critics) found this dread even before it was released. Sharon Stone's trash still looks like a fashion man who, like all of us, is now 14 years old, and unlike most of us, it's still wonderful. The first comments on this movie were so cruel that I had to see myself. In my opinion, this sequel is almost as good as the original film, but it is not as bad as most of the comments pretend. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, Henry Bean and Leora Barish are not Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just a fun, average thriller, and besides adding Jerry Goldsmith's original score, it is no longer similar to its predecessor. Even Stone gives a different dimension to his character, creating a cheerful, fucking Catherine Trimelli, who gets excellent ranking among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. He is an intelligent actor who is not afraid of taking risks and playing in the camp during his spare time. Unfortunately, he seems to be the main target for those who enjoy this folding. He became too successful, too big a icon, and like all the actors who have reached that level, his time has arrived and he has now destroyed the Hollywood audience. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are much better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and much more interesting than Michael Douglas: his actions are flawless, giving otherwise a one-dimensional character a tight and complex dimension. Since he has more screen time and this is the axis of the film, he can keep your attention from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a big movie; I simply express my agreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that the film itself, like a film, will shape the opinion of most of the spectators.
