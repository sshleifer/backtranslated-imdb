Anyone who doesn't think Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are the biggest movies of all time, needs to have their head checked. It somehow manages to be both completely naughty and non-brainer, but also terrible knowledge and smart at the same time. One of those rare films that actually improves on the predecessor, Bogus Journey can be enjoyed over and over again. The remarkable highlights are Duel with Death and the end that is very "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all the trash of this matrix and do what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan Bill and Tedis: The Return.
