This movie contains more action before opening credits than in Hollywood films. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and the letters Jet Li. This team has brought you many worthy Hong Kong movie productions, including China's multiple times. The activity was fast and furious with amazing wire work. I only saw wires in two frames. In addition to the activity, this story was strong and not just a filler. You need to look for a Hong Kong movie theater in your area to find other competition movies. They are really worth looking at and usually never disappointed.
