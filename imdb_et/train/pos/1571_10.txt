Not since Spongebob Squarepants, I've seen larger comics on television. The colors are great, the voices may not be better, the characters are both original, big comics. Hope Nickolodean develops this drawing. I hope the season DVD will soon be released !!! I love such cartoons and I hope more people will tune in with this great comic. It is very difficult to find a Season DVD, so if anyone finds a store that sells it, please let me know. The only kitten that is available at Nick Shop is a great shirt, but very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; and who is not? you also love Catscratch!
