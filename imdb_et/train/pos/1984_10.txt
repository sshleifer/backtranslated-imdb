One of the best music that is timeless and worth seeing over and over again. Delicious! Functioning, especially Ron Moody as Fagin, is great. Costumes are fine .... even ragged. <br /> <br /> Two young boys playing Oliver and The Artful Dodger are great talents. Oliver Reed does a great job of depicting Bill Sykes, where you can't help but hopefully he will end up in a terrible end ... what he does. <br /> <br /> Dancing is choreographically smart and amazing. Oliver is able to have a sort of My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. Film for the whole family.
