Cure uses a voice to create an intense mood. Although VO takes all the features of the film into consideration, it does not take an astonishingly visual story. Using multiple movie stocks adds a lot of texture to the story. The choice of b & w and color matching worked fine to slow down. The end will make you jump even though you are able to predict the outcome. I had a particularly pleasant movie break. Close-ups of the love scene are also beautiful and reflect a delicious eye. The piece is quite short, but achieves a lot. Close editing helps to prove what a short film can do. Worth seeing more than once!
