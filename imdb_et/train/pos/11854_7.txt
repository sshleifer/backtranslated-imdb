I agree with Jerry. This is a very underestimated space film (of course, how many good budgets are underestimated?) When I remember correctly, the mystery solution was a kind of 2001 variation (but not a "rip-off"). because the ship's leading computer was actually a man who had somehow become a computer. And like HAL, they tried to untie their "mind", but not its mechanical parts, and like HAL, it made it a disaster. There is at least one funny moment. If Christopher Cary's character, who can't find food, finds an abandoned pet, there's some kind of ominous moment, but then there's no obvious thing.
