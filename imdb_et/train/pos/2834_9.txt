I have not seen much German comedy, but when this movie is something I want to go, I have to see more! A simple but effective story takes two very different people from Germany to Italy after Eva, the mother of two unemployed, finds out that her husband's wife communicates with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. I'm not going to post anything, but what results are a very funny series of events with a perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has since seen the film for the first time. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... don't let babies fool you into thinking it's a family movie) who love comedy - even those who don't know the language.
