This is a delightful film that is upstairs for my wife, daughter and I found it irresistible. The plot is just crazy, but the "rings true" world soap operas all their outrageous unlikely and impossible. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the performances by Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I'm no better than Kline playing THICKheaded. Field's real desperate need for attention and confirmation - and his almost bipolar mood - played well in Field's famous (notorious?) Background. Oscar exclamation. People with such a large salt are too rare in this world. I think this is the only movie where I couldn't find the patience with Whoop's Goldberg characterization; I thought he was "on the ground" in every note he hit. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first class. Just a great movie when you're in a mood to drive and LAUGH!
