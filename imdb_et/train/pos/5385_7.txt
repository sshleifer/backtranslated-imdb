I have never watched the "Hero of the Next Action" exhibition and, until reading the other remarks here, did not know that this film was the "prize" for this competition. I had just shifted the channels and found it and found myself watching, daring to end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is made (the most dangerous game, etc.) but I hoped and got almost "got" - how the protagonist finally won the hunter. I think the high technology was overpriced (GPS) and gave me cold flash flash feedback from the Night Rider, but it wasn't too redundant. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie was the SOD (Suspend Belief) required by the Viewer. Do we really think someone who is driving in a helicopter would be able to read countless guilty patrols at a public bridge and NO COPS will appear for investigation? Can a limousine make countless donuts at the intersection of Las Vegas? Pleeease. Too many things of this type - fun to watch, but keep it at least credible, thank you very much. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the end was disappointing. Bad Star Trek Episode. At least for now, I understand why it worked so exciting, except for Zane, who doesn't go as far as she deserves IMHO - they were the winners of the reality show. <br /> <br /> Tap me out.
