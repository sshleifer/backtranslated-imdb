The main payer of the RKO radio, Bombardier, marks Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers at the bombers' school. O'Brien and Scott argue about teaching methods, while their students talk about Anne Shirley. O'Brien's methods turn out to be a sound during a bombing attack in Tokyo. Scott and his team are caught and tortured by Japan, but deadly wounded, Scott succeeds in firing a gas lift, providing the perfect target for his companions. Stylishly, Bombardier is one of the more schizophrenic moments of war films, with a little bit of (slightly Eddie Albert's death) alternating with ridiculous "Yellow Spiritual" melodrama scenes (literally in Japan stinks through his teeth as they torture helpless Americans). Although Bombardier is unable to contribute, it is still an entertaining propaganda effort (the film is sometimes incorrectly listed as Robert Ryan's debut who has actually appeared in front of cameras since 1940. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in a copy of this movie please contact me at iamaseal2@yahoo.com
