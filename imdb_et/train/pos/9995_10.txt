It's a movie you want to see with a glass of wine, fire and legs. It does not require a lot of brain power to follow, so it is very good after a long day. I would say it is very unrealistic - if you expect something serious then don't worry, but it is very funny. Just thought the businessman was going so far that he agreed to live on the slum for a while and actually enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
