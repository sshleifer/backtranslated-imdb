I have to admit that from EROS MOVIE COLLECTION it must be what I love most, but also one that I have reviewed. The story is something that really monitors you. Many EROS films have a plot that looks like a hammer cutter that cut it off before you look at it. Everyone focuses on sex and who gets how many different people reach the end of the movie. And oh dear god, never look at one of these movies when someone pulls the gun out. It doesn't work because it's almost ridiculous, but you don't want to waste that energy. <br /> <br /> "Loss Control" is exactly the same as its name. The main character, the leading character (wonderfully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is what a person controls over his senses, body, and feelings. And one man makes everything for him, makes him a second wife. But the mirror is broken at the same time. It makes a great movie that I wish I had come out for the first time !! <br /> <br /> 10/10
