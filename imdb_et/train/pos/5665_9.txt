They were the first show for me. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. Sleepy little Mayberry-like place with one little difference. Sheriff is really Satan. There's a spoiler. Not like you don't see it in 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep him good, but it's an uphill battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and wants to spend time with him to teach him ways of darkness. Fine. Smelly. He doesn't always mind. He is usually a hero. Everyone owes him great benefits, because he often creates an accident and saves it. So every time you think someone finally puts him down, one of his friends comes out to sabotage. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite episodes was Lucas and Caleb in the cabin in the woods. and some men with arms decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson of evil. <br /> <br /> The Ted was hesitant to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half a conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have shot him now. If he had a real conscience, he would never have become a criminal. So he started calling him Half-Ted. It was pretty funny. He destroyed the criminals. And, of course, he always had 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted. And of course he was in complete control at all times. They really did prefer you to Satan. <br /> <br /> Very great show. it was one of my all-time favorite fears. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> It's a good company.
