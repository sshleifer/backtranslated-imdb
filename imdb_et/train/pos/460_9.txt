This is a great new crime series that brings together three older British television stands (Denis Waterman, James Bolam, and Alun Armstrong) as retired detective, leading to old cases, under the guidance of a younger, career-oriented Amanda Redman. The three peculiar, upset old police make an excellent team, employing twenty-five-year-old detection techniques in police forces, which have since gone a long way - sometimes efficiently, at other times, to the horror of their senior officers. These three are depicted sympathetically, warts and everything. There are great comics and some very moving, as each of these three must be compatible with aging and their past legacy. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we're allowed another series next year), every symbol was developed. The widow James Bolam cannot accept his wife's premature death. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to accept his grandfather's role. And even your obsessive Alun Armstrong is assisted by his new friends to fight his past demons and continue taking the medicine! Although Amanda Redman faces an all-out conflict between life and career. The story has been interesting if it depends more on the miracle of DNA testing. But this is a combination of the four best UK players that have changed the series unchanged.
