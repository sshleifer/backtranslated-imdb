I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he was obliged because he had already seen the movie and he said it was okay. I thought the title was a little comb because our store version was "Fear: Halloween Night". I was expecting this movie to be somewhat of a robbery of Halloween with a killer boy. But it opened up with a good scene, and the killer immediately murdered two victims and died twenty years later, when his son, who witnessed him, killed two people (including his mother) and even saw his father's suicide go to a solitary cabin. forest with his friends and girlfriend, where he tries to face his fears until the wooden shape lives with his fathers spirit. A pretty good sequel and I never saw the first one.
