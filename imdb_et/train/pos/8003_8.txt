This movie is a great entertainment to watch with a woman or girl. There are lots of laughs and some very interesting little nudist stories. The actors are all very interesting and certainly worth their natural beauty. Maslin Beach is full of different types of nudists and personality. The terrain of the Australian coast is just great. What a place to say and one day it can become my hiding place. I really enjoy this movie and every time I watch it, I enjoy it more. I would like to see more of these signs and I don't always know what got them. Although the plot is somewhat soft, this film is, of course, a great excuse to just sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous beach of Maslin with these wonderful nudists and their personal stories.
