Absolutely great. Powerful and pleasant. The most convincing documentary series ever made on war. This tone offers sharp contrast to the often attitudes of the media often exhibited by World War II. Instead of choosing fear from the fear of war, it allows Sir Laurence Olivier quietly to take back the back of the war: everywhere dead bodies, explosions, frightened citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocent. Indeed, it really brings home that mankind is capable when all the usual "civility" rules have been removed. Man is a hobbyist in a truly natural state, he returns to a more lively form that is capable of committing crimes that are still shocking and enchanting for 60 years. Perhaps for the twentieth century, there could be an after-class called "the war of the century", which was really a century of horrors. I think it is an enormous amount of irony that he took an event that caused the death of 50 million people in such a massive and magnificent series as this.
