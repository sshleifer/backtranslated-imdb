Peter Bogdonavich has made a handful of really great movies, and TI EVERY SPACE is one of his best. The cast could not play this light, but a little bit of bitterness of comedy. Interestingly enough, the witty, light-touched Bogdonavich works so hard that the film is given a rather irritating emotional core. Fresh and instant, the film starts with absolutely no explanation. We don't have soundtrack music. We meet the characters, and when Bogdonavich slips on the streets of New York, the film opens effortlessly. The Robby Muller camera captures all this with the discounted ease that seems random, but certainly not. The cast is terrible. Anyway classic.
