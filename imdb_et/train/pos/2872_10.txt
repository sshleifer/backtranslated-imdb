I think it's a completely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (the voice of Lucille La Verne) was really sad. If you want to know why you want it, you have to see the movie. On the other hand, despite the fact that he did a lot of housekeeping, the Cinderella (Ilene Stanley's voice) was a very beautiful lady. For me the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong. Before I put it on, I would like to say that all the players in this movie were very good. Finally, I recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You're a good time to go to a video store, rent or buy, get back with your friend and watch it.
