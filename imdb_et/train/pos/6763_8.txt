Elegance and class are not always the first words to remember when people (at least the people who make such a thing) sit and talk about the film's dwarf. <br /> <br /> But some of the best films in the genre, "Out of the Past", "Killers", "Lonely Place", "Night and the City", manage the level of smooth complexity, raising them beyond the desperate phrase and its connotations predictive shadows, fedorade and femme-fatales. <br /> <br /> "When the sidewalk ends," it is quite difficult to find a movie - the only copy perhaps of Manhattan's best-equipped video store was the AMC cable TV's raw delivery - belongs to the category from the classic. <br /> <br /> From the moment when the black cloud of opening the credit passes, the curtain pulls the rotten single detective Marc Dixon into a crumbling world and when moments pass, it gets closer and threatens to suffocate. Of course, he's the familiar "cop in the dark past," but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a dark enthusiasm and a worrying intensity that makes you so uncomfortable as it looks. And yes, he has been beaten by suspects for too long and the newly promoted leader (Karl Malden, usually a robust and commanding outing) warns him "last time". <br /> <br /> But Dixon hates these pieces too much to stop. And the boy hadn't come? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, Dust Sticks, Mugs, Gutter" speaks when this boss harsh nut lowers him and rolls all the complaints the office has received about Dixon's better hook. The advice is to cool down for you. But he takes his stuff. <br /> <br /> And what is the world of problems when it relies on its instincts and falls back to nature that may or may not have been passed on from the generation before. <br /> <br /> She is right now with the police, the syndicate, her own partner. Dixon's questionable participation in the "investigation" of the murder threatens his work, makes him wonder whether he is just as ground as he has sworn to bring him. Like Bogart "Lonely Place", he can "get what he is?" If he has not turned elsewhere, he discovers that he has practically condemned his unexpected relationship with the seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney) who seems to be able to change his infertile bachelor when he comes home. until. Solidifying this excellent film is tense and engaging. A group of writers who contributed to the production polished the script with a high gloss - the dialogue is delicate, without breaking into a dated parody feed, passionate without becoming melodramatic or delicate. <br /> <br /> And all this top-notch direction and action is not too slippery or frustrated to let go of the emotional care of the movie. Gene Tierney angelic, soft focus beauty is used to a great extent. She shows herself as an important actor and her gentle, kind character is as infinite as her psycho "Leave to Heaven." The scenes between Tierney and Andrews Dixon grow more intensively and touch on what he himself is destroying. At the end of his rope, cut, bruised and exhausted, Dixon takes his lot together: "Innocent people can get into terrible blockages ..." he says. "One wrong move and you're over head." Perhaps it makes the film so overwhelming that it can be wrong for almost everyone - especially a person trying to do so well - with a slight shift in the wind. , one wrong decision or punch or, scary, due to factors you don't control. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, bringing them to the surface. "When the pavement ends" it does it realistically. <br /> <br /> (One zero-select aside: this is otherwise a silver bad bad movie that doesn't seem to be inappropriate for Mystery Science Theater. It's very weird.) Noir fans - hell, NOT a movie fan - who hasn't seen it, is a terrible treat.
