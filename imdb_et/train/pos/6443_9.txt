Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. It was suggested to me a few weeks ago by fried. I've never watched it or even noticed it, because it falls (as usual) in the category "Swedish movie" and those who rose up (like me) with Hollywood products tend to be skeptical of any foreign films. Hell, what paradigm changes! The film touches me because it just keeps my hope that humanity will be right. The Swedish village is just a pattern for all areas where people live together - under the control of faith, misunderstandings, lack of courage, prophecies, hidden brutality, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... It takes the trigger to break all masks (who keep them one) and let them feel that we are all just people who want to live their lives. I can never stop to see such stories because it keeps my hope as described above. Five minutes, including the story of Gabriella's song, including her performance, is one of my highlights! Thank you Kay Pollaki just for those 5 minutes that made me happy!
