The Stargate SG-1 is the spin of the 1994 Stargate. I am so glad that they have decided to expand on this issue. The exhibition goes out of its first episode, retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once more to meet his old companion dr. Daniel Jackson. In the first two episodes, we meet with a very intelligent Samantha Carter, who doesn't let anyone walk, and there is Teal'c, a quiet, compassionate warrior who breaks his false god and joins the crew. The main bad guys are called Goual, they are parasites that can enter their brains by controlling them and doing evil actions. Every Gouald who has enormous power is often considered to be the "Lord of the system." The warriors behind Gouald are called Jaffa, who create parasitic Goual into their bodies until Goual can be inserted into the human brain. <br /> <br /> Through episodes, we can mostly see SG-1, a research team consisting of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c and Sami passes through a wormhole that immediately takes them to other planets (called the Stargate) and they come in contact new cultures or bad ones. Some episodes are in the world, which means that they do not go through the Stargate in time and deal with urgent problems on Earth. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you will begin to see SG's decline -1 team in a tight group and more characteristic buildings. This, in turn, means even more world episodes that are perfectly understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this show is good, some story lines aren't always packed in the past few years and less emphasis on gateway. But still, cutting edge science fiction!
