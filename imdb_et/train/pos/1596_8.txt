Although Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good colleagues for them - this is where Loretta and Ronny are in love for 50 years. All the cast work makes Aiello a nice job for John Mahoney - it shows real life. Although I saw it for a long time, I'm glad he finally hit Cage where he was recognized for his talent in Hollywood. Between Music and Scene The Arguments of the Opera Kitchen Table - This is a very fun movie.
