What is undoubtedly the best outing film of all time, the four city boys stand up to the anger of nature, the story of survival. It is Georgia, where there are forests, mountains and natural rivers. <br /> <br /> Director John Boorman decided to use local people instead of actors to portray secondary characters. These locals suck the film at a depth that is unequal in film history. No central "actor" could ever come close to the remarkable faces, voices or activities of these people. I don't remember a movie where secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As far as anything else, this tough reality makes this movie so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another strength is the movie theme. Nature, nature, can be violent. How suitable it is for the device to be South America. Very few places in the US are or have been as violent as the Redneck country. The story of the best Darwinian survival represents the idea of ​​the film that people are part of nature and not separated from it. <br /> <br /> "Fulfillment" is the result of a great deal of time when, unlike today, Americans have expressed concern about the lost wilderness. The wonderful landscapes, birds, frogs, crickets and the roar of the river rapids with the absence of civilization all give the environment a message. And this is another strength of the movie. Even halfway through the film, the tension does not become extreme and it will never let, not before the final credit credit. Very few films can maintain this level of intensity on such a long plot of land. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film's technical quality is top notch. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography is great. The dialogue is interesting. And acting is terrible. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is completely cast and does a good job. And Jon Voight should have applied to the Oscar. If the film has a weak link, it is the music that strikes me. <br /> <br /> In general, Deliverance is almost certainly a pleasure for viewers who love to go out. Even for those who do not, the gritty testimonies, actors and plot tensions are enough to watch this movie, one of the best in cinema history.
