I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I never watched it. The other day I was a nanny and my cousin never saw all the dogs go to heaven, so we rented both movies and looked at them today and he really loved those movies. So many memories had to look back at this movie again and I have to admit that I even called a little. I'm 22 years old and still ending. All the dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and I have shocked honestly this rating of 5.8, I thought this film will also bring good memories to others. I admit that the animation was a bit typical, but the story is just so charming and fun. Charlie is a gambling dog who kills another gambling dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, she comes back to Earth with a clock that can't stop baptism or it's the end of her life. When he and his best friend Itchy look for Carface and talk to him, it turns out that Carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan who talks to the animals and finds out who wins the races. Charlie takes Ann-Marie and makes false promises for money. But he comes to learning that maybe he should first announce Ann-Marie when Carface returns to him with revenge. this is a great family movie to watch. Not to mention that it's just so cute and touching. I know it is ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but for me, when I was a kid, I believed dogs had souls. How did they not get? They are just so loved and I think I'm gonna cry again. But I would still recommend this movie to everyone, this is a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
