My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old. I've never forgotten it. I've never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor before. (He was twenty-two when he made Elephant's walk) Remember that I'm nine, so feelings aren't sexual, I just didn't see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit on my feet like a puppy and watch him. He has begun to show his age (He is almost seventy-four), but I still believe he is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women who ever lived. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie many times since then, and it's a nice melodrama. Of course, it saves Miss Taylor's beauty, great landscapes, a very impressive elephant, and a well-made point of human arrogance before nature. <br /> <br /> All in all - spent a few hours watching movie or rented video.
