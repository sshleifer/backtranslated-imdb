Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who takes the "The Unknown Man", a 1951 film, featuring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. Great faith in justice, Pidgeon accepts the pro bono case that protects a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle), who is accused of murder and gets him right. Shortly thereafter, he understands that the man is guilty, and he had both forced the victim and other neighboring shopkeepers out of the defensive money. He has suggested to DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is a small change to find the best man to destroy organized crime. Mason finds the upper man and faces a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "Unknown Man" is a small, black, and white film that can keep the viewer interested in its various plot twists, although the plot is somewhat natural. It is a really good man who is looking for his god, justice and what he is ready to achieve. And this is the most thoughtful part. I think it was time before O.J., Menendez Brothers, etc., when people believed in justice and the integrity of lawyers. However, for this viewer, these days are a long time. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his beautiful, elegant behavior and declamation voice are a success for us, a solid person, but also deeply caring. Pidgeon had a great career for 60 years, but never got to a superstom. He was a solid actor who could play almost anything and did. This may be because he was well into his thirties by the time he got his wires, and remained a matin√©e idol; or it may not have been sure; or that she had been printed early, led a big female star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. Here he gives honest and touching work. <br /> <br /> Very good movie with good results.
