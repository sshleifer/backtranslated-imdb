One of my favorite films that has been overlooked by too many filmmakers, which mysteries me. Not only led by Ang Lee but also by many young actors who became big stars such as Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the actors were great, and all the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers, who depicted the evil cable that killed him for killing. <br /> <br /> When the director's biographies and achievements (even if he won the Academy Award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually left out of his past. I accidentally discovered a movie from a DVD and became one of my most frequently viewed movies. But it is rarely seen on the cable. I hope to read what others suggest is the reason why the film is not well known.
