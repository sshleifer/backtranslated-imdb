At one level, this film can bring out our child who just wants to build sandstone and throw things in the air just to see it. At the same deeper level, he explores the deep desire to reunite with the land. I said, "If I am not here (alone) for any time, I feel it artificially," I feel loose. "<br /> <br /> I thought Andy Goldsworthy was one of the biggest contemporary artists. I know my works mainly through the installation of my coffee tables and a couple of art galleries. But to see my work in motion through the Riedelsheimer lens perfectly, it was Goldsworthy's work, which has not been frozen in time, is alive, rotating, flying, soluble, crumbling, crashing. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly what it is: Time, Creation and Destruction Process. Void and become the Universe and back. He has shamanic quality, insanity about him. You get the feeling of watching him at work, that his art is viable for him, that if he doesn't, he goes there and dies. <br /> <br /> For us, Goldsworthy is fortunate enough to share his vision through the means of photography, otherwise there would be only one person except for some hats and walls.
