I understand that a lot of people hate this movie, but I have to admit it is one of my favorites. I think I like it better than his predecessor and happy that it's better than many movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think people will never give a credit like a return to the future, time is hard to write, and in this movie they were Time Travel and Spiritual Journey. <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were the best performers in this movie. and those cooler things. <br /> <br /> The structure of this movie is also awesome, the kits are sometimes quite detailed and massive, and it may be hard to believe that these kits are made for the film about two teenage buds who hardly write ... but not the whole the franchise genius, making these two idiots bigger than the life characters responsible for the utopian future of the whole country. <br /> <br /> Costume design was awsome as well. Bill and Ted really see Bogus Journey's cool, where, as in a great adventure, they look pretty much like they would, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music of this movie is awsome, score especially. I can say so much about this movie because I love it. But this is one of the movies I watched and every time I liked it more so I understand why people hate or just think it is annoyed compared to an excellent adventure (which I would love otherwise). <br /> <br /> SEND YOU TO YOU !!!!
