Wes Craven is the most successful killer thriller movie ever made. After watching the movie, you will find your new fears. People don't know which Wes Craven thriller film is the best because they're all different. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Lisa is terrorized by passengers. He forced him to kill and if he didn't, Jack killed his father. Lisa is enormously confused because whatever she chooses, she kills. <br /> <br /> Action was unrealistic. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy acted incredibly. Emotional choices were right.
