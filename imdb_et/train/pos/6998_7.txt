Watching the seven pounds I wasn't sure what to think about, because the previews were much more open to understand what the movie really was. So in the first 20 minutes, or if you're completely lost on the plot, there's no idea what's going on and think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All this ends when the "twist" is said to be cleared at the last minute of the movie. Basically, Tim (wants a blacksmith) was worried and haunted by the big accident he made, causing the lives of seven people. With this, he decides on seven new people who need help, need some badly for whom he / she will give his / her life. <br /> <br /> The way this movie works is great because I feel it's part of what it seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, this is one of his best films, in addition to the eagle eye that I think is there. She's been in some bad shape, but she's giving this movie. Other actors, such as woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to understand this character. Although the casting of the film was still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected and definitely hoped much slower. The film, however, was pretty good. Nothing happens before the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything goes down. So far, it just seems like a meaningless love story. Final Thought Seven Pounds = Seven Stars.
