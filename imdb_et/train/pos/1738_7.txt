It's a fun movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beatty Chicken Pit restaurants. There are any humiliating clauses in the treaty, for example, forcing Burt to wear during the race during chicken clothing! Jim Nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief engineer. Loni Anderson (oh, yeah!) Beatty determines to keep Reynolds honest and rigorous. This is a funny film in which Burt proves that he is not too proud. I like it!
