Everything started with True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse to get the club safe. Noble Heart Horse meets Dawn & John and took them to True Heart Bear. Later, the gatekeeper went over to check the True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse to see if it was Dark Heart, but they couldn't go if the club took care of asking Dawn & John to take care of the club. After a real heart bear & Noble Heart Horse Come back, they send Dawn & John back to the camp. When the club and cousin bears have grown up to get ready to heart-to-heart combat. In the end, Dark Heart robs all of the caregivers and the children (Dawn & John) have to tell Christy that Dark Heart is bad. When they work together, save the Care Bears. Later, True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse found out the shadow of this Dark Heart and returned to the nursing home to find they were gone. Children (Dawn, John & Christy) come, but they were not able to stop the dark heart. True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse will come to Dawn, John & Christy to release other care wagons, but Christy got the way and hit Dark Heart Magic. When the dark heart saw that Christy was hit and finishes her careers to help her, but she can't, because the Dark Heart (herself) is not able to save Christy. Care carts and kids help to save Dark Heart with Christy. Now a dark heart who will take care and become a real boy who loved Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy work out in the camp. <br /> <br /> This is a great move and the best care film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Like all treatments, I wear movies and I can't wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> Who likes this movie?
