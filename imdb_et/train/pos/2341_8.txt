It's a really funny show that has been done in a horrible way, like Tim Burton's movie. It is worth checking out because it is much more creative than most exhibitions this season. Best of all, it's not a "reality" show. I mean, why the audience is so willing to take such examples (which are not creative) and ignore such excellent exhibitions, which is actually a creative bend. <br /> <br /> While some deceive assumptions, I think it's really unusual. Much more enjoyable than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think this is the most fun thing on the pipe because "My name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and storytelling and music are wonderful. If you like to show what is a little away, I would recommend it. It is not as strange as the Twin Peaks, but it has really given it away.
