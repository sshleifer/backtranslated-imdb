Intelligent script from late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and two male wire intelligent performances - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or if it should be the other way around) cause an exciting and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Add a veteran JEAN HERMAN leader and FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX from the rare but effective point, it's easy to see this film in odd-timeless quality. <br /> <br /> Lonely, both disappointed and tired of the world, returning, presumably from Algiers. Like other colonial powers of this time (after World War II, which led to the 60s), France was experiencing difficulties in continuing to appear abroad. The loss of the Algerians was a bitter blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (Original Title) crowns the action of our two (anti) heroes when they fight to go out after their release. /> <br /> One thing happens after another and the viewer really needs to pay attention because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his script: if it exists, there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that these two men are fighting physically and psychologically, one long weekend. Their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other. This ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different from the outside - a former, probably beautiful boy and the last ugly thug, adding chemistry. <br /> <br /> This quest makes a great story, which in turn makes a great movie. <br /> <br /> I don't forget that there are women in this movie and they are also memorable, although not nearly as perfect, according to the Japanese method; a lot to say would ruin your joy of discovering their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, FRIEND has been released in the UK; ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 TESTED; ONLY in English (not even subtitles for hearing); 110 minutes of driving time; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but DE ROUBAIX's music has a lot of punch! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
