Ashanti is a very 70's film (exact). It reminded me of wild geese (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore in Africa). This is also a very good movie, and I enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a physician who works in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti wife named Anansa (Beverley Johnson), who has trained in medicine in America and is a doctor. If they have a doctorate, one day he will be forced by slaves who work in Suleiman in the Arab slave trade (played perfectly by Peter Ustinov, all people). The rest of the movie is David who is trying to get him back. Michael Caine is of course a brilliant actor and plays a character who is very determined and ready to do something to return his wife, but rather to the hopeless arms and horses. He has for the first time helped an Englishman who fights against the slave trade, that no one admits it is happening (Rex Harrison!), Then a short helicopter pilot (William Holden) and then an Arabic named Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has Suleiman's (he's very intense, very tempting) billing and he goes to David to find him and get Anan back - that is, a wonderful scene where David can't barely get into his camel. There are also many moral surveys. The progress of the story is somewhat predictable from that moment, and some of the things that have been done to move things faster are some of the freedoms, but it is all forgiven. The question is, does David go to Anans before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course Omar Sharif is in it!)?
