OK, so I'm not watching too many horror movies - and it's because of films like "Dark Remains". I caught it (surprisingly functionally filled) on a DVD and scared me foolishly. In fact, the only extra I think the DVD was missing was a pair of new pants. <br /> <br /> The next day I talked to someone about how I realized I only saw about 10% of it. The rest of the time I look at my coffee table seal - nervous, so my girlfriend would have grabbed me if I actually covered my eyes. Few times I watched the screen look so I jumped so hard that I decided not to look again. <br /> <br /> Making a movie is sure and the situation was really convincing. The simplicity of the movie is what really hit my jump button - it's just woodland, salon and unused prisoner - and a lot of darkness. The most surprising was that although it wasn't obviously a multi-million dollar product, make-up effects seemed like it was! It is also obvious that this is a film made by someone with a great film life. Sound design and music used my spatial system as many Hollywood films have never done. I noticed that this film won LA Shriekfest - a really great achievement, and I think the festival had seen a clear talent of filmmakers - and probably a lot more of this movie than I managed. <br /> <br /> Turn on the sound, turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend, order a pizza.
