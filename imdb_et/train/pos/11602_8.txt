Now I was happy to see the contaminated man first when he preached on television in December 2000. <br /> <br /> Infectious disease expert (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease enters and kills his home. A few years later he is now in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure where exactly everything I know is going to happen anywhere in the area. In any case, the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases is forced to lay off most of its staff due to budget cuts. One of them, an unpleasant security guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, the best known for his indestructible Robocop role) goes there and requires them to give him a job back. She needs this job because she is divorced and she needs it to pay for child support. So he goes there, the fight breaks and some things get into dangerous things. It was soon discovered that Muller was infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it's so deadly, one drop of his blood kills a person in seconds. Soon the word will come out and the disease expert (Hurt) will be invited to investigate and later join an American reporter. Now Muller has decided to come home to see his wife and son, and he won't stop anything, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. . We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas Falling Down) who can't do anything to reach the goal there, even if they have to kill some people in this process. Next we have a hero man (Hurt here, Robert Duvall Falling Down) who is both sympathetic and decisive to stop the antagonist. <br /> <br /> An infected person is actually a very good movie with a good story and some very good results. <br /> <br /> 8/10
