Although it may not be a "classic" movie according to today's standards, it is still worth it. The main reason why, after experiencing this film, you feel that you have also experienced the anti-cultural idealism of the 1960s, whether it is good or bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the English literary class SUNY Geneseo, and although at first it seems to be just a meaningless composition of 60's icons, the movie is far from being "thrown". <br /> <br /> My point is that if you leave the film dissatisfied and confused, the film has done its job: it will convey a hopeless vision for the future that will leave you unrecognized and angry. Perhaps it was the same feeling that the film was trying to look at the young people it was showing. <br /> <br /> As such, "Zabriskie Point" may not say a very good (or interesting) story and at the same time its characters may be one-sided and predictable. But it also gives such a clich√©, a rebellious desire to get out of existence that Mark and Daria must share. Even anti-body students are as unreliable as those they do not oppose.
