This film was seen by my husband and I when it appeared in 1978. It was a revelation to us. We thought we were the only gay and lesbian couples who had ever been married and had children. Obviously we are wrong. Love can come from where you don't expect it and maybe you don't want it. But we both chose this love anyway. <br /> <br /> And no, it never changed our sexual orientation. This stuff is for Christian wackas. <br /> <br /> When we were young, they both had things, but never with the opposite sex. As we get older, we stopped taking extra-marital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is far from being drawn. However, they seem to have become heterosexual, quite unreal. My wife and I have slept together for the past 40 years. We're still gay. End of story.
