"Scorpion's tail case" has all the elements needed to make an effective giallo movie. The story is a standard giallo. When a person dies during an air strike, his wife (East Galli) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy. The widow goes to Greece for payment, but she is followed by a series of assassinations of murderers. There are many suspects, including an insurance agency and a widow (George Hilton). Director Martino keeps the story at a fast pace, while the viewer tries to measure the killer's identity. Anita Strindberg (also a memorable "Your Vice President is a locked room and only I have a key" and "who saw her death?") Is a stunning heroine. This is one of Martino's best films.
