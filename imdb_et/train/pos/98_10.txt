Also, this Christmas special is very pleasant to me. In 1989, I grabbed two CDs that I found on the soundtrack recording, giving one to my sister and holding you for yourself. It is now part of my family's Christmas heritage, and I would like to see the example again, not just remember it when I listen. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, it has been noted that John Denver made a number at the Muppet Show, and they made more than one special. A good rapport between Denver and his fuzzy companions is here in a clear, charming and fun show that is good for all ages.
