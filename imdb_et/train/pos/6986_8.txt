When you study the UFO facts, this video is very important. "Meat" is a comment from Buzz Aldrin. He is undoubtedly America's best. Learned to be objective, honest and factual in your reports. Many American Astronauts have reported some contact or compliance with UFO and some of these missions are videos. At least something has happened that requires further objective investigation. I think this Buzz Aldrin testimony shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress. Like all expected documentaries, it may be inclined, but it contains additional information and opinions about the accomplished American hero. They don't come every day. So the fact that some people don't care about details should not watch your video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I suggest you look open.
