"Inspirational" stories of "the triumph of human spirit" are usually great deviations for me. The most amazing thing I liked is how much I enjoyed it. The film is as predictable and clich√© as it gets, but it works. Lots of credits go to the inspiring performance of both leaders. This is the perfect role for Cuban Gooding, Jr., who is perfectly restrained here. We've been waiting a lot for De Nirol and he's not disappointing. She creates a funny portrait in the dark. Director George Tillman, Jr., decided to make an old-style flick and comes up with a winner.
