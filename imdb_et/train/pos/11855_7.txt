Wow. Something surprise. Although it is faulty, it is much better than I thought. <br /> <br /> Arcturus, a new spacecraft with about 3,000 passengers, is on a sixteen-day trip to Jupiter in recent days. Without warning, the ship's brain (central computer) sounds like a disaster and tells everyone to evacuate. Soon, there will be only a few people, including one of the ship's astronomers (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the shipping manager (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It turns out that the alarm was wrong and the main brain works <br /> <br /> wrong. The rest of the passengers and the crew must flee the ship and avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well. Opening is a very nice touch. There are obvious parallels for 2001: the historical sinking of Space Odyssey and Titanic. The film slows down from time to time and has problems, but it's generally well done and well done.
