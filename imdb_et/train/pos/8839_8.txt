God thank you for not having a real story because of what that story is. Displeased with despicable characters, whose exhaustion knows no bounds before the devil is mesmerizing, the falling jaw excursion to perversion, which would be ridiculous (and sometimes as a result - or perhaps because - the human disorder is tragic) if it didn't happen with such a magnificent, overwhelming conviction of your stars. Also Kelly Masterson's excellent script and none other than Sidney Snow does not hurt. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction here is family, two largely twisted brothers (great images Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke decided to rob their parents' jewelery shop, which is a test that goes disgracefully. <br /> <br /> Story speaks of time changes (shown on the screen, for example: "Charlie: two days before the robbery", so no one should be confused), some people have said they don't like this device, but I thought it worked great by adding the whole bogus, given that the two brothers in question did not play in full pack - between them you did not get a good poker hand to save your life. Throw out the non-extruded tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (also Marisa Tomei, great) who communicates with another brother , throws in some monumental sister competition with saying that the drug addicted brother hates his father (the competing performance of Albert Finney) who has apparently caused him a serious past pain and you have the tragedy of Shakespeareus / Greece in your hands. Continue with caution.
