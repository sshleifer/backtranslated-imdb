Wow! So fun! Probably a little bit of ordinary American children, and it's really a stretch to call it a child's movie, this movie reminded me of Band Bandit for a while - very Terry Gilliam. Although the general narrative is rather straightforward, Miike still throws a lot of surreal and Bunuel-esquire moments. The whole first act of attacking the scene violently is the normal family life, the spirit world, and the evil that has come from the main child / hero. And while the end is a bit vague aspect that has spread to Miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, especially the anti-folly anti-foolish anti-revenge, are pretty damn. Both mania and imaginative fun, like other big Miike films, instead of top torture and gore, he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folklore, who creatively create CG and doll products packed in an imaginative versatile adventure. F'n rad and one of Miike's best!
