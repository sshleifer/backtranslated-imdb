Strangely, this OPEN YOUR EYES version is more mature and rich. In retrospect, the Crowe scenario is much stricter and more accurate than the original Amenabar. The Spanish filmmaker should first hope for a story of thinking, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved it - just a little. Note that you have no idea what the OPEN YOUR EYES has guided, but you know almost everything about managing VANILLA SKY. I mean more "exactly".
