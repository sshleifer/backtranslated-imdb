I had to see this jewel twice to really appreciate it. When the widow of two fathers interrupts the sleep of their two sons with a shocking revelation, they are broken by believing that he is not. When we discover this horrible events, we learn a lot about the father, his two sons, and their fates. After a shocking twist with shocking twists, this film never lets you streak. Bill Paxton plays his father, but the most remarkable performances are his older son Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen for a while and you want to look at it a couple of times to understand all the complex aspects of the plot. I'll give it to movie 9/10.
