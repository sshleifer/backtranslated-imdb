I could not accept Nomad 7 and I A HVR with comments. The perfect Saturday morning movie. Humor is subtle (exactly the opposite of "slapstick", as one of the wrong commentators noted). <br /> <br /> But what always amazes me is how often I think I want to come back to this movie over and over again. I originally copied this movie to VHS about 12 years ago, when this premiere of one of Pay Cable's free weekend previews (perhaps?). Had heard it before. Don't know why it wasn't marketed well. ? When the DVD was released from the mass, it was one of the first films I replaced. Great combination of casting and writing. In addition, the rear drop of Montana desert does not damage anything (beautiful). <br /> <br /> This is probably not a comedy for everyone, but what? If Adam Sandler's type of stuff is in your allele, it's probably not your cup's way. This film needs your full attention. Humor is mostly in dialogue. <br /> <br /> I believe my next review is probably my 12th place. But I still know that if it gets into scenes like the one where police hoods are going to blow, I'll lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is PRICELESS!). Recommended for 110%.
