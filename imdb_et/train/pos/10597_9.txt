I praise pictures that try something else. Many movies seem like a rebirth of old ideas, so it's a big reason why I highly recommend Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The movie is set right after World War II, and post-war shortcomings and norms seem to drive London barmy. At the heart of the film is a small district in London called Pimlico. They also have the illness that they can't buy what they want but don't see it. It is as long as they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter that officially called this neighborhood a sovereign nation hundreds of years ago! With this document, they can justify that they miss out on all the norms and coupons and live life as they want because it turns out they're really British! When the movie goes on and the crisis is finally resolved, you have something to do. Leave this to Ealing Studios with amazing ideas to find this gem!
