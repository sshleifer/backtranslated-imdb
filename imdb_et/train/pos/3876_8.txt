Lovely Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this movie from everybody's nose, which is not small in view of the terrible performances surrounding her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Anna, a non-working, independent, somewhat neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actor who relieves despair by looking at a wheelchair-related, muted, outdated father named Walentin (a big Danish actress) Frits Helmuth, who died at 77th after the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walent refuses to answer anyone - if he is facing talented Anna, whose strange and mischievous way brings the poor old devil to the back of his own death sentence. /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about a serious businessman's son (Jorgen, played by Clausen) is a loving father who has never accepted him. The film ends, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, about loving and caring nature and value, and how one person, irreplaceable Anna, can change a person's life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance is worth the price alone.
