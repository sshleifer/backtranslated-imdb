I've long wanted to see this movie, being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-block was a waste of time, but the talent of McCallum shines its juvie role. Thank you for the skies for Turner Classic, who made the show last week. I can imagine that after the war, there were many problems with the children, especially how things were all over the 1950s. Some guys are a little scary. Certainly I wouldn't want them on a well-lit street, much less in the dark. Also, the feelings of the fireworks were touched by some good insights, or when they call him firearms.
