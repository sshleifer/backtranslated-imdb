This movie is interesting to take on killer scarecrow genre - amazingly it manages to rise to get bigger than the sum of its parts. Medium assembly scenes, 30-year-olds play with teenagers, and some great facial expressions connect to one of the "new waves" of modern classics. As a spectator, I missed the film with an equivalent "shock and fear" as I first saw the Godfather in 1969. Tiffany Gardner's amazing imagination of morally bankrupt Judy deserves his Grammy candidate, which was well documented with stolen Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, no one of the descendants was able to meet the expectations of the original (unlike the series of the godfather, which was better achieved by each installment and culminates in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage.
