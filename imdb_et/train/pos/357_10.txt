The film is very enjoyable with great pain and great direction of James Eves. The film's entertaining is a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and everything is completely cast. James Eves has a good vision and leads like a conductor who knows exactly when an action should be taken, fall and then rise to the top. He does it with a sense of humor, lots of twists, excitement and blood. This is the return of an old vampire movie with lots of gore, blood and screams. The film works at high speed and the characters take you to a terrible adventure, but it does work to make the film not taking too seriously, how much language is with exciting activities.
