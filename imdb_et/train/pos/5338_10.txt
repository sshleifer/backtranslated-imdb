When I watch a porn film, I would prefer to have some plot and a landing dialogue. Behind the doors of the bedrooms there is one of the few I have met with these qualities. <br /> <br /> The new girl sets off the neighbor's human nature and weaknesses, where seduction and sex are related. Chelsea Blue (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is a choice actress who plays part of the blackmail seductress and plays this part perfectly. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and very beautiful actor. A total of 10 movies just because he's in it. His partner in the movie Monique Alexander is a confident cutie. These two should work more together. In this movie, Monik, who plays Gigi, doesn't have much to do or say. It's too bad. He seems to have more talent shared. I like a girl who was the next (possibly) DA woman. I forget my name but it looks pretty good, not a bad actor. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. It is obvious that they are part of the fee they bought. What's up, but has he finished? Sorry, but come on! I am afraid that his performance here could have fallen to some rating, except for Chelsea's talent and beauty, which goes beyond the negative. In general, this film is good.
