Don't look for a too advanced plotline here ... just sit with some popcorn and enjoy it. With a remarkable make-up that includes incredible makeup and design, Beatty, Madonna and Pacino don't talk about the classic comic book villains. Very fun for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
