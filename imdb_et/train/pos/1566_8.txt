Leslie Charter's series of novels about the adventures of a little shady Simon Templar ("The Holy") were brought up in the late 1930s and came to George Sanders as Templar. It was a cautious choice - Sanders usually plays grass with random "nice roles" (phobalt for FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, title hero of UNCLE HARRY, Robert Montgomery framed "best friend" RAGE IN HEAVEN). Here is his willingness to bend the rules and break the law briefly to match his "hard person", while his good appearance and sincere behavior made the Templar a sheltered hero, like Chester Morris "Boston Blackie" and (to some extent) Peter Lorre. Moto ". <br /> <br /> Movies are not the best series of movie secrets, but they are usable. Like the Rathbone Holmes series or the Dutch Chani series, the show often played a repeating role or played new ones (movie anti-heroine) Wendy Barrie, who appeared in the second movie, played here.) This and a bit familiar film sets make the series a pleasant experience for viewers who listen to the buzz of the dialogue (always showing Sanders' honesty, keeping one step ahead of the bad guys), without mentioning the obvious mistakes of the plot. mysteries have flaws, because even the best genres cannot avoid repeating and repeating old ideas. <br /> <br /> Here was a moment when this incident admitted its affection to Barrie, which he was long aware of. But when the film dealt with the identity of the criminal master, it became clear that this person became so subtle that it would be a mysterious master (ie the script hides it all e less likely to be a suspect). <br /> <br /> Barrie is after the evidence that his father (who died in prison) has been abducted by real gangs of gangs. He has several people who help him - mugs like William Gargan - and he gets advice from a master to plan for embarrassing burglars that can't be fixed to him. D.A. who got his father guilty (Jerome Cowan) has decided to get Barrie and his gang. The only detective who seems to have the chance to resolve the case is Jonathan Hale, who hides Sanders, but is reluctant to treat him. <br /> <br /> The cast script has nice moments - Hale (currently on special diet) is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner prepared for Sanders for Willie Best. As a result, he gets a serious stomach, allowing Sanders and Barril Sander to escape. The best one should remind her (if she feels better) to guide her to the location that Sanders was at her time. <br /> <br /> Gilbert Emery also has an interesting role to play. Usually decent people (like the double world) play a socially striking weakness here - whose death resembles the character of the Bogart movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, a well-made film in the second half of the 1939 film house settlement. It also attracts you if it doesn't stay in your memory.
