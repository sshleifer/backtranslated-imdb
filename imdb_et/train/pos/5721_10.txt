I'm not sure if I understand where all these enthusiastic people are talking here, maybe some people want to get things up. <br /> <br /> The film was definitely imperfect (uneven, some may have had difficulty with changing time, actors who are too willing to go, and I really wouldn't go, etc.), but IMHO had some things which were more than flaws. <br /> <br /> First of all, I loved "breaking the rules". NORMAL, when you leave the haunted house, the baddies leave you alone, giving you time to re-group, make friends and mysterious paranormal. NORMALLY (half-pointer warning), when you hide under the covers, they will only get you through the small opening you look at. Finally, the ghosts at the end have become less creepy because you have discovered that they have just misunderstood or have been released or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, production was exceptional. Although the film was barely loaded with special effects, supernatural bits, although the short was very well done. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the ultimate kind of horror (something they are against), but great for those who have begun to take the conventions for granted and who have no problems time distortion.
