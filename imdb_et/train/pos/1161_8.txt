It was an extremely low budget (some scenes look like they were recorded with a home video camera). But it has a good plot line and it's easy to follow. 8 years after his sexual abuse, his father, Amanda, is released from the Psychiatric Department with the help of a doctor with whom he secretly is. Your doctor will stop renting your house and buying a car. But during the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda kills her and buries her in the backyard. Then he sees his neighbor Richard putting his eyes on him and stopping him until he has him. He is acting innocent, but after another neighbor, Buzz explains that Amanda killed this doctor and tried to kill Richie's wife, Laurie (after Amanda and her have reached the hot tub). Then he stops his behavior so innocent and kills Buzz and later tries to kill Richard, whom he probably loves and cares for. And you have to rent a movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. Generally a good movie, reminds me a lot about your life you know the whole falling neighbor and stop doing something until you have his part.
