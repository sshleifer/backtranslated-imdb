I am a child with special needs and I enjoyed this movie very much! It was loving, warm and fun. I've long been aware of humor about things. Especially I thought it was sweet how all other characters worry about Frankie and who would care for her after her grandmother's death. Before editing the film, I was in the focus of the parents of other children with special needs and siblings. Everyone enjoyed the movie and it inspired great discussions. We talked about how our children laughed at us and also talked about how we worry about them. The scriptwriter talked about how she works as a volunteer volunteer with autistic children and other children with special needs. He was based on a real person. Our family has been blessed with a sense of humor that has gained us in times of great stress. I'll give the movie two thumbs up !!!
