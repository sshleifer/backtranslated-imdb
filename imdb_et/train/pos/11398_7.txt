I enjoyed this movie. It was light, pleasant and very colorful. You see that MGM was out of Technicolor. It's hardly visible in this movie. Every scene is full. Choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He's so talented. The dance numbers of this movie are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last part of the movie, the great dance, is very impressive. What makes this movie very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers have given the melody a better gift. I enjoy Gershwin's music. It's enchanting. Ira Gershwin is certainly one of the largest lyrical writers. He's so witty and charming. It was a very fun movie.
