Dig! I would say to anyone, even if you don't like Metallica to see "some kind of monster", this is a spinal type documentary that is associated with the world's biggest bands like spiritual children. It's fun and exciting. On the same line is digging! The Dandy Warholi and Brian Jonestown Massacre are two of the Portland ensembles who are starting their own music only in their home country, one of these ensembles becoming enormous and one falling into books on musical history. Right from the start, the two strips in the opposite direction draw their ability to make decisions, whether good or bad. Filmed with a seven-year and sometimes painful view, we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame (thanks to this vodaphone ad!) And Jonestown's reddish drop to the scene teachers slipping. Because the ensembles become inconsistent, the friendships are tight and there are arguments at many points and even on the stage pages. All of this is semi-funny and semi-tragic and I believe it or not, is perverse traceable. As I said at the beginning, you can watch the Metallica movie even if you have no interest in the band. Dig! on the other hand, it is somewhat different and more enjoyable and much easier to see if you have an interest in either band. Still a good movie and a will to not be in the band when encouraged as a career. Dig! There is a crazy journey on the tails of rock and roll-on hair and a good example of pitfalls and joy to be famous or want to be.
