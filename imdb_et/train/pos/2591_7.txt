An exciting and quite entertaining sleeping place for two very different brothers, both of which are not just so-called "fire starters" (I think Stephen King is in the forefront of a book with the same name), but also forever with a woman who is quite disgusting to be pyroman! A good special effect (especially towards the end), pretty talented actors' trio performances and the addition of a really interesting and strangely suitable soundtrack makes "Wilder Napalm" unique to watching a movie ... if you find it! On a personal note, I was able to grab this two-dollar trash from my local video store. (*** end *****)
