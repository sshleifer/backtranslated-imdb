Is this our future? An overweight, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? This film reminds us of the problem that still destroys us twice, as the film was released in 1973. We hope that the world is not going to stop this ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild film that I really enjoyed. It had nice characters, a semi-apocalyptic device, a weighty and thoughtful story, and maso-est macho: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant and dirty feeling. You're almost suffocated by the stench of the city and its dirty people. <br /> <br /> Characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become my favorite actor, is Thorn. The man created the role of this badass, but a nice tough guy. I can definitely put Thorn in shoes. She sees something wrong, but she doesn't listen to her (she likes to pay no more) or she wants to die. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film, R.I.P.) plays a loving old Sol, who has had this nasty place. All others are great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment where he lives. <br /> <br /> Special effects are fantastic even in 1973. The Soylent Green factory, futuristic apartments and especially the "spoons" (bulldozers released from people) were excellent. Contaminated air seems disgusting and very disgusting. Empty and dirty people full of empty city streets are very pleased. <br /> <br /> One last comment is the end that still shocked me. It's tough, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: <br /> <br /> A great 70s science fiction flick that makes you think and leave you feeling very restless.
