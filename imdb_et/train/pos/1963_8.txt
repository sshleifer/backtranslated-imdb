Let's start with all of our comments with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films a year over the last 15 years. Recently we were honored to receive a free movie from any newspaper on the live movie! So we see what we want. The idea is that CRITICS takes zero. Your local critics or national critics, like Ebert, do not really differ from you or me. The only difference is that they can write a movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies, whether they want or not. Therefore, our conviction is that if you get your money for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! NEVER IS ANY QUESTION by critics. We care only about our friends and the ones we know about the same things as us. That's good enough. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not only good but very good. Critics are heaps. Just because there is nudity and the language they hated it. It was worth the ticket price and that's all you can ask. Isn't that right? Each film cannot be a candidate for the Academy Award. Sharon's stone is fantastic and does a great job in the film and it mystifies me about what the devil's critics want
