Midnight Cowboy made great noise when he appeared in 1969, drawing a class X. Today's standards make it difficult to get an R rating. Jon Voight, who has been better, has a role to play in Joe Buck, who is out of town, who wants to make it big with the ladies in New York. He sits with a street hunter named Ratso Rizzo, who is trying to make friends with Buck for his own purposes. These two eventually form a bond that is both touching and pathetic. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman looks simple. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more than that image. He is so characteristically that everything else around him is comparable. The abolition of John Wayne's academic award is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Cinematography and Science. Director Schlessinger has a dirty hand with his production, but this film has a grungy underneath, which leaves the viewer with a bad taste. It's worth seeing Hoffman's performance alone.
