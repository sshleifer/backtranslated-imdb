I've seen this movie on several occasions. I find one of the funniest things to do is just look at the different people who see it. <br /> <br /> Type 1: Older People. Many old Japanese men and women go to this film because they think it is a fairly good samurai film with lots of sword games and medieval Japanese dialogue. As soon as the two main characters start discussing horizontal films, adding the story almost randomly throughout the sentence, the old people leave, usually nasty. <br /> <br /> Type 2: FILM SNOBS. These people think that just because the film has an "Independent" label, it is automatically a burden on a hard-to-track, transferable, and non-English language that may or may not be. But they still see it to be sung later so people think they are intelligent and cultured. They're really surprised when they see this movie. As soon as the blood begins to swell out of the anime-inspired sword battles, or as an overflowing frog who speaks to a dog with this cross-section during a phone call, these people are so outraged they go out. Some will just look like "how bad it gets" and later they will be wondering what the terrible movie was for their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: PEOPLE THAT MUST BE SPECIFIC TO LIVE ACTIVITIES OR MATRIX. Sorry people, martial arts are pretty strong in the movie, but director Yamasat doesn't really have this kind of budget. <br /> <br /> Type 4: PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT EXPECTED. These are the people who really enjoy the movie. Whether they had only heard Samurai's blood, chose it randomly, or fell into the wrong theater with alcoholic blur, are those who laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the film for what this ultimately is: ENTERTAINMENT. This movie wasn't made to enlighten or provoke deep mental thinking, it was meant (if I can borrow a line of dialogue from the movie) that "really threw a ass." And that's what he does. <br /> <br /> Depending on the type of person you are, you can enjoy this movie or not; But if you appreciate the movie for what it is and you can enjoy excessive blood and act, check out this movie and make sure you bring your friends.
