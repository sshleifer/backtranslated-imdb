I love this movie! Animation is great (for the Pok√©mon movie), cgi seems so fantastic. I love movie music. So big they kept Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for the story: its great. It has a great sense of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pokemon. Ash is very good in this movie and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I didn't like was the look of Suicune, she just suddenly appears, helps Ash & co and leaves. They could have made their part a bit bigger in the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fantastic movie! Can't wait to have a US version of DVD!
