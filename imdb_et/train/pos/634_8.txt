I was one of about 200 people happy to see this movie early. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows Tristan's young man, who wants to find the fallen star and bring it to the woman, loves to prove his love for him. The only catch is that the letter has fallen to the other side of the wall, between the doorway of England and the magical kingdom, known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a joy to watch, it has something for everyone, all action scenes are played beautifully, and comedy is spreading through a movie that makes it funny without being funny. If I had to compare similar movies, it should be a classic classic princess bride. <br /> <br /> All the performances are outstanding, the beautiful Claire Danes loves her in depicting Yvaine, a trusting naive star, and downplayed by Michelle Pfeiffer brings stars over Larnia's top score, but the performance speaks of Robert De Niro. <br /> <br /> If you are a funny fantasy love story in the mood, this is a movie. The boys can't be turned off by the description because there is enough action comedy and not to mention Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained. Cinematography is dead and sticking to the knowledge of the film ... nothing in the film seems to be forced.
