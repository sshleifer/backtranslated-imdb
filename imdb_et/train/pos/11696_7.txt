"The Thief in the Night" is a film that film fans generally ignored because of their low budget (which was evident) and its theme - the resurrection of a true Christian church and the fate of the people behind them. Nonetheless, it was a thrilling story that kept the viewer and certainly made his relationship with Jesus Christ. It touched everyone - even the pastor who proclaimed the Word, but didn't believe it, knowing exactly why he was behind. This movie and its sequel "Distant Thunder" must watch movies. Even if the new "left" series comes out, the same story speaks with a much bigger budget, the effect is the same - "The Thief in the Night" broke the basis of this genre and is always remembered.
