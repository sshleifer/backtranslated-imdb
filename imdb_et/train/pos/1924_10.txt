This show was great, it wasn't just for the kids I thought at first, it's the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was mainly for the father who takes care of two daughters and a son, he unfortunately died in season 2, I can believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I'm covered to show that what's really going on in life, and I need to mention a good-bye episode, it was so well done, it must be so hard to shoot, you could say they were real tears in your eyes. I'm a 24-year-old man and this episode made me cry because I know how they felt like my father died when I was 13 years old like Roy. <br /> <br /> In the 2nd and 3rd seasons there was a great comedy there too, as the 3rd season had some of my favorites like Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I think the show was strong enough to go on, I was disappointed that it ended, it was one of the best family comedy exhibitions since home improvement and it could have been the following friends. <br /> <br /> It should never have ended, but I still love repetitive repetitions.
