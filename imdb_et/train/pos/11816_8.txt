It was a lot of fun! I didn't read those Chester-Gould comics, but they don't need to know. Maybe there were some internal jokes I didn't think about, but what the eye doesn't see is that the heart can't go over. It's so ironic, colorful and the actors are all together. The setting is similar to Batman movies, but not so dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not self-evident) and a more or less surprising end. <br /> <br /> With this movie you can play an interesting game if you look at it with friends. Don't look at the credit at first and then see who's the fastest to find out who their famous make-up actors are!
