I remember it years ago when it first came out and I was in Parker Posey's performance. And the film was pretty good. For anyone who has spent a little too much time in a nightclub / after-scene, this film has a special charm. Not too serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posey will definitely express his talented way through this indie gem. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character of Diaz (reminded me of every single fighting DJ I ever knew). And many other films can take a film of how to declare the virtue of responsibility without being boring and cute. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
