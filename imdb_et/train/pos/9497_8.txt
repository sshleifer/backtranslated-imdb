Absolutely fantastic trash ... it's all: nudity, good fighting scenes, gore, action, explosions, etc. It also marks the wonderful Belinda May as Ingrid - not Olga, as the other reviewer noted - although Olga turns into Ingrid later in the movie (you have to watch it to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about the story because it's too long and very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and his brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - see the towel stealing scene to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes were pretty good at the same time, and then the effects of some really dirty times that seemed like the team that made the City of the Walking Dead (ie strange colorful blood that pulled out of the neck wounds) were spoiled. ). <br /> <br /> I would recommend low budget garbage to fans to check if they can track the copy, it's quite rare, and I could never see anyone who would release it, so it would be less common in a few years. <br /> <br /> Anyway I d recommend it only for Belinda Mayne's big naked scenes! This lady is a fox!
