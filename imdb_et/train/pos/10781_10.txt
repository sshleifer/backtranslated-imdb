Road Rovers was a major showcase for captive criminals worldwide. The exhibition was at least fun. Simple and complicated jokes that can turn to any age. Running a whole series of jokes that could play a drinking game. The activity was mesmerizing and cleverly created. The characters were very original, each with very different personalities. But what made me enjoy the exhibition was the depth of the symbols. They all have struggles and emotional difficulties that have never been expressed, but a subtext. Hopefully, one day, you will be able to look at Rovers again in some way.
