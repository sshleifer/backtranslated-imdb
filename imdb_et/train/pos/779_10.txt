In the north-east of Brazil, twelve-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells his daughter's prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to work as a domestic worker and has a better life. But the girl is being sold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto), who blows her off, and she gives her abused girl her first sexual experience for her teenage son. Then he will be sent to the Amazon brothel and his owner, Antonio Calloni, will be examined. When Maria flees to Rio de Janeiro to wait for a better life, she is also studied by Craften Vera (Darlene Gloria). <br /> <br /> Anjos do Sol shows that Brazilian childhood is sad and shameful. girl Maria's fate. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever" telling an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore, this problem exists in third countries. Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents an excellent film that reveals reality, but never shows nudity or explicit sexual scene. This is the promising debut of Fernanda Carvalho, a terrific child with excellent performance, fighting for survival. Most prostitutes are amateurs and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Gloria so much that it is after many plastic operations. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("The Angels of the Sun")
