No show prizes can appeal to the people. It is clear that if your favorite movies do not win, you say that the show was not very good. It is understandable. <br /> <br /> But the 74th anniversary award is remembered for one magical moment in Hollywood history: <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's first appearance at the Academy Awards. <Br>> <br /> Allen has often punished self-extending and pointless prizes and has never been involved - although he has won several coveted awards. <br /> <br /> When the 74th Academy Academy Awards found that the nation was still killed in the collapse of World Trade Centers in New York. When it was time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video of the big movie moment of the city. Then the announcer simply said: "Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar award-winning director Woody Allen." <br /> <br /> This place broke out in an extremely long position. Finally, the entertainment sector had to give its applause to a New York man who usually avoids the Hollywood scene. As applause died, Woody applied some of his legendary spirit to the situation. <br /> <br /> SOME LARGE: <br /> <br /> "Thank you very much - it is a tape search." <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted their Oscars back," it. "I panicked because the pawn has been in business for a while and I had no chance of getting anything." <br /> <br /> "But it wasn't. I couldn't do it because my film wasn't a candidate this year. Then he hit me - maybe they excused me. /> <br />" for New York I'd do something. So I got my tux and came down here, "said Allen." This is a great, big movie town. It's been a big, moving and exciting background for movies and it's a big, big city. "<br /> <br />
