Yeah, that's the art ... for a successful slow paced thriller. <br /> <br /> The story has a nice volume while you don't even notice it. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams. The sexual angles of the film may seem unnecessary and may affect the enjoyment of the film. At the same time, the heartbeat is very tempting. The film is not in a hurry to you and still keeps you so you don't know. The direction is good. The use of luminaires for desired and unexpected effects is good. <br /> <br /> Very nice 1x viewing if you are looking back and you will hear an exciting story!
