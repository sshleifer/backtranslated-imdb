Beautiful movie, especially if you like horses, World War II movies and a strong Hungarian plateau. A story of courage, compassion, and loyalty that transcends generations. The horse is remarkable and the main character's horse in his training. <br /> <br /> I buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family movie and I highly recommend it. Good "Family Nite" movie. Although there are some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. At home, people were very interesting as they stood on their ground even with the death of a certain Nazi victim, who had their own personal reasons for hunting for Brady. Strangely beautiful movie.
