This movie was really an eye-opening. I've seen this movie many times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it, and when I was 12. 12. The whole message that the director transmits is to wake up and not to get lost if we leave God out of our daily lives or just plain goes it offensive to him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for both believers and believers!
