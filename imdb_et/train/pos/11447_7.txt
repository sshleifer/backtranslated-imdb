This movie is probably for you. It was a general meditative quality of music, beautiful photography and often listening to clich√© about the life that Andy Goldsworthy says, as he worked, or between the frames. If you're familiar with a Buddhist - this is the feeling I got out of this movie. Persistence of life, beauty of nature, interrelation of all things, etc. But what I did not understand, confused and finally forced me to leave without finishing (I saw it for over an hour) was redundancy. the whole thing. You will only know why he has ordered, and how he even allows you to live such a job. The work of art is alive, but all his conclusions, which have no conclusions, lead to the end of the dead.
