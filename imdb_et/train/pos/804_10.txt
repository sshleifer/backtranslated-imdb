No, there's one more! <br /> <br /> Since every Star Wars fan had an opinion on I, II & III, and because this opinion was biased because we left so many atmospheric and original trilogy symbols, I will tell you about the good points of Jedi's Return and a couple of failed points. Of course I loved music, special effects, two droids, but it's been discussed elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie: - A strong ecological problem - Anti-militarist positions - An exciting understanding of the Jedi Order and troops - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - Killer scene: When the end ends Vader looks at his son and emperor alternately. A flash of deadly bolts reflected by his black helmet. And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke, risking his life! Oh, boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with prequel INMHO: - The whole element of the "human factor" that the original was cast is somehow missing - forces seem to be more big and somewhat than wisdom - Too much Jedi at once and too much Light Sabreid on the screen - The lack of experience of some participants often threatens plot coherence <br /> <br /> By the way, if you enjoy the Obi Wen (I mean) and Yoda explained power theory, then you should read some books about Buddhism and the forms that he took in ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual legacy of his lord to his apprentice, his father to his son, even though he has difficulty. "De mon âme à ton âme" (from my soul to you), as Beony wrote late to Captain Zen Captain Deshimar.
