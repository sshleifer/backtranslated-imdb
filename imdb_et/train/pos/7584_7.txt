This PM Entertainment is produced with enough spots to make John Woo say, "Enough!" Of course, it is almost as beautiful as Woo is able to offer, but it can be exploited in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret police in the near future. If her husband is designed to kill the governor with a team that uses a fictional cyber, Eric's name is deleted. Wilson gets Van Dame's obligation to play when he plays a heroic leader and his evil cyber dopper. Why is the Academy unaware that it is beyond me. Because it is a PM production, there are many car rides, explosive cars (4 first 5 minutes!) And shooting. I especially liked that before it touches an exploding truck, it enters the air. My second favorite bit was accompanied by a neighborhood watch who came over to complement his karate Don simulator. It's just an opportunity to show some cheap LAWNMOWER MAN effects around 1995.
