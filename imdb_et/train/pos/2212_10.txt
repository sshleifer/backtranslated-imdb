E! TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is so funny, you can watch episodes change with a flash. We want the best writers from Stan Evans to have more funny writings. Patron of frantic masses Holy ... He is a truly talented, talented writer, actor, comic, producer, director and creative consultant. but he was not a $$$$ billionaire, so he left him a billionaire. Many superstars wanted to shoot with actor Stan Evans, who has "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable} actor. He should do a lot more movies. Maybe Stephen Spielberg or maybe with many other talented producers. Has he brought out any U-drama? or maybe any docudrama ??? The Bernie Madhoff project would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scenarios he has written? Is he $ $$$$$$$$$$$$ Billion Bill with Disney? He should earn more than $ 50 million ... He could also write a TV movie about the late King of POP. Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot more movies and watch TV from Stan Evans. Thank you very much. Elvis has left the building !!!!!
