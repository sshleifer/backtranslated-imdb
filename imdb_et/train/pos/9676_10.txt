The film was very sweet and warm from the heart! I cry almost every time I watch a movie. I recommend this movie for everyone. The film was so inspiring for me. The actors did a very good job and the film was very well played and done. The film was about a little girl who was a parrot named Paulie. Paulie was separated from his parents because they thought it was the best for him. <br /> <br /> After Paulie had experienced so many people, he reached the cage in the basement. Finally, the Russian man who had been employed by a janitor. He would have found Paulie in the basement and Paulie started talking to him, telling him the story of his life. Ultimately, he helped Paulie reunite with Marie (a little girl who brought Paulie). Love surpassed all obstacles.
