This is one of the most recently viewed films. This is because it looks less like a movie and rather an experimental film. The attempt at Kurasawa was to take on a variety of people who live in a garbage dump and tell their experiences as a tapestry that looks at their general tough existence. Not every episode is frustrating or harsh, but in general it is definitely a tone. Let's see ... we have a case of incest / rape, murder, husband exchange, alcoholism, infidelity, death of a little boy after eating dirty fish, a man with severe depression (he never speaks during the film and looks like a very scary, hopeless dreamer likely to diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor, and spends all his waking up to ride his street car along the road between garbage bins - all the thirst (I think he liked his character even less than incestuous rap!) etc. have been inclined to deal with mental illness and hopelessness of life. Is it a miracle that after this movie, Kurasawa tried to kill himself? So, did I like it? No. It was not a fun experience. But it was a very well made film that certainly stayed with me attention, and as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to those people. don't want to see all the carnage, but you can't help but look! Of all the vignettes, I think the older man who tended to pay attention to everyone and who didn't seem to fit (he was too well regulated and smart to live in the landfill) was probably represented by Kurasawa himself. Maybe. If you have seen many Kurasawa movies and have a great deal of wonder about strange movies, then give it one clock. But do not do this for your first experiences watching your movies - it's definitely scared by many viewers!
