This is truly Sweden's biggest film all the time. This is not only a revolutionary narrative, but also one of the first films to present the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindstr√∂m are two of the most intelligent and smart filmmakers in Sweden today, and this movie really shows it. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna Pine Basket" (adult people) is a warm-hearted and fun story in adulthood and the question of whether we would be better without it.
