Eight simple rules started very fun. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and his children were the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I've always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget has been done before, Kerry is quite unique and I can communicate with him in many ways, although I'm not sure I would like the direction his character went into later series. <br /> <br /> Early episodes were fun, good simple teen plots for Paul and Cate disciples, but I think the show is gone when John Ritter died. I wondered about the cast and the team who wanted to continue the series, but when he died, I felt the program did. For me, the whole point of the exhibition was based on "8 simple rules for getting to know my teenage daughter", written by a real man with teenage daughters, and that the relevance and angle of the show changed without Hennessey's father. <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed more annoying, Rory remained the same and Cate always gave lessons to the lives of his offspring, which previously seemed more fun than everything left for Paul. I think the grandfather is funny (especially when he looks at the big escape) but feels that C.J. She is partly funny, but I felt that during her arrival, the story lines were very similar to other American comedy series. It's not bad for all the newer ones to just miss the excitement, and does anyone find it annoying that Cate works at school and C.J and Granddad are always there? I'd always recommend this example to friends because it was very strong at first and very worthy for Paul and Kerry, but later they were the best.
