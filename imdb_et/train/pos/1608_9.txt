Seeing "Moonstrucki" for so many years is a reminder of how cute and sensational this film was when it first appeared. Who knew Cher could work? Who ever heard of Olympia Dukak? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not well-known for their comedy talents and Norman Jewison was not a director. <br /> <br /> The only truly definite remark in this great work is "When will the Moon hit your eye like Big Pizza Pie, this is Amore," a song that sings too many times in the movie (once is too much) and having is a popular music long life. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to be married and doesn't have to love the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges her to offer her a pink ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, attacking her dying mother in Sicily. He lets Loretta see that his strange brother, Ronny, is attending a wedding. Loretta stands with Ronny and loves her quickly. Meanwhile, his father (Vincent Gardenia) deceives his mother (Olympia Dukak), whom Loretta accidentally discovered when Ronny invited him to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Everything works in the end, inevitably in the movies of this genre. In the meantime, all the actors are amazingly released and the audience can be enjoyed. "Moonstruck", in turn, is how Hollywood was at its best: entertainment is not social. If they had lost "It's Amore," it would have been perfect.
