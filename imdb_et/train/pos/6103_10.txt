I recently saw a movie at the Boston Film Festival. The film was very fun and I believe in the world and black America is ready to see. It's comedy, drama, the soundtrack is great. This is a good movie. The characters were well-developed and the film had many different prominent actors, such as Wood Harris (remember full-length), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and the great Zoe Saldana (Drumline), Pirates of the Caribbean). In a short time, the film deals with many important topics in today's society and does it in class and grace. It's not just a story about life in a hospital, it's a story about people and their personal journey to discover who they are or who they are.
