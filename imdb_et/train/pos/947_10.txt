and perhaps the closest to Dickens story. While I find it difficult to look at the young Ebenezer (who had the idea that the hair of the period was definitely better!), Scott Scrooge does an incredible job. His delivery from some of Dickens' lines finally brought me life. Edward Woodward is all we expect and more of Santa's ghost. I find G.C. Scott's Scrooge is a much more plausible scam than the current version of Patrick Stewart. Scrooge's Christmas Eve, when he realizes that he has not "forgotten", is enough to convince Scott to know how to operate at an overcharge. He's phenomenal here. Almost all cast is incredible. Tiny Tim in this Christmas song version is a bit tough to watch, almost too sweet. Nonetheless, music and landscapes are looking at it every time they leave. Enjoy!
