Jane Porter's former love interest Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) came to the hidden jungle of Tarzan to look for an ivory gold mine called "Elephant's Graveyard". only we will soon discover that both men have hidden intentions ... namely Jane. Does Tarzan stand for this? It is unlikely (in fact, Tarzan is not even "disturbed by Elephant's Graveyard") and when Martin tries to do so, he will only try to remove Tarzan's image if he later finds himself in a difficult world later and with his party (including Jane who leaves with them after he believes Tarzan is dead) is busy with the local tribe to bring them to the lions. Is Tarzan enough and able to get them on time? <br /> <br /> This movie is an adventure that is full of scenes and tops of Tarzan and other wild animals that capture the viewer's interest and don't let go. The cruelty to animals and the portrayal of local people may be a bit disturbing today, but everyone should remember that this is basically a fantasy adventure and should not be taken so seriously.
