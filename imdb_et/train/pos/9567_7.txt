I watched the DVD of this movie, which also has an excellent commentary track (in English). In Cambodia, it seems that subtitles in English say the character speaks Thai, but the film says Cambodia. A very violent man raises the boys to kill, using hunger and training them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and kills a police partner at the time of killing. Police Wai is an open cannon who is worried about his father, who is also a policeman who has shot and is in a coma. Wai's manager is his father's friend and is worried about Wai's wrong behavior. She doesn't know that Wai was the one who tried to deal with her father's drug dealers and put her in a coma. Pang escapes and hides a cunning dump where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and continues to repeat her father because she doesn't let her leave (Pang doesn't speak Chinese and doesn't understand it but saves her father who seems to Wai is getting obsessed with Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable, even after Pang steals a boat and takes a wife to her home, where they are married and she gets pregnant , follows Wai and joins the evil man (who trains the boys) to fight and train so he can get Pang. There is a big showdown between Wai and Pang, where the big victim has been horribly abused and left Wai dead and Pang cuts his child from dead mother die and leave it as the next boy to grow as a killer. This movie is decorated with a great soundtrack. There's a lot of brutal violent scenes. A woman with a long nail pulled her leg t out knives for neck and torso. Weapons were shot directly on the head. And several very intense beating. It may be gloomy, intense and booming, but it's definitely worth it.
