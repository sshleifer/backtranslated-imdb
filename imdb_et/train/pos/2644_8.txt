I don't know what this movie is so cute, but when I first saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or war dramas, but I was really wondering how and when Winfield would find his child. He knows the boy is with green eyes. It must be said that I haven't seen this movie for years or shown on television for a while, but this film is somewhat of a man's odyssey after the war. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart-warming image of his lost man. In this film, there is a basic message that he is looking for the final splitting of the human morality of this war and the reality he is facing. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or the video has no mystery to me.
