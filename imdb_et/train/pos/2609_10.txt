I write it 9 years after the last episode was on air and I still rolled over when Wildside influenced me. <br /> <br /> It's actually gone where numerous other police trunks have gone and succeeded. But it took it forward and did not get lost in street realism, often depicting life events and characters for T. "Underbelly", which has been dramatically overhauled and has worked to create an entire American esquire garbage load. <br /> <br /> Wildside remained the most unique and truly charming feature of Sydney. It was class A and it is a disgrace to see that only a few actors have developed their careers, while others are blinded. <br /> <br /> I don't want Australia to forget about this great television history, so please let ABC release the entire series on DVD, not the first three. Complete this series to finish what it deserves.
