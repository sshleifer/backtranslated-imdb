After playing the nympho in WINDES WIND, Dorothy finally wrote to her sweet sister / wife role and demonstrated her ability to play the best of mantrappe. He and Gloria Grahame played the same kind of tramp - and his efforts here in a highly manipulative role were won by the actress Oscar, who was best supported by Malone. <br /> <br /> The film he has is not exactly the same as the Oscar standards, but it is a strong enough melodrama by Douglas Sirk's capable hands. The explosive opening scene has an almost fictional look and tones the rest of the delicate tones of fireworks featuring ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as headrests. <br /> <br /> Drama focuses on domestic looting among the rich population of oil-rich families, with emphasis on strong supporters Stack and Malone. Both seize the opportunity with both hands, and Stack would have to give his fine work as a weak alcohol brother, driven by despair with his natural motives. <br /> <br /> Nominal letters are a less impressive job, but do it with your usual skill and conviction - Hudson and Bacall. They play their more sympathetic role with quiet authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly striking (as is usually the case with Sirk), but it does not preclude me from thinking about the film. as the Technicolor film's LEAVE HER to HEAVEN vein. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching a wide range of interesting shows.
