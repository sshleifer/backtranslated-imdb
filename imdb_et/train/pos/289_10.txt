I love all the movies Michael Landon Jr. And the casting of Michael Landon Jr's Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" couldn't be better. Dale Midkiff has the opportunity to draw this character. <br /> <br /> This movie continued with me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The Missie & Willies Girl's Death With Clarks was just a timing of the gods. How they died and how Clark helped them do this was the love of the fathers. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 movies [Love Comes Softly before, love a long-lasting promise and love a long journey], I feel like you see this movie and you can easily understand it. However, leave and want to see the history of the previous 3 movies with all the characters behind them. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr is a great director <br /> <br /> Look forward to more movies in the future.
