Wonderful James Stewart, Vera Miles vehicle. This makes the FBI's historical film so good that it is a family element involved in a 35-year career, as Stewart has shown in the film. It deals with airplane bombs, Indians from Oklahoma kill real estate, fight organized crime, Nazis and communists in this order. The human element is never far away, because Stewart is in front of Vera Miles. They raise 3 children because Miles's heart goes out of Stewart each time. <br /> <br /> Look for a short but memorable job from Murray Hamilton. Years later, he appeared in 1967 as "The Graduate." <br /> <br /> The film has nothing but praise to Mr Edgar Hoover. He definitely brought the FBI to par. <br /> <br /> True, it can be seen as right-wing propaganda, especially with Stewart's real Republican views, but it is well done, historically informative, and the view family so well depicted.
