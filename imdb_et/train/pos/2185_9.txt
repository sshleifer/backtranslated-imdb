Poor Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who has lost a museum. He has fake it for a while, buying lyrics and music from various sources. The problem is that the two sources (Bing Crosby's music) and (Mary Martin's words) meet and fall in love. And then they discover what they've done. There are complications, but everything is justified at the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing horribly. Mary had signed the Paramount Agreement and at the same time doubled as Crosby's Kraft Music Hall radio. For reasons I don't understand, the film's viewers didn't take him, so he went back to Broadway and made one Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, a few times when he played comedy, does it very well. His ego deflates constantly with Oscar Levant and again I'm surprised that they didn't make more movies together. <br /> <br /> As with most Crosby's Paramount vehicles, there are no large number of product numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer title setup that has been made as an expression stroke at a pawn. Good work for all. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
