This was undoubtedly the best of the Dirty Harry series. Opening credits bring up a revenge story that hits hard and is deeply enticing. Sondra Locke is the perfect traumatized woman for revenge. Eastwood has many "aside" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but to show Harry the best of his bad things. Loaded with unforgettable characters in small roles, this film tends to and should work as a standard for detective / action clips. It's a Dirty Harry flick that is raw and has no "fluffy". I can look at it over and over again (okay, not in one session) because it's a joyous "revenge" thread. Speed ​​is fast and many scenes are unforgettable. "Go ahead - do your day ... You feel lucky, Punk? ...." classic Eastwood as just Eastwood, his distressed, haunting expressions and whispering, threatening voice can do that.
