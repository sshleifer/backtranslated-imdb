There should be a sub-genre in the West called Robert Mitchum Western. Mitchum's brilliant, self-evident, usually undervalued westerners are importing their film's noir staff to eat some of the heavily dark characters, and bring fatigue from the more elegant world of Sam Peckinpah's films. "Man with a gun" is one of his best. Director Orson Welles protests Richard Wilson, a harsh, monochrome beauty, full of cool silhouettes and terrible outbursts of violence, as Mitchum comes to a city that has been privatized by the army with a monopoly of terrorism. Mitchum's Regression is a mysteriously abducted murderer with a lot of dark emotions, a wonderful expressive, physical behavior.
