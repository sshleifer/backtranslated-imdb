I love this example. I look at all the attacks every day, even though I've seen them all like 6 times each time. <br /> <br /> It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly lives with Val, when their father goes to Japan. Val is a perfect life, he has a boy and a perfect apartment in the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show mainly shows all the problems that Vall and Holly go through. the main problem is boys, but also responsibility and other lifestyle choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 years old and is free, while Val is the opposite. He is organized, who must have a plan to do something like that. Other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren, and Tina.
