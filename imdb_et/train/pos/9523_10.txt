I loved this movie! I'm a true Tom Hanks fan, and I've always impressed with my work. His most dramatic roles, such as Cast Away, Green Mile, Ryan Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, and Philadelphia. For her fun roles, like their own, the Turner and the Hooch Union, try me, if you can, Ladies Killers, Big & Of course Toy Story. But in this movie, Hanks is not the only big actor on the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, an emerging star who shows a great promise to celebrate Hollywood stars as Hanks' son and gives something good. He's definitely someone who follows his career, I believe he's doing great things. Paul Newman is always on the screen with excellent performance. He's really a legend. We cannot forget people who did not have such a big role in the film, but they did it perfectly. Beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is a woman from Bastard Out of Carolina & Single White, will never forget, it will bring her grace to the screen when Hank's wife is on film and doing a great job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the movie. With such a small role, she does such a good job as her roles in Lemony Snickets and Sweet in November, and I dreamed of Africa giving a great result.
