There are many (just like most Twilight Zone episodes) in this episode, such as the woman's incredibly sexist military "united". And some things are so incredible, such as easy access to clean water. However, consider this year and time and you will quickly understand why this episode is so special as you look. It has a nice sense of hope that is missing from many of the Twilight zones, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact that she rarely speaks), anything else rarely in the twilight zone. "Two" is a great example of how Twilight Zone in just over 20 minutes offered more emotions and drama than most two hours of movies. And it's nice to see two people who got American icons so early in their career.
