Here's a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon for Halloween. I know it doesn't have much fatigue, but it has a "trick" like "Trick or Treat" as Jerry did to Tom with a window cover and a vacuum cleaner that had a collar on it. ghost; but I still want to put it in my Halloween cartoons. In this short period of time, Tom listened to the "spiritual hour" on the radio, which was a ghost story, and frightened the horror story. The story of halfway, drama (the hair that stops, the heart jumps in the throat, the icy chills on the back) begin with Tom. . . literally. And Jerry was watching the whole thing and laughing at himself, thinking he was raising Tom's fears of scaring him. <br /> <br /> I love the end, it was a little funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons where Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; others are Lonesome Mouse, Mouse House and Nit-Witty Kitty. And this short is the first of the twenty-five cartoons where Tom talks. Others are Loneome Mouse, Zoot Cat, Million Dollar Cat, Bodyguard, Mouse Trouble, Mouse to Dinner, Silent Please !, Trap Happy, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleanup, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and Cat Above and Mouse Below Headed by Chuck Jones.
