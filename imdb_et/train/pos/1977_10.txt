I love this movie. I remember once, when I was in Grade 2, my teacher showed it on a 16 mm film roll. However, this film may be a bit scary for the other occupant, for example, a scene where Bill's murders in Nancy and Fagin's face appear for the first time on the screen. One of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because he studied it in a music class. If I were a teacher and I could classify the people who made this great film, I'd give them A +.
