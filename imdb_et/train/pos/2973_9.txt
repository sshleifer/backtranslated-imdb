Here is one movie that is really funny at every moment it covers. How can it not be said that this film marks the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I didn't know right now that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent in acting and writing was quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that they were later Matt and Trey. Humor is sometimes crude, sometimes flawless, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid, but in general it is one of the hell of a film that is undoubtedly appreciated. In fact, its crazy. Completely crazy.
