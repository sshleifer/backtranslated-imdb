Never watched this movie and enjoyed singing and dancing with Cagney and other cast members, namely: Dick Powell (Scott Blair), who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who writes music and finally produces the prologues shown in the 1930s cinema. Chester has problems with people trying to steal their ideas for their exhibitions. This is a very fun movie with a lot of comedy and lots of laughs. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) gave a great supportive role, who was also very young and beautiful. Dick Powell was an excellent singer and dancer and just started his long and successful screen career. Enjoy.
