Just looking at this movie again from the 1998 VH-1 show, I just had to comment. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie on television, it was around 1981 and I remember it. my mother betamax. For some reason, it ended up with a black and white tape that gave him a time-out that I liked. <br /> <br /> I remember a movie that begins with the song "My Bonnie" very clearly. camera placed in Liverpool scene. I also remember the opening scene where Paul moves to some girls and says, "Look, talent!" So it was with great excitement that I jumped in my taped version of 1998 and "remembered" that the movie opened instead of "My Love" instead of "My Bonnie". When you see how slow the camera is being set against the speed of music, you'll see that "He loves you" just doesn't fit. Also in this "later" version, when Paul sees the girls, he says, "Look, girls!" .. and somehow remembering the earlier version, this word didn't seem to fit. Why did they feel they had to move the American film from American to American audience. Personally, when I watch a movie from the British band, I want all British colloquiums and one that is part of their speech, motives, etc. Another irritation was how "dirty" editing was on television. Just after Stu was beaten, the film cuts the film with a commercial shot. Yes, I know it depends on the net, but it really destroys the effect of the movie that it would be cut, as we all know. What some people may consider to be irrelevant to the dialogue (and therefore correct editing) can actually go to the next step or scene. <br /> <br /> My point is the "best" version of this movie was probably an earlier version that I recorded since 1981 and that just happened to include the "Shake, Rattle & Roll" scene, which I did in 1998. did not. I started to assume that two different versions of the television had to be made, and looking at the link to "alternative versions" of this movie proved that I was right. The fact that the American version had some shorter / cut / different scenes and / or dialogue is a big disappointment for me and something worth mentioning when caring for such things. Imo, the best chance is to try and get the European version of this movie, if possible, even less likely. Unfortunately, I had to throw away my old betamax version of Europe because I didn't know how to change it. <br /> <br /> All this aside, I found this film to be one of the best films behind the Beatles' birth. Being aware of the fact that artistic and creative licenses are often used in films and television to depict historical events, I did not promise to enjoy the film. Of course you can see that Beatles plays songs in Cavern that made me think, "Did they even write that they were writing back? I don't believe it," but I thought it was a great movie and performances, wonderful <br /> <br /> The actual condition for me was actually actor John, Stephen MacKenna. I just loved her. His appearance, motives, personality and voice of speech seemed to be on the spot. He looked like a young John, so I can make a double shot at the end of the movie when you see Ed Sullivan for the first time. I found myself questioning whether it was the actual Beatle movie until I saw other actors. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for dead exact history of Beatles life and beginning, you will get nothing better than: "The Beatles' Anthology," as the guys themselves "wrote". However, if you are looking for a fun snapshot of your pre-Beatleman days leading up to the United States and leaving your anal critical ratings on the door, you can't go wrong with "Beatles Birth" - - OR any "real" or random Beatle fan.
