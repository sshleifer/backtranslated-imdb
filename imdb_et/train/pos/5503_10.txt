The material of this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears. Yes, the tears I tell you. This popular struggle for the traditionally exploited population should encourage us all to stand up for their rights, increase the community's prosperity, and stop making cowardly apologies for the company not being challenged. Chavez represents the weak and unhappy in the same way that Bush is on the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran. Indeed, Latin America is being redesigned and a marginalized majority will eventually have a voice over five centuries. In Mexico, Calderon stole the elections clearly. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to allow him to run indefinitely. It can't be tolerated. It is enough for politics and back to film; Speed ​​is a breathing opportunity at times and with others deeply philosophical. It depicts Chavez as a popular hero who is not afraid of US hegemony and global resource domination. If you think the author is in favor of Chavez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. One of the important messages of the film is questioning the sources of information, as the supporters of the disgracefully accused snippets apparently supported by Chavez's supporters. Venezuela puts America's alleged democracy into shame. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
