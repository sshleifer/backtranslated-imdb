Usually I don't like Emma Roberts so much, but after watching Nancy Drew it changed my thoughts. The movies made the whole thing exciting and funny. Most of the time you watch a mystical movie, you can solve it before the exhibition's average, but in this movie it's like you really are. Tips must all fit until you finally understand the crime. I'm still surprised at how he found it. The whole movie was really smart and the people who watched it loved the movie. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I don't think there would be such a movie until the sequel came. I give it nine because popular girls didn't really know that part, but they still laugh. It was really a great movie and a great secret. I strongly recommend that you look at it.
