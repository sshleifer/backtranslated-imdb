I've been waiting to see it because I saw it for the first time in my work. Finally, he found a lifetime movie channel yesterday at 2/13/02. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments about being a "sweet funny story of two human crosses" were dead. Probably writers should not get a bonus for making a movie, all other SROs. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie should see it. <br /> <br /> Natasha's screen is so warm and her smile so electric to say something about her beauty that something she's going to go to my favorite list. His TV and the printed interviews I've seen are just as refreshing and worth looking. <br /> <br /> God blesses him, his family, and future aspirations. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't seem to be available on DVD or video yet, but I'd be the first to buy it, and I think others too.
