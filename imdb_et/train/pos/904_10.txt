Suraj Barjatya is the best in married movies. And here he is; back to your basics Vivaah. As this story goes, it's a story of marriage. A movie that you can look around with your family. The movie you hate looking at alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, cinematography is great, the direction is the best, all the film has its own class. There are a lot of scenes that make you cry and I'm sure that if you watch a movie with your loved one, you will definitely stick to each other until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita iodine has given us hidden movies like Ishq Vishq and & Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good film, the public did not accept it well. A truly Shahid & Amrita movie.
