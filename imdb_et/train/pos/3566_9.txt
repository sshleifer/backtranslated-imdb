In 1954, Marlon Brando had been after Streetcar Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had to reinvent himself on the silver screen. But depicting Sinatra in the form of former Nathan Detroit, Sinatra helped restore her fans. <br /> <br /> This is a great game and the choice of drivers and supporters is terrible. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? It was her only singing role when she depicted Sky Masterson. In addition, female leaders Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (playing their role as a longtime friend of Nathan, Adelaide) made a great effort. Especially talk about the big Stubby Kaye (like Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, Rockin 'Boat is not even close to Stubby. Sheldon Leonard, who continues to fame on TV shows such as the Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, makes "Harry Horse" a miracle, BSPulley is great as harsh and harsh speaks "Big Julie", and even Regis Toomey offers his excellence as "brother" Numeric ". <br /> <br /> It's one of the fun music, good comedy and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" And Brother ... "It's Your Dice"
