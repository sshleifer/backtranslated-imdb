Exquisite effort for Australian show. which is probably not surprising as the high-quality Aussie drama seems to be recovering somewhat. dare to compare this example of love with my way? no. but it reminds us of our early secret life. Great, gibney works in his magic with the first two episodes I've seen, the British cast is also strong with especially tendon and lizzie characters. But abe forsythe can be a sustainable light (not what it needs to save) when this exhibition is to get another season. I was not a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome celebration mini-series a few years ago, but he was always greener than green. it is also good to see brooke satchwell again. hopes that the play improves during each episode.
