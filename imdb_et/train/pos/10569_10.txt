Smart, sharp, funny, fast paced, sexy, extravagant, buggy, erotic, affectionate and brilliant, Footlight Parade is a first-rate entertainment that's about movies. <br /> <br /> Realistic, satirical treatment gives the material a fresh edge and its speed and delivery are breathtaking. To guess that they only started to talk about pictures before 7 years ago! The shine of dialogue cannot be matched today, especially since realism has taken over and contributed to contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was made at a time when Hayes code limiting content was ignored and the result is a fresh, self-referencing, critical and lively cinema that spoke directly to a modern audience suffering from a general depression and age. I would recommend watching films from this period, ie 1930-1935, on the vision of a popular cinema.
