I've never been great in IMAX movies. They are cool, but when you get the first boost, "you feel like flying!" the films themselves are usually horns and ordinary. The exception has been the powerful "Everest", the exhilarating "Wild California" and now the BBC "The Human Body", which is a super-sized look on the inside of our bodies. Our bodies are complex machines that are simply inconceivable. This 50-minute movie can be 10 hours long and still doesn't reach all systems that work as tandem, as I write this review and listen to my radio, and most of us take it for granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of the pumping heart (looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of the lungs, the small hair in your earlobe that processes the sound, the child's development inside the mother's uterus and, surprisingly, some ... um, the less attractive features What I thought it would be scary (pimples, proliferation of acids ...) <br /> <br /> It has a rather funky style that distinguishes it from other IMAX documentaries. For example, have we all seen sperm finding an egg, but have you ever seen it in Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" setup? Such creative moments make the "Human Body" not only for health training, but also for fun.
