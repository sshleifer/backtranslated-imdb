The film was a long-awaited publication that was a bit disappointing about expectations. If you look at it again, I must say that it is actually OK. First, it is very true to the original history (of course not entirely) and it is only made to preserve the right of the film. The history of modesty is shown as a child that is very true to the original. The action may not be the best around and the plot is a bit thin, but when compared to the 1966 Vitti movie, it is better because it doesn't try to be musical. In general, I would only recommend it to Modesty Blaise fans or anyone who catches the TV.
