I first watched the Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 years old, and I thought that both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they must have anyway, as I was trying to learn so much about the real Sheriff Buford Pusser when watching movies as I can. All three of the films were chased by the chills and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just want him to be alive today and more like him. I would like to thank her for getting rid of all the crimes and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart goes to them. So the 30-year-old Sheriff Pusser fan and 3-part Walking Tall movies and actors are not negative to these films and actors, but tried to tell us what a wonderful Buford Pusser was and what a big family he was . And for all young people who haven't heard a lot about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and get more information about him.
