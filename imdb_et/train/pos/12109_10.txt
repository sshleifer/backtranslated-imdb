Wait! Japan is really a fun show and I like it! This was recently shown in our country on Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. Located in Azuma Kazuma, who is trying to fulfill his dream to make Japanese bread that represents his country. He works at Panto's southern part of Toyo and also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) with other bakery products (such as Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru). To conquer Pierre and control Pantasia. They fight against other skilful bakery products in many other countries and learn not only to cook different breads, but also to learn how to cook. It is really a funny and unique anime because they also mimic other anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous people from real life. This is one of Takashi Haschiguch's best works and is indeed a must-see for people of different years.
