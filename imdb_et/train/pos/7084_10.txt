I can't decide if this is one of my favorite films. It is a good thriller and has an emotional core, but I can't decide. I certainly liked it. This is Terry Gilliam's first film I've seen. My first impression? I was working until the end and it's not all that complicated (be confusing). <br /> <br /> The movie will be set in the future. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future to get information from the past (1996). The virus killed 5 billion people. He will be sent from the future to get information about it. Here is also the name of the psychiatrist Kathryn Railly. The love story is beautifully depicted and you really feel the longing for this love and the longing for a normal life. The loose ends are very interesting at the end. One thing I liked about this movie is that, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film did not favor any boring social commentary, and instead focused on one man and his longing for regular life. "You want to see the ocean, be with him" is especially the rhythm of the film in this sense. He decides to focus on the tension and confusion in the human mind. That is why it is not exactly after the apocalyptic film, but it could be described as a romantic sci fi film whose themes range from time to time to blur and so on. This makes this film a special film of the 1990s. The complex primer flows smoothly without adding too many signs. <br /> <br /> The performances are pretty good. Bruce willis surprised me here, because he was not here in the usual harsh boy, but he gave good results to a man in love confused. His despair in certain sequences is beautifully depicted. I have to review my other films. Gorgeous Madeleine Stowe is quite gentle. After that movie, I saw EVer, I got so obsessed with her. She has made a great contribution to a woman who sympathizes with her patient and finally falls in love with her. Brad Pitt is a real surprise when he depicts a crazy Jeffrey Goines man. The appearance of his Oscar nominees is quite surprising, given that he does not have many critics with generous words. <br /> <br /> The end is quite cold and this is another reason to watch the movie. The length or complexity is not such a big problem because this movie is quite fast and there are enough incidents to interest people. And every case of this movie has meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
