Popworld: You are part of a modern armed forces in routine maneuvers during peacetime, and you will find yourself able to change your history over time. What are you doing? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, you're changing the Japanese G.I.s G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) for an American airline crew, lets them talk to stop Pearl Harbor's attack for 90 minutes and then go home and hope nobody reminds you that Japan did it first and more in 1979, this Sonny Chiba movie. But unlike his Hollywood colleague The Final Countdown, this is the premise of being thrown back 400 years in Japanese feudal wars, his peacetime soldiers deciding that their best hope of returning is to provoke history by trying to change it by joining a warlord to conquer the country? Many tank and helicopter samurai activities, including a very impressive 25-minute battleground that contains thousands of pains that cause serious damage to each other. And yes, there are decapitations. <br /> <br /> Of course, things do not go as planned, and even better firepower will not stand up and create thousands of soldiers. Even before that, the soldiers fall out with each other who want to go home, those who want to go to war, and those who want to rape and hell against this hell. With impressively targeted and surprisingly thoughtful reflection, soft rock and earth and western songs are sometimes distracting, especially if they have English words spoken by Japanese singers who cannot hear the pronunciation, let alone speak the language, but this is a forgiving mistake of a surprisingly good sci -fist. <br /> <br /> Optimumi UK DVD is a good cut for a good 138-minute version.
