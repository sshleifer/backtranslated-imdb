This is a strange film for me because after watching a nice movie from a new filmmaker (FAR OUT, Phil Mucci), another writer / director Ryan Jafri contacted me and asked me to watch his film THE CURE. I usually don't watch such movies, but what the hell - I love shorts and couldn't wait to see you. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, when I found myself doing like CURE, I wasn't excited about it and let Jafri know. To encourage him, he encouraged me to look at it - giving him a fair assessment. <br /> <br /> The film has a tremendous style and it is exceptional for Jafri's direction - especially for such an inexperienced movie maker (this is his first film). The choice of the extraordinary color, tempo and music for the film combined the perfect atmosphere. You're really drawn into the movie and it's a credit for making a movie. But the thing I didn't love was some writings. Although the basic idea was great, the end was too easy to predict. I would have really loved this end if it had come more surprisingly or had an unexpected twist. Given that this film comes from someone who should not make such a professional film based on their experience, it is a good hope for their future. Good work.
