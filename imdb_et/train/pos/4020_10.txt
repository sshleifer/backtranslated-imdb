Dwivedi Pinjar is a fantastic movie. This is definitely the 2003 fat and the best. There are very good results. Dwivedi knows what he can get out of MAST Urmila. she's like u never seen. one real great performance. with him is a good actor Manoj bajpai, who has shown what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film talks about a girl (Urmila) who lives before the partition in Pakistan. he comes from a family of punjabi living in a small town. he is a kidnapped Muslim guy who is part of a dedicated fight against the Punjab family. and then followed by a series of turns, as urmila's arranged marriage has passed a few days. this movie is really a very good movie. The storyline is an amazing scenario. all the performances like flower dubey, isha cop (u wont faithev, but he can act besides jus dancini in khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and more. Positive points add these kits to the pre-partition of Pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background. from start to finish u r u'r seat issue whats next? this movie is not worth watching, but it's earned to be part of your movie collection. The final scene is the end of the movie. I offer all those No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-rubber-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowds to watch this amazing flick. my rating: 10/10.
