In the middle of the middle and the skirts of Detroit, the comedy I found was a great new comic duo. "Noriyuki Pat Morita" is a very funny guy who happens to be a Japanese policeman in an industrial secret thief who has stolen a "proto-type" turbo super charger, reluctantly going to the United States to follow the thief after his commander has ordered. The character himself hits the "Jay Leno" character, fast speaking, but with Detroit policeman. When they cross on the road, Japan's venerable ways meet with all the old schools in Detroit police investigating ways. Two stumble and travel on top of each other, but then develop a "rhythm" that becomes a two-layered explosive team that solves the incident, cold. After fighting against the "equipment" stolen by the city's criminal boss and closing the case, these two disobedience remain with each other against friends and co-workers. Slightly worse about the wear and the extended vacation that is needed, they have succeeded in a victorious closure. I appreciated it 9. The direction of Lewis makes it "perfect comedy". Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
