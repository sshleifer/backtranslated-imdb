It is a subtle drama and a nice change from today's more hectic and louder films. This is another firm store, which means that much of it can be dramatic. Frankly, I don't know, but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story tells of a young man who is back in fifty years who is interested in Rocketry and wants to get out of it, not to work in coal mines like everyone else, including his father, in the city of West Virginia. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I thought was superfluous. I'd like a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> A young man, still a boy, plays Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first powerful tasks. She's nice, like her school mates here. It's nice to see nice kids in today's movie. Two other key players in the film are Chris Cooper (father) and Laura Dern (a child teacher who always encourages her.) <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is good, the sound of the 1950s is fun to hear. Once again, I want more of these films made today.
