The plot's intellect is about as light as a feather. However, the advantage is the boy and the girl with the classic refusal we are accustomed to "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" are now missing. Instead of a typical casual acquaintance, former dance lovers are Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love with their dance days. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a problem with 30-year-old music. misunderstanding of romance, classical treatment, and the slight irritation of sabotage listening to the bicarbonate soda is something quite special for Ginger. And then, in the great tradition of reduced finance, Hollywood's best entertainers are no better than show. <br /> <br /> Beautiful numbers in Irving Berlin are scattered throughout the show. Top hats and evening dresses are saved until the end, which remains refreshing. Fred and Ginger are once again captivating the world ... and the navy's charm. Everyone and everything is just so enjoyable again. <br /> <br /> Pure classic stupidity. But with Astaire and Rogers we know that it must work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
