I originally saw this very dark comedy on cable TV around 2000. What a surprise and joy! Everything in this movie is covertly armed! Dreyfuss plays "spiritual" don (remember New York, who was supposed to be schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are their most beautiful and NOT play them! So, proving that beauty and toughness DO come together! Then there is a big "bull" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they play the word "devil" verbally. This film is both subtle and bald. For all shots, it can be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see multiple participants in your final or closest role. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of word games and that moves without it, it is the movie for you. Roger Ebert landfill on this film. He's wrong. This is a good, fine film! Maybe just not one of Ebert. I consider it 10 because how well it is done and if the script can be funny, though it is not really a straight comedy movie. I like it so well that I bought it on a DVD because it just doesn't appear on cable TV. Now it's all mine!
