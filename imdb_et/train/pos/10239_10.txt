I disagree with anyone who doesn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie when I was little and I still earn. It is sweet, funny and warms your heart. And this proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although it didn't have much story, it was great when I gave it 10 and two thumbs. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and it proves that your deepest desire and dreams come true. (Tear, tear) <br /> <br /> I love this movie personally when someone says it's sucked when I say "Shame on you." Because it was a delightful little movie and I'm glad that at least some of me liked it.
