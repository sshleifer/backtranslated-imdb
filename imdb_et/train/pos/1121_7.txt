Here is a real strange thing for you. It starts with a second start in the PSYCHO shower room, on the campus, then it becomes terrible when several coeds and their doofy boys sail south of Spring Break. The problem begins when they drive to the Sheriff Dean-led Redneck County. One of the college cuties migrates to the woods, witnessing a sheriff murder and his head blown. It then fires MACON COUNTY LINE-time-dean, traps and killed witnesses one at a time. Tony March is the target of the evil, lousy-happy dean. The overall tone of the movie is really disturbing. The end is so steep that you almost think the director ran out of the movie; it is also a survey of despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is mandatory for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists worldwide.
