Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes is an important film that deals with the dark side of female sexuality (and contains a complete female nudity that surely wins the male). It flirting with sado-seismicism and imprisonment that falls in love with captain theory. <br /> <br /> This feminine libido treatment is sometimes low and jerky, but Borden has traveled far beyond the feminist dogma to give women power through their insatiable lust. One striking scene reveals female female fetishes when a fake fashion photographer, an antagonist, seduces older women who wear pants, asking her to show her how she rides. He pulls a riding culture between his legs, pressing it against his feet, and it greatly increases his excitement. <br /> <br /> Then he suddenly leaves his home and swims gently on a closed door. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bergin plays the artist and, although he falls from a beautiful distance, he chooses the usual Janes and has enough screen presence to believe that women can swallow their line. According to all reports, Sean Young proves a strange person and he is hardly beautiful. Yet, in this film, as an advocate of the district, her intense face and long-lasting slender body and accentuated hips and periodically separated movement are the erotic charm. His performance is robust and complex. Borden has an intriguing view of the world and the fact that it is so inconsistent with today's fetsless zeitgeist I really appreciate.
