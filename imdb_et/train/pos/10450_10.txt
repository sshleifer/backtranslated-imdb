It had randomly scanned the TV channels and found this wonderful movie from two beautiful people who lured each other. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 television series (Nicole). This gal and boy warm up your heart and soul and make you think deeply about your past relationships and how you really want you to have followed your hearts with a man or a gal whom you loved deeply and lost over the years. Jesse and Celine interact to a great extent and communicate with each other with a large magnetic explosion. I look forward to seeing this movie SEQUEL in 2004, and if you have watched this movie, you will feel the same.
