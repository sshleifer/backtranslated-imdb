I couldn't believe in the comments about the movie. <br /> <br /> When I read terrible opinions about the movie, I actually thought you had been watching the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> What I was looking at was incredible! I think the actors and the director did a fantastic job in the movie. <br /> <br /> I was not happy to see if there was an actor before, and I wouldn't have had the modest work they did I have to say about the most credible movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> I don't see why everyone has such a problem with Deanna's choice of medicine for suicide attempts, because the comments seemed to be the choice of actors and her stupid choice. I do not understand this, the movie that someone else has written and directed by someone else, so how can it be an actor's mistake I don't see. I think it was a real plausible film that I watch and recommend again. The opinions are the ones that are and are too bad that so many are so close. I hope I will soon see all the participants who think that everyone played a big role. <br /> <br /> Philipps has been one of the highest-paid actor one day and I hope he can laugh at anyone who has criticized him! You're going to the girl!
