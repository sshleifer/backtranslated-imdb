Harman and Isings' Old Mill Pond is a masterpiece of animation art. The perfect skill and art that characterizes this duos-work is no longer proof than in this comic book. It is disgraceful that so many people see only insulting what is and was always intended for light-hearted entertainment, which in no way attempted to paralyze black people. If this is something, it is a tribute to the black race's infectious humor and musicality. I have not been able to watch this pastry for many years because in England, "racial comrades" have considered it too offensive to show it in multiple racial UK. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would be very happy to review this masterpiece again. I think those who normally look for messages and intentions that were never meant for those cartoons that are, after all, sixty years old should try to ease and remember that the world is a very different place today, but that does not mean to anyone has the right to censor the visible from the past.
