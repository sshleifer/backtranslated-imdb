The collapse of a nuclear power plant will cause most people to die from deadly, poisonous zombies, who naturally continue to be terrible. Ragtag handful of uninfected people do their best to survive this grueling ordeal. Director / co-producer / producer Todd Sheets shows an enthusiastic sincere love and passion for a lively and frightening scary race: he keeps a surprising pace all the time, fills the screen against a mad wall-wall and fortunately keeps a terrible dialogue on a pleasant minimum. What's more, the pages certainly do not skimp on the brilliant graphic and excessive spraying: this picture gives a delicious melting of meat, evisceration, a lot of intestines, one guy has his heart and there's even a nice impalement tree branch. Leaves earn bonus points to keep the tone from gloomy and disgusting literally (for example, almost all major characters stop zombie-chow). This flick has a fair share of bugs: dirty editing, a number of dental-to-fate attempts in the sin, and a terribly terrible act of casting, all of which are necessary. Top-level prizes go to the beautiful and generous Kasey Rausch for her successful Daria Trumillio inventive imagination. Frank Dunlay is also a solid army veteran, Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets' definite grasp of the infectiously slambang feeling of unsuccessful headlong momentum and the obvious affinity of the horror genre ensure that it remains the whole blast look from start to finish.
