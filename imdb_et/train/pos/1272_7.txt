An enjoyable movie, though I think it had the potential to be even better if it had a deeper look. It's a mystery toward the movie to find out why Elly is such a party. Then, when we finally get an explanation of childhood, there is not much detail yet. Maybe they would have shown setbacks or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's still a good movie I watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
