A strong pilot, this two-hour episode will do a great job of creating the characters and background of the original "Star Trek" series "Enterprise", "prequel". It takes some time for the Trek Convention and the clich√© - candy-colored space removers never seem to come out of style, and I can predict that T'pol will be referred to as "seven volcanoes" - but the appearance of the band is strong, the characters are well drawn and we already see tips that this team must be more inventive in different ways than before (later?). Scott Bakula captures the right character as Captain with passion and cruelty, but without his insidiousness, and I look forward to interesting ways in which the engineer, captain of the weapons and communications officer (not just the praised phone operator)! Writers seem to have accepted one big mistake made by "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager". a smaller symbol symbol that can be sorted out later - which I hope will happen because after about one and a half episodes more sorting is required.
