Johny Brings here one of his best style exercises, making a strong movie with a good Yakuza story. Choosing the new Yakuza boss is the beginning of the war in the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it makes sense to use violence in the context of making very strong gang movies. I especially love how he speaks history, moves around all the roles of the Yakuza family and makes us see violence like the only way they can solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> about, technical aspects, film is a good example of a paused, rhythmic and planned way of filming. One year from Hong Kong movies. It's like Infernal things, but without simple action-violence scenes and confusing events. Recommended for all Asian movie lovers. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my English, better done in Spanish lol)
