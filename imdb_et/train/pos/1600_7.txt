It's not a bad movie. It's not wildly funny, but it's interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Fun. It has some funny moments. Cher gives a good result in a role that is against his real life. Its only performance is worth the clock. If this movie had come out today, it wouldn't have been set, but according to the 80's it was <br /> <br /> great.
