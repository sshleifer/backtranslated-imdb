I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s and now in 2006 this movie is one of the best films I've ever seen. I advise anyone to watch this movie. You're not sorry. It has worked well, both real and never boring. Acting is great and the location makes the movie seem like you are. This movie is just the end that makes you lose. The actor is doing an excellent job of depicting a girl who lived on this terrible plane crash in Amazon and shows how she managed to live alone in Amazon. It is incredible that everyone can survive in such conditions. That's why this movie is so appealing. The fact that this is a real story makes the film even more interesting and thinks that a young girl can survive this challenge. I find this movie that I can watch again and again and I never get tired. It's really a compliment, because I have hundreds of movies! I'd say it's probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
