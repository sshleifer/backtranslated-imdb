Shiny adaptation of largely internal monologues by Joseph Strick Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom on June 16, 1904 to re-create Dublin's loving portrait - Bloomsday - celebrated day - double partner! Bravo, directed by Strick, scriptwriter Haines, as well as director and operator of this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel, Tin Drum (1979), filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff, is another suitable film for an interior monologue that I prefer compared to Strick's film. </p> And there are recognizable characters in the movie even though the novel has different names. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, is an outstanding Dublin surgeon at this time. <br /> <br /> This movie has become even richer with additional views across its cutting edge. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
