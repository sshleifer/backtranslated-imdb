For anyone waiting for a traditional superhero, this can be an unpleasant surprise. Surely it is a drama rather than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and is a bit like the Greek tragedy - whatever the protagonist is, it always goes wrong. <br /> <br /> Sasha, like any superhero, takes the law and society does not recognize it. Sasha becomes law. While driving, she meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things become even more difficult for her. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is very dramatic, but the film lacks dynamics. This reminds me somewhat of Ram Gopal Varma's recent films. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is a scene of activities, it becomes so enormously dynamic that before you realize what is happening, it is all over. But the director does not want to impress us with impressive and obvious action. Here, the result of Sasha's activity, which is mostly very drastic, is more important. The result is very little, which also makes it harder to focus on the film. Basically, you have to be very patient to see it. <br /> <br /> Is the movie worth it? It's really hard to answer. I do not believe that this experience enriched me so much, but somehow I think about this film and feel again. Mainly due to the atmosphere that is really dense, but not heated, because all the time there is hope for Sasha and Katya. After all, they are young people who live their entire lives. So no matter how difficult it is, there is always a light joyful voice when they are together.
