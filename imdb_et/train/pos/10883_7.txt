It is surprisingly higher than the average slasher, it's enjoyable and well done, with some decent gore! All the characters are decent and the story is quite fun and Molly Ringwald played a very tedious bitch. I bought it for one dollar on a pawn and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty bad for the budget, plus I loved the mask that the killer was wearing, because it was actually somewhat horrible. It was really cool for Finale, because I loved the way they took the killer, and the end result when the predictable was very fun, plus all the characters except Ringwald were surprisingly pretty! It has been properly done and written, and I thought it was sometimes quite creative and original, and some death scenes were very impressive. This killer didn't share, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like me) should really enjoy this movie. It's surprisingly higher than the average slasher, it's enjoyable and well done, with some decent gore, and I say it's worth a look! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall is doing good! work here with a specific camera work, using horrible settings, good corners and keeping the movie at a fast pace. Action is for sure! Molly Ringwald plays very well about my mother, and I was sorry because she had to be a hero, she turned out better, but not much, I'm surprised she decided to make this movie, but she did a great job! Frank Roberts is fantastic as a killer, he is threatening, horrible and had one mask of hell, and this guy is not scared, he was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays very well with his small role. Jessica Napier is lovely and does good as the second heroine. The rest is good. Generally worth a look! *** 5
