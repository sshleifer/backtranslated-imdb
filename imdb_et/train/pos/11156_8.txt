I don't usually like reality exhibitions, especially those that have made "American Idol" a success. But what I can live with is that. <br /> <br /> Comedians from all over the world fill a short routine for celebrity talent researchers, and if they like, these guys are routinely sent to the actual audience. Then choose from ten or twelve comics to live together and make "Survivor" style competitions using comedy tactics. Then one of the "The Last Comic Stands" is determined. I like to stand comedy, so this is one reality show that holds my interests. There are usually some pretty funny comics. He started a career in talent such as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is that there is a chance that many of these comics were chosen for their contribution to the reality show drama. First they lived with Big Brother, but now they have done it, thanks to God. <br /> <br /> And I have a lot of comedies I felt, but not because they were funny, but because of race, ethnic origin, attitude, gender, etc., when other comics had to beat them. But in general it is a well-made reality, which is two terms until today I thought it was an oxymoron.
