Many mystery stories follow the standard track path: murder the most attacks, clues, the scattering of possible perpses, the spraying of red herring, and the inevitable interruption of the enemy and even smarter crimes. <br /> <br /> "Forgotten" is giving up the miner and giving us some tricky signs that may or may not have happened terribly. The fact that at the end of the three episodes we have no easy answers and no well-connected package can be a bit distracting, but For me this was a smartly designed story that probes, disturbs and haunts the question: what does the evil person look like? <br /> <br /> Great action and production combine mystery easily ... forgotten.
