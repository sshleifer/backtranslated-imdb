Upper notch from Columbo from start to finish. I particularly like communication between Columbo and killer Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Avid Columbo, I cannot remember another one in which he does not end to the end of the killer as he does in other episodes. In the way he tries to determine the correct order of the boxes and the "message" that the nephew left behind, he finally makes him. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is very good, as it is in many others.
