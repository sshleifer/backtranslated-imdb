My favorite movie of all time. Work with an Oscar caliber, all done at the front and back of the camera. The scenario is perfect and, unlike the novel, works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way. The care that other leading characters have drawn is a tribute to the screen writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty could have been won by Oscar for director Mike Newell and operator Rex Maidment. This is Josie Lawrence's best work far away and changed my opinion of Joan Plowright. Looking at this movie at least 50 times, I can't find any mistake. The famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet's music is admiration.
