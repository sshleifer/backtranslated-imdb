I had heard that this movie was good for many of my friends who saw it, and they all said it was amazing, so I had great expectations - and Nancy Drew exceeded those high expectations! It had funny parts, it kept me entertained and all the brides who tried to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing as Nancy Drew. The rest was also very good. I definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I don't know why these guys killed us?!" Corky: "Yes, I thought about it. Actually, it's going to go to me!" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate people trying to kill me. It's so rude!" <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
