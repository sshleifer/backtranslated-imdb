It is not certain that this can be called an anti-war film, it shows war on the elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and proud of it. Even if they are pacifists, they still enjoy the skill level and fight their enemies, even if it is in conflict with the pacifist. Movies are slow and quite unchanging, and in many ways it is more cumbersome than war films according to today's standards, not flying parts of the body like today's movies. It is bold in another way, as you can see killing on a personal level. This is a film of a more thoughtful man. If you look, you don't want to miss anything. The film men's thinking and their interaction is what the film is not about fighting itself or a great exciting story. This may be called a war thriller. <br /> <br /> If you are a warrior, if you are reading or seeing programs about SAS and so on, you would like to watch this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparable movies are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th parallel (1941) with all the characters, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. Everything is unusual on its way and shows the war on a personal level. Enjoy!
