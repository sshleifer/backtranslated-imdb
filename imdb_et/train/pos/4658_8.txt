Talk about a dream - just two of the most amazing actors ever appeared - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - "Hot Millions", a funny, selfish comedy starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets a reappearance of talented computer programmers (Morley) and takes a position in a Malden-led company with expertise. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted his competitor's attention to a company played by Newhart and his neighbor Maggie Smith (who knows him under his second name at home) becomes his secretary for a short time. She can't keep the job and she's seen in the whole movie in a variety of workplaces - everything ends with her dismissal. When Newhart makes progress, he invites Ustinov to his apartment, where it is a career, but two will soon decide that they have been made for each other. Of course, he doesn't know that Ustinov is a cramp. <br /> <br /> This is such a good movie - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be tempted by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and how he breaks out of trouble. But there's a twist that shows you who really is. Don't miss this movie, which is based in London in the 1960s. It is worthy to hear only Maggie Smith, "I've fallen off."
