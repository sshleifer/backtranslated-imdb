2005 Toronto Film Festival Report This is Official; "Takashi Miike" is looted. <br /> <br /> An annual screening of the annual Takashi Miike, The Big Spook War, or The Great Yokai War or Yôkai daisensô. Call what you want, it's a fanatic ride. <br /> <br /> Colon Geddes, a hirmas programmer, said the film was originally aimed at Japanese children. Think of Japan as "Lord of the Rings" or "Endless Story". After screening, I understand where they went with it, but it's "Takashi Miike". He directed '01 film 'Ichi the Killer' when it was screened at the festival bar bags. And no, it was not just a marketing problem. <br /> <br /> Summary of capacities: A young boy with a worrying home life becomes "chosen" and stumbles in the middle of a great spiritual war, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions during his journey. <br /> <br /> It's not really for kids, not too young. You will surely see that some of these spirits (even the friendly ones) are terribly frightened. It's different from what I've seen in the cinema before. Fantasy is, of course, a very funny (but dark) material. You can't be bored to ensure it. Will it ever hit North America? Suspicious. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
