Mating Game is a charming and wonderful film from time to time. Hollywood has to consider the magic of this movie. My wife and I would see it. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie is the best of Tony Randall. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> Loved it. We plan to order a DVD to add to our growing movie collection. <br /> <br /> Too bad Hollywood doesn't make such movies anymore. <br /> <br /> Hi Hollywood. Dig out some of these scripts out of the old safe, refresh them a bit (without breaking the original movie and script, as you have done with other remakes) and hold the selection call. <br /> <br /> would be a big silver silver screen, DVD and cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
