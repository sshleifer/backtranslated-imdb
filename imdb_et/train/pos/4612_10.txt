Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo star in this funny, funny movie. Late Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster, who lives with grandfather Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is fun as a wax museum owner with a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When Hermann's and grandfather's wisdom begins to terrorize the city, they all blame them. These two now have their names before it is too late. You laugh out loud like me.
