As a film by David Lynch, it may be an idea that he depicts his mysterious mind like most of his feature films. But this is a very straight story, because the title may suggest. Don't forget to stay in the usual Lynchian cavity, which usually happens after viewing, ie lost road. It's a simple movie, but it's really a big movie. It is both innovative and fun. It's innovative because it's not so Lynch. But maybe it's Lynch. He loves to twist his thoughts and therefore puts together a film that may seem very mainstream and far from Lynch. Being a very avant-garde director, he can just make such a movie just to dance to his usual audience because he knows what they are waiting for, but he doesn't give it to them. It would be cunning. <br /> <br /> The movie's pace is slow. I'd like to say almost the speed of a lawnmower ... Don't wait for an action struggle, but the movie is really entertaining for those flowing with the film. Look carefully at the small details that are primed in the Lynch movie for all entertainment. Find a great movie that will make this movie live. And listen to the Badalament score and the main theme that really enlivens the often shown Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is one of the best performances of this movie, making him one of the most pleasing creatures ever depicted on film. She doesn't have to say anything to express her feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness looks just through him and his actor earned him the Oscar nomination. Do I say that his weak health in this film didn't work? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after the end of this movie. This knowledge puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes a respect for Farnsworth. All of the above forms are a very nice film that is suitable for all kinds of people who like the film they should do. One might ask a homi who is not so obvious and somewhat naive, but it does not destroy the overall picture because it is a memorable film. 9/10
