The arrival of age films is quite common these days. By 1980, "foxes" really gave their meaning. Jodie Foster plays his character straight out. Since he made the "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, he has a stronger character in this film. She is Jeanie, a high school with great courage, and she seems to be leaving in every situation she is. Scott Baio plays Brad before Chach's "happy days". She's immature for other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hanging on the wrong crowd, driven by her police father. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live in nature until they move into a rented house where the party is completely out of hand. Researching the other side of the track can be either fun or dangerous. Annie saved Jeanie and Brad all the time she was wasted. Reality goes back a lot when it is killed in a car accident. And one gets married to a much older man. Growing is not easy, sometimes we need to study the life, how it is. In fact, you need to be careful about the people around you. For me, I was my person, and I tend to stay in this way! Great music, great plot, this movie is a pearl! 4 out of 5 stars!
