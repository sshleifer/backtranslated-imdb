This is a cute little horror / comedy with Cassandra Peterson or Elvira: The Dark Mistress, the most infamous hostess of all time. It was supposed to be Elvira's pilot tool and it was so successful that the NBC network took it. They filmed a television series pilot to see a black baby, but unfortunately it did not change beyond the pilot phase due to sexual references. But this movie is very amusing. Elvira is the queen of today's Chesty Morgan and one of the liners. This film was followed by a debilitating "Elvira's Haunted Hills" a few years later, which was supposed to be the start of the old Roger Corman movies, but falls on his face. See a lot more fun experience instead of this movie!
