Lauren Bacall lived through the illness and death of Humprey Bogarts. Rock Hudson was at the top of his 1950s. Dorothy Malone is in great shape and wins the Oscar for support. Robert Stack is appointed and falls just for his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit of a soap at some other time, but as valuable as most drama. It is amazing how well drunks are driving in this movie and how fast Stack fits in the early stages of a few movies. <br /> <br /> You understand why this is so good and really wise that this movie is very good. You can say that Bacall is confused during this film because if his action is good, he looks emotionally out of order. <br /> <br /> The sexual references of this movie are so light that many of today's young viewers would not understand what they are. The film does a good job that tells the story and actually leaves the end that needs to be done at the end, although it has never been done - although the written Beyond The Wind would be a good title.
