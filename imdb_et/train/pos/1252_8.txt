The infinite boundaries of our inhumanity against ourselves never stop me. This truly amazing story of a terribly abusive and mostly unheard of population is convincing, well documented, and furious. As an American, I continually lower my country's behavior and it's just one of our long catalogs in the international catalog. We suck. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I've seen, but it made me see what he was doing right away. My only complaint and the reason I gave this movie from just 10 out of 10 is that Pilger shows us this travesty and terrible cooperation between US and UK governments, requiring our viewers / citizens to participate in our own inaction ... but not make suggestions on how to help. I don't know about Britain, but America has made it almost impossible for citizens to participate in the actions of their government. The gesture of the right direction can help the interests of these islands.
