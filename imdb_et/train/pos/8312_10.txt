Little Richard's life and time, as Little Richard said, prepared and directed by Little Richard, was about one-sided as one of his songs. It is not a biography or even a docudrama, but it has a good writing, a great energy and a prominent leading actor playing Richard. All music is by Little Rich, so it tends to lipsync every song. <br /> <br /> The film covers his early childhood, carries music through the shaping years, the natural success and the throwing of Richard all to praise the Lord. All of this is well tied and the obvious return in 1962 succeeds from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles whom he opened. <br /> <br /> My main objection is that his outrageous anti-cultural behavior is underestimated and you don't know how his viewer experienced him at that time. Some of his energy he still does not get full force. He seemed to be thrilling compared to what I remember about him. <br /> <br /> The best scenes for Lucille are to hit Richard and write about it and bikini pants to make it point out that they don't have a proper place to change. <br /> <br /> If they had reached the "Bronze Liberace" when Richard used himself to interview, there would be a story. Trust me that I saw him a few months ago and he still flirts with pretty white boys, giving the audience a particularly good dancer, his headband. Nearly 68 and still strong, I recommend this movie and any concert or T.V. appearance. Little Richard is always on
