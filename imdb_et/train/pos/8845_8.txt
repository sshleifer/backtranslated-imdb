The beginning of this movie is a bit clumsy and confusing, but it sits tight because you are driving your life. The concept is convincing and interesting devices are used to tell the general story. There are fine performances, where Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the best surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves a very strong performance recognition. Mr Lumet's direction is unfulfilled. The film has seventies that feel that this story is about risk, but unlike most tritiated movies in today's landscape, it is a thriller that is sincerely based on relationships rather than special effects or product connectors. . The time invested in this film is heavily paid.
