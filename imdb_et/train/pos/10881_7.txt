"Cut" is a complete tilting of the Slaher genre, and essentially it achieves what it intends to do. Most ordinary clich√©s exist; old creepy house, forests, anonymous, indestructible serum killer, gore buckets and, of course, a couple killed by the killer when they have sex (this is hardly a spoiler). <br /> <br /> The set-up is a simplicity: the film students' nerds are ready to finish the unfinished "masterpiece", due to the murders of the unfinished couple. That's okay - okay, crap - destroys Kylie Minogue on the first roll. They are joined by one of the original film survivors played by Molly Ringwald, who absolutely steals the movie because he gets all the best features. The rest of the majority fits well with their role, especially the lovely Jessica Napier, who plays it directly as chaos and gore around her. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> There is very little time to try to find out who the killer is because the movie is moving so fast. It also has an appropriate low budget, including some awkward edits that are likely to be intentional. Good sound too. If there is any difficulty with this film, it will be decided whether it is sending or respecting the Slasher genre. Probably a little of them.
