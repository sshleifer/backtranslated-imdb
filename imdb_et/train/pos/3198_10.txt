So I felt like watching this movie. I love it. It was fun. But I felt like I began to see someone's psyche and then laugh because it became complicated to make an interesting point. The friend put it in the way: <br /> <br /> "I feel we were invading someone's house and now watching their terrible home videos without their knowledge." <br /> <br /> Another of these things is stranger than movie films. "Groovin 'Gary," the original "Beaver Kid", is a small town boy who appears in a nearby TV channel hoping to get into the movie - and he certainly does, though not, as he originally expected. With great hope for fame and meaning, he calls Harry to come and film the truly terrifying talent she has had in her hometown - her own drag-and-drop action "Olivia Newton-Don". <br /> <br /> Director Trent Harris makes this slow-moving story a great job. Some movies about an uncomfortable child who wants to be someone's morphs in two subsequent interpretations, a story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in a small town in America. At the same time, Harris criticizes the practices of the small town of America, the culture of fame and the exploitation of the film and television industry. <br /> <br /> Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover are stunning. young Sean Penn is the most pleasing - so attentive to the real "Gary footage", but with a strong nuance that gives way to thinking how Harris wants to go. <br /> <br /> In the end, the broad-eyed naivety of the original Gary is what changed me - as opposed to their possible interpretations. <br /> <br /> Film does not leave. I haven't seen anything like that. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
