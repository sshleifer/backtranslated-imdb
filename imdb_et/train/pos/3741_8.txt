The War of Drama, which takes place in Louisiana in 1971. This leads to a number of recruiters through basic training and then through Tigerland - an exact idea of ​​Vietnam on the American surface before they go over. It focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, friends, and the corner squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and the border psycho (Shea Wingham). br /> <br /> Surprisingly non-commercial film, directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses most of the film's handheld camera and uses digital video for fighting scenes. It works very well - the film looks sharp (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covers his Irish brooch and takes a pretty convincing south height. His performance is just great - he is a very talented young man. Unfortunately, Davis is not that good. She is tall, muscular, very beautiful - and very fun. The rest, however, is great. <br /> <br /> This movie was thrown away in this studio. It had no stars, a famous story, and was considered "just another war movie". It was just a week in Boston! It's worth a video or DVD. <br /> <br /> Farrell and Davis also have a long naked scene.
