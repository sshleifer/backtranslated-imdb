Jack Albertson and Sam Levene Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns played role-playing games with a few old Vaudeville comics, Joe Smith and Charles Dale's tradition team, who seem to have a different life view. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can no longer work, the man has never learned to relax, take time and smell the roses. He is an old-fashioned old man whose best days are behind him and his nephew Richard Benjamin is finding less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What hurt him was that about 15 years ago, his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend time with his family. Carefulness, like Matthau, cannot understand this and take the Burns decision personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits the brain storm, connects boys and does it on national television. What's going on here is quite fun. <br /> <br /> Sunshine Boys is also a sad, bittersweet story of old age. Matthau is on screen for most movies, but it's Burns, who got mature in the Oscar-like mature age 79. Burns brought this film a little personal well. As we all know, he was a man of the great comedy team of Burns & Allen, who had many loans from Monty Python's troops. Gracie Allen retired for health reasons in 1958, and George was up to 100 years old. Or at least close to the active performer. <br /> <br /> Sunshine Boys is based on a team of Smith & Dale but if you like The Sunshine Boys, I strongly recommend that you see two tickets to Broadway to see a couple of guys entertaining the American public at the beginning of the last century. The physician's sketch by Matthau and Burns is directly from their material. <br /> <br /> I think you like The Sunshine Boys.
