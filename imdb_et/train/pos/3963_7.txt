The FBI's history, as said agent from Stewart's point of view, through the setbacks, knotted his personal biography. Stewart and Miles (his wife) are pretty good as well as Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes engagement difficult. It's like watching bits and pieces of twelve different movies when we see the glimpse of the gangsters cast. Some episodes are too long, some are too short, and some just look out of place (Stewart's daughter's school order). In general, it goes too long. Nonetheless, you should look for your beautiful production values.
