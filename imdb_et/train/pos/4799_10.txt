Maybe more than a lot of movies, it's not for everyone. For some people, the idea is to slow down, reflect and allow things to happen in their personal hell. For others, this approach is to some of their deepest parts of what they know is part of what they are dealing with for a long time. <br /> <br /> I think it's a function where I am in my life. I read myself in the last group camp. I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, leading me somewhat mythologically. It is indeed a journey story, a rich idea of ​​the distance many of us have to travel when we want to come to the end of our day. <br /> <br /> Much as written by Mr. Farnsworth's Alvin in Sirge, although I am not sure there are words that express desperate sadness and a check on the innocence of a subtle balance. Now knowing that he is really coming to his mortality when he was sitting at the seat of this tractor, I wish I had the opportunity to spend time with him before leaving. I hope he had a little satisfaction and the truth he had brought to so many people, not just "acting", but sharing his absolute humanity with such cruel honesty. <br /> <br /> Given the reality of production economics, I am not sure that Mr Lynch has been given full credit for the courage he showed that the story will develop so slowly. A film-maker, but I understand that there are few areas of modern life where the phrase "time is money" is so descriptive. Entering our hearts deep is not an adventure that can be rushed, and in his credit, Lynch seems to have realized that he is not just talking about the story - he called his viewers to spend time with his mortality. The simple task is not so. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of the movie to introduce you to some valuable part of your own, you might want to make it worse than spending a few hours with Straight Story. And then give yourself a little time for a while, just listening to its echoes at low hours at night.
