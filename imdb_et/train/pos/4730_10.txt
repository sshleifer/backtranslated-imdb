The story is dealt with by Jet League, who has to fight against his old friends. But there is one problem, friends are super fighters. The film is full of blood, super acts and the best tricks forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-actor. Of course, the film is typical of HK-Fun. But I love it! In Germany, the "black mask" is uncut.
