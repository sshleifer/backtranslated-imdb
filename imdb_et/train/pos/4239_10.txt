My observations: post-war fun. Tom Drake and Grandpa "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed is charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton is always good; less than the "Ozzi Wizard". The Spring Byington tea is more beautiful, as well as the assumption that Hamilton is a tiny little nose. Finally, the campsite was a boy of a former neighbor. As a two-year veteran of army tents, he looked quite youthful and inexperienced in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I worked at a department store and it was as elegant as it was. Unfortunately, it's lost and dazzled. We were famous for the magnificent windows of exhibitions that were used to attract the passers-by to the shop so they could buy all this great goods. <br /> <br /> 10/10
