How can't you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this movie is not a lot of fun, but the goal is not to tell you the story, but the story! This is the first "real" film of cinematography ("Pr Prince de Galles" was the first, but it was not technically perfect?) And it certainly has a great international value. Those people you see in the movie finishing the workday were able to take part in the historic moment, becoming the first people to be able to move! And above all, the shot is a beautiful shot! And it's very touching when you think of the first people who saw it! What a moment! Historical science first (since Lumiere's brothers first invented cinematography for scientific reasons) and art later. Watch the movie!
