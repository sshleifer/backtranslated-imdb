Has anyone bought this movie? My Uncle "Hutch" was a true (not reel) pilot who saw his wings beating and then glimpsed with a glance at the pilot wings. <br /> <br /> He's only on the screen for a few seconds, but my family would like to get a movie. He was killed in an Italian military fight. Do we know the movie studio that did it? <br /> <br /> Or has anyone seen it from a video store like Blockbuster? I want them to make a full catalog of these old movies, because DVDs are so cheap to do these days. <br /> <br /> Please send me an email at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
