Polanski returns to loneliness and insanity, which he studied with a huge impact on Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, a tenant. this movie is inconvenient and i'm not sure if it is intentional. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, is not entirely fair here. Since his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a little disappointed with how little truly impressive cinematography is in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really makes a movie down is an actor. Polanski is definitely not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten more than he can chew in Trelkovski's difficult role. Some support casts are great, especially Melvyn Douglas as landlord and Shelley Winters as concierge, but others are weak and wrong. It is also difficult to overcome the fact that all of these alleged paradise children have American accents. <br /> <br /> Quite unexpectedly, the film has fine moments in dark comedy. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is definitely a good comedy actor. However, there are times when it slips dangerously close to the parody. Trelkovski's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) "transformation" is more likely to raise strangulation as eyebrows, which reduces what should have been the powerful moment of his psycho-dramatic journey. is an enjoyable and intriguing experience if it is a bit too outrageous for your own good. There are a handful of exceptionally cool moments and a consistently uncomfortable and predictive atmosphere, but this movie, although it is very good, didn't hit the mark as successfully as it could have been. day, "okay" Polanski movie is still better than most other "good" movies. Be sure to look, just don't wait for it to blow.
