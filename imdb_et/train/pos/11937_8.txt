It was definitely Angels in Outfield. It was on television last night and I believe I didn't see the movie because in my second year in high school and I'm now in my fourth college year. Although the film has a lot of mistakes, it's just so touching that you can't help but sit, watch and enjoy. It's also fun. Danny Glover's ranting is just so upright that you can't laugh at him the most time. It adds a film and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. In fact, you know the characters of the movie, although development is not the best. Must see. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
