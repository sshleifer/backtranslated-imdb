I've seen this movie when I traveled to Brazil. I found it difficult to understand Brazilian culture and society because it has so many regional and class differences. Watching this movie in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something about the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, it is sometimes slightly more dramatic. And this is the only negative comment I have on this film. Sometimes there is too much, too much sex, too much murder and too much cynicism for one movie. The director could film some things a little bit, making the film more effective. Nonetheless, I liked the film and the way the story strikes itself. The characters are complex and very similar to real-life people. Not exactly American actors and actors with lots of cosmetics, but people who can be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the film realistic even when the story is not so convincing.
