Interruption. I must first say that I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but I believed the exhibition and the undeniable talent of Abe Forsythe, I continued to look. I can say for sure that I'm glad I did now. The story is quite well developed and all the characters have a solid foundation and most have no missing information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I get in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and the pronunciation of Lizzie. <br /> <br /> Some good acting with a star plot really show this line. Here's another hope for the season!
