Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force to be used for atomic energy. Unfortunately, Rukh has been contaminated with Radium and starts to glow in the dark - and his touch causes immediate death. Dr Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) is developing an antidote - but Rukh is going to fret about Radius and the antidote and try to kill everything he believed to be wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is silly and the "effects" that make Karloff dark are ridiculous, but it's still a fun little cooler. It moves quickly, has a great atmosphere (mark Rukhi's "house" and the movie starts in the dark and the rain at night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. Frank Drake (like Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (mother) have worked well. So it's OK, but only one below all other Karloff / Lugos movies. The plot is too far for me. I still did it. I'll give her 7.
