I, like many comforter (or Trekkies, I don't care!), Suffered through the Star Trek Voyager for seven seasons, dreaming of a better show when he was finished. The 1999 prayers were answered. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new visual images, intro pop song. (I was shocked!) I don't think of something I didn't like. sign me up for the 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager", no one leaves you! Keep on Trekkin! <br /> <br />>
