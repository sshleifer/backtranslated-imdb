Streisand was signed with CBS for a long-term contract, which is now almost an extinct format that was 22 years old. a handful of the most sold albums, a couple of dazzling television shows of variety and speech, and his successful Broadway ride "Funny Girl". <br /> <br /> The movie is black and white. divided into three parts. With the creative transition of Disney's "Alice in Wonderland" "I'm Late", the first segment cleverly shows that it grows through childhood with such diverse numbers as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five". Open with comic monologue Pearl from Istanbul, the second part of Manhattan's elegant Bergdorf Goodman moves elegantly in glamorous costumes while singing depression songs like "I have a lot of Nuthin" and "The best things in life are free" comic with irony.

For those who are familiar with Streisand only for their expensive concert tickets and political money collection, this is the real eye-opener for why it is now highly revered.
