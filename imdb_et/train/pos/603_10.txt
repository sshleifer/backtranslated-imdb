Albeniz's music goes through this movie. Occasionally it is played with original equipment (eg a piano, but never a full orchestra), but it is often recreated with various modern ensembles (eg guitar) and treatment (eg jazz piano). Only occasionally is music the only focus of the film: most of the time music is set for different dances, often flamenco, but not always. I think there are 12 14 scenes that have not joined the plot. Not all scenes reach the heights of individual viewers. In my case, about half reached the top, although all the rest were very fine in their own way. Those who worked for me took me to the aesthetic joy of goose meat; indeed, the last scene left an impression of joy. And in some very magical ways, it brings you deeply into Spanish culture. If you don't like subtitles, don't worry. The film is almost speechless, although the title of each scene is Albeniz's piece. This very beautiful film sees my sharp complaint that almost no Saura movie is available on DVD in the US. I am thinking here especially of his "Carmen" flamenco version, a remarkable work of art available in Europe, but not here (European DVDs are not played by American DVD players). This is a scandal.
