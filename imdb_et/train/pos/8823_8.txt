Good movie. Talking about boy-fantasy, telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what extreme measures to take differently. Or at least feel that you must break all the rules if you want to break it. If you wanted to express love to someone you don't know, how would you do it without creating an urgent social situation? It is also fascism to decide on other cultural life, what culture we should pull down in our throat. What gives Disney or FOX or suicide attacks the right to decide what our choice is. Can no one drink coffee with one in the morning. Do we have to listen to the NRJ screaming, see foolish tabloid titles and street ads before we've had morning coffee?
