This - and not a little overestimated South Sepia Opera - was the greatest epic to come to Hollywood's biggest year 1939. I don't change the obvious-Cary Granti, Victor McLaglen (who was Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks. Jr. gives great comic results. But I would like to point out that this masterpiece has two more less understandable elements. An excellent final battleground, like the wonderful Sam Jaffe climbs to the top of the temple to blow your silicon and warn the regiment is just great. It never leaves me. Another undervalued element in the film is Eduardo Ciannelli's guru. It is not a cartoon of Fu Manchu, but a well-drawn, literal, historically-informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maury? He won the army left by Alexander the Great"). Indeed, we see parallels between this mysterious, evil national and thirty-specific figure (Germany, not India). Gunga Din, The Nazi Pact? Not quite. But still, a huge, funny, moving epic.
