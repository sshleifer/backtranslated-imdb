I never attended a movie midnight before Dick Tracy came out. <br /> <br /> I still have a "t-shirt ticket" that I had to wear to show somewhere, and "Dick Tracy" has been stuck with me since then. <br /> <br /> When you've seen a movie, sharp images, bright basic colors, and strong characters will undoubtedly be etched in your brain. It's a miracle to see. <br /> <br /> Beatty knows as a director / spouse / co-author / producer that works in the film and shows it here, taking a familiar American icon and creating a whole new era for her. In the 1930s, Tracy is a sort of timeless quality like all good films. I've lost track of how many times I've watched Tracy and I'm still trying something new. <br /> <br /> Others are the top notch, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy best), even Madonna Breathless Mahoney is the right person to act in the right environment ( GASP!). <br /> <br /> But topics such as family necessity, preserving originality, good and evil, even Machiavellia are being studied. But Kummer's comic is odd, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> Overall, Dick Tracy is a classic. Compared to other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. This is a good, strong film that doesn't depend on blood, violence, embarrassment or nudity. <br /> <br /> Here's a lesson. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
