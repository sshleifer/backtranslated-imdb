Includes * spoiler * - my bids may not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone always has satire in social comments and economic parallels - as true. But for me, I see this movie so much. I love the symbolism of this man in a glowing white suit. There is so much confusion and defamation around him, but it doesn't stop there. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play it - his boyfriends and eternal curiosity are so fit: <br /> <br /> "It's brilliant - can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to gasoline?" > <br /> The only moment to win if he realizes that his invention hasn't worked in the end - he is almost naked there. But more than a shame is this simple disappointment that "it didn't work." People have never been intimidated by him. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we also want to stop it." <br /> <br /> Little moments without hesitation before trying to get back. Does he show any signs of such fraud? No. <br /> <br /> The role of Dapne is also significant. She's sick and tired of money. He thinks he has finally found love outside his father's company. At first he didn't care about Sidney anymore than anyone else. But the moment he falls off his car and he goes back to see if he might have killed him - and yet he only thinks about the beauty of his invention. She finally found something she thought was worth living for. The funny thing is that it's not even romance. It is friendship, but so much of an ephemeral character that the title is almost inappropriate. It is more admiration and perhaps even inspiration. <br /> <br /> When he discovered that Michael had no real love for him, and that his father was caring for him, he gave cynicism and pursued Sidney. Fortunately, he finds that there are really people in this world who live more than power, money and lust. What an update: <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sidney. If you had said" yes "I think I would have strangled you." <br /> <br /> I love this end when all this crazy business seems to be something. But then the bubble-free, peculiar beat begins and Sidney goes out, fitting his voice with a voice: involuntarily. Where is Daphne? We don't really know - but they were not really in love and he wasn't really a scientist. He was able to escape the aid, and he became a "hand of hope." (Pollyanna) The future relationship would have been nice, but as Billy Joel says, "it's more than I was hoping ..." <br /> <br />
