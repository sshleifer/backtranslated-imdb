This film has big stars in its earlier years: Ingor Stevens never looked more beautiful; Yul Brynner was very convincing Jean LaFitte, who was in conflict with his piracy and his desire to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a good job with Andrew Jackson, but for a few moments he was a bit tough. It's really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history, AND it shows that all the happy endings do not include lovers with each other - sometimes the happiest end is that they drive away and find partners with similar backgrounds to understand them in the long run better. I've looked at it at least twice a year for 16 years; and while this is not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
