This is a movie that can see you again. I liked how it ended. I didn't see the end, but if the law wasn't blown for the first time, it was suspected that he was back. <br /> <br /> The story is exciting and could have been more psychological, but I understand the story that is needed to catch the viewer and the action was necessary. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe Michael Jr. it may be as obviously unmoved as her younger brother and mother who have blown away. But I appreciate that the game of the scene could not pay attention to us because it had a bigger story. <br /> <br /> Some have complained of Hanks as a gangster. I believe this is not justified. Had his character been more difficult, he wouldn't care if his son pulls the starter or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for that. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
