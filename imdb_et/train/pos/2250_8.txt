This is a great movie about the Mormon fight and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are especially powerful and the message is one we all need to remember - God does not speak, but communicates when we only hear. As I write it in New Orleans and in the surrounding area of ​​Katrina in the midst of ongoing horrors, I was particularly concerned about the Mormons who had to leave everything behind and after Joseph Smith was murdered. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, but they couldn't do it. The Mormon struggle to overcome the state, the cost of life, the difficulties they suffered, were truly awe-inspiring, showing their enormous power. As far as the actual beliefs of the Mormons are concerned, it has not gone far and polygamy has been mentioned, but it is not at the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Excellence is cast, although others who have commented more on real characters and can talk about how the images are true. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell, they're doing a great script they got. While the film could have been independent (and certainly not today), Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to get the crowds into cinemas to see the movie from Mormons. Power is wonderfully beautiful as young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but remains with the family after his father's murder. The power does not have much to do until the end of the film when it has a big scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of making the film) is even less, even though they make a lovely pair. Their fate remains unclear as to its transformation, and no matter what their case is polygamate. However, you can't beat the candy for the eye.
