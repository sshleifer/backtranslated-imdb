New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, where each segment lasts about 10 minutes. Short shorts are not exactly related, but they all have something in common, love. Every short is about finding love, whether it's about a couple or just two strangers who tend to. The stars of the film are the ensemble, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. Waiting for such a horn and so interesting assumption, I was expecting a huge movie; the problem is New York I Love You won't add. It remains the sum of its parts. Some segments are funny, original and interesting, but others are so pointless (segments of Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q) that it's terrible. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Of course, some filmmakers seem to put together. Having said this, the film also has some great moments, one of the best segments of the old pair, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, walking along Brooklyn on their 67th wedding day. Such moments are what made me a viewer, I want the film to be more consistent, because there is a lot of potential here. But if the overall story is not satisfied, cinematography and sound have recorded everything for me. Editing was perfect, the way the movie was taken was very impressive and the essential soundtrack could no longer fit. Finally, New York I Love You feel that this is an experimental film and, like most of the experiences, there are heights and lower. How the film is viewed as a whole that determines whether or not it enjoys it. For some, it may be useful and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
