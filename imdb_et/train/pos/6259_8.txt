I'm really outraged by the comment I read that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful landscape was black and white. It was done in 1925 !!!! I think it's completely unbelievable for this time! The ride that these people had to go through is quite remarkable. They took a week to cross the river. Women wore their children in heavy wooden cradles, climbing on a solid stone sheet, sometimes in barefoot snow. I'd like to see someone do it now! I thought it was a great movie with some really amazing shots and an incredible story.
