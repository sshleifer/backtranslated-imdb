4. The Pokemon movie made me cry when Celeb died. Don't you dare say Pokemon sucks! I don't like people saying that .... I liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, please tell me that Pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. And also, why do Pokemon-haters give low ratings to all or most of the Pokemon movies? I don't understand .... They shouldn't do it .... There's no reason people should just vote without proving Pokemon sucks in addition to: 1) Pokemon is just for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think that's why people don't like Pokemon.
