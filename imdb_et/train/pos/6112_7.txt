This is a chick flick, this is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has added some pretty sweet fight scenes, I don't think any wires were used or if they were they were not flat out of blatant. It's not a terribly complicated movie, so the brain is easy, there's no need to analyze anything to get a deeper meaning, quite simple, good chemistry between managers, and a fun clock. I would like them to say that the girls look at their full potential because they can be amazingly cute, but throughout the film they keep it out of little importance. I look at it again ... with the girl.
