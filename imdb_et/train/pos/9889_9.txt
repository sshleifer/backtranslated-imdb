Read the Eric Review again. He has described my own sense of this film as beautifully as ever. I'm just writing here to encourage you to look for it and see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it several years ago on TV, IFC, which I think. This is a unique film I hesitate to do. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the ruthless evil of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. It's not a Sedona-like Durango, Mexico (from John Wayne), but a really tough and wild place. I have to find this novel to check the original location of the story. Like the location, this film is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone. This is a production that almost motivates me to study film. <br /> <br /> I didn't forget this movie, it's indelible. But over the years I had forgotten its existence. I know someone who has seen it has never read it and has not seen any reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name, I even forgot the title. Well, I want to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** I have been a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez since I posted above, and I regret not having read it before. <br /> <br /> In connection with MsMyth's comment below; The film was filmed in Mexico, but the author is Colombia and did not comment on Mexican or Mexican history in any way, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. I liked the movie? You have to read the story and then all the other Garcia Marquz wrote. And by the way, the original location of the story was Colombia.
