Gandhi Mu Father is a well-made film. It depicts the life of the oldest son of Harandi Harilali. His character, his differences with his father, his love for the family, his desire to stand alone, his failure, his ego .. Akshaye Khanna fully justifies Harila's role. Just not him, everyone did well in their role. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji screen I've ever seen. But I cut three points because there were few shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First, the film was fifteen to twenty minutes longer than it should. Secondly, the film needed more research on Harilali's character. Somewhere the sign seemed incomplete. Nor was his relationship with his brothers shown. No other Gandhi children were mentioned in the film. I believe that a Harilian-like character should also have at least some differences between his brothers, given the egalistic nature of Harilali. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it, despite some flaws.
