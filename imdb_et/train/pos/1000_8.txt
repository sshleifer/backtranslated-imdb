I liked the movie. Some scenes of action were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially liked the opening place with a semi-trailer. Very tense action that seemed well done. <br /> <br /> Some transition scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as slow motion photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles. The film is also funny, there are several parts. I also liked how the bad boy was portrayed. I'd give a movie out of 10 out of 10.
