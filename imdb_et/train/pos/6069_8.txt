....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. was a man quite wide-ranging and shouting. I love to communicate with Amanda Blake or Don Knot or with whom she was probably a ball and I think she made it easier for her guests as long as they knew she wasn't disciplined before, 19 take some sort of production. The name of the game was clearly relaxed and loose. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of men like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, perhaps Jerry Lewis. Great timing, ancient gags that kept the audience stitched for decades, a delight in what he did. His sad little clown he played was also good - but touching. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think he is great, having just bought two DVDs from his show '61 or so, it brings his stuff back to me. I remember seeing him on television at the end of his race when he finished the series in 1971. <br /> <br /> Check it if you are a fan or curious. He was a rebellion.
