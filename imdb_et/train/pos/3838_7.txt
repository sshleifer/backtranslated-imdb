Fourth Man (Paul Verhoeven - Holland 1983). <br /> <br /> A Gerard Reve short story based film that works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising given that Reve needs about 100 pages for a small plot to twist and the tension is the last thing I think is reading his work. <br /> <br /> The Fourth Person is on the symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely busy to prove something hostile to criticism and I am never sure what he is trying to prove. Usually, he underestimates his audience and tells his story in such a vague way, quickly differs from the original idea or style, and almost seems to be forgotten what must be seen on the screen and left out. "The Fourth Person" is not so precise that it details the plot when it is sex and nudity (which is a lot), but, like most of its films, it seems to be afraid that the audience will not get it and hammers blended with clear symbolism at home a story mixed with some allegedly shocking nudity and graphic sexual scenes. There is hardly a scene without sex or full length nudity, most of it so crazy and free, and your face is otherwise damaging to a good story. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, if you can cope with Verhoeven's obvious satirical approach, this is a fairly fun thriller sometimes with some intriguing plots and good performances, especially Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√©. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
