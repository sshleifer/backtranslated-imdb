It was still the best documentary of war. From the beginning of the first episode, when Sir Laurence Olivier described the terrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glane, "The Days The Soldiers Came". On the last days of the war, when the fungus clouds appeared in Japan, I never missed the second classical series and I remember it well, though it had been sifting back in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. This whole series should be a compulsory viewing of so many children in the world as possible that the Second World War tragedy will not be repeated and that bigotry, hatred, greed and intolerance will not be confused with patriotism or religious enthusiasm.
