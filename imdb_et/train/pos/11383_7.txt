This is a good musical journalism given by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Paris' atmosphere that gives the film a lot of charm but with a story in mind. Or at least not very well developed. Caron does not work so smoothly. But I liked some dialogues, I liked the Seine scene, I liked what Levant played, colors; and of course dancing, which is quite big. <br /> <br /> 7.5 - 8 seems to me a bit.
