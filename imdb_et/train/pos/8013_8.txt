Yes, this is the second big magical Muppet movie and I adore them all; characters, movies, episodes of the TV show (this is the best comedy or musical TV show) and all the artists behind it. But here they rarely made a deadly mistake, and I'm definitely talking about a strange end !! I think it is very dangerous to involve so much American drama and end the marriage love affair! We, like all the poor viewers, feel so free or maybe happy about the lack of anger, misery and misery! So we all enjoy the stories that collect 2 cute heroes for a couple who don't have a legitimate bond like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess. feel safe, calm and peaceful. So, if you look at what the filmmakers have already done, you're as crazy as I am! <br /> <br /> They made a weak unhappy creature (Kermit) to marry his daily nightmare that is the toughest woman ever (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change through American entertainment industry action! And it was quite common to have a negative impact on an audience that I just refused to bless or believe or was pleased with the sudden marriage (even the pathetic villain had no time or right to think or decide). . So it is no wonder if you know that this film is the biggest failure in its cinematic serious, reaching only 25 million compared to 65 million servants, the first (The Muppet Movie 1979) earned five years earlier! <br /> <br /> Just in this movie, they took Manhattan and my vacation!
