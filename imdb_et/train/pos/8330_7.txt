What a delightful romp? a highly competent film with so much charm and a sensitive factor that many romantic comedies are missing. Einstein works great with Walter Matthau, while Meg Ryan Catherine is unforgettable? better than I've seen these movies with Tom Hanks? like a young mathematician who needs to be recognized. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and feel her compassionate immediately, and when a young man is easy to understand what has to pass through Ed (Tim Robbins) mind for his true love. There is a general complaint in these emotions, even if I.Q. keep it all easy, fun and well connected. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not difficult, but if you look, there is some subtext. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great clergyman; his words like something like this: "If it is not impossible, why?" suppose that he is a believer in achieving higher goals beyond an immediate understanding. In this movie, there are questions about what an accident is? For example, is Albert and his dirty sidekicks interfering with the temptation of Catherine to stay away from the rigid-upper lip, the unloved James (Stephen Fry, who gives this otherwise priestly character of life and you can't help but feel his lack of feeling) counts. How many interventions do we have in our lives that we don't see, and it's as rich as it is? <br /> <br /> And, of course, we'd like to think in real life, despite what we often observe of people we know that Edwards can learn in Catherines and James how to melt ice water in their veins. How nice to know that this can happen in I.Q. innocent (and worryingly, only in Caucasus) Eisenhower's era of faith.
