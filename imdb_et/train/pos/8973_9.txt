I saw this movie when I was on TV in my childhood (thank you to the Canadian broadcaster) and I had a nightmare of it for years. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the best animators of the Bratislava Son, one of the Canadian National Film Agency. The son, in turn, was a great Drouini mentor and co-author. If you like Trnka, you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The insignia is obvious, but skilful. The contradictions between beauty and life (plant) are placed mutually with the anonymity of the glove. The poor puppet has been condemned for the absence of a political agenda. <br /> <br /> What I most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor. The small space where the action takes place is the character of the whole world. The invasion of the hand is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and haunting movie. I found a copy of Trnka from this and other wonderful short pants in a public library and showed it to my kids. Must see.
