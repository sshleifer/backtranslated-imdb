This movie finally made me cry! I'm watching at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw many great movies, even more. But when you finish the scene - the catarist in its heart - I came to shout! And if you didn't, you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - something new or original. But this is real - because such a thing really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I wonder what they were going through in the early 70s ... At some point it led me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never works very well. But this movie really believed all of us ... Because they don't try to do it with famous concerts full of roads, musicians who are superheroes, group girls who are stupid and emotionally numb, they don't respect drugs and alcohol, they promote rehabilitation and redemption, which comes even 20 years later ... Again, it's a great movie. Since "leaving Las Vegas" has never been moved by the film.
