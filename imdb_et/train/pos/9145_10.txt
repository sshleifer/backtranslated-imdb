In a semi-autobiographical film by an artist but a narcissistic young musician with less than a star's life, the Prince is the "boy". It is true that the actor desires (Morris Day, and especially Clarence Williams, both of them pitch perfect), but the film is still great and the best of the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack for a 50-year-old movie, extremely quoted lines, and a HILARIOUS !! Plus Apollonia is just just STUNNING. Regardless of what I saw in Prince's concert in 2004, he blew down the stadium. She is an actor and it was one of the best concerts I've experienced. <br /> <br /> My Class: A <br /> <br /> DVDs: Disc 1) Comments by Director Albert Magnoli, Producer Robert Cavallo and Head of Photographer Donald Thorin; Theatrical trailer; Trailers "Under Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) 12-minute feature film at First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (a half-hour film on a film I watch later on this page)," Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: Purple Rain Effects and Effects "10-minute featurette, 30 minutes MTV premiere Film (when MTV didn't absorb the donkey balls) 5) Prince music videos (let's go crazy, take me with you when pigeons cry, I die 4 U / baby, I'm a star and purple rain); The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird) and Apollonia 6 music video "Sex Shooter Eye Candy: Apollonia shows her fine ass
