Most of the monster movies I saw on television as a boy and some of them, BLOB, scared the sunlight out of me. Movies such as INVADERS from MARS made it too small for children to simply not be trusted when they came into things that invade Homeworld; BLOB reiterated this fact. I recall, gently, for the late nights that spent on the floor looking at how Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs got into an unsuspecting society. The beginning of the 1980s was the summer when the local science museum (Virginia, Virginia) ran a classic Atomic Age every weekend. These were 16 mm films and most of them were black and white (the projector was noisy) and the THE BLOB "color" print was getting pink but the man was fun. I took my mother along and she enjoyed it as much as I did. There was this science museum where I really fell in love with BLOB. Of course, the filmmaker had the intention of earning money, but it was the sincerity of all involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (players) that made me fall in love with this film. Corny? You wish. Cheesy? They don't get cheese. But the man, what movie!
