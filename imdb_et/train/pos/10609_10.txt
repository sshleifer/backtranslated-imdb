I saw this movie last night on cable and it is extraordinary. What I love most is that it is undervalued and with a low key but deeply affectionate. The performance of Henry Thomas (who played in the child's E.T.) is masterfully inertiated (he should be a man with a few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. And miraculously (given that we are talking here about a Hollywood product) is the baby's main owner, but one who does not act or has lines, but rather IS (and is in that light). It is interesting to note that Thomas' mysterious relationship w. E.T. was the core of this film; if his bond w. the baby is the core of a "good baby". <br /> <br /> Then there is music - ah, what music !! Gillian Welch's songs are wonderful and the whole score is fantastic in mountain music. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful atmosphere. I highly recommend it.
