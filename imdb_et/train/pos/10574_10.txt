This is a great movie. The unfinished battery takes a number of evaluations to fully understand it. Busby Berkeley's music will never be copied. I think this film goes beyond all its other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together. Some humor would push the boundaries of today's films. Make a rational explanation of how they left it and enjoy it for the spectacle.
