You saw this movie from its release and have appreciated it ever since. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find one of the most interesting aspects of the film). Really liked to see dramatic actor Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always a hoot. The script is intelligent, clever and linguistic, bombing the fun of almost everything "Beverley Hills". Beloved Paul Bartel's "doctor" and Ray Sharkey's servant. It was dirty and raw, but thanks to God! If you're not proud, I recommend this movie from the heart. FYI for all who want to play six degrees Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov & Paul Bartel were "Rock & Role in High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were together at "Comet Night". They were all three "Robbing in Raoul".
