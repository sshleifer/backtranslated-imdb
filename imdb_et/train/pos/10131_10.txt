On the first episode of friends on September 22, 1994, "One in which Monica gets roommate", there is a song that is played as Rachel sits at the end of the show window, where "If you ever need to hold" .... is anyone knows the title of an artist's song or song? It looks like it's a great song .... I'd like to get a copy of it. Thanks for the help. I'm looking for an album / cd that is turned on so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have examples that can be bought and enjoyed over and over again. It seemed plausible ... thanks to the hours you have offered over the years.
