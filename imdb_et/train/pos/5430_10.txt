Of all British imperialist films, such as Four Feathers, for example, a light brigade, this film looks like a crop. It reflects the time when "the sun is never the British empire." Get over it. I'm not going to, because so many others have expressed a number of reasons that make this movie great. I have visited the Alabama Mountains and have photographed the passage through which the British marched and remains as it was, over time, and the penetration of people and vandals. And although I know it is coming, you will see Dini's death on the stretcher and when these lines are considered <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! <br /> <br /> Sa Lazarushia skin Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> Although I'm wearing you and I dressed you up, <br /> <br /> Life with Gawd that did you, <br /> <br /> You are a better man than I am, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> I'm still at the age of 54 and everyone who says it is not is a liar. The emotions inside it are a great movie sign. Like ending another big movie, mice, and men.
