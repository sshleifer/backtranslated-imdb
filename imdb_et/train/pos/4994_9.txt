Man's Castle is a great example of pre-codes. It includes realistic events with truly pleasant and imperfect signs. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a fine pocket. He makes a living by doing wonderful work and traveling to a new city when he is forever. One night, she meets Trina, beauty with any standards that are cold and alone. He has refused to use prostitution so that he has not eaten for several days, but two take very well and make a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between them, even if they live by the river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the biggest actors on the silver screen. His characters are amazing and relative. We see his thoughts on the face, making it easy to detect, even if we believe he is acting badly. The young is good in the foreground movies. His character is very sweet, but far from perfect, making it even more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Pre-code elements include lean watering, pregnancy before marriage, and crime.
