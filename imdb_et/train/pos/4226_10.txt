I have a lot of time for all the Columbo movies, but it was especially well written and the solution was very effective. But my main memory of this is opening the scene in the middle of the movie, between Columbo and the murderer (I'm sorry if I haven't remembered that detail). This is Columbo's most prominent picture I've seen: the view is the closet of the darkness of the darkness where the victim was murdered, and outside the room that lights up with daylight. Columbo sits in the armchair in front of the doorway (and us), looking at the cabinet and almost the light contrast of the silhouette. No sound. The camera moves slowly out of the room and toward him. He's deep in meditation, gently blowing a cigar, turning the cigar around the cigar slowly, as he thinks. The dialog then begins. Great.
