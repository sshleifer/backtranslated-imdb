This film has many strengths. This is one of the best horrors being thrown outside of the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, and the leading man Melvyn Douglas. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone stairs, a crazy scientist, townspeople burning torches and hunting vampires, a "Igor" -type character, a beautiful girl, even a furry hairy burgomaster. Working with a soft focus camera is moody and imaginative. There are even some good comics easily placed throughout the script. <br /> <br /> But this is not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in "Kleinschloss" ("The Little Castle"). The plot is turned around by a general crazy scientist (well played by Atwill) who appreciates his work more than human lives. <br /> <br /> This is not a cutting edge material because the plot resolution is high. Dwight Frye is an embarrassingly bad dialogue. But you might want to check out if you want early pictures of brahhi.
