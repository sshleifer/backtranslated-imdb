Mendez and Marichal have given us a serious, convincing and painful analysis of the social, mental, economic and political crisis that has been born for 108 years in colonialism in Puerto Rico. The beautiful island with the most hospitable people I met and yet because our people are refusing to meet their imperial responsibilities, Puerto Ricans is allowed to wilt and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis that has arisen in the colonial situation of Puerto Rico has undermined families and the main institutions that support any society. Corruption is rampant in that people do not pay taxes (which have led to the country's fiscal crisis), and the sense of cynicism and mistrust penetrates the island's culture. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the support enabled this painful yet powerful film. <br /> <br /> Must be seen. . .
