It's really fun, windy, light-hearted romantic comedy. You can't go wrong when Meg Ryan loves kneeling with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally, I am not a fixed fan of fictitious stories of real people who are now dead and unable to defend themselves, but I think that late Einstein could get out of it. <br /> <br /> It's in the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey Spring. The story revolves around a beautiful, young, scattered mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is all ready to marry a cumbersome jerk, a behavioral researcher, James, just because she has the brain she is looking for in her future father's children. But this is love at first glance when his car breaks and meets the auto mechanic Ed (Tim Robbins). Since he doesn't think Ed is intelligent enough, his uncle who is nothing but Albert Einstein will play the game maker by helping his three aspirations, all the naughty cronies, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed appropriately smart, so that it is a physicist who depicts him as a physicist ... of course with an amusing result. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau is his usual fun and draws Einstein's character quite effectively. With his three professor mates, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, there is a lot of laugh. True Einstein was a real human aspect, and this film just takes one (unheard of) step forward. If you stop all logic, you can almost imagine the stupid story that happens! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite your main character), but it is a wonderful sweet, refreshing film. One of the best comedy genres.
