The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Indeed, this episode is exactly the same content as the DVD pilot release. It has been said that episode 01 gives a very important background to the very popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both original and 2007 remake). This is relevant for the 2007 series. Like late sci-fi trends, this series explores the "virtual" life or environment. In addition, we have many backgrounds about Adama's family line and their relationship with the cylindrical creator of the Battlestar Galactica series. In most cases, this first episode revolves around the popular theme "Virtual" life and (as expected) the early life of colonies and the birth of Cylons. <br /> <br /> First I enjoyed this episode. Although it wasn't for me or anyone else who has already seen Caprica pilot's DVD disc, this series seems very promising. As with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a rock cluster to ensure that the audience (sci-fi community) adheres. I must certainly monitor both the solution and the development. <br /> <br /> I'll give this series 8 stars.
