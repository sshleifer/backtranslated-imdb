Let me first point out, James Hanlon is absolutely terrible, trying to act on his description of what is happening with rookie training and day events. Indeed, it is in a strict agreement with other firefighters, without naturally acting in their endeavors. <br /> <br /> This means it's an amazing movie that can't be seen in the eye without tears. I am an English man from England, but I love New York and have visited many times before and after September 11th. This is another home for me and I can't help but I feel like losing the loss of human life, but also destroying such an amazing city. This is the real thing, with firefighters all that collapses around them. I'm so glad that the film material is there to show people how it was on the day. It is a disgrace that they did not use the materials of people jumping from the buildings, because the friends who were there tell me that it is so much of their memory, it should be added to show future generations how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell.
