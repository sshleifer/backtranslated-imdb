This distracting western spins the story of the famous early Western gun that one and all wanted. James Stewart is a cowboy who wins the winning Winchester shootout but loses it during the robbery. The story describes Stewart's quest for a rifle and a certain man through a movie. Rifles change hands from time to time, as if the owner has lost it through violence. There are many activities and tensions in the picture because Stewart is closing his career. The big producer supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems unsuccessful here and her task is rather unclear. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, who are teenagers of later years, have short but good roles.
