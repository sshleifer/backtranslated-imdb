I loved this movie. I'm Mexico and it was the least offended. In fact, I think this film should be displayed at the police headquarters all over Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is both a dead body and a 3-month body. It is angry that I read in the news how killers, robbers and other mucus are released, paying a ridiculous fine or living as kings in prison. We should have a character like Creasy, Denzel Washington. The bodyguard turned to revenge. Robbery is a flourishing industry here (at least in big cities). I really want robbers in real life to suffer the same fate as his Creasy did. That would be so wonderful (Sorry, I'm annoyed!). MAN ON FIRE is a thrilling movie that can't be missed. For some, this may be difficult if you are not accustomed to reading subtitles (Mexicans do it all the time you watch American movies), but efforts are worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy ... like TRAFFIC, remember? (another rich take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts a bit slowly, but the pace rises frantically on the other side. I swear you will be glad if you look at sending Denzel Washington's wrong makers. His performance is not good. The end (not spoilers, OK !!!) is a little sad, but I'm sure you still like it. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films of the year. There must be a "black" for the DVD collection! 9 * 10
