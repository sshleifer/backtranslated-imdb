Another episode of childhood that as an adult I look back from another perspective. It was one of my favorite childhoods that really confirmed my exhibition. But after looking at this episode after 20 years, I would say that it is definitely one of the lightest, to be laughed and amused, instead of a dramatic and well-built story in previous episodes, their first and best seasons. Maybe this episode was also written for a little R & R! As Mr Spock would say, the story is not just logical, but some amusing lines, as, of course, Mr Spock's last, when he asks the captain, McCoy et al. they answer yes, raise the eyebrows and say, "Exciting ..." just as Mr. Spock did. An interesting story is, of course, the idea that an amusement park is actually amusing (for example, Disneyland's fake and often annoying "amusement") so that it can really make your wishes. Really, a great idea, but not what is well done. And Theodore Sturgeon, the second great SF story writer they used in the first season, is wondering how much of the script Sturgeon has turned on. <br /> <br /> Now there's a little trivia I learned on this site: In 1987, James Gunn founded Theodore Sturgeon for the best short science literature. And I quote the rest of this site: in 1968, he wrote {Sturgeon} "The Joy Machine", the third scenario for the Star Trek TV series {Amok Time the other}, which has never been photographed. The main reason not to use it in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget. Scriptwriter James Gunn (Star Trek # 80, The Original Series) adapted this script and published Pocket Books in 1996. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I said this episode is still very enjoyable, especially if someone doesn't think too much about it. Just laugh and enjoy it, and the next episode can come back to the serious things of protecting the universe.
