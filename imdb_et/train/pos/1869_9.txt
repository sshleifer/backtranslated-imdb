The story of Antwone Fisher's childhood negligence and abuse is an inspiration to all of us who saw or experienced the situation of stepchildren. An effortless mother abandoned Antwone has never met her father. With the "church going" criminals who use the "n-word" not only to scare and hurt, but also to endearment as a young man, how his best friend is killed in detention, persistent racial gaps and battles while serving in the Navy, the anger of Antwone becomes slowly as a positive force when the naval psychiatrist advises it, and love enters his life. <br /> <br /> The scene where Antwone meets her childbirth is one of the most powerful moments of the film. Unexpectedly confronted by an unexpected confrontation, the woman listens quietly to hear that the young man tells him how he has lived without crime, drug addiction, father of children and left, all despite his extremely unfavorable circumstances. <br /> <br /> If this scene was not powerful enough, it will drive home (and open flood gates): reception to welcome home Antwone; dozens of smiling faces and open arms that declare that HE is part of this great family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages of this great movie is that there are many good meanings and sincere people for helping orphans and orphans. unwanted children. Even if some homes and administrators do not seem to be caring and seem to be self-serving, many give it all. The person who found the "file" of Antwone when he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of the bright lights of the "darkness" of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD includes a French language track, a variety of subtitle options as well as additional features and information about raising a child. <br /> <br /> As a Clevelander, I appreciated the location material. No matter where you are, this autobiographical pearl has moved deep.
