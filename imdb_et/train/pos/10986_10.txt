Last Sunday we stumbled on the documentary "Gray Gardens" and we could "suck" without warning. Anyone who entered the room changed on television and Edith and Edie in ghostly images that seemed to be alive in their living room in a large dirty manor house, eating ice cream and corn dust (which was boiled on a bedside table) - and cat urinating in Edith's bed and his incredible words, "I I flourish on it [smell]. " We had not started and thought what we were looking at and how these aristocratic women could get there. must see !!!!
