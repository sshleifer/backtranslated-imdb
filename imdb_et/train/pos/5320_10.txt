I started watching a movie that didn't wait for anything but watching another movie, but from the twenty-first minute, the artistic and main character who is puzzling, talking a lot, really tells me this movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully acting and really touching. It is a bit slow, but immersion was complete. Leadership was fantastic, giving us the bits of bits that led Joey's conviction and his life behind bars. The music was really great and very well entered. The end was unexpected when I didn't see coming. It's not a movie we often see.
