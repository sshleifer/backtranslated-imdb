I had doubts about another love story where people with disabilities find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But Helena Bonham Carter's and Kenneth Branagh's performances, exemplary, almost stunning and rescue are just another tear-jerker. The depiction of Carter's ALS victim is strong, perhaps even superfluous (sometimes his dialogue leaves for inseparable turmoil). But the overall impact is commendable and cost effective. Branagh can be a great compliment to your work. <br /> <br />
