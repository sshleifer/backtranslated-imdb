A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film that talks about two antagonist workers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan), who are wearing the mailbox romance without being aware of it. The key to the success of this movie is that Ernst Lubitsch prevents all sorts of syrupy sentiments and invites its participants to give low-key, unpleasant performances. As a result, you will love almost all of them. <br /> <br /> This movie, which I appreciated, has a strong down stream of melancholy. Loneliness is a big issue that probably is represented by the character of the shop owner and manager, which Frank Morgan played perfectly. She discovers that her husband is conquering and realizing that the successful life she has created is not enough to keep her alone if she has no partner to share. This makes the terrible romance between Stewart and Sullavan even more brutal, because they both reach this invisible other, who thinks he is a soul player before they even meet. Of course, we know that everything will ultimately be right, but the film will not let you forget what the feeling of each one feels when they find that reality did not live in fantasy. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch fills his film with cracking with chemical ships. A small group of shopkeepers refers to themselves as the small family of the film, and it is exactly as it seems to us. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful, silly romance. <br /> <br /> Rating: A +
