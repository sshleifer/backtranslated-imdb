well, this is Ivan Reitman's film. With a rare exception, Ivan likes entertainment. Her films are usually not "deep", but they are often fun enough. My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me that I laughed more than I thought. Uma Thurman is just so big and I love his images. I also like Luke Wilson and Rainn Wilson was a straight hoot. The film has never been taken seriously, the film is up and is not yet very unique, nor does it go when no one has ever gone .... it's a nice rental and probably an OK date movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want your brain strain. It's fun fun and there's nothing wrong with that. When you remove "super-girl" things, you have a story about relationships and relationships have disappeared. This is a boy who meets the girl, the boy leaves the girl's thing. And finally, the characters are looking for love. Not everyone will take them "at dumped prices" as they could.
