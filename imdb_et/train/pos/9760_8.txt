I have very fond memories of this movie because I saw it with my two younger siblings as he did in 1977. Apparently, it was considered a failure - and now it is virtually forgotten (pan-and-scan video cassette that is never legitimate or ambitious Panavision's compositions are The film is very stylized (YELLOW hues) SUBMARINE and is uneven. Some characters and sequences are subtle, while others are somewhat minor and undifferentiated. The sad thrown blue camel (Eeyore's tones) and his blue song are truly warm-hearted. Joe Raposo's songs are usually just beautiful. Certainly, there is a precious curiosity that probably (unfortunately) coincides with insecurity.
