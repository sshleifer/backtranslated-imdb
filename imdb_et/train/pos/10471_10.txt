I enjoyed this movie, but I hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and I have many friends in the music company ... who are still trying to become adults ... more fans, groups, money, etc ... and they find it hard to adapt to normal life ... when they see new bands etc get the spotlight ... it's almost like they start again ... this movie is a sign of what many old rockers are going through in the 70s and 80s .... and this is where I find the movie sad and depressing.BUT it depicts old rock-star-abandoned and lost-in incredible road life. A young girl who arrives at her spoiled home reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she's one woman in the movie you rejoice. This film must be for people aged 50 who have seen the rise and fall of ensembles, people who know the members and looked at them as injuries when the age slips and the popularity disappears. It's almost a perfect movie ... .add but in some ways positive .... because of whales. HAVE TO TAKE!
