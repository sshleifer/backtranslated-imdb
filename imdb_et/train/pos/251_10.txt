"If Ned Kelly was born later, he would probably have won Victoria Crossi at Gallipoll". such was Ned's Bravery. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially in Victoria, Ned Kelly can name and recognize immediately. Gretas is still a hero, the life blood of the town of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but they have still not forgotten in Mansfield that the three policemen he "murdered" were from there. Many of the buildings he has visited in his life are still in place. From the old Melbourne Gaol, where he was hung, to the post office he kept in Jerilderie. The trolley he ever held at Greta is Benellas and Ann Jones Hotel's on-site station, and even logs where he was detained in Glenrowan, can be visited. <br /> <br /> The existence of all evidence of movie events (except for his love interests) can be found throughout Victoria, police records, and even Sash, that Ned got Dick Shelton's rescue from drowning. None of this is wrong, and what was left out would further justify Ned's action. The horse, which Ned "stole", was stolen by Wild Wright (the man out of the Ned box prison). Ned was already in jail when the horse was reportedly stolen so that he could not steal it. <br /> <br /> The Jerilderie letter is more than ever said. It is not a justification in itself, but the story of Nedi, an overview of what he stood for and who defended him. So go ahead and read it, watch the movie and make your mind about what Ned was up to.
