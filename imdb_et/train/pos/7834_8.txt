Please also see my comment on Die Nibelungen Part 1: Siegfried. <br /> <br /> Another part of UFA's large Nibelungen saga production continues in its predecessor's stylized, symphonic and emotionally separated way. If the first part was a passionate image of individual heroic acts, the second part is a chaotic image of large scale blood vessels. <br /> <br /> As in part, the director Fritz Lang maintains a constant dynamic rhythm, the pace of action and the complexity of the shooting composition that rises and falls smoothly on demand for each scene. These images should only be viewed with the perfect Gottfried Huppertz score, which is luckily on Cinema DVD. Now that it focuses on mass activity, Lang faces major challenges in production. The sequences of their earliest properties were often poorly constructed, but now it is simply part of that rhythmic flow, with the screen activity level expanding like an orchestra. <br /> <br /> But as part of one gave us the testimony of Siegfried's adventures, which are factually and without excitement, the second part presents warfare as a devastating tragedy. Both pictures deliberately have an emotional relationship with characters. For this reason, Lang mostly keeps the camera out of the way, never letting us feel like we are there (and that is important because audience engagement is usually a distinction between Lang's work). This is also the reason why the performances are unnaturally theatrical, where actors act like sleepwalkers with constipation. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Kriemhild's revenge is constantly dealing with emotions and is actually deeply humanistic. One moment of naturalness is when Atilla keeps her son for the first time, and Lang actually emphasizes the tenderness of this scene by building a wild and frantic ride on it. The thing is that Lang never manipulates us with taking sides, and in this version there is more to the original saga than Wagner's opera. Climatic killing is the very opposite of a devastating battlefield. Then why did Hitler and the cover do. Get so tearful of what has unfairly exaggerated the image of these films? Because Nazi's striking racial ideology automatically turned Nibelung into good boys, even when they kill children and betray their family. For Hitler, their collapse is always a national tragedy, not a human being. <br /> <br /> But for us, the Nazi viewers, which makes this picture enjoyable, are its beautiful way of thinking and the rhythm of music. If you see these fully developed silent images of Lang, you will understand how much it wastes in Hollywood. Instead of mixing him with small budget boilers, they would have had to work with some of their sword and sandal ideas that do not have to be credible and do not have to move us emotionally, where it is poetic, operative tonality that sweeps us.
