Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story about a virus that destroys everyone, but a handful of people around the world, and forcing them to go underground and a man who was sent back a long time is a fantastic, dizzying and highly styled film with Bruce Willis's best result ever . <br /> <br /> What sets 12 monkeys apart from most travel-time sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis is actually dealing with the psychological effects of time, that is, without knowing what reality is the real reality: the place where the time traveler arrives or goes. The film also recognizes that the past cannot be changed and the prevention of the cataclysmic event, in this case the release of the virus, cannot be stopped or altered. As Willis claims, "It has already happened," although he is in a mental hospital, the biggest dilemma the film speaks is a subtle, redundant plot to save the world; Instead, Willis's internal struggle just survives. It's a fresh and innovative concept, and it works great thanks to the effortlessly written script by the peoples and the Gilliam's unique brand of dementia. <br /> <br /> In addition, Monkey storytelling is completely non-linear and instead chooses and bends how the story is spoken skillfully, adding different time sequences: setbacks, dreams, memories, current, past, future, and even a scene that is Hitchcock Out of Vertigo. Everyone serves the cofoof of the disturbing madness and void surrounding the viewer. <br /> <br /> Visually, Gilliam is in despair and shade, competing with Tim Burton for her amazingly despised landscapes and shapes. With cold, wide and submerged cinematographies, Gilliam moves her characters into a colorless environment and darkness. Scenes are often bathed in strange antiseptic, dead white, and this often contributes to crazy characters. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes by completing the patented loony-off-the-wall performance that he earned in earning the Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best result of his career, not returning to his heroic clich√©s and carton hero and depicts Cole as simple, frightening and tragic forever. The same is good for Madeline Stowe as Willis psychologist. He keeps his own, injecting his character with both natural energy and power, if he falls below what he believes is a false religion. <br /> <br /> Gilliam's expert, overwhelming and complex behavior that could have been a routine action / sci-fi movie, makes 12 monkeys a compelling vision for a spooky, futuristic landscape. Its rich, thoughtful, sophisticated storyline with bravura performances of all the pain and descent, fine cinematography makes it crazy. Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly proud vision of a movie that is full of shine. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
