"Odd Couple" is one of those films that surpasses its reputation. People know it, they sing a song song, complain that they live in a sloppy "Oscar" or in a terrible "Felix" ... but they don't know this movie without knowing enough. It's not just a clean guy living in a sloppy boy; it is a portrait of two friends that help each other through torture. It is also funny funny from start to finish, but it is such a comedy that comes from realistic, stressful and simply terrible situations. So, some viewers have actually found that the film is a bit uncomfortable, but I think it is its strength. Besides, the Matthau Bulldog will break my face! My favorite comedy in the country.
