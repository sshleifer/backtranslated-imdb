I watched the movie recover from a major operation. Although I knew it was just a "B" movie, the western space, I loved it. Perhaps there was no flash of high dollar productions that he kept to a lesser degree of imagination and gave a great escapism. Unfortunately, our society has so many opportunities that discounting small trials is too easy. Similarly, when I can even enjoy a Shakespeare school performance, I can understand the level of many achievements for art. I'm a policeman and found affinity with retired LAPD. Dreams like her haunting me that I can't respond to the crisis at the moment to save another life (or my own). although it was a romantic end where Farnsworth took the bad guy out (predictable), I needed a bit of a happy romance with a good win. My world is really too cynical.
