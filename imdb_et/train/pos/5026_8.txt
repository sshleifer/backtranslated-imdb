This is a great movie everyone should see. It plays like Dean Koontz's book. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was great because he seems to believe what he says and does. <br /> <br /> I don't know why viewers have to read some sort of religious murder in the movie. It's fiction. The end is surprising, but fancy. So what? I think it makes this movie so good. THE SPOILER IS NOT READING IF YOU WANT THIS MOVIE. Throughout the film, the viewer is constantly shocked by the influence of Paxton's character, the impact on children, and the impact of this outrageous behavior on children. And then finally it turns out it's true. God has put him on a mission to get rid of the demons world. Paxton is not a psychic, as other viewers recommend. Of course, he is given information that he would not have known otherwise, but the film goes further to show how God "keeps" Adam through the problem of proper video quality and the lack of full memory of another FBI agent. The film does not support a Christian murder, but takes the viewer to a very unexpected ride.
