First, I do not praise Iñarritu's short film, even if I'm Mexico and proud of his success in Hollywood's mainstream. <br /> <br /> In the other hand, I can see that most of the comments focus on their favorite (and not so) short films; but we forget that there is a subtle lower line that surrounds the whole compilation, and maybe it is not so pleasant for the American people. (Even if it wasn't the main goal of the producers) <br /> <br /> I am talking about the fact that most of the short films do not show the suffering of WASP people because of the September 11 terrorist attack, but the suffering of other people. <br /> <br /> Do you need proof of what I'm saying? Look, the Bosnian short film has a message: "You cry because of the dead people of the towers, but we (others = Eastern Europeans) are crying for the crimes committed against our women for a long time and no one is paying attention to you as the whole world has done to you. "<br /> <br /> Although the story of Burkina Fasso is more comedy, the same idea is:" You are angry because Osama Bin Laden created you into evil but we (others = Africans) should be more angry because our people are already dying long ago for hunger, poverty, and AIDS, and nobody pays attention to us as the whole world has done to you. ”Now look at Sean Penn's short: The Twin Towers fall makes a lonely (and alienated) man happy So the message that Power and greed (which are the symbols of the towers) have to fall for people to see the sun rise and flower bloom? It is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been made by America. almost subversive. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (very aware of his anti-capitalism ideology) is much clearer and shameful when he goes straight to the point: "You are angry because your country has attacked the forces of evil but we (others = Latin Americans) suffered the worst on the same date and nobody remembers our mourning as the world has done for you. "br /> <br /> This is how the project of this project wanted to tell the Americans : "You see now, in America? You are not the only one who has been the victim of world violence, you are not alone in your pain and by the way, we (others = non-Americans) have long suffered much more than you, so we are solidarity with your pain ... and by the way, we are sorry because you have had some taste of your medicine. "Only the Mexican and French short films showed sympathy and compassion to the American people; others are like a collision with an American state that is not equal to the American people.
