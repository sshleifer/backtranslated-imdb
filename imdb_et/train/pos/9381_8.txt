The manpower ladder has gone astray to a man in a small town in Wyoming, leading to any complications. The drill is perfectly cast as a miserable score, hoping to pull fast and get out of the city, but find that he can't escape from the capital city. Hopper does what he does best by playing the psyche known as "Lyle Dallas", a real hit man. Walsh as curved sheriff and boyle as femme fatale, rounds the fine cast. The manuscripts of Brothers John and Rick Dahl contain delicious turns and John's direction creates an excellent "neo noir" atmosphere. Funny and very fun, it sucks the viewer from the beginning and never lets.
