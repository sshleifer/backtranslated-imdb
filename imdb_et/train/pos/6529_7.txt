I was forced to watch it because a) I have an 11-year-old girl and b) We had shown her Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s she enjoyed. Personally, I didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand, it wasn't a nausea-intelligence-offensive fluff that I was afraid of. It was an unpleasant, lightly fun movie. Although I am glad that they did not try to upgrade Nancy's 21st Century "Hyper" (Veronica Mars holds the title of Modern Nancy Drew), I think they made her a bit too sharp to not do this. enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been called "Jane Doe, Girls Detective". I have to blame the script: I think every actor did a good job of what they had to do. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a television, not a theater release, script ...
