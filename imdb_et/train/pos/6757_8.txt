Dana Andrews stands in this 1950s film, where Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand also celebrate. Andrews plays New York Detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a policeman with a bad mood, who has been beating the suspects in the past. When a person is murdered by a mobile gambling club, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner, they are investigated. Scalise accuses the murder of Ken Paine (Stevens), who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but with the victim. Dixon thinks the victim got a lot of money and was killed by the mobster men. He goes to Paine and does not understand that he has a head on the war plate, he strikes him on the floor and inadvertently kills him. He must now cover the murder. As a further complication, he falls to Morgan; his father (Ken Tully) who went to Paine's apartment after seeing Paine hit her daughter was arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> This is a really terrible, sharp dog with some good results. The harsh and beautiful Andrews is convincing as a harsh but nervous detective who has to step in front of his colleagues. The film connects her with the fabulous "Laura", Gene Tierney, and she looks cute as a bad taste for men who are probably used to grazing. Little does he know he has another hand. Ken Tully is doing his father's terrible job of protesting his innocence despite some embarrassing evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-directed, fast moving, and absorbing film is the end. Pure in Hollywood and Tierney, I doubt I would react the same way. Little criticism of Ben Hect's writing and Otto Preminger's film. I didn't find it inspiring for Laura, but there are few things in this world. If you like a movie noir, that's a must-have.
