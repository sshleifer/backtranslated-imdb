It has a lot to do - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller number of dross - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little ho hum - Kelly. It was Sinatra's first real film, where the producer spent the string and you saw it on the screen (previously she appeared to two low budget people, higher and higher and more lively), but if they relied solely on Sinatra tubes and deep sixty Grayson plus Iturb's ego-beating piano , which we would have missed a much tougher movie and a better show at Sinatra. As he is, he evaluates his two duets with Kelly - we hate to leave, I asked - with his songs to his own solo, which makes sunset, your charm and I love too well. Despite this stage, the lively forty best of Sinatra's music will remain at the tenth of the budget.
