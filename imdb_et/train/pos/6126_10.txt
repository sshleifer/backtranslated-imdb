I saw Jack Frost for 4:00 pounds in my local shop and I thought it looked pretty good for a low budget movie, so I bought it and I was right that it was good. For beginners, this movie is about a killer snowman, so it's a laugh and a way it seems to be funny compared to a snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The action was okay and the lines Jack Frost said I smiled, "I just smoked for your smoke" and "The worlds that are the smallest snow cone" when funny and camping? At first, the story was pretty funny and stupid. "Jack's cheeky, Jack's fast, Jack's eyes with a candle." If you're looking for a B-Movie comedy horror full of punch, check out Jack Frost. 10/10
