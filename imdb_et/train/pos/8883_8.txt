The film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of the main problems in this country (USA). We see relationships in the film's university settings. An impatiently obvious student v.s. the teacher is there. But what the film increases is his other relationships: man v.s. female, white v.s. black and individual v.s. in society. But most importantly and in relation to all other relationships is individual v.s. yourself. <br /> <br /> I was surprised when the two-sided viewpoint given by the director showed racial relationships on the campus. Most movies usually show the injustice of one party, while showing the suffering of the other party. This film showed injustice and suffering on both sides. He did not try to show how each was right, though I would say that the skin heads have shown a lot more cruel and vindictive (quite obvious). The film also talks about gender and rape. It is an ironic injustice that in some ways leads to two races. Lawrence Fishburne is a top-notch presentation by Professor Phipps. He crumbles the idea of ​​racial favortism, and instead demonstrates the parallelism between laziness and decline in hard and positive. Other stars that make this movie are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent idea of ​​confused young people with the wrong anger who is looking for admission. Tyra Banks makes his film debut and proves that supermodels can work. In fact, I would say that the film is almost satire, showing students how to interact with one another, not a dry book, but a real university education. It is a life-learning process, not textual. I think you will find "higher education" on important issues in many universities and even in life in general. 8/10
