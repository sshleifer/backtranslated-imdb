First of all, there is no way that the remake can be as good as Japanese society is different from ours and plays such a big role in this film as explained in the opening statement. It adds both humor and warmth to the film. Different support symbols / personalities have been corrupted. Everyone is doing a great job in making this movie. This movie is full of comedy, which is not vulgar anyway, like most of today's "gross picture comedies". Yet he can still laugh out loud. In reality, you have no real life choices with whom you work or attend school ... etc. This film truly emphasizes this and shows that the natural well-being of people can overcome small differences. Not to mention this, it makes a great subset and a lot of humor. It is a story of dancing that really has a story and good. There are some back stories that are not in place but actually support the main story. Really well written film. Dancing is also great. I happen to be a fan of any movie in this movie. But this film goes further with dance because it is a story First and just happens to be dance in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
