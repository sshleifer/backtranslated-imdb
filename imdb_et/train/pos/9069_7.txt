If you like the film of bullying, brave children, having fun with toddlers and worms, how do you like Fried Worms? <br /> <br /> The movie is about a boy named Billy, who arrives at his first day in a new school to discover that some of his classmates have been playing with him, putting worms on his lunch. The school bully, Joe and his "team of friends" start teasing Billy and calling him "worm". <br /> <br /> Billy decides to play by saying "he eats worms all the time". Joe and his friends do not believe in him, but Billy confirms them and contributes to Joe that he can eat ten faiths in one day, otherwise he will get into trousers with worms. <br /> <br /> The boys will take Billy up on his contribution, leaving a weak stomach for his mission to get his classmate respect by eating boiled, fried or live worms. <br /> <br /> The film may look tough, but it has many messages. For one, it represents true friendship and how to receive people. It also shows why some bullying use bullying by other children. <br /> <br /> The film's main character, Billy, is a strong and brave person with whom we can all communicate. It is easy to understand when we quietly rejoice in achieving our goal, although we may not always agree with what it does or the choices it makes. <br /> <br /> The kids in the movie are depicting exactly how kids are in real life and the film deserves it a lot. Children's actors are the stars of the show that show true emotion and the feeling that most other children's films represent. <br /> <br /> Some adults may not enjoy this movie, but kids, or even teenagers. <br /> <br /> There are currently no other good movies in the chain, so if you don't recognize the snakes on the plane, try the worm on the plate How to cook fried worms. It's a good fun movie and not just a fear factor for kids.
