It is well known that when Gene Roddenberry first celebrated Star Trek for NBC, the original pilot episode The Cage was rejected as he was "too brain". When another option was given to the series, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to identify the events of the rejected episode as a canon and write it at The Menagerie, which has a unique distinction about what was then that uneven episode. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his team at Starbase 11, visiting former CEO Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), are now terrible and paralyzed due to an accident. Pike joins his offspring on a star ship waiting for an unpleasant surprise: Spike, formerly under Pike, has effectively hijacked the ship and set a course for Talos IV, a planet that is borderless (punishment is death) because Pike and Spock last visit there, 13 years earlier. Of course, Spock, as a logical creature, turns on and organizes a trial to justify his actions. <br /> <br /> There is no need to talk more about the plot because the rest are playing part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberry establishes a link between Cage and the rest of the universe of Star Trek, providing some type of feedback (saying too much) that would allow anyone, on-screen, and outside to see what could have been a trek, NBC rejected the original project. It is especially fun to see that Jeffrey Hunter (who could not go back) plays Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk usually and Nimoy in the early days as Spock, whose personality was not yet fully created: it's only time in the series to make everyone's favorite Vulcan smiles in itself. <br /> <br /> In short, not only the great "mystery" episode, but also the treatment of those who can't be disturbed to track Cage in its original form (available as part of the 3rd season set).
