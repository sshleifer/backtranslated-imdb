This movie was very enjoyable, though you only like it: - you hate to go to the dentist, but don't be afraid of a movie where one of them is slipping - you love horror films <br /> <br /> I especially liked the fact that the main character brutal activities were explained. The fact that he is completely clean (especially in the mouth) and then tries to give his women a mud-covered pool man an oral joy is a quite plausible reason to go overboard. <br /> <br /> liked. I'll give her 8.
