For years I thought this comedy abandoning the knockout was a product of John Ford, especially one of Victor McLaglen's leaders. That's definitely the same harsh humor that Ford is fascinated with with his films. To my surprise, I found out that it was George Stevens who actually led it. I still refuse to believe that this film was not offered to John Film, but he was probably from Monument Valley when making Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Indian Army Sergeant with a nice friend / friend / friend. But the old gang breaks because Fairbanks is married to Joan Fontaine. Not when his two bales help, rhythmic beastie Gunga Din, like Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> Rudyard Kipling's poem was an inspiration for this RKO film about the life of barracks in British Raj. The comic play of the frames is so good that it hides the incredibly racist message of the film. Not that the makers were racist, but that was the British prerequisite, including our leaders and Gunga Din showing it most effectively. <br /> <br /> The Britons took off from India by doing business here and there with local rulers under the weak emperor of Mogul, who ended in the mid-19th century. They ruled very little from India, it would have been impossible. Their rule depended on the local forces you see here. Note that the soldiers cannot rise above the physical level and the status of Gunga Din is much lower. <br /> <br /> Note that rebels are actually prices, not Muslim. This religion has as many strains as there are Christian sects and this strangling cult was quite real. Of course, those who are complained may not have the same view as the liberators. But until India organized its independence movement until the Congress Party emerged, these people were the free Indian voice. <br /> <br /> But if you cut it, stalking people is not a nice thing to do and the British were here too. When I look at Gunga Din, I think Star Trek and the reason why the General Directive came about. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant was able to play his real cockney instead of Cary. . Fairbanks and McLaglen perform very well with their roles appropriate to their people. <br /> <br /> The best actor in the film, however, is Eduard Ciannelli as the leader of the guru, a foreign cult. Notice the fire and passion in his work, he blows all others on the screen when he is. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene Gunga Dinis is Ciannelli, who inspires his troops in his mountain area. Note how Stevens gradually darkens around Ciannell until all you see are eyes and teeth like a haunting Halloween mask. Scary, scary and very effective. <br /> <br /> At the end of the nineteenth century, this film was immediately after more and more British publics questioned the underlying assumptions. But this is Gandhi's theme. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a great movie, fun and funny. It should be shown with an A-route to India and Gandhi, and you can map out how India's independence movement evolved.
