I was watching this movie erroneously. With a little pearl. This film, made in 1956, looks and feels like a late seventies movie. And it's actually better, more restrained, and more correct than a blue soldier. Environmental, anthropological undertones are far from their time. Insufficient cinematography is excellent and terribly realistic. Much more than dances with wolves, the last wolf is able to convey the appearance of the "deadfields" of buffaloes in the late 1800s. Probably because those who were in the movie were real killing fields. The movie was hit during legal forest management, which was aimed at killing buffaloes, so that the animals that were seen were really shot, the bones are real. To sum up, a very little appreciated Western masterpiece that worked perfectly, led and shot.
