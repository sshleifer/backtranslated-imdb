A pleasantly romantic comedy with interwoven sub-blocks that adorn beautifully and actresses that collide with each other in a precise comic timing, a beautiful vision. If Cher's infinite groom asks him to help his strangers, the younger brother-in-law, no one could dream of the consequences. Operational insignia, Catholic Church confessions, biting of love and falling snow ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. The rhythm of the image lasts about 15 minutes (in the old and his dogs there is an early sequence with previous events and the next scene with Cosmoga and the elderly man at the gate), the wrinkle of the plot is intertwined with harsh skills and the strange tone and kooky spirit of the film are both infectious. *** 1/2 from ****
