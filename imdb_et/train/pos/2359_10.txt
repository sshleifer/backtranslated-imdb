I think if you ask most JWs whether they expect miracle treatment because of their faith, you will find that they don't. I know I won't. Instead, you will find that they believe in the promises made to Christ in the resurrection. So, even if the worst happens and we die during our integrity, Jehovah can fix it and correct it. <br /> <br /> This really goes for a simple question: is God true to you or does it all believe? If he is real and you trust him, you follow his instructions, regardless of the short-term result. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One of my family was scared when he saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in capital letters on his chart. I explained to him that if I were in a situation where only a blood transfusion would save my life, it would be the only anger of anger that would have returned to me when the time came? He didn't get it - God just isn't real enough for him. Damage. I wish he had a comfortable trust.
