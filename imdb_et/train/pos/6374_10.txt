Atlantis was much better than I expected. In some ways he had a better story than other older films. Though this film required some attention at times. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the younger audiences saw comedy but got an adventure. I think everyone is tired of the endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children did not see any parody. After a short while, everyone looked very intense at watching Atlantis.
