This 1958 movie hasn't been seen for a long time and I enjoyed the role of Kim Novak, who plays Gil Holroyd, a real witch and who has aunt named Queenie Holroyd, who is also a witch and Gillian also has a brother Warlock named Nick. Jack Lemmon. When Gillian puts eyes on Shep Henderson (James Stewart) who is related to the girl, she plans to marry; Gillian performers wear some magical cat and change their mind about their bride's mind and then become very loved and fall in love with Gillian. The story says that a real witch cannot fall in love, blush or cry, and it will turn out to be a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they had to do something about this situation. Great movie over and over again and a great classic movie from 1958.
