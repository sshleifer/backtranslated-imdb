It's one of those who feel good on Saturday afternoon. It's up there with other retro valves like Navigator. Just a lovely movie with some fine comedy to make things easier. And it's fun to see how 20 years have changed stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin from Phoenix. I personally like this from time to time for such movies. Nothing is too deep or scary. Just a nice story. And I would never have known that Mr. Phoenix would have read the credits recently. She was just that kid when she made this movie. He and Lea did a great job in this movie. I agree that this is not an Oscar caliber film. But worth watching. Especially if you have children between the ages of 8 and 11. Or those interested in the space program.
