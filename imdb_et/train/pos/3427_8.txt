This film illustrates the worst part of the surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, both men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I am reminded that my father and his brothers are returning from World War II. One of my uncles has never finished the war. He survived a D-Day invasion that resembles private Ryan recorded for the first 20 minutes. For him, the memories did not only remember but tortured him. He got alcohol, like many of my cousins, his sons. Jump 60 years ahead and place the soldiers in a different war, another country, the result is the same. When I saw it in KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there was something in the war that never changed. Ideally young men and women did not spare the emotional torture in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war, you will come to more compassion for those soldiers who are trying to do what they believe or have said is right. <br /> <br /> The Vietnamese film's platinum label shows it all. "The First War of War is Innocence."
