Funny fun laughing Neil Simon comedy. Late Walter Matthau is a former comedian who has convinced him to join his former partner (late Oscar winner George Burns) for a final reunion exhibition. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is a Matthau agent and nephew and both have the same chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's bad character - he is the same as he always is, but also very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, like an outdated old man, are as funny as Matthau. <Br>> <br /> Matthau: Want some crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: How would a normal cracker be? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I didn't get ordinary. I got coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Okay <br /> <br /> Matthau: They're in the kitchen cabinet. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or how to do it: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I got black, the whites I said! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie to understand it! <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a refreshingly comedy with a sweet, heartfelt, warm and incredible heart and some of the most memorable quotes. <br /> <br /> They don't do them any more! At a time when all the latest comedies are crude, juvenile and foolish, it rises back to the real core of comedy - funny characters, smart and funny dialogue and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best friend comedies of all time, right there on "Airplanes, Trains and Cars", "Deadly Weapon" and "Hard Road". <br /> <br /> You may find it hard to find it for rent or on TV, but trust me, it's worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
