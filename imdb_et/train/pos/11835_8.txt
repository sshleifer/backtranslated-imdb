Although I wanted to watch this movie for the first time, I was deeply surprised by this film. Although some of the characters and actions in the characters seemed too small, the dark nature of the movie is indeed a much different experience. Instead of a good-happy story, this film takes the second direction, which proves to be exaggerating, but also disturbing. Most children do not understand the darkest moments of the film, which makes the film quite observable for adults. I was also impressed by cinematography using animations and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tiles. The music point was sure again, proving that Hans Zimmer is clever with animated scores, and I didn't think I would say I really enjoyed Brian Adams' music.
