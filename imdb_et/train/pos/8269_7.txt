This movie has been interested for some time, partly thanks to the extremely high IMDb result - to 9.0 averages over 300, it gives the highest rating to all the silent films available! How did I not hear about this movie before this site? Well, you can't always trust the ratings. In fact, this is a very good movie, which is kept quite well when I get the VHS transfer I rented, any indicator - a great player, especially William Haines as a brown, and a good location in Cambridge with some fine-footage climates in the climate Harvard / Yale football game - but the story must be felt in the 1960s even suitable for chestnut. A dirty, self-centered, and charismatic man goes to school and goes to his place, becoming a caring, sacrificing friend of the process; I doubt that in 1926, people who are very exciting in recent couples have a high predictability factor. Nonetheless, it begins very well and it is certainly worth remembering if it does not approve. Maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now 600+ voters and the score has actually risen to 9.2! Seriously, people here are voting - I don't want to explain why it's a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
