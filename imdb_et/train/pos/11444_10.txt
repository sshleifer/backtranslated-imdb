Watch this movie for great images of Andy Goldsworthy's sculptures and meet yourself with eye-opening and a relaxing experience. Music perfectly complements film material, but never draws attention to itself. Some commentators called the fragments of the interview as a weak spot for the artist, but find it: why would you expand it in the movie if you can read Andy's music in your books for a long time or participate in one of his great lectures? This medium is much better suited to showing the artist's ephemeral character and is used in this regard in a professional manner.
