EA has shown us that they can make a classical 007 agent and feel in the 60s world. The graphics of the game are outstanding and the sound recording is also very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (two years after release) and I'm still impressed with the game. It is a shame that EA no longer has 007 games. <br /> <br /> I'll give this game a level of 10/10 that includes this, especially the "consulate" level. I recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13. The only thing I didn't like about the game was the level of the Russian boat, it was too much pressure. Overall I like LOT !!
