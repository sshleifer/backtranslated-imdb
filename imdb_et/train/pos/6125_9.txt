Okay, here I mean Jack Frost. I looked at the VHS tape morphing box and thought to myself, it seems interesting. I rent it and I take it home. Boy, I was right, it's interesting. They put in the spirits of serial numbers into dreamy strollers and everyday machines. But it has to be the most unique place to put the grabber spirit. Snowman inside the body. I liked all the friendly, snowier pictures of landscapes, pots, snow and more. Like. I like the actor who played Jack, he created a nice murderer that wasn't seen by FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I said that. FREDDY KRUGGER. That's the cool level. I wish some of the doll makers were better, the foot movement could have been better. But I criticize it up to a small budget. Cast is doing a great job, there are some big liners and frightening to make any hardcore horror fan. Everything and everything, great story, good effects, great dialogue and big cast. I'll give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
