Richard Attenborough, who gave us the magnificent "A Chorus Line" and "Gandhi" films, surprised us again, creating a beautiful anthem for nature. Indeed, Canada's vast and (at that time) unexplored territory helps to compose the stunning scenery of the film camera. If the film is based on a true story, it is once again apparent that "visionaries" are indeed men who live their time, from a historical perspective, that only time gives them cause. Cinematic art is excellent, for example, the lead of Pierce Brosnan, whose performance is due to Attenborough's main hands. A pleasant surprise is Annie Galipeau's appearance in Archie's beloved role. A film that must appear in the list of those who really love nature ...
