I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something else. The Gundam Wing lacks all this stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime, because the number of jokes made in 17 hours would be just two-digit, Gundam Wing gets the business right away. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is just as much a political thriller as the series of activities. Large parts focus on military diplomatic relations, not just battles. Although the battle animation is not very detailed in cases where it would be just for pain animation, the individual duel between gundams is almost a work of art, considering the animated use of complex mechanics and fast movements. As far as I know, this is a network of cartoon films in 2000 with 49 episodes and was called professionally. duplication is just flawless. Not only does it say that every word answers, but the use of votes makes the characters much more reliable. many believe that it is best to watch anime in English, but I just don't want to do it. <br /> <br /> Not only are voices good, but the score used in the series is quite impressive. I'm just saying it left me a net to wash the sound track. The plot of this series is what really captures the viewers, and not, the hook you like is a major drama like Lost, which was made for you only. a thorough explanation of the plot would result in many spoilers, as many characters do not even contain names until several episodes have been made in the series. The harsh idea of ​​the series is that the earth and its now independent space colonies are difficult to maintain peace. This is how the war begins, leading to a military coup and developing diplomatic situations. I think that information that is very important to the plot would be given in more detail. <br /> <br /> Finish here by saying that this series is great for anyone who likes anime, everyone who thinks ALL anime is stupid (they have reason to believe) and anyone who wants a serious tone with anime .
