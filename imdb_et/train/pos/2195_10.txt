I love it! Fred MacMurray is an excellent as somewhat imaginable, proud but at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always with him. They will meet in Panama after Maggie leaves the ship and arrives at the bar Anthony Quinn. Tony reaches his nose after his insult to Maggie, thinking he is an open woman - all because he took his hat openly. Big hitting and Maggie get to Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always with her whenever she needs her. She calls her to go to NY where (look at the movie well and explore). They have these wonderful scenes together, where he sings while playing the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
