Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems to be the only movie written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in him. <br /> <br /> Operation is superb. Renying Zhou as Doggie was an amazing - very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a joy - very credible as an old tradition. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack was very effective in driving without overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only such films were made in Hollywood or Hong Kong - a family-friendly, well-run, well-written, well-targeted, almost perfect pearl.
