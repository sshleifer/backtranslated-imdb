Children from 7 to 14 years of age were so challenged by this film that we gave a copy to all other children on our birthday list. They all loved it! Children between 2 and 7 are watching it repeatedly and often, and we can look at them together. <br /> <br /> It's rare that the movie attracts children for so long and offers smiles to adults, too. Most enjoy it more than the first one. <br /> <br /> High-quality production and excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as a higher George - sporty, energetic, and completely believable, loving innocence and a specific skill to take the tree - well-supported imitated Christina Pickles as the evil mother, Thomas Haden's Church as evil jerk rival and all others. This is fun.
