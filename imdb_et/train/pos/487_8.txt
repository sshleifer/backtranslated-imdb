The film's remarkable brilliance and lively and unusual love story, Luzhin Defense maps the intense attractiveness of an eccentric gene and a woman of beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> This gives John Turturro, which is probably his best roles so far (thank you for not giving it to Ralph Fiennes, who would have murdered him.) Likewise, Emily Watson shows the richness of her experience (on her outstanding background) ). In order to reach the tortured chess master (Turturro), his character must show intelligence and love of the woman. Watson does not represent the sexuality of a beauty contest, but he brings to his parts a self-consciousness that is tempting. <br /> <br /> At random meetings between Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she inadvertently prevents her from losing a piece of chess that is dressed through a hole - specially made, which we later understand in the film, symbolizing her hopes and aspirations. Later, as their love relationship evolves, she delicately compares with the dance chess (Luzhin has learned to dance, but never with a partner); she encourages her to lead her with "bold, brilliant moves" and allows her to relax enough to play later (and also to understand her lover). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a woman who inspires her to her greatest achievement and does it for her deepest self-realization, emotionally and intellectually (or so we believe - Natalia will definitely be freed up in time, not someone who She considers herself a stereotypical husband and wife.) <br /> <br /> The Italian kits are stunning. The complexity of the characters and the skills that the dialogue opens up is a joy for an intelligent filmmaker, but the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most valuable. Chess is just photogenic backgrounds for the development of an emotional and emotional film, although the game is treated with sufficient respect to almost convince the chess player that characters exist. Although the classic author's tragedy is of considerable height, the final understanding is surprisingly surprising.
