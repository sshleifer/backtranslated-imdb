I do not understand. Not a critic, I do not evaluate the quality of action that I believe is credible. My confusion is in content. Isn't anyone sensitive to the fact that these two unbelievable women justified their fidelity to men who fought and bleed to ensure the continued freedom of their families and their country. Hadn't it been a prologue that would tell us if the men are at home and if so, what was their cheating on "women" infidelity to them? Although these women were lonely in terms of lining their parameters, did they think their spouses enjoyed daily death or demolition? They didn't think of their spouses at all! Only by yourself. Excuse me, except when they wanted their men dead.
