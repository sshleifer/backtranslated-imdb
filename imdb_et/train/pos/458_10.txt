My wife Kate and I loved this series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there's a sequel!). I would like to know what a memorable song has been called and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and still interested in life :-). If anyone has full lyrics, send them. <br /> <br /> Of course, there was one big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much that we are 75 years old and retired, but intellectually very active. It is nice to see an exhibition that highlights the contribution that society can make to older people with specific skills and experience. An aspect of human interests that shows the interaction between the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the exhibition. <br /> <br /> This series is very fun and very challenging, like some of our favorite "Spooks" and "Hustle".
