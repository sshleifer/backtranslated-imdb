Great show. Instead of looking at the same old sitcom type, it shows where it's the same old thing, just different "stars", this refreshing exhibition gave an incredible entertainment overview of the offices. We have been away from watching TV for 2 years and after returning from all available exhibitions we are expecting this example from W. Shame on Globalis to pull the plug into it. I thought it would be a winner. Let's be realistic, FEW Canada exhibitions do it. Anyone I talk to enjoys this show and I believe Global was stupid. I think they want to bring it out with typical amusing entertainment shows coming from countries, rather than pulling Canada for an exhibition that was a lot of promises. Don't make me wrong, I enjoy a lot of TV shows, but come to the people, we keep the variety. This unique exhibition gave a very comical insight into the somewhat exaggerated realistic side of the office's life and relationships, with unique letters that you don't see today or in the past. Too bad that the global had to say it was not a foolish mistake.
