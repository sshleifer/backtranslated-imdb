I loved this episode. It is so big that all these five teams will finish LutherCorp and save the world. I love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are in this starring guest! I just hope Clark joins the League of Justice and we follow this group of heroes around the world! =) It was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because what happens next. I think Chloe should join a team like the Watchtower, which she should do in addition to the Daily Planet, because she has no superpower. I also want to know what topics Lex is using for 33.1, I do not know what other powers other people in the world!
