A fun-filled period around the 30s is the spin of the classic series of climbers, as much as the "lost ship's Raiders", made with only a small budget and much by Michael Anderson. Opening scenes fascinate the liberal quantity of Gothic art that precedes Batman for two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) is a perfectly cast hero and proud of Pamela Hensley as a local Latin Mona, who celebrates our hero's golden god Hidalgo in a non-Latin American country. The best line, our hero Monale, holding the fist on the chin, as you wait for her gently with her and give her a boulder: "Mona, you're brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's ham and blackhat, Captain Seas is an absolute pleasure. Expect a little "Raiders ..", a dash of "Batman", a small "Lost World", a small "Lost Horizons" and a whole lot of campiness and you get it just right. See a small part of the cultural figure Michael Berryman and enjoy the combious use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. The primary candidate for a DVD carrier is definitely late. Inappropriate treatment for the whole family. 9/10
