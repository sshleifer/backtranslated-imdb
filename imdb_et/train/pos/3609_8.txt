I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and didn't know if I did a bad purchase or a good one. This is the latest result of watching the whole movie from start to finish. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", 05, has produced an excellent result and her appearance is beautiful, sexy and at the same time a real study of how action really works. Diana didn't like her home life and especially her father's abuse of her mother. He decides to get boxing training at the local Brooklyn gym and the male boxers disagree. There is a lot of friction between her classmates and boys in her high school. The women's bathroom has many activities and references to the individual parts of boys. If you like boxing, and if you see a warm sexy gal wonders ring and tap the guys about what you know, this movie is for you.
