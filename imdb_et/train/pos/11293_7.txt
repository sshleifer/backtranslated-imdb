William Wyler was supposed to lead Moss Hart's hit Broadway game with a music / recruitment poster, but his own military duties intervened and went to George Cukor, the most unlikely man in charge. The "female director" has a definite atmosphere of many documented sequences of Air Corps training and invests more with unacceptable humanity than is generally allowed in the genre, especially in wartime. Of course, the gee-whiz (and wholly white, except for one outstanding Chinese-American recruiter) bunch of beginners is more beautiful and healthier than in real life, and speaking about home and mother and wife and child is pretty thick, but it's effective propaganda and indisputably blending . Also noteworthy for all military men, many of whom did not repeat for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, red buttons (drawn, Andrews sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. Also a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't see up to one and a half pictures of the picture, but has some good sequences, such as O'Brien's anxious and ill Brooklyn wife. Its rights are too bad, and the only print everyone knows is 16 mm; apparently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (significant success), the rights returned to the army, and if there is a good 35 mm print, it is probably somewhere in the Pentagon intestine. It is unpleasant and brilliant, but it also includes the military training and the fear of war honestly, and it deserves more of it.
