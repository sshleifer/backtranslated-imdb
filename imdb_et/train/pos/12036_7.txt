Why am I so convinced that another movie version of this novel is there somewhere? I saw the film again this year when I teach the novel and find the annoying changes in the film - the little boy does not appear in the novel and the end has changed. They kill him in the movie, but the whole point is that he's haunted by the events of the marsh Marsh House for years, but he's not getting married again and finally the events are behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, and in the film where Kipps fires the office, the constant appearance of the toy soldier for the presence of the child is really horrible, but meaningless - Kipps is haunted by a woman who is seeking revenge, not a child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that is better and closer to the novel and that is actually more scary. Have I just imagined it?
