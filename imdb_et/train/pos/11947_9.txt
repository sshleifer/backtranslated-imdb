Just written, directed and acted ... Woody's best of the 2000s, if not his best since the 80s! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his roll. Scarlett Johansson's drilling with Woody proves how well-rounded the actor he has changed. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing that it's not romantic at the screen. He plays the perfect worshiping magician. <br /> <br /> Some comments have been made about the malignancy of this movie. Don't let them stop you from seeing a wonderfully made movie. People in the people I saw, laughed so loudly in a few lines that I left the next row. If you like Woody Allen's 70's movies, you regret the lack of it. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie with an open mind when you do, you can go out with a smile.
