I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 8 years old on TV in the United Kingdom (where it was called "Flying Island"). I loved it very much and I was heart-breaking when it was repeated later and I missed it. I was fascinated by the story and characters, but above all it was haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version I saw - sometimes mistakenly called "Streamline Dub" (dub was actually by Ghibl himself and only by Streamline), unfortunately unattainable, except for the ridiculously expensive laser disc Unfortunately, I feel Disney has partially violated this release. The vote is OK, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy that the "streaming" dub or the original Japanese was, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to drive. They have made some pointless changes, such as changing the name of the protagonist between "Pazu" and "Patzu" and adding some dialogue. But worst of all, I feel they have destroyed a lot of intrusive music scenes - for example, the airship opening scene was initially silent, but has been spoiled by Disney's moral claim that music is always played when no one talks about what I find in many Disney movies annoying. <br /> <br /> This movie still blows the latest animated films and I can't recommend it enough. The plot is simple but exciting and the film shows the elegance that has unfortunately disappeared from the most modern mass market, homogenized animation.
