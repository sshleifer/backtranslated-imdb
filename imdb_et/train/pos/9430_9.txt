I'm a member of the canoe club and I can tell you the truth that Deliverance is synonymous with peace and tranquility. When we put our boats into the water, the echo perceives the conscious mind at the back. This film is timeless because it waxes the human position in nature and the impact of technology on human relationships with nature. We see it in the catch. We see it in a home-made tent. There is also a contempt for the city man and a sense of superior to the forestman of rural areas. The fact that the Atlanta banker (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" is designed to put him on the same level as a forestman who also has bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle for life and death replaces the "civilized" suppository "Law". This canoeing ends too fast for the viewer, but unfortunately it is not long enough for characters.
