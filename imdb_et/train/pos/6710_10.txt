Sabrina Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V shows of life: D I was watching the episodes every day when I went home from school. So far, I think I've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl / witch with normal teenage concerns that we can all relate to. He's funny, smart, outgoing, witty and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit as well as Sabrina's aunts. Intelligent scientist Zelda and crazy Hilda make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Although I have to agree that college years are not as good as his high school years, but that doesn't mean they weren't good yet. I think the ending was awesome, though it wasn't what I was hoping for, it made sense and I loved it anyway. :)
