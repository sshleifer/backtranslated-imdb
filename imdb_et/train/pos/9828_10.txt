I'm honest with you ... I liked this movie. This is a great zombie flick, full of action, original ideas, good action, but also full of bad zombie effects. Part IV, entitled "After Death" is also good. I recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Of 10 out of 10 Away Camp and other full moon pictures are blinking.
