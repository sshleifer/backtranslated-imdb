MTV has all the ballers and has let the callers pull out the classic movie Scarface from their DVD collection. This may give you the idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Of course there are gangsters and mobs, but that's not Scarface's point. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban residence looking for a new way of life. He falls with the mob group and becomes a well-known master of drugs. Montana was all about doing what you wanted to do with your life. Classic phrase: "Say hello to your little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is always what comes to mind about Brian DePalmas's Scarface movie. It belongs to my 10 best favorite films. I would appreciate it *** 1/2 (****). Definitely a movie you need to see. FENOMENAL.
