It is ironic that in the 50s when Douglas Sirk was his most successful audience, the critics practically ignored it? He's now seen as the head of a terrifying intellect who achieved his best melodrama work? <br /> <br /> "Written by the Wind" speaks of the fall of a precious reputation for the Texan oil dungeon surrounding it. Alcoholism and Nymphomania? It's about twisted, deadly relationships between sex, power, and money ... <br /> <br /> Stack controls a massive portrait of a tortured drunk that is destroyed by disappointment, arrogance, jealousy, insanity and some deep insecurity? Dorothy Malone succeeds as an attractive woman with excessive sexual appetite, humbling himself for Hudson and other townspeople? His best line: "I'm dirty." In one frantic scene, we see that he shakes, shakes and sweats into a provocative mambo? In the other side of the shoulder-shoulder model at your father's desk - a symbol of excess wealth and masculine tyranny ?? <br /> <br /> Crazy atmosphere is both delicious and has intensified Sirk's great use of colors, luminaires and mirrors?
