The first-time writer / director Peter M. Cohen's victory in comedy depicts a cozy and attentive dating environment. The story comes up when four male protagonists meet in a local canteen in the week to make their acquaintance. We meet Brad: good-looking, wall-to-street playboy with fast and sharp language; Zeek: Cynical, Sensitive Writer; Jonathan: Sexually perplexed nice guy with affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: A married man who takes care of his weekly meetings with his friends in the hope that his boring and banal marriage is enlightened. The trials and tribulations of male individuals in New York have been expressed in a fun way, reflecting the mind of the new comedy "Married Man" of HBO in the City and HBO, and bring amazing light. The story takes a twist when the three singles come in contact with Mia, whom Amanda Beet plays cleverly and all fall against her. He seduces them to the personality they show, according to their common power. When they realize they've all met and fall in love with the same woman, they chose their friendship. A realistic introduction to the world of dating, which the critic could not recognize, is whipped. In plain language they missed the point. Here the main character is the cartoons of real people. The exaggeration is hysterical, stirring satire and humility, and should not be taken as seriously as the critic's insecurity suggests. Watch this movie, laughing from start to finish.
