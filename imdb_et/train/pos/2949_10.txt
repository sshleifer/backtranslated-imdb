It's the most fun thing I've ever seen, and I think it's more fun I ever see. If you are not laughing with absolute fun, it is not just your cup of tea. But I honestly don't know anyone who hasn't seen it. Now 17 years and my friends and I will quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo, Aunt Bunnie Ice Cream, Ralph and Ed GET OUT !! Here's just so much individual and collective fun that if you haven't seen this movie, you have one of the best stand-ups. Take any Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin, or even such as Richard Pryor or Red Foxx, and surpass it. I don't know how or where Murphy got his material, but it works. That's what he needs. It's funny as hell. <br /> <br /> Could you imagine how this show must be shocked by people who were used to Eddie Tatar and Mr. Rogers and this SNL? When you listen to an audience when it breaks your first joke or when it first says F, they are totally shocked. <br /> <br /> His first time he says F is when he does that Mr T is homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey boy. You see these jeans very cute. Now come here and f @ ** give me a ass!" <br /> <br /> The crowd breaks a laugh. Nobody waited for the dirty mouth he fired at them. But the results were just awesome. I've never been rushed with comedy, as I was in this condition. In fact, the next time I smiled so much, until 1999, when I saw SOUTH PARK: HIGHER HIGHER AND UNCUT. This comedy was raw and unreasonable, and it was jugular, like DELIRIOUS. I don't think it's possible to watch this comic and not laugh. It's almost twenty years later, and it's still the most funny video. <br /> <br /> "I took your kids for fishing last week. And I put the worm hook and the kids put the gear back in the boat and pulled their head for two minutes on the water. Normal kids don't do it like Gus, then they started your head around like that and m **** f ***** came up Then they looked at each other and said that Goonie Goo Goo! I say, do you believe this f **** nitite?! "<br /> <br /> Watch it again and be ready to laugh your freakin ass! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
