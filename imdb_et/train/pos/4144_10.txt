For a while now I tried to trap where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and I liked them. Fat options for the bus are an exception. That's the truth. This is the best "bad" movie ever. <br /> <br /> This "bad" movie seems natural. After Satan's monologue, the word "Hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. Glamorous Bridget is a wig and economical shop. It takes an eccentric couple trying to kill each other to go down the stairs. Jesus walks in a funk soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In any case, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost his term to advise his parents on a film project. But this is how bad it is that makes it so wonderful. You get the impression that the makers knew it would be bad, but never forced it. Highly recommended.
