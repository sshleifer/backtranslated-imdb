I didn't expect this movie as much as I did. I just got it because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films. It didn't seem that great. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that it was one of the wisely made films that I recently remembered. <br /> <br /> This is about twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything. He stores all the information he collects in a huge archive. He is experimenting with experiences in sex, political activity and interpersonal relationships. In the meantime, the film crew who sees the movie and watch their reaction story and each other is shown. Nudity, explicit sex, and controversial politics were seen as a show in the US, while its seizure by the customs was appealed. The film is narrative, but it is a documentary that shows us the scene behind filmmakers during the narrative of the world, the fourth wall being broken. This film is the most direct way to the film I've ever seen. The film mainly acts as a time capsule for psychedelic, freedom and sexual liberation in the 1960s. I like to think so much more. <br /> <br /> I didn't think I would waste my time with the blue version of my movie, but I really do. This movie is buried in treasure. Try it.
