MPAA: R. Quebec Characterizing Violence, Language, Nudity and Short Drug Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After celebrating Fritz, I wanted to see more Bashki movies I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw it. When it was first released, the film was very controversial. It was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film to be banned, even led by demonstrations outside the theater, where the film was only released under the title "Street Fight." It is now considered a cult classic film and African-American celebrities, such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and the rap group The Wu-Tang Clan, have said they have enjoyed this movie. Personally, I thought Fritz Cat was a much better film, but it is also very enjoyable. Worth watching Bashki or Blaxploitation film fans. The film interferes with live action and animation, such as a film framing Roger Rabbit. I would have preferred it in animation, but wh film starts with a respectable and second-man racing to save two of my friends from prison. Although the prisoners are waiting for the parent, he tells the three men he knew. black men who sold their house to this man. They decide to make names for themselves in the Harlem. So the driver, the black rabbit, kills the big player in Harlem and he gets basically a big fire. The film moves like the Italian Mafia Mafia includes the godfather, his three sons who are homosexual and Italian clown.Coonskin is an entertaining animation film that is worth a look.
