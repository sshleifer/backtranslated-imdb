Shakespeare games have the opportunity to exceed time. Language breaks the timing. but maybe there are actors who actually do it. <br /> <br /> After disappointing Romeo and Julia (Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), she was hesitant to take another modern Shakespeare transfer. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character was so well played by Kenneth's companion! even if Iago is really bad and despicable, this character was played so well that it does what Shakespeare has for his career, hate the audience. I have to say that fish farming is also very good here. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to Shakespeare scientists and lazy students (who refuse to read the book).
