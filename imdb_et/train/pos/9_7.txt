Director Martin Ritti's classical romantic drama is as incredible as they come, but the moments of joy are mostly stars of Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both terrible) charisma. She is a widow who cannot move on, she is illiterate and a cabinet inventor. Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (right title!) Adaptation is so modest that editing a movie is confusing, but it is still pleasant; rosy humor fantasy. There are no serious questions (even the angle of illiteracy is just a plot tool for the next love story) and real fireworks, although the characters are deliberately colorless and the lead has been tinted to an interesting extent. Finale is fluffy, and it is difficult for the cynics to swallow - though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture does not match. *** from ****
