is the highlight of its 1917 function. The clan prides itself on a young girl who becomes a clan after her father's death. On the island of Scotland, the villagers live the simple life of the "fishermen's people". My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but the film has some great ocean landscapes and camera work is great. Maurice Tourneur led Pickford in this pleasant film. Pickford was already a big star in 1917 and this film seems to have been written for him: a happy young woman succeeds in failure. Pickford whipping toward the lazy villagers towards the church is very funny. And the last scenes of the sinking ship are very well done. Not a big Picford movie, but it's worth watching. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is in the interest of love and is good for a couple of couples. Leatrice's joy is one of the villagers, but I couldn't meet her. My copy shares many bells and gongs and adds a frightening feeling when the village's alarm clocks are beaten. Very effective.
