My comments: VIVAH: - This is a charming, idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film brings us back to the small pleasures of bride and groom families who sleep on the floor, play together, their friendly torment and mutual respect. Vivah is about the importance of marriage and the commitment of two people. Yes, central romance is naively visualized. But the romantic moments between married couple and their stubborn resilience between modern entertainment games make you desire for idealism. The film is expected to come to marriage and the bride's wedding evening, which tells her new bride who burns injuries: "Come let me make your dressing" <br /> <br /> VIVAH - introduces many good things - organized beauty of beauty, Indian beauty of culture, India woman's beauty, last but not least, nice IDEAL, a married couple waiting for marriage ... playing with the rules! Easy yet beautiful; Such a simple story .... there is no plot ... no villain - like most Sooraj Barjatya films. Sooraj sir is back with what he does with BEST. He has made the film with FULL CONVICTION. This is a very sweet movie that teaches the current generation a lot of good things, organized by a marriage and a union of 2 families. I think AMRITA RAO - it looks very good and has worked very well. He has most of the good scenes - though I thought the last half-hour was entirely for Shahid Kapur - who gives great restraint for the change. I also liked the action of all others ex. Choti or Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahidi bro & sis-in-law. It seemed almost as real and recognizable as possible. Sooraj sir has become another nice family film about Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is awesome. <br /> <br /> Similar events in marriage / relationship, avoidance of justice, mutual respect, care and cosmos, waiting for official marriage, praying / celebrating for Ur Beloved - all these and still in Vivah. There's still a good audience who runs this movie and enjoys it. Some people / audiences are already excited after they see they think they are organizing a marriage :) Thats Success if you ask me. It seems that AMRITA RAO - our actor-from-Vivah {Nice Result Result} has received the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE Award in 2006! He hired him for this achievement, though Vivah, Shahid or Amrita didn't get any movie tickets and other awards; @ at least this is news for CHEER !! Congratulations to AMRITA RAO to show us the visual Indian bride-to-be, the purest form and of course Sooraj Barjatya to show her the best way :) Don't forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH sweet and legendary as of today ! Imagine sharing the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... Its not an average achievement !! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - for the second level of her career with this award .... I personally feel - she should only continue with Shahid Kapur !! They make a lovely pair and their screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> <br /> Some points The few things I noticed: - # 1 If you notice carefully, Amrita Rao seems so good because she always wears traditional dresses. He gives every bit of Indian femininity - in this movie !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage .... but PREM listens closely to its DAD gradual talk - having full faith in Anupam Kher. Finally, "honesty" and "trust" are the keywords that she reflects in her first conversation with Amrita. Most people would think that such a first encounter with a stranger for a limited time is never enough to understand a person. But according to what I saw in this movie, I feel that the two people who are prepared for each other can combine this potential at the 1st meeting !!! # 3 There are basically 4 or 5 sequences in the whole movie, where Shahid & Amrita are together - or they have been shown to be together. Unlike most of the other romantic / wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are singing / dancing or today - they do cheap things. But the beauty of these 5 sequences: - is characterized by restraint, innocence and respect for others! # 4 I really liked the relationship between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These films should emphasize the indifference shown by the girls / girls' children in some parts of India. # 5 Romantic Scenes Between the Guiding Pair and the Very Nice Photograph - Cheap Scenes, No Songs Beautifully Taken! Words such as "Jal", "Praarthana" e.t.c. all the girls have liked the buzzwords :) Personally, I really feel a lot of dialogues in this movie. # 6 Last but not least - The entire hospital scene where Shahid puts "Sitahore" for Amrita when she lives for life - is terrible. These pairs of dialogues are both in touch and U feel LOVE / I-cant-do-without-U; Its hats-off feeling !!! *** In many ways VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - LEAD-pair freshness / screen-chemistry:) :) NEW QUESTION: - With movies like Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE, and Kabul Express, are the best films made in 2006 by VIVAH. FACT - I think Vivah deserves better viewing / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golma or all those time-pass / fuzzy / style / crap movies !!
