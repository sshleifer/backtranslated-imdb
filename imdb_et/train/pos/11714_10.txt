Then you need to see this movie to understand reality. After reading the book, Duke is now a supporter of people suffering from bipolar disorder; previously labeled manic depression. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that people at this age and age are still criticizing people with emotional problems or those seeking psychiatric care. Regressive and discriminatory thinking is still there and it is regrettable. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the audience sees the pain and suffering that Mrs Duke had gone through, especially as a child. Many of us can remember him from the teenage "Patty Duke Show". He was the household name in America at the age of 15. <br /> <br /> You know how he uses Ross (well played by Howard Hesseman). In the 1950s, stigmatization was full of power. But we can see when he is progressing in his career, but the illness is getting worse. It passes through substance abuse and promise; even marrying someone with whom he divides next week; and he has several conflicts and tantrums with his children and elderly mother. All of these problems occurred before receiving adequate treatment and medication. <br /> <br /> A recent study published by NAMI (National Association for Mental Illness) noted that most adults in the US are not familiar with most of the classic symptoms. bipolar disorder. It was also announced that one in five respondents thought that people could control their disease without having to take medication. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) When you watch this movie, you will learn a true story about a talented woman who couldn't pull her bootstrap up and "get well" until she practiced her disorder and got the right treatment. Thank you, Mrs Duke, for advocating for ignorance and prejudice.
