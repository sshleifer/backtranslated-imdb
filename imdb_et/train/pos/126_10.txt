Zentropa is the most original film I've seen for years. If you like the unique thrillers influenced by the movie noir, it is just the right treatment for all those Hollywood summer camps that today block theaters. Von Trier's follow-up like Breaking the Waves has gained more recognition, but it's really his best work. It is flashy without disturbing and offering the perfect combination of fine and dark humor. It is too bad that he decided that the cameras were a wave of the future. It is hard to say who spoke to him about the style shown here, but it is because of the loss of everyone that he went to his strongly theoretical dogma.
