I think the idea of ​​the plot is perfect for first exploring the emotional experiences of the people involved, and secondly, as someone else wrote in his commentary, such relationships (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> So ... to start from another aspect ... that it was short, it was not at all visible ... <br /> <br /> just like the first one. as I said, it had much more potential ... I think these relationships are much more tense ... much more tension ... and the potential tension didn't go through ... <br /> <br /> I think that the soundtrack could have been more than the few background and theme songs (which were nice but not enough and not always in the right moments) ... yes ... i felt like there was no better soundtrack .. <br /> < br /> actors ... I think they were somewhere between 7 and 8/10 ... not enough sensuality at key moments ... <br /> <br /> total 7/10 .... mostly story
