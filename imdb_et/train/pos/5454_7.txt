This is one of the boldest and most important pre-code films made in Hollywood in the 1930s. Unlike some of the precursors that occasionally appeared on topics that would never have been allowed after 1934- 5, this film made a very nice but fun plot from start to finish. The usual moral of the 1930s and 40s was certainly not evident in this film, because the film is essentially a female woman who sleeps her way to the top - and without excuses. This "wide" both enjoyed sex and was used by all men who could enrich it - something you would never have seen in movies made just two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The movie begins Barbara Stanwyck is working on her father's talk. In addition to his boss, he is also a pimp and encourages him to sleep with a local government official to allow an illegal bar to act with impunity. Although not very clear here, it seems that the father has been letting his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> But after almost rape and attacking this man by breaking the bottle of beer over his skull, Barbara has been enough and leads to the big city. It doesn't hurt that she was still bleeding and killing her father, but her feeling that she whispered out and had nothing to show was a driving force. <br /> <br /> Despite depression, Barbara uses sex to work in a huge mega-bank. He starts a rather mysterious job as a file manager, but for a couple of weeks he seems to be sleeping his way to another job - until he sleeps with the bank manager and his future son! It all ends with a tragedy, but Babs does not seem to be too corrupted due to the deaths of these two men. In fact, he has some time later to be able to take on the new CEO and he is back (maybe more than one). <br /> <br /> Now it's a wonderful movie because it was so sharp and unpleasant. Barbara played a 100% sociopath - a woman who had no morality and conscience - but a desire to squeeze as much out of her life as she could not, regardless of who hurt in the process. But bold writers and producers "broke" and thought it was important to redeem the redeeming end. Given that this woman was so evil and enticing, her heart's change at the end was the main disappointment and severely damaged by the film. It reminded me in many ways of the end of JEZEBEL - as once again, the evil person sees somehow "sees the light" and makes a not too convincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try to look at RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. RED-HEADED WOMAN is very similar to BABY FACE, but there is no magic transformation at the end - the leading lady is indeed deep in reverse! In DOWNSTAIRS, which is very similar to RED-HEADED WOMAN, roles are reversed and the man (John Gilbert) plays a similar associative character. Both are classic and a bit better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing for a short time, which is often very sparse in Hollywood films and in this light it is worth Cinephiles. Duke fans also take note - John Wayne plays a very small part in the film and it is very unusual to see a very young Wayne who plays such a normal role.
