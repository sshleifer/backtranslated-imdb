It is a real shame that this spin-off television show, inspired by the high-tech images The Night Stalker and The Night Strangler, lasted only one season and twenty episodes, as this program was at best often a winning and very fun mix of sharps. cynical humor (Carl Kolchak's powerful verbal sparring games with the editor of persistent innocence and long-suffering with Tony Vincenzo were always suitcases to watch and hear), clever writing, supernatural supernatural threats (you have to love ancient and original beings) "Spanish Moss Murder", "Sentry "and" Horror in the Heights ", plus you can't go wrong with the favorites of such tried and tested fears like zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches. , lively acting with plenty of cold stars (the legendary biker flick icon William Smith got a rare opportunity to deal with heroic leadership in The Energy Eater, while other episodes were excellent veteran players like Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels in juices roles), the real tense moments (the "Spanish Moss Murders" sewer area was really harassing) and the best one and only Darren McGavin is in top form as an aggressive, aggressive and exciting, but basically decent, brave and honest little occasional newspaper in Chicago, Illinois reporter Carl Kolchak. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was the main 70-year-old eternal protagonist, wisely and quickly fascinated, with a strong nose for a delicious male shovel and an unfortunate opportunity to get into any kind of trouble. Moreover, the occasionally worshiping Kolchak was nothing but supernatural; he died or usually succumbed to the deadly threat, but still had some inner strength and courage that allowed him to rescue mankind over and over from any deadly enemies. Kolchaki was surrounded by a handful of pleasant secondary characters: Simon Oakland was perfect when Carl's chronically bad boss Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as prissy Ron Updyke, which made the ideal comic foil, Ruth McDevitt was just as pleasant as sweet Miss Emily Cowles and Carol Ann Susi were also very fun as an avid beaver Rookie Monique Marmelstein (who, unfortunately, disappeared after opening only three episodes). It has been shown that the exhibition suffered from weak make-up and special effects (the title lycanthrope "The Werewolf" is unfortunately similar to the Yorkshire Terrier!) but even second-level exhibitions are redeemed with a program brand that is maliciously sardonic and McGavin's boundless vitality and appealing splitting presence.
