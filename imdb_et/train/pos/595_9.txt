When John Wayne filmed his Alamo story, he had built a complete Alamo, located in Brackettsville, Texas, which is still a tourist attraction. As long as it exists, we will have Alamo interpretations on the screen in the future. One such thing with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was done this century. <br /> <br /> But I'd say Alamo: Thirteen days in honor is the best Alamo story I saw. John Wayne's movie is good when it's over-jumped, but it's John Wayne's movie story to fill the character of John Wayne's screen. Brian Keith plays Davy Crocket here and gives a fine interpretation of the scrolling he had. <br /> <br /> It is much closer to Professor Lon Tinkle's book “Alamo as Wayne's Movie” and read the book year. back I can confirm it. Tinkle's book is the source of both films, but the Tinkle who lived at Wayle's film was not happy with the result. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was the right age for the youngsters William Barrett Travis, an idealistic freedom fighter who, by the way, was a slave owner. On that day, no one saw an ironic contradiction in this respect. One thing that was not studied and was not Travise's hyperactive sex drive. He was in southwestern Casanova, he even kept his joyful diary of Libyan conquests. <br /> <br /> But the man who always hurts is Jim Bowie, who is playing here with James Arness. He was a sure Alamo hero, but his career before Alamot was what was terrible. He was a smuggler, a slave merchant, everywhere who sold land with a questionable title. But his heroic death was definitely redeemed by him. There is no clue in the imagination of Arnes or the others I've seen on Bowie's screen. And of course, he designed the Bowie knife made for his specifications. This person needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> But the main asset that Alamo has for the thirteenth day is the inflatable image of the President of Mexico, Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, personally appearing to push the rebellion that aroused by the Americans who came to Mexico at the invitation of Mexico settle down. Unfortunately, these Americans came up with some of the imagined concepts of freedom that simply didn't do it far south, at least freedom for the white people. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna, a more controversial feature of Mexican history. He was also quite scary, but he was the best in Mexico until a real reformer named Benito Juarez came. <br /> <br /> This movie was a goodbye to Lorne Greene, who briefly appears as General Sam Houston. Greene is not quite my concept of Houston, he was partly too old, Houston was in his forties in 1836, he was not a Texas patriarch. But within the constraints imposed on him, Greene is doing a good job. <br /> <br /> Alamo's story is romantic about the version of John Wayne, but for historical content, I highly recommend this movie.
