My school's drama club puts this show in the spring of 2002 and I just hope we're so good! I recently watched this movie as a kind of "exploration" for my role (Rosie Alvarez) and I just want to say that Vanessa Williams is the coolest! <br /> <br /> Wow! Choosing this movie was right (one exception). Jason Alexander, oh, I can't do anything? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson - I especially loved all my funny facial expressions and dance "Burn a happy face!" He's so big! Vanessa Williams, as I said earlier, is the coolest. She was beautiful Rosie and her transition from secretary to seductress was completely plausible. Tyne Daly was cheerful when Albert's unpleasant mother and George Wendt were great as the annoyed Mr. McAfee (but I loved Paul Lynde's action in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau broke me as Ursula Merkle; he really grabbed him! And Marc Kudisch was a fantastic Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" I do not understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - What was it? I mean, she's really beautiful and very talented, but ... she looks a little too old for her role. Uh, maybe I'm misleading. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, I recommend this movie. This leaves you smile. <br /> <br />
