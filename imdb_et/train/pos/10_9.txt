I'm a man, not a female movie, but it's really a well-made special story. I have no personal love for Jane Fonda, but she does a fine job of hell, while DeNiro is her usual great self. Everything is so well done: action, leadership, visuals, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy the story of real people and true love - this is the winner.
