I thought this movie was fantastic. It was fun. Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap. It has to be seen by fans of the 70's stones. (I hope my and my friends are not like twenty years!) Bill Nighy gives you great performance when a singer trying to restore that old spirit, Stephen Rea is perfect for film as an adhesive that tries to save the band but does not work well. <br /> <br /> If you love music and were once in a band, this movie is definitely for you. You won't regret seeing this movie. I know I won't. Even my family found it funny and it says something.
