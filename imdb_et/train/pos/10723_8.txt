I've read some other user comments and I also decided one. Some users are in a "realistic" mentality. This movie was supposed to be "fantasy" .... "what if" a fun movie. It should never have been "real" or serious. It was fun for everyone when I knew it came out - although it shade the Challenger explosion tragedy ... I was 30 years old and enjoyed it completely - my young son loved it too! Later I shared it with my daughter and she loved it. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should be enjoyed just because - fun. All "realists" in the world should shine or stick to watching documentaries or documentaries and avoid any other type of film. So sorry that the young people who first watched this movie could then go to the actual SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - they had to wait to find the same type of environment as the film was portrayed and then felt "breaking" ... I think their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you love fantasy fun movies and haven't seen it, then I recommend it! Enjoy!
