This series was cut across the rest of the TV detective series, but in no way found the audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be completely new, but has added so much story. And who could forget about Pax, a beautiful guide dog! <br /> <br /> Although the stories themselves may not be better than the middle series, New Orleans settings, actors and music (I note the comment on the music score in other comments ... I remember clearly) all work to make a good TV show even better! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... one day Paramount can just dig into your archives and release it from a DVD!
