This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some campy humor and death scenes that can be sort of comic. I liked the movie because of personal humor. This is definitely not a super-scary movie that is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid later. I liked mountain biking and Lester ... very plausible. I think I will paint my hair in red on Scarecrow - very cool! Anyway, it is worth renting the experience of renting humor and the usual horror.
