Some say "The game is the most important thing" or something that is attributed to that old Bard, Avon, William Shakewspeare. if it wasn't old Will, it could be our own super-veteran film director, Mr. Raoul Walsh. There are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis. None of them is more suitable than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The film also hangs with a second prize called Errol Flynn's favorite for its main vehicles. This clearly shows the evidence on the screen that could easily guide the viewers in the dark theater or watch them on their home TV or DVD to stop the same. <br /> <br /> To be sure, the story is a semi-serious Biopic that takes part in factual material and combines it with the liberal dose of old imagination to bring us very satisfying, though somewhat fixed (what is not Biopic?). <br /> <br /> Casting is great because it uses the natural athleticism of our management, Errol Flynn. Although it is not a Swashbuckler, a Western or war image, it is GENTLEMAN JIM, the main role that best suited Australia's harshness. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Coconut Team in 1928 or 1932. His training and skills in "sweet science" are clearly visible throughout the film, and in particular the "great fight" at the world's high-level boxing championship with great John L.Sullivan himself. Ward Bond) It's like a Warner Brothers resident support book for supporters. It has Alan Hale, Jim Corbett's father, Livery Wagon as operator *. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), two men in the family's "blue collar", called "long-haired". <br /> <br /> Great Jack Carson makes his usual masterful serio-comic performance supported by Jim Corbett's friend and co-bank. The rest of the ones we both know and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn, but only a few. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh also used a number of Pro Wrestlers in the role of various boxers. So we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis and the unknown Grappler * are open at the scene of 2 scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (never heard of him?) And Wee Willie Davis. These men had a powerful but unpolished look at them that the old Pier 9 brawlers would have received. <br /> <br /> We have not forgotten the leading woman, Alexis Smith. He is capable of characterizing an "independent" woman, but retains enough comic book in many scenes. She shows a fairly large selection of poor little wealthy girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients, there is a trick to mix elements in the right proportion to give it the right mix. Well, Director Walsh does it with a reckless waiver. Because he's looking for a big movie first. His treatment shows all the skills he had put to fine-tuning, starting with his day as D.W. Griffith. Mr Walsh seems to have a special affection for this period, the 1890s. *** Mr Walshi's direction is moving through the script with a pretty fast clip, breaking the scenes of exposure with a humorous line of lines, "it's Corbetts again!" So he can keep a light, even humorous touch story that can become too drab and serious. <br /> <br /> In addition, Brother Walsh provides an authentic look to the almost forgotten element of San San. 1890s Francisco. And if he is another example of having loved it during this time, he creates a broad and dynamic image of the historical prize fight. These Boxing scenes have a lively, delightful mood. In the form of the crowning glory of this great, perhaps undervalued film, director Walsh gave a glimpse of the police magazine, which included such events in these "old days". <br /> <br /> But remember before you watch. If this is the first time or you see it again: <br /> <br /> "CONBETS ARE BIRTHS!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion of the historian, both Film and Pro Wrestling, it seems that Tor Johnson, who was a favorite of director Ed Wood a year later. <br /> <br /> ** Livery is a somewhat archaic term for renting a local car. urban transport. <br /> <br /> *** It's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was Griffith Veteran Player. He was an actor who depicted John Wilkes Booth at NATN BIRTH (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his memories of the 1890s and the Sullivan-Corbett Championship competition and what it meant to be the sport of those days in America.
