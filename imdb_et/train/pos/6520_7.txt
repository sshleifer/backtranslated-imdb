The original DeMille film was made in 1938 with Frederic. Very good movie. Hollywood love for remakes brings us a pretty interesting movie, where Yul Brynner plays. Of course he was brilliant because he almost always appeared in his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a genius. The tendency of the film, however, is somewhat long in places. It doesn't move at the pace of the 1938 version. However, this is a fun movie that should be seen at least once.
