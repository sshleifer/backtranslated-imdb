You saw it from the previous viewer randomly, I've been watching it twice. I enjoyed it thoroughly, no foolish way of thinking that caused messages just for fun entertainment, good songs, good characters, and just a good movie. Very recommended for those who just want to enjoy movies and not entertain them for the whole family here. I didn't know that Rosie Alvarez was playing Vanessa Williams, she was great and very gentle. Songs such as One Boy and One Last Kiss are really enjoyable for listening to Jason Alexander and knocking his legs, which is completely in conflict with his character Pretty Woman ans is very good. Tyne Daley still persists with Cagney and Lacey, and his voice and accent had a memory. Generally I just loved it and looking to buy it when it is available
