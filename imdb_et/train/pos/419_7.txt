The Old West Cecil B. DeMille's epic contains what may be Jean Arthur's best results, such as hysterical, eccentric, incurable, immoral, but dedicated, embarrassing fisherman Jane. He really pulled it out! Gary Cooper is his most silent, but manages some random pronouncements: "The levels are great, but the roads sometimes cross ..." The story is a paste that finishes all pastels. All western cowboy heroes seem to be there, except for Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln personally opens this story (or at least DeMille should believe it). There is no room for anything that is subtle when it comes to the masses of the "stomp" mother's face. The remarkable thing about this film, however, is that Eisenhower was called an "early military industrial complex" a very early complete attack. It is not just a story about the runners of weapons, but about restraining everyone in the heart of Washington. But don't get into politics, let's leave it to DeMille, who has a superficial look. The main interest of this film for these years is that he uses the first film score by George Antheil, who has a lot to say about his autobiography "Bad Boy of Music". Antheil seems to have created a "sound" that has been received by all subsequent western countries, where plains sing the voices of countless hopes and sounds in the sky, celebrating open spaces and interweaving common melodies. That's why it doesn't sound unusual because we've heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have been the first to summon the whole sage brush in combination with the open sky symphony that has entered the American mythical lore and has given it a soundtrack that has never varied ever since. be, but no doubt appropriate. It's fun to see Anthony Quinn early in Cheyenne Indiana. Gabby Hayes is there somewhere, but you missed him. Gary Cooper crosses all of them, threatening big - but when will he ever be small?
