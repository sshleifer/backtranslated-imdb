I got an evening cinema with my friend's friend. The evening is a chick flick that has no excuse for it, but I can somewhat relieve you that it is not an estrogen that a red blooded male is painful to look at. Except for one copy at the end of the movie, I looked with interest and did not have to go my eyes to any self-conscious melodrama. Ladies, for their part, love this movie. <br /> <br /> Ann Lord is an elderly, bedridden and last few days spent on land as comfortably as possible in his home with two grown daughters on his side. His past memories suddenly frightened the man's name, which his daughters had never heard before: Harris. Although both of her daughters are quietly thinking of her mother's strong desire to remind and restore her mysterious man's importance to the mysterious man of all this time, Ann is leaving her head to meet Harris - and by doing so, we lost the youthful optimism for the future we all inevitably have we could. <br /> <br /> Both Ann and her two daughters - one married with children, one series of "comissofoob" - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly, if true love can withstand the attempt of time. Do we all realize one day that love does not last forever? Do we all realize that solving imperfection is the only realistic result? The subtle fact that the old Ann is still wrestling with the answer to these questions about his death bed has not lost his two daughters. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting in the evening - most of the movie will be in Ann's mind when it reminds of the past, and so I think the film has been knocked out like it would have been deliberately overwhelmed to give everyone an essential glow (and so would it is very clear that all this is not real but happened in the past). Claire Danes is beautiful (it looks really really long, though in reality it's only 5 '5') and is absolutely enchanting in a climatic scene where her song talents are finally tested. <br /> <br /> You can't really talk about a trash that takes you to Claire Danes and doesn't miss it: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep, and Glenn Close play other big and smaller roles in the movie. br /> <br /> I can't say anything negative about this movie, although Hugh Dancy's struggle to develop one's character due to one dimension is ultimately a complete loss. dirty rich who puts a big bravot on but is secretly scared that never reaching anything, apparently, doesn't offer much of the character of exploration - he had his orders and with them. <br /> <br Finally, gentlemen, your lady's friend will definitely cry and while you probably won't feel almost as affected, the evening will definitely not be wasted while watching the evening. Try it in the theater or grab it for rent to get points if you want to accompany Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo flick. It's your little secret that this viewing didn't cost you much.
