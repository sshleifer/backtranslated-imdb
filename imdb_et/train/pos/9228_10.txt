Waiting to see another Nunsploitation movie whose average mother Superior abuses and tortures her charges, Flavia turned out to be far more than I had expected. <br /> <br /> This is actually a feminist, although I do not believe such a concept existed in the era when the film was set. It certainly wasn't practiced. Women (and Jews and the poor) are very much dropped and hidden in social places. The whole story is witnessed by the sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) to her tyranny until she just can't sit there and actually do something, albeit with catastrophic results. <br /> <br /> The pre-credit sequence is a flavia youth adolescent near the battlefield. He sees an injured "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few in life) and tries to help him. Before he can, his anger throws his daddy's soldier into his face and breathes his head (great family dynamics, ah?). After that, his father forces him to join a monastery where he feels even more injustice. Although the scenes are related to violence, rape and nuns, I consider it more a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> Indeed, there are many ingredients in the unpleasant exploits, but they work, camera work, storyline and music are too good to keep it at that level. Most of the "nun" films I've seen have usually the basic premise: A good girl somehow winds up in a monastery where her mother's boss is the ultimate female who loves to whip people and / or make life hell. br /> <br /> Flavia spends most of her first part of the film passively, questioning all the atrocities around her. Much of his passivity is forgotten when he gets to know a strong spirit (but a little lighter if he likes it like me, but the guys are much simpler) sister Agatha. If a group of Muslims attack their monastery, Flavia and Agatha will not scare like other nuns. Their attackers actually act as their liberators (near the monastery's cruelty and slavery). In fact, it's a Christian, not an Muslim invader who dares to dear Agatha. <br /> <br /> This is the death of Agatha, sending Flavia to his violent crusade against those who have emphasized him ... His father treats him as dirt. His Muslim lover rejects him at a very inappropriate time. I don't want to give the rest of the story too much, but be prepared to shock, ruin and grieve at the end. This is a great movie, so don't let this (undeserved) reputation as a trash. Plus, how on earth could a film containing Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I don't know other works by María Casares, but Sister Agatha is a character hell. <br /> <br /> I have read many great comments about the release of Synapse (USA), but I love my German X-Kult DVD. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but in fact we have a little more information about the entire edge than the release of Synapse. <br /> <br /> There are also many good, smart or funny dialogues (many sister Agatha). <br /> <br /> "Why is God a man? Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? They are all men!" -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are afraid - look at them, sister-afraid that their ability to remove them!" -Sr. Agatha (for Christians fleeing after Muslims arrive) <br /> <br /> "The Woman You Are Going To? Muslims Can't Do You That Christians Have Not Done! If Ha Ha!" -Sr. Agatha (a group of fleeing Christian women) <br /> <br /> "The Lord blesses these Muslims - the fear of the Christians of these pompos." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Does it only take Muslim eyes to make you $ h! -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing message:" Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a kidnapped nun. The idea of ​​the film came from the events that occurred during the Musalman invasion in Italy, which culminated in what is today remembered as 800. a.
