When I read the previous remarks, I collect that film went directly to the cable. I paid to see it in the theater and I'm glad I did because it was a striking film visually. Most of the settings seem to have been made in the early 1960s (with the exception of the shrinkage office that was dated in some other way) and when you leave Neve Campbell's series, the whole film has gone through the atmosphere since the early 1960s. And the use of restaurants in the movie was exciting. For the first-time driver, whose background I think is written, he has a big eye. In the first ten minutes, I felt the plot lacked credibility, so I just stopped my belief and drove along. Film and father-son, mother-son, husband-parent-child relations represent the film on the spot. William H. Macy, a joy to look at, seems to have filled the gap left by Tony Perkins when it and Magnolia are references. Tracey Ullman as a neglected woman was quite touching for me. It was a three-dimensional image that society too often saw as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add it to his collection of unforgettable images. The depiction of parents (Bain / Sutherland) indirectly reminded me of Vincent Gallo 'BUFFALO '66, although it was quite a few. I would definitely pay the money to see another movie in this movie. He has a self-discipline of a 50-year-old film director for b-crimes (something never gets to Mr. Anderson!), But he has a visual style and five participants who draw attention.
