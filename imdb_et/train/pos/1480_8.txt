I'm right in front of the television watching Casomai. It is changing, it is developing or improving. It begins with the wedding of two main characters, where their love story has been announced. After that, everything changes, the baby was born and the rest usually happens in a couple. This is not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple and the normality is at the heart of this film. It doesn't want to show us something special, it's nothing new, it's just a normal love story, a couple story, and normal it's different. It is also a flashing film, everything is short, every scene is just a few seconds. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it and their opinion is central, opinions create a story and destroy it. It is a simple odd story, as I said, but it is not boring, it just shows a couple, it should be all known, it is, but I'm sure each of you wants to know what will happen so don't forget that Look at the end!
