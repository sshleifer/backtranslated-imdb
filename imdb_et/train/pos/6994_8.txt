Bela made 9 pictures for the Monogram, but it was only the fourth that things started to come together. All other classes would use it as an important production, writing and character development. From this, better or worse, the series would also deal with one important topic: a researcher (usually Bela) is doing a test in the basement or in an old house (sometimes in an old house in the basement), causing the stuff to fling. It was also the first time that art director Dave Milton had the opportunity to spread his wings. He came on board with BLACK DRAGONS, flick before, but this one is where he can make his craft start to click. Lewis set aside a great atmosphere and was for all the other monograms. They are key and it's a pretty good B movie. You get Barclay and Harlen (also BLACK DRAGONS) with Russell, who would celebrate Lewtons' CAT PEOPLE movies ... and Rosetto, SPOOKS RUN WILD ... nice slice of Poverty Row talent. If you have a limited time and budget, start with it ... it will gather all that they have learned so far and give you something to compare the rest. Content? Bela steals gland juice to keep her nasty woman young. They both want to sleep in the coffin. If you can read and smile, the rest is easy.
