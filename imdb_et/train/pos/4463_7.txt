Recently reviewed entertainment has given me the desire to watch many classic MGM music from the forties and fifties. ANCHORS AWEIGH is definitely less a movie than on the street. Songs are not so good, nor are there any characters between languages. But the film intertwines beautifully with classic favorites like Tchaikovsky. And the scene on the Hollywood Bowl, where Sinatra and Kelly rise upward and then step down, but dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the movie, although the scene where Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will undoubtedly identify the music that pianists play. Sinatra, then the croons, "I fall into love too easily" before he loves his epiphany. Color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty clear of its mountains and pollution-free air (can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, not to mention the mid-1940s?) And piano music is absolutely brilliant. MGM was certainly fond of creating such lyrical moments.
