The information in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have recently been paying attention to the news. Walter Reed's scandals show a small part that we are not doing a good job of taking care of injured heroes when they come back. <br /> <br /> What this movie still shows is the common truth of all wars. The psychological trauma suffered by soldiers during the war and the difficulties they have in returning to civilian life. They have not just changed or been affected, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with it because they do not know themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie, which the military is doing for our young men for women, to be able to make war, and the policies and practices they have to follow to blame war that leads to all psychological trauma. <br /> <br /> We have over 3000 dead soldiers in this invasion over four years. ; but we have many tens of thousands who suffer from a lifetime physical and psychological trauma due to this war. It doesn't matter which side you are in, you need to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in this business. This film perfectly illustrates the cost of men and women.
