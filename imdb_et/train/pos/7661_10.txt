Scanners II: The new procedure is as good as David Cronenberg's classic scanners, scanners were made in 1980 and scanners II in 1991, so the difference between the eleven years between the two films. The movie saves the style of the scanners, which is a good thing, it would not be scanners without a headache, so the scanners II have a head explosion scene that is terrible first. Scanners II: There is another imaginative gory scene on the new floor, well done. Scanner Scheme II: The New Scanner is a new series because scanners were used as a force for the police chief and research team until a young scanner named David Kellum discovers that he is used and decides scanners II: the new procedure is a great success for David Cronenberg's sci-fi classical scanners and it should be seen. Look at this. 10/10
