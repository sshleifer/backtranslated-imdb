Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with Gandhi, the winner of the academic award, back in 83. I did not know of any other work he had recently published on Cry Freedom, published in 1987. Although it may not be as popular as his Gandhi, it is all as pleasant, if not more, and appeared when South Africa was still not released from apartheid chains. Although most of the movies about social issues come out after the event, I think it appeared over time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real characters and events. The book that was based on the film was written by journalist Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who worked in South Africa until the end of the 1970s. It follows Woods' friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who has been perfectly designed by Denzel Washington. I can't imagine a better choice of role. Washington expresses the natural charm and the presence of the screen that Biko needs. <br /> <br /> While Woods was originally opposed to what he felt, Biko spread from black racism after he met a man, he couldn't help. their own struggles and ideas. The relationship between them is growing stronger and Woods and his family understand and become more sensitive to the situation of the people that Biko represents. <br /> <br /> Finally, tragedy and Woods must now focus on escaping from South Africa with his book so that he can publish it and let the outside world know what's going on. The other side of the movie is a thrilling story of his escaping from South Africa with his family and keeping you tenterhooks. <br /> <br /> There are also some tasty humorous dialogues. An example is a courtroom between Biko and a lawyer. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you promote violence? Biko: I'm in favor of confrontation. Lawyer: Well, isn't violence, Mr Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and we now have a confrontation, but I don't see any violence. <br /> <br /> But there are times that will bring you back to the horrors that passed through the country before the better idea prevailed. The scene where the army opens fire to schoolchildren protest is intestinal intake and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a must see. I suggest to those of you who do not know Attenborough's work take the time. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make life. I'd like every day to prefer the latter.
