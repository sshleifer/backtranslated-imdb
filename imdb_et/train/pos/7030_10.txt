We recorded it when it flew on television in 1995, and we have been waiting for all these years to release it. The kids are now teenagers and have to see this ba-zillion, but they still watch it with friends. This is a timeless complaint that reaches all age groups - like "fat". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is remarkable. Jason Alexander delights and miraculously illuminates his feet. I have noticed that other commentators on this site are quite tough for him, but our family gives him the best ratings. (We loved his "Giant Step" number.) Marc Kudisch (like Conrad) supplies us with comedy relief and great musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) just captures the show. Probably our favorite movie in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was Chynna Philip Kim's performance. Some of this is in writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. The deception that Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginable, incredible and just terrible. The director should have seen and improved it. Or never start him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture is wonderful and I recommend it to families of all ages.
