I've seen this movie many times and for my life I don't understand why some people compare it to BABE. This film is not the secret life of all the secret animals. Instead, it tells a parrot who learns to talk to his owner, a heavy daughter with a girl, to overcome his speech impediment only when he is separated from him in a heart-catching scene early. Then a big trip begins. Paulie Parrot is trying to find one of his great friends, Marie. <br /> <br /> He meets many great people and numerous nasty people. She falls in love with the girl's parrot and loses it. He gets into the life of a crime and then he is taken by a bad scientist who wants to use him. Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub kindly shines with Janitor, who has an open mind and a big heart and who decides to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the parrot's voice and one of the poor characters he lives over. also fun and see. It is a clever, clever, epic animal-adventure story, and ultimately a great love story of the castle and its little girls. She's looking for Marie ends with a rather unexpected surprise for most people who don't know much about Parrots. this film and the notion that birds, especially parrots, are not disposable pets. All children everywhere see that Pets make up their own deep attachments, and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be valued. </p> twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try to tear off the sad parts.
