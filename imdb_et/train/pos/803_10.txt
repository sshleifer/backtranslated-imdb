Like most of Star Wars being turned off: returning to the Jedi, who you may feel like a good movie, but as you saw on the video, they may end up with a Mi and they just end up with a party with no spirit or anything. before I say more when Ben obi-wan dies Imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and Yoda dies either of old age or internal disease But since Luke killed Darth Vader (real name: Anakin Skywalker) when they all end up when Luke or somebody stops the spirits Ben and Yoda stands staring at Him and smiles when another spirit appears, his Darth Vader, but not A Sith as the old plain he put down and started smiling with Ben and Yoda I think it did the film is a bit more interesting, but manufacturers or someone should take the spirit of Padme and Mace Windu and other Jedi killed in the Younglings Under There guns
