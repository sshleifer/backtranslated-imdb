Soapdish may fall as one of the least rated movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Stargate, unselfish, who understood exactly where the movie went and the roles they played in it. Although everyone pulled it up, there was no call. Kline showed smart and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to continue a funny conversation when someone else was talking, I can just go on. <br /> <br /> Don't pass this movie on!
