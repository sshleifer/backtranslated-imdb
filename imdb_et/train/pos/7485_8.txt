I had heard some good things about this movie and probably saw a low score in IMDb and that's why I avoided it. Today they showed on television Vanilla Sky and when I had nothing better to do ... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding something better to do. Vanilla Sky is a scary, sad, and moving film that is actually one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised how I was influenced by it. It is difficult to explain, but during the film there is a feeling of signs and perceptions that are happening in change and that is a rather emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me so it is very rare for a movie or this media. <br /> <br /> I really recommend watching this movie for everyone. Regardless of what you've heard about it.
