I have to say that the undying of Clive Barker is by far the best horror game ever made. I've been playing Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them have tried a clean clamor with which this game solves their terrible elements. Barker is good at what he does, which gives our world horror and shows that his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice is one of the main characters in the game. Full of lush visual images and enough atmosphere to slip the stick, Undying is the best horror title in my books. I just want it to have reached the console system, but unfortunately the PC sales tip was that it was bung.
