Liam Neeson depicts Scott's legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He's a real actor. He enchants the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is a wonderful wife of Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy a legend, but it's her passion that makes her love uncomfortable. They need each other. Tim Roth as Evil Cunningham is Perfect; in one way or another, watching a movie, you will find Cunningham's disgust. Scotland's landscape is beautiful. The time environment and conditions are well illustrated. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell the story as it should be said; no free violence. And you must listen carefully if you are not accustomed to the Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so good is that no actor or actor is glamorous; they are dirty and see unknowns in different scenes. It is their skill that attracts you, they do not rely on the names, popularity or gender symbol of the tents. This is something special.
