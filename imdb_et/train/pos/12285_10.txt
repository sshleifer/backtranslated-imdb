Brilliantly adapted the novel, which made the Chilean President Salvador Allende famous. The rich real estate environment that comes from the ruins, which becomes a force for abuse and exploitation of violence, is a luxury house that is useful for Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August. what at that time would be the process that led to his story of the greatest stigma of the stiffened Chilean people and whose main character would be Augusto Pinochet (Stephen's similarity is inevitable: recall, for example, the Senator's image in the dark glasses that make him public to enter the palace). <br /> <br /> Bille August is participating in the exceptionally cast Jeremy's protruding irons, the character of which is transformed by superb and extreme cruelty, a difficult lesson that life always brings us to force us to change. Esteban fully implements the resonance law with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words: "The things that freckles are the same punishment that serves you." The unforgettable Glenn Close plays a splint, Stephen's dirty sister whose sin, led by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love, was the wife of her brutal snowy brother. Meryl Streep was also a wonderful woman whose name came to her as Clara. With telecom forces, cognitive and mediocre, this hardened woman is loyal, character and self-control to her cumbersome and conservative spouse we want for herself and all people. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuosity (such as Blanca's worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo ...) or a portrait of humiliation, such as Stephen Jr, a senator's bastard child who acts as a tool to return boomerang. <br /> <br /> Film moves into the intestine, restored some facts that should never be repeated, but it happens absurdly (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and Immortalize Just Bille August.
