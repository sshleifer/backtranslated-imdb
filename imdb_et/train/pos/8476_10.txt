*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My father had recorded this movie when I was 3 years old. At the age of 5, I watched it over 400 times. I just looked at it and watched it. And I'm still doing today! It has a gloomy storyline, lamb kills a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf like her. After years of training, lamb is made in really gloomy weather. He and the wolf are driving their old fence, but he can't kill the sheep no matter how much he wants. She ends with killing a wolf, but she is no longer seen by sheep as sheep, and she can't get back to her previous lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Art is beautiful, songs are .. Well, okay, and voice action is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> All in all, you just see this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
