In 1930, this image was banned from American film houses due to the nudity of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann), which caused problems for women throughout the 1930s, but not so many men. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann, who marries an older man and is over the threshold at a wedding night and her husband does not marry or worry about any very small things like her shoes and bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to clarify her situation. On a hot summer day, Eva rides her horse and decides to swim in the woods by the naked lake. His horse runs down and runs after him and is followed by a young man who finds his clothes and returns them to Evale. These two people are very familiar and romance begins to bloom. There are many interesting problems when watching a movie until its end. Enjoy a great classic movie that was Shocker Film in 1933.
