I would like all the fans of this documentary to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm so proud of it. This mini-series, featured in VH1, is a great look at the drug culture over the last 30 years and my uncle has been working hard on it. The time and effort I looked at in this documentary and all this in a book (Can't Find My Way Home) is much better to watch on TV. I know he loves what he does, and he does it well. Her fiction has been shown in the interviews she made, and the amazing additions she adds to the commentary. From music to videos and everything, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of drug culture through the person who lived through it. I appreciate all the comments about who enjoyed it (or not) and would like to hear from the fans! Three joy to Uncle Martin !!!
