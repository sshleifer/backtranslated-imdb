I was delighted to see this movie at Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is probably a great screenwriter and I would like to see more of his films. If he could do what he did with the budget of this movie, I am very interested to see what he can do with the big picture. Tissue poured for those terrible performances (this little girl was gold) and who made the music. Twisted "Row Your Boat" blew me away. A very creative movie all over .... I hope to see it on video or DVD because I would buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
