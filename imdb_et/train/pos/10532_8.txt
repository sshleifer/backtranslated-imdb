Make the world away. Take it off my shoulder. Say the things you said earlier and make the world go. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in the marinade, one in the assimilation and the other in kissing the child. Neither of them was guilty, but was confronted with accusations and their homes to burst, they didn't get anything. The whole world, except their house, went away. <br /> <br /> It's kind of strange, but also funny. What would you do if you were alone in the world? Two friends just enjoy each other's company and do what they want. But it gets old fast, it seems. <br /> <br /> Then they begin to improve their lives by hating memories. The sound effects were great at that time. <br /> <br /> Things end at the end. This film was the result of great imagination and wrote and directed Vincenzo Natali with the help of two letters. You just have to see it.
