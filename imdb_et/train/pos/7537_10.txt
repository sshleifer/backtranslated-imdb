Unlike those who hate Christianity, 700 clubs offer real answers and inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments and a different view than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think. Unlike other programs that provide social and religious commentary, 700 clubs offer people in need, such as hungry feeding with the blessing of the operation, giving medical assistance to people living in communities affected by poverty and giving hope to those who need hope. It's not at all angry. When 700 clubs offend you, I recommend that you turn on the remote control and TV set. I do the same thing when I find programs for CNN Headline News or this topic that I think are biased or offensive. In my opinion, it is insulting that ABC Family adds a waiver of responsibility that 700 club views do not reflect the views of the ABC family.
