We keep it simple: my two kids were glued to this film. He has gaps in the adult's perspective, but buy some jelly and just enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The Pepsi girl was great! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh-darned hot, although he's not very much in the movie, so don't be too excited about it <br /> <br /> It's not really a bad thing, but just this kind of movie you only watch once. Don't buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (It was for fathers.)
