In 1933, this film had many cuts because it was the content of the story that prevailed and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) does something to achieve great wealth and power. Lily's father was forced to prostitute her daughter at the age of 14, and she grew up in the steel factory of the very poor, and her father ran a jazz that brought her all sorts of male characters with Lily in her home. As the story progresses, Lily meets a man with a man and finally finds a man who has everything and is the president of a playboy bank. It's great to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr), who was only 25 years old when this picture was produced and Jimmy couldn't even get started with Lily, not even for lunch. Very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) celebrates with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances. It's a great movie from 1933, produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, who for many years was guilty of being locked and just recently shown on a silver screen. This movie is quite easy compared to what we see on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933, watching this movie was very naughty. enjoy
