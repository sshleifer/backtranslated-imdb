Sometimes you need to look back. The 60s did just that. We must remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> Great mixture of Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to be named and won, the 60-year-old best mixer. <br /> <br /> Best mini series all the time. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Ursula <br /> <br />
