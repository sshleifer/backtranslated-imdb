This is my fourth Joe McDoakes, which I've seen and still have fun. Joe is studying for a record of Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros Studio (the company behind this series), he asks Jack Carson for instructions that both get confused. Then he meets the actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes) who speaks with his usual voice, which is not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and comes to the set where he automatically drives. I stop there and just say how funny I found the whole thing and was fascinated by the constellations of the movie that were close by. The last scene was particularly pleasing to this note, go to YouTube if you want to watch it be Picutres!
