I urgently need it on tape, not on DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have one nephew who is in an infantry but has not yet been placed, although he was going to Iraq soon after December 2008. I lost my beloved step in Ramad's Iraqi 09-15-05 unmanned missile in the green zone. I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring, as he has some ideal and romantic ideas about serving in the army as his older brother. My stepfather died after only 10 days in the country and never went to any mission, so my grandchildren have no chance of referring to the experience of this kind of documentary film about any personal experience that my now dead son could pass on. There is nothing I can do for those who are or are now missing, but I have one who has not raised his hand and has been sworn in YET. I want him to be so informed, no one else did it. <br /> <br /> Wants to help me with this. <br /> <br /> Movie Documentary The Earth's Truth is the best visual reference ever seen. I have to do something to my younger brother, what he's going to do before he gets late. But: (do not laugh) I have to see her first. He must actually see and hear these men and women, not just their ideas, but the truth about what they are, perhaps forever. Then he has an emotional decision to see my brother look at this movie and if he is, he can also watch his son, my younger sibling. Then my nephew can take it seriously. <br /> <br /> (((or is it once more shown on TV? if so, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> My problem, though, is that mother does it doesn't have a DVD player, it still uses video (is it right? with tapes?) So I have to find a way to watch this movie. Can I buy from anyone in this form? If not, is it another way for me to tape it? Is there a legitimate link I can download it to my computer and then transfer it to tape. If so, with whom I contact. I will be happy to pay the privilege if it is a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have an alternative idea, consider something you can recommend. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I have already lost one very valuable adored and loved one. I know my oldest nephew is never the same as he returns, and I can lose him too. I can't lose three and the emotional theme of all those who do it is too high a price to pay for every man in each generation's family. Please help me. I'll call you happily, send me a number if this is the best way to get the information you need. Thank you so much for the help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Yours sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
