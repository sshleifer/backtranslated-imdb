OK, I saw it in theaters when it came out and I don't know why. I haven't seen it, but I reached this page because I found myself over this movie - again I don't know why. But the fact that I remember it is talking about the volume. <br /> <br /> Comedy is hard - much harder than any drama. Doing it right, it seems easy, but wrong ... is there anything worse than bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you have fallen for some reason for this category. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done this to make me remember this movie. It's done at a fast pace, with a tongue in the cheek, and knowing it's not a Philedelphia story, it's amusing from beginning to end. Brain donors are another one that fits exactly into this category (sans most free gifts). <br /> <br /> One statement - the end. It seems that the writer / director had no idea how to finish the comedy. The end is trying to be a love story that undermines somewhat peculiar quick dialogue until then. Then there is a "tassle" scene. Because it has to be seen (male opinion), it is both up and down like a shock. One more rewrite was needed at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you don't try to cut it off and just let the bumps and delicate amusements get you, then you laugh, I guarantee it.
