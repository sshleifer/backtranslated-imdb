I don't know if I'm just strange, but I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Back by the Cabin by the lake is of course another of my favorite films Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. I also thought this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on filming Stanley's "Cabin by the Lake" scenario - it wasn't a superfluous movie, Stanley, who grabbed other girls and drowned them. - If you are looking for some deep meaning, this movie is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for fun for two hours, go ahead and watch it. I've been killing this movie for at least ten hours. :)
