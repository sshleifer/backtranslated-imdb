almost every review of what I saw was pretty bad. It's not quite bad, it's actually pretty good, though not big. The character of Judy Garland might have been irritating, but she didn't allow it. Somewhere along the line, I've become aging, overpopulated, Van Heflin's resurrection at least in the early 40s. Judy's song is great, but the film was a great opportunity if she didn't show her relationship anymore. I gave her 7.
