Everyone, my name may seem strange, but nothing was! Anyway, I've never seen anything like that before, so it was crazy! Of course this is good. It's a humorously interesting movie and my absolute favorite is always how they interact. Like a little chicken, the fish pretends to be King Kong and Runt Pig, saying, "Twas beauty, who killed the beast, war of the worlds and much more. The Walt Disney company has not lost its connection, perhaps not for that. Also, how did they do like watching a movie and it was like a home theater. <br /> <br /> But some parts don't fit. Like the original lion king, Timon and Pumbaa were not with Simba when he won Scar? They're not in this movie! they fought the back of the hyenas. What's more, the reason is why Pumbaa is not so sure that other animals have pushed him away and that is just Timon, Timon, Timon. Does anyone understand that only the story of Timon was spoken, while pumbaa had only setbacks? <br /> <br /> But besides that, it's great!
