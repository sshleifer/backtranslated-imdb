Jim McKay has made one of the best films you see all year round. The silent simplicity of this movie draws you from the open game and never lets you go. The whole movie has no false messages. None. Everything works. A handheld camera is never disturbing and always where it should be. The three young women whose lives we follow are always real. There is no victory in which the audience is reminded that we are watching actors who play a role. just real girls trying to find themselves. The political agenda is neither hidden nor otherwise. It is the most basic cinema, and although it is only seen by a few filmmakers, it deserves much wider release. special hats for Hugh Hefner to give filmmakers the money they need to get this important movie. I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay is doing.
