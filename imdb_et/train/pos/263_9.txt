It was a strong Poirot / Suchet, a television mystery choice. The characters were vivid and well-functioning. The plot and the main unit - the student hostel - were excellent. Japp was nothing special, but for me this story was not disturbed. One important point, many of Poirot's observers do not know good action or good characterization. I also think they are rather harsh in some Poirot's secrets. Finally, I've read some of Christie's novels - not in recent years - and I find it annoying that so many viewers have changed the novel. Please, viewers, think about what is presented to you in the movie, not what you think should be there. This means that Poirot's mysteries are of different quality, but not as much as you think reviewers and assessors would think. The few exceptions to the five small pigs that were a fabulous plot, character and theme, the longer Poirot's films are not so good or bad. Because I've seen all the longest Poirot / Suchet films. Finally, Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp's films are neither good nor bad due to their absence. However, the presence is either controversial (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant to Hastings. The lemon is in the middle.
