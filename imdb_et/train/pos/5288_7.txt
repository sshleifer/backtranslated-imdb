This amusing Bugs Bunny caricature looks like a green dog not yet named Mars and Martian smile K-9. <br /> <br /> Instead of trying to destroy Earth, Marvin's mission is to land, defeat the Earth's creature and take it back to Mars. Of course, he he chooses, Bugs Bunny. At first, Bugs thinks Marvin and K-9 are a trick or treat, but realizes that it can't be right if Marvin significantly increases Bug's rabbit hole with ray-gun. Bugs tries to trick out their situation in a couple of ways, including convincing Marvin that K-9 is planning a rebellion. Finally, he is caught using the Acme Strait Jacket, which releases the bazooka. Amazingly, Acme does this in an advertised form, and Bug is forced to use his mindset to get K-9 to release him, the tables are soon reversed, and two peaceful mars are put on and Bugs is trying to fly back to his plate. is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. The voice of Marvin has changed a little here and he becomes angry with the visible emotion, but it didn't change me as he or his comic.
