I really like what I've seen so far in this comic. Of course, animation is not the best, but to be honest I can see that this type of comic style would be faster and cheaper than the old and stylish style that happened quickly and cheaply (which started to happen more and more often - it's just a style that looks good, when a lot of time and effort is put). There is nothing wrong with corner lines and small black eyes - I think it's really cute. As a child, I had never thought that Scooby-Doo's design was particularly divine, but I think I could know it better. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character and I believe it or not, but I think he has the greatest potential for the deepest potential. Of course, this exhibition doesn't focus on the original "Mystery Solving" theme, but it was still a tired old formula. Don't Do Me Wrong - I'm Sure to Have Writers Who Can Mystery Inc. The traditional interests (which have been so late) are much more interesting, but in the meantime the exhibition is a fun deviation from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny but not just comic relief. They are still cowards, but eventually they have the opportunity to use (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old over-the-counter slackers as ever, but now they seem to start using their lives with Uncle Albert's legacy. <br /> <br /> I found the most original Scooby-Doo jokes to be pure cheese and at best inadvertently fun, but this show really deals with real humor. I also don't really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor doesn't mind me as much as he does to other people. (I still think Billy West was the best) <br /> <br /> In general, though not all comic history, it is still not an achievement among other Scooby incarnations.
