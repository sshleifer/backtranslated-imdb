After traveling home to the movie, I worshiped the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre danced. I've heard it before - where? Ah, Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (lane 2), "I got it just as I reached the door." Dimitri Shostakovich's "Waltz No. 2 Jazz Suite No. 2" presented by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Prague City. and I got the soundtrack to the tower. What cures! The result of Alexandre Desplat's film was full - there are 15 tracks next to twenty tracks. Often we don't get a sound dedicated to a complete movie spot these days. Reminds me of Maurice Jarre's favorite products by Ennio Morricone (Track 6 start marks include "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue, and John Barry. Strings, notes of Strings, Celeste, Piano and Harp are fine. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro reliably offered a couple of performance Love story, their intimate relationship is very much between Alexandre and Natalia - her childish but torturing inner world, and her generous and courageous understanding of her - relationship alone with both of them. Director Marleen Gorris "Antonia Lin About e "(1996 Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film from Holland) gave us a silently sensitive film - not without confusing human conflicts, intrigues, obsession, family aspirations, love and respect. The foreground theme is chess thinking and mathematical logic. It can be a light tear of drama set in the late 1920s. Cinematography records the peaceful beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> I recommend sound if you don't know the movies. The lyrical film "Luzhin Defense" by Alexandre Desplat is over.
