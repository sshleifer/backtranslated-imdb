People forget that there have been several King Kong ripoffs in Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they're all hanging on each other, but YETI stands alone. It borrows only one element from King Kong and it is an animal attraction for one female. <br /> <br /> The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archaeologists are fascinated by the fact that they existed at once, but there is no scientific evidence to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it's worth it. For the first time in the early 1980s, I watched it "Elvira for the lover of blind exhibitions". It sent chills to my child, especially when YETI became crazy. I saw it again at about 1:00 AM ABC about 2 to 3 years ago. Seeing it again made me more appreciative, has some general good results (for that time) and the story is covered by the mutilated boy and his dog and the evil businessman who wants to kill YETI for his own purposes. Music is also pretty cool, very pleasant. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Jetmen create a big monster like the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and 10 out of 10.
