I'm not saying I'm a fan of Ralph Bakshi because I'm not. I've been watching 5 of his animated films so far: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz, Cat's Cat and Lord and finally "Fire and Ice". What I say is that I found "Fire and Ice" the most enjoyable batch. It is a simple fantasy story of swords and sorcery, such as Conan Barbarid, but a beautiful work of art, realistic animation and a lively movie spot give this film a very classic charm. <br /> <br /> The first thing to mention is whether the animation itself. I don't care what people say about rotoscoping, but I think Ralph Bakshi used this technique very effectively here. I was surprised when the real movements of the characters were. The style of leadership and the photorealistic character "Fire and Ice" feel like a big budget fantasy field rather than a comic strip. Unfortunately, the level of artistic detail is inconsistent, especially at the end of the film. Some scenes only see really flat, body contour details or fabric folds and shades. <br /> <br /> Realistic action with real moving characters naturally follows. Not only was the activity choreographic, but it was really cruel. I would be so brave to compare the brutality of action with live movies like Zack Snyder 300. However, I note that although blood was broken, minimal blood cleavage was kept. What's more, the creative team's great choice, which only enhances the viewing experience, does not take things too "over". <br /> <br /> Although I no longer admit "big names", voice participants manage to perform satisfactorily; considering each row realistically modest and only for obstructing the sons by preventing it. <br /> <br /> Did I say bad guys? yes i did. Because it is this story, a standard story of good and evil. Something truly original story that seems to be just blends of existing fantasy film clich√©s that include little-covered warriors and maidens. Anyone looking for "depth" would be very disappointed. These signs are not being developed much, and some of them, such as Nekron and Darkwolf, are at best one-dimensional (but I heard some obscure scenes explaining Darkwolf's obsession with the killing of Nekron and his mother. The scenes deserved full restoration and should make a final cut to add depth to the show level). Actually, I wouldn't be surprised to know that the whole movie was just a "technical demo" to showcase the fantastic animation and art where the story came together and thrown as a follow-up to pass it on. the right movie. <br /> <br /> The true classic of the past era, "Fire and Ice", really captures the spirit of relaxing adventure and mysticism with fantastic creatures and charming characters. It is a unique vision of the world created by Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Frazetta, who have a good measure and relationship. <br /> <br /> Could it keep up with today's animated movie standards? Definitely not. But I generally encourage animation fans to "go out of their horses" and give this simple but beautiful movie a chance to grow. It's really an 80's pearl that you should look at.
