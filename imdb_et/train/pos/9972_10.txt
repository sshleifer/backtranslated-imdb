This is certainly an appropriate update to the original, except that "the left side is now to the right." Like the original, this film coincides with a federal government that transcends its boundaries with personal freedom. This is a warning about how weak our political freedoms are in the superfluous and superpowering era of the federal government. Kowalski acts as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, along with the mainstream media, turned around words such as "white domination" and "right-wing extremists", as well as major drug taxes to reduce its most important "citizens' rights, the general population's consent. This message is so non-PC, I'm surprised that this movie can be done - at least not without the federal government through the IRS against the makers like they did Juanita Broderick, Katherine Prudhomme, the Western press center and countless others who dared to talk. (some) message from this movie. <br /> <br />
