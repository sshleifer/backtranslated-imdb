Do we really do "video nasties"? With 8MM in the shadow of large-scale digital wide-screen transactions, this is quite a ride. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much story and sometimes it becomes a travel book when our heroine searches for the divisions of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am rather dirty about "lost" scenes, including everything, hot wax, harsh whipping and harsh sex drowning, burning and some. These scenes are impeccable and unfortunate that Bruno and his budget are unable to transform all kinds of creatures of substance into mere cartoons.
