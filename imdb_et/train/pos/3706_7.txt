The biggest surprise of this film was the performance by Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing stereotypical ditzy blonde roles, he usually plays a street-wise, intelligent, world-tired character. She has no great role to play, but she does a good job of depicting Lois Harlan as a woman who is tired, though accustomed to covering her boss's indiscretions.
