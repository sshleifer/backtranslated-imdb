Director Sam Fuller has something religious, especially in Europe. Yet most of his films are more than forgotten. However, he directed one very horrible movie "Pickup on South Street". The following films were much lower at the beginning of their career. <br /> <br /> "Pickup" works from the first to last frames at all levels. It's filmed with flawless fluidity, boasting great performances. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both players with excellent top performances, are top-notch. Widmark, who was not a stranger when he played a crook, though in fact a core, still manages to uncover the slightest humanity that makes his character exciting and makes Jean Peter's character even more reliable for him. <br /> <br>> Fuller has no strokes in this really tough movie. There is a scene where Jean Peters gets tempered by Widmark. It's really shocking. This is not a case of choreographic photography. <br /> <br /> Less self-conscious than many of the movie's twins, a great example of this genre.
