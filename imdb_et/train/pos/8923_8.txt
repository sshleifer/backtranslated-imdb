Blob is a classic 1950s B-film sci-fi flick. You probably know this story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see the meteorite on the ground, and when they search for it, they get into the old man who is strangely attached to his hand. They bring him to the doctor and then find out what happened. From there spreads the stain, eats all its way. Special effects are fun, as is the story. There are many great touches like a police officer playing chess with another police officer on the radio. It's not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10
