Penny Princess is the heir to the small kingdom of the American working girl Yolande Donlon, located in the triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet with Lampidoro. It seems that Lampidorrans owes debts across Europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to this geography. An American multi-millionaire buys a place but dies before he gets a title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> Of course, the estate must pass the will in America and what are the Lampidorranss? Especially after Donlan, who has now become a princess, has banned smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is in the Swiss cheese industry. Lampidorrans seems to have some kind of cheese they play like Schmeeze. Schmeeze solves some problems on the road as well as between Donlan and Bogarde, both financial, geopolitical and romantic. <br /> <br /> How Schmeeze works, it's a movie trick. But here's a hint. Lover Come Backis could just get Jack Kruschen out of Schmeeze's secret when he was captured by VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Penny Princess is a British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon plays again the role Marilyn Monroe would have played if the film had been made into a pond for this pond. At the beginning of his career, Dirk Bogarde was a romantic heart that was before someone else, but he suspected he had acting pieces. <br /> <br /> This movie was unfortunately shown at 3pm in TCM. But at least I found a reason why I am grateful for insomnia.
