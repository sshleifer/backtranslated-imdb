Higher and higher was one of Rodgers & Hart's smaller Broadway musicians, and in 1940 there were only 84 shows in Broadway. Nonetheless, it gave one of the biggest hits he never had in my mind. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, with the exception of one minor Song, so avidly rich, the entire Broadway score was demolished when RKO bought movie rights. Instead, a brand new score for Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson was written, mainly to accommodate one Francis Albert Sinatra who made his film debut. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, who had made some songs in previous films, takes her singing rival from the Bing Crosby page. When Bing made his feature film The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took the role of Frank Sinatra and I don't think of anyone who could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The Chairman of the Board will pay the third place Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. She's a butcher and she's a boyfriend of Leon Errol. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who has not paid for his aid for seven months. Mainly because he goes up to Chapter 11 or informs staff. <br /> <br /> Errol is a pleasant old soul who works and no worker wants to lose good. They combine their resources and send Michele Morgan to invite Errol's daughter, who is in Switzerland with her mother. The idea is to grab a rich bankruptcy in hopes that will save the family's happiness. Only Michele will look at the other. <br /> <br /> This is a light plot and definitely no worse than whole music, but RKO invested in this movie with good players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play some other dud and her mother, who suspects nothing is wrong, Victor Borge is a fortune that doesn't look for an account, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes are playing other Errol household workers. Not a bad bunch at all. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads, all of which had some commercial success, music stopped, a lovely way to spend the evening, and I couldn't sleep last night. The latter was the best song for the Oscar, but lost to Alice Faye You never know. <br /> <br /> 1943 was a musical union strike year against the recording industry. To get the material out, Frank Sinatra recorded a higher and higher song with acapella choir at Columbia. Bing Crosby also recorded Dixie from his movie in the same way for Decca. Both were proclaimed by occupation president James C. Petrillo as captors, and both did not cross the line again. The strike did not fully survive until 1944, although Decca broke earlier from other record companies earlier and lived earlier than Columbia, RCA Victor and others. <br /> <br /> The strike gave Sinatra some moments. He had just left Tommy Dorsey's orchestra when the strike was called. He closed the place he needed for his artistic position when he was unsure whether Dorsey's departure would prove to be the right career. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the higher and the higher got well and the legend was launched.
