WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs MVP in Inferno: So this is the fourth race in WWE and Kane vs MVP why it was the first card on the map). I only looked at the end parts where Kane fires the MVP ass when they are on the apron and then MVP runs around when screaming? Finally, the refs put out a fire extinguisher to extinguish the fire, as the MVP explodes around the ramp. Funny and visually quite fun ending. WWE Tag Team Championship: It was originally intended to be William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c) in a regular tagging team match. But GM Teddy Long comes out and says it will be a deadly four-five tag crew ladder match. MNM and The Hardys are thrown away and that's all chaos. One word that describes this opener? wow. Man, I don't really remember how many sick places in this game were and the words can't do it right. There was a particularly remarkable place where Hardys saw the ladder in sight and Jeff jumped up the rope when Matt had to kill the MNM and then WHAM! Nitro blew away, while Mercury apparently showed it and bleed like hell and face on his face. He had to take off and Nitro continued the game alone. The second place was when Jeff began to split London when he was kicked off the ladder. Some too many breathtaking breaths were too much to remember. Finally, London breaks the belts to win this rave show-stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Boogeyman vs Miz: Two men are thrown round and round until Boogeyman explodes the power of sitting power for victory, and then throws worms over Mizi's mouth as usual. 5.5 / 10 for this 3-minute incognito. <br /> <br /> United States Championship: Chris Benoit (c) stands in front of Chavo Guerrero in yet another typical Guerrero match. Some good places included the superplex of Chavo's top rope and the Benoit's unusually long chain of German suplexes. Vicki Guerrero comes with a seat belt to Benoit's nails, but Benoit scares him and takes a long time to decide whether to put him in Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to roll, but Benoit rolls it again and Chavo is locked in Sharpshooter. Game over. Nice tough fight, though slow from time to time. WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for that, at a rather moderate pace. Were good flying spots in the competition? especially Helms moving out of the top rope? but the crowd didn't seem to be after the ladder was seen, and Yang needed more air. Helms won the game after he burned Yang on his knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Undertaker vs Mr. Kennedy on the Last Lane: After a series of games between the two, this time the last bike game, the second one, and the winner must listen to his opponent's arena. Pretty good, these two could offer. Kennedy handled much of Taker and even broke freely in the chokeslam to throw the Takerer out of Armageddon, which was about 15 feet below; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been brutal. Kennedy was almost victorious until Taker got back inside the bat (I liked the camera's view in the throat). Then Taker stayed in Kenned's steel tube and instead broke the window of celebrities, but then cut off Kennedy with a chair and followed another chokeslam and tomb roof. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker won him out for racing. In fact, I was interested in these boys' willingness to take / give real sick pictures. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa is around, I'm going "what the hell?" like many crowd kids and then the word "lingerie contest" comes into my ear. Rest time. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena vs. Finlay & King Booker: Talk about charisma and technicality. In fact, this competition was a pretty good main event that risen rationally from one team to another and maintained a good mid-term review. Even Finlay got some legitimate shots for his opponents this time (I doubted his strength against the masters) and he and Booker couldn't cheat on him? except for one point where Booker pulled out his skeptic Price kurk. Batista hits Bomb's Booker to win, not seen by F-U; Price made 5 Knuckle Shuffle in any case and I think he did the STFU. This was probably the best technical match of the evening, and the participants did what they did without the ladder. 7.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> Having been a WWE fan, we must agree that Armageddon was built with numerous eye-catchers and the ladder party finally won half the show; Last Ride played some more nervous places and the main event was very good for its category as well. All other competitions also lived in their own settlements, except perhaps the Boogeyman and The Mizi competitions and the continually useless lingerie contest. In general, Armageddon was a very pleasant payback and, despite some major setbacks in the history of the PPV, Armageddon wishes to say goodbye to him this year. PPV rating: 8/10
