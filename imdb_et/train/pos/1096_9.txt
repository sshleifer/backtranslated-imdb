I saw this movie for the first time in the mid-1980s in the movie scene. After several subsequent views (and buying a video), it still laughs loudly. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a second-age remnant - a domestic comedy set in wealthy middle classes in America - but well done is well done. But it is also a document of its age - a sign of post-war optimism, baby boom and emerging consumer time. This film is not "guilty" of joy. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful complicated leader positions - urbane Melvyn Douglas; confused Cary Grant; Dirty Myrna Loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "That means we have a blast" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little soy". <br /> <br /> Love it.
