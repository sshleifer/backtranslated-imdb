Chris and Andre have two average, ordinary teenagers. Some have misunderstood it and others have chosen it. But they stand together and all pay. Together they form the "Two Armies". They schematize and plan a zero day. This day is when they decide to rush their high school and inevitably kill 14 people with cold blood. Through the tapes it was said that they made a zero day, a barely fictitious Colombian tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero day" is one of those movies that will be confused with your head after a while. The two main parties (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) are doing so well that their characters seem to be almost every unfair earned street. Their performances were very plausible, you liked these guys and it was scary. In the video clip almost entirely from the teenager's perspective, "Zero Day" seems very real and authentic, as you are there. These children try to rationalize their activities to the viewer and the actors sell it to you. But be warned that it will follow the tragedy from start to finish and end for some for shocking and restless.
