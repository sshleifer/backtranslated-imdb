What's good about this is: some resourceful and really creepy little effects that get even under the skin of the most experienced horror blowers. Not talking about hackneyed soundtrack stabs in your "gotcha" moments. Even if you've seen everything, there are a few more things in this movie that will make your jaw fall. <br /> <br /> What better way to do this: the action was somewhat flat and convincing. It was "video-video-quality" in some places (although it mostly came to the atmosphere it was trying to achieve) and the camera's work is full of unnecessary close-ups of meaningless activities. Although the effects are really horrible, I think they've been doing too many times for some of them. The end seemed to hurry and went beyond what might have been more influential moments. The viewer has left to find out many things, not the challenge of filmmakers, but because they just left it behind. <br /> <br /> However, a good little indie horror movie is easily several steps higher than average. It is worth renting.
