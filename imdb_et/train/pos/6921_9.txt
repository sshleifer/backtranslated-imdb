Remember that I'm a fan of the genre, but I've seen this movie for the first time. The way I have ignored it all the time is a miracle to me. For me, this is a better film, a lot of praise for "High Evening". It is a great west with a great example and a great story. The DVD is beautiful with black and white and excellent cinematography. If you like Western or James Stewart, you can't miss this movie.
