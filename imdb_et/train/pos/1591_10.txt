My mother and I have just recently been addicted to this show laughing at our butts! I've only seen about 10 episodes and I'm disappointed that I didn't pay attention to this fun series before they were canceled! The story is very funny, the characters have very big personalities (or not so big, but they're still funny!). I TiVO for every episode you like. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all cast, will not leave me forever! There are some inappropriate languages ​​for children and some sexual content, but you shouldn't have too many problems near a parent. There is a type of "friends" that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
