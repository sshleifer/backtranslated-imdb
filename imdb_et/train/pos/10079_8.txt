I liked Chinese cinematographic entertainment in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man, although he has no living children. The faces of the actors are admirable. The story shows children 's dedication and gratitude to those who treat them well and their longing to treat well. The movie's operas remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more complicated and complicated. The story here reminds me of Dickens' story of the days when the children were quarreling. The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me, but it takes time to see the heroism, humanity and the history that was portrayed.
