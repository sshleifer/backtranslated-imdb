This movie is well done on so many levels that I'm scary that the score is just as low (5.9 / 10 (576 votes)). This movie has incredible special effects, a true epic story, a challenging great character interaction and desperate battles - they must be seen as credible! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version I got (some lines have not been translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I do not understand when I read and hear from different sources "This is a confusing plot ....", "I couldn't follow the story ...." or "The signs came somewhere ..." . From the first time I watched this movie, I understood it, followed it, knew why the characters were there, and I loved it completely! I've been following it 8 times and every time it's pure pleasure. Oh, and that's not just my opinion, because I've shown this movie to many Americans (people who have never seen a HK movie) who know the same. None of them was able to follow the story, and every person declared his love for that film. Oh, man, why can't we get things out of Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings had a nice marriage with special effects, character development and storyline. <br /> <br /> It does not come from the Asian film lover. I own an extensive library of Asian films and I have to say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. When you look at it, this movie's amazing special effect and epic feel blows. You are being taken in this fantasy world and you do not want to leave! I've seen both the 1983 version and 2001 (both made by Tsui Hark) and 2001 is a lot better than the IMO. I didn't want it to end .... I beg you Mr Harki - do we have a sequel?
