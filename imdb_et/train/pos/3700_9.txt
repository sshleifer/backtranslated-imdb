Cameron Grant is one of the best directors of adult films. His only rival is Andrew Blake. Celeste is a dynamite throughout the film, but the DR's office sequence with her and the other two ladies is simply incredible. Almost as good is the performance of Asia Carrera with a construction worker. I recommend this movie very well and gave it to 9. It is almost as good as the Cameron Grant ELEMENTs I gave to 10.
