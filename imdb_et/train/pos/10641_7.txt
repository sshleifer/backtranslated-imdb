This dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick, it is not going to win prizes and its not very original but it offers goods you want to see from dolph lundgren movie. Our man dolph is a former soldier who is now a teacher in a tough downtown high school and when he gets terrorists into his own hands to save the day. sure that the script does not win any Oscare for its fun and has an honest sharing eplosive. dolph lundgren gives a good result, but it gets more active in the more active scenes and the rest is not the best actors, but they keep it well. at all, detention is an enjoyable activity, but you saw it a million times earlier.
