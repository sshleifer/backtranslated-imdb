This movie surprised me. Some things were "clich√©s", and some of the technological elements reminded me of the movie "enemy of the country", starring Will Smith. But mostly it is a very fun and good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and 2 wannabe hits with Julio and Ramundo (offering comics). This is a movie that can be viewed again, saying ... on some Wednesday night, if nothing else. I gave her entertainment value 9.
