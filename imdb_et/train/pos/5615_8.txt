Kafkaas alienation and paranoia thriller. Extremely well done and Polanski plays well when it is a widespread introvert that is trying to adapt to its dingy Parisian accommodations and fellow citizens. A frightening early apparent average and self-obsessed companion tenant and frightening later when he develops his defenses, which is ultimately his withdrawal. Personally, I could have done without the cross-sectional element, but I agree with Psychole's descent and having some logic in the light of events. However, he could have worked without it and would have wanted to remove a little bit of the theater element, but then maybe it was meant because the courtyard seems to be the appearance of the theater. I can't feel there are more than some of the director's own feelings that they are not "real" French and Jews. However, there is still much to enjoy here, including the excellent looks of the excellent-looking Isabelle Adjani and the good old Shelly Winters are just as reliable as ever.
