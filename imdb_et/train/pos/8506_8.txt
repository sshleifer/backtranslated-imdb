. . But it was on the UHF channel and the reception was very cloudy. I'd really like to have a movie because because I was watching it for the first time, I'm a bus driver and when I saw that movie, I drove on that bus. Only (about 15 years later during the murder proceedings) do I remember that the EU was one of the stars. I only remember that he was the driver and was fired and driven wildly. I've been looking for this movie all over because I watch it in the mid-80s. I liked the movie, I don't usually look at the thrillers, but after reading the summary of the TV guide and watching it start (though fuzzy) I missed the whole thing.
