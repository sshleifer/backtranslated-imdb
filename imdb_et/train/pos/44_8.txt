When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another chick. I was wrong. This movie sends a strong message to others. I was deeply moved. I have been recommended by anyone I have met. No one has come back saying it was bad. Busy, he also played his role in this film. I don't know much about my actor career, but wow, how he pulled the end of it, was great. <br /> <br /> At first it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital ... wow, the movie lives again. I have no idea why this movie hasn't been told in the film world. I would like this film to be released again and advertised more ... because it sends a strong message for just one and a half hours.
