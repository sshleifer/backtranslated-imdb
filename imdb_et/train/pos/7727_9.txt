FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF movie in the gold of the SF movie and it makes it a great movie that is the idea of ​​this miracle. As soon as the spacecraft lands the audience - through the crew of ships - it travels through a smart and sometimes terrible adventure. We meet an unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair, and we learn to know the former inhabitants of the planet - Krell, who died overnight. Or did they? <br /> <br /> You can nip and say that the planet is clearly filmed in a film studio with a painted background, but it adds a sense of claustraphobia to the danger I feel and electronic music from Bebe and Louis Barron adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I'm shocked that this movie is not on the top 250 IMDB movie.
