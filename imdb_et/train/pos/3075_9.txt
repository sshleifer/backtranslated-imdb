A great film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such a big actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks at a part of the neurotic sex object, but doesn't have to scream at the level of the script he requires. But he is such a good actor that he played to the stage for performing. I very much praise Tracey Ullman for casting a neglected woman. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character higher (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Macy is the only situation where her character cannot be careful, there is nothing full of mastery.
