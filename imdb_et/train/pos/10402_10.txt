I first saw Thief as a child that makes me almost as old as Jinn. Like any child, I would be delighted with the imagination, ingenuity and energy of the film. Several years later I realized how much of this script I was watching for the first time was not. I've never been able to see it in the intervening years. In addition to the script, production exceeds the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the storyteller to the right. If you see Thief as a child, you know you have a great time. If you see Thee as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It's as timeless as the story he treats. Amazing work. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
