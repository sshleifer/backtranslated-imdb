The United States was still fighting World War II (the film appeared between VE Day and VJ Day). Every studio worth the salt made either fighting films where fearless American soldiers won the enemy or the Americans generally sang and danced. Technicolor Musicals was what flourished in America on depressing days when everything was rationalized. Most of the day's musicals were just a number of musical numbers that were put together with the best possible plot that slipped to fill the next musical number! I now feel that people who watch this movie are all born after 1970. How fast we forget is frustrating. <br /> <br /> This movie can be called "Jose Iturb's Search", but now everyone is wondering why. Let me explain. From 1929 - his arrival in America - Iturb was until his death in 1980 one of the best pianists who respected the stage of the concert. He agreed to make some movies in 1942, but Hollywood had been with him for almost ten years. Not only a great pianist, but also a successful conductor, Iturb was home to more than 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene where Iturb and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's raps was planned early - and has anyone ever noticed that other pianists were all children? Joe Pasternak, who produced this film and many other MGM musicals, credited Iturb with classical American youth. Grayson, who wants to listen to the movie Iturb, was not different from real life. Everyone wanted Iturb back then. It was a joke among the soldiers that "GI" meant "Get Iturb" (he made many concerts in military bases). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a great dancer and a great singer of Frank Sinatra, but at the time of making this film, Sinatra was barely 30 years old and was only signed with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already known as a dancer, but Iturb had been a global feeling for 20+ years. <br /> <br /> And when there was no plot, the Americans didn't need the plot. They were tired of the war, they were afraid of their loved ones and worried about the future. They needed happiness and hope and the certainty that things would end well. They needed music and smiles and joy and romance. This movie and other similar movies just did what they needed. <br /> <br /> Enough lecture. Dancing the mouse aside, the best scene of the film takes place between Sinatra and Iturb, and each of them "unconsciously" complicates the music of another. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Jose Iturb, a Spaniard who conquered more America than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon, please drag on my website www.joseiturbi.com, where you'll find a plot summary, extracts from the movie day a "day" overview of this and other MGM images.
