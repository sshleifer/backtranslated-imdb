When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew it wasn't an entertainment movie. Instead, I thought of it as a lack of confidence in a reality where someone gets serious beating. And you know what it did. Kurt Russel did what I was, playing a significant role in showing the emotional soldier. I recommend this film as boys and want to watch a good action film.
