I've always liked John Frankenheimer's film. Elmore Leonard's good script and the main reason why it wasn't just another thriller is Frankenheimer. His tight direction and attention to small details all make a difference, he even hired a porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make the case that his last good movie Roy Scheider did. I've always said that Robert Trebor was just a terrible result. Clarence Williams III got the public out of her fright, and she's also great, but I thought Trebor was excelled. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this movie as others, but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors appear in foolish parts. What can you say about a film in which Ann Margaret is under the influence of drugs and rape? Innocent pleasure to say at least. Vanity has a real sloppy role and very young Kelly Preston looks out early. A classic exploitative thriller that shouldn't be forgotten.
