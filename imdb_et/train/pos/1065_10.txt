Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, focusing on a genetically enhanced young woman (Jessica Alba) from her creators. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel universe is absorbing (not as much as saying Buffy, but still swallows) with interesting and incredible characters. Certainly not for everyone, but those who give it will find themselves looking at one of the most enjoyable series. Dark Angel has been neglected and underestimated by the offender and was withdrawn after the 2-series cancellation. What was a great shame, because it had the potential to become a big series, though its 42 episodes have only ten shy BBC sci-fi comedies Red Dwarf. As it is Dark Angel, it is unfinished, so look for it and if you want more, fox for the second series.
