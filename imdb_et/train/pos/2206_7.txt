Do not believe that all the negative reviews of this movie will get. Yes, it's cheap to do. Yes, gore is ridiculous. And yes, acting is sub-par. But this is a textbook example of an early slip flick, and if it's your "thing" (its mine!), Then you'll enjoy it. There are enough good aspects for this film to compensate for the shortcomings. One, the result of the unknown Christopher Young is very scary and emphasizes the violence completely. The end is a welcome break from the expected good ends of most movies. And last but not least, this is the provision that made the film for me. The makers of this film could have done a much better job of "dressing" to make this college dormitory more credible. But if you forget this mistake, the device is great. Four colleges alone in a large abandoned, condemned building waiting for the fall. Looking, let your imagination work and you can enjoy this movie as much as I did.
