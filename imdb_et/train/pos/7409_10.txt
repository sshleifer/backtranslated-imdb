Waiting for you to see a "cute little movie" from mainland China, I was poorly prepared. Family dynamics, the community, and the inevitability of change have rarely been so thoroughly studied in the film. Every sign is sure, and I was a complete story. The organization is much more complicated than the American audience is used to. However, there is no difficulty even after reading the subtitles after the progression. Jiang Wu, like a braked brother, is a constant bright light. Leave your cynic in your closet. This is where you check out.
