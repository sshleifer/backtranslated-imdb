One of my favorite "domestic" movies. I don't know if there is anyone in our country who hasn't seen this movie! It's funny and sad at some moments ... I don't know how people around the world (who had the opportunity to watch it) accept this movie because you need to know some moments in our Serbian history and Serbs in the first half of the 20th century to understand it! But as I see here, there is someone from Canada who watched it ... and liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I'm trying to put all the good quotes on the movie on this site, but first you can learn how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Hello.
