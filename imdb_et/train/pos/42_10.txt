The busy Phillips put one comma and dramatic performance in hell. Erika Christensen was good but busy stole the show. It was a nice touch after The Smokers, a film that was captured, wasn't that big. If you don't get a name for this movie, it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, look at the home room.
