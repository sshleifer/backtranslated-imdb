LOL !!! delirious was so funny. I was in tears. The impressions of Eddie Murphys are absolutely on the ground. The best impression was James Brown and Mr. T> SO FUNNY !! Her strange how Eddie Murphy was at that time and how she is now DELIRIOUS must see, but if u don't like a flawless language, don't look like AMAZING AND so FUNNY .. I've seen it 6/7 times and still pissima every time .. This is Eddie Murphy's main and you see where he got humor and ideas about movies, like a nut professor. He also makes the impressions of his family, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> when I was just there ...
