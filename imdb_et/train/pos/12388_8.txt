I have read the book and I have to say that this film is still in shape. I think this is the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same psychological genre. Cristina Raines gives an excellent result as the leader and Burgess Meredith give an excellent support to the neighbor. I've seen this movie at least twice, and I think I'll buy both my book and my movie. The thrill keeps climbing to the end, a twist you never see. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, Sentinel is a classic premiere. It is also interesting that the participants of the film would not know them if you did not read the credit. The late Jerry Orbach is great as a business manager and Jeff Goldblum is a great photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, who is undervalued but excellent.
