When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was dragging this movie, my expectations for watching the whole movie were low. The only reason I gave him the opportunity was the excellent Julie Walters and friend's recommendation. insightful comedy. Pasdar is a completely believable and empathic businessman who has to release his wife's part at times by baptism. It communicates these needs to the audience in a credible way. Julie Walters is great, her habit is a possessor who teaches her unconditional love.
