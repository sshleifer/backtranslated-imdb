I saw it 25 years ago in PBS. It was very difficult to see. So real. To look at this small family struggle in winter, the heart was breaking. No time to judge: Fate has turned us around and we put our shoulders on the grinding stone and make it work. It was based on the woman's actual diary, which I read several years later. He said in his diary that his parents died when he was little, and all their woes and sisters had to work on the farm. He learned to mow what was not a bitch. She was afraid that no prince would be charming wouldn't want a woman with sunshine, harsh hands, but that wife was so happy that her new wife knew how to mow, and she was happy to do it. Both were widows and they worked together to build a new home. It was so sad when the child died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would have been good. It only makes the tragedy very sad. I cried so hard. But then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is on its way and life goes on. In her diary she had two more boys and they lived.
