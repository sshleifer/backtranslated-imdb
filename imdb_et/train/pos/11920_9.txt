Christopher Lloyd is funny and really believable as "Al the Angel". This film is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that were not on the first and much better on the plot and writing. <br /> <br /> OK - it was written for kids, but adults are as fun as kids. Tony Danza is doing a very real job - but it is not a taxi meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good, and even his emotions seem very human and show some real change for talent. <br /> <br /> Watch at least once - it's worth it to catch.
