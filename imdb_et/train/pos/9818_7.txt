Robert Culp (they call him "a doctor" ... I think he is a vet or something) and the family is moving into a prosperous, low-tax, zero-defense suburb. Lamp-jaw Culp and his dog are almost killed when some local idiot neighbors kids drunk and "fly" through their front park at 60 mph. He pushes the accusations that cause the child's discomfort, and suddenly he and his family are victims of a violent and disturbing campaign. <br /> <br /> Marlyn Mason, rather Marlyn Mason, plays with her terrible, boiled-advisor wife, who calls her not to use violence against her embarrassing nobles and who really just wants to move to a decent public service somewhere. But the System is nowhere near Culp, and he's not going to leave his house because of his punk children and their mad rock and role music. And we all know what movies people do when the System fails ... (but it's based on a real story that makes it even better). <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while evil hooligans do make it a convenient 70's funk-o-matic "teenage" themed music that warns us if they are not good, this movie will even reach the age class by hand (really !). It does not make it a great generation. Tissue for that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like dogs (or at least believe in the protection of your civil rights, like me), and you like justice, and you like fire, and you like dog justice, fire, and you think people, who is nervous about the nervously afflicted communities is "too fucking soft" then this flick ethos is your alley. No, it's not really "good", at least not in some widely recognized sense of the word. There's nothing fine or underestimated or smart, it's just a kind of long PSA monitoring. However, the feeling of some memorable scenes is captured in other, beloved works. Remember Frank Miller's dark knight when Batman takes the mutants back from the horse to restore Gotham City? Do you remember the Christmas story of the scene where the boy laughs at the bully's face? Remember how cool it was? Or do you just hate your neighbors joking? Yes, Mon. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was a TV movie made in 1973, which I just happened to be in my local WB partner at 4:00 am and it is probably not for DVD. But after this film inspiration, do you think I'm just sitting here and taking it!?!
