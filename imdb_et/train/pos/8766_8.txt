I saw this movie a million years (5 years exactly) before the first time. In the light of recent events, I decided that the Australian woman, Schapelle Corby, was imprisoned in Indonesia as a so-called contraband, so I decided to watch this movie again. I looked out of my heart because I was breastfeeding for the necessary hot girls (just read my review of "Laurie Show Tracking"). Some of the wet fled from my eyes, but it was barely filled with tears. Why? Not because the two heroes were not completely divine and helpless, not because the film was not prominent in the eyes of the two children in their life, where they were almost inhumane. Why then? Why didn't I cry? I wanted to cry! When I rent such a movie, except that I am being moved, it collides like tomorrow, feel unhappy and pleasant. This movie was just too short to do that. It was like reducing the script to the main plot elements and by doing so the psychological aspect was discarded. Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale did a great job of depicting the emotions of two friends, but the film screamed just for the girls that their girls were more depressing (and oppressive) around. The spiritual journey is lost for some reason here. You only see the key moments (which are very relevant, I admit), probably due to poor editing. Sometimes I felt like these girls were on the postcard. Relations with family members could also have paid more attention. What are the relationships between girls and parents (especially between Alise and her father)? You look at it, but unfortunately the film doesn't offer enough of the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Nonetheless, it was a great movie, and finally I had to bite my lip. But I think it is more related to the skills (and looks) of the actors (and music) and then to the director. Frankly, I hardly knew who Kate Beckins was before (again) watching the movie. Now I'm a fan! A great movie if you don't think it's a classic movie.
