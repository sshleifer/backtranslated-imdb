This movie was beautiful. It was filled with memorable shapes, good deeds and touching themes. It would be very easy to write it too sentimental, but it is the feeling that this type of film is trying to achieve. I was completely in the story and in the presentation. There were some cheese colors, but this is expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can point out is that there wasn't much detail. But this movie was not created to explain the elements of Joseph Smith's life, ministry, triumphs, contradictions, failures, etc.; it was intended to give a quick glimpse of some of the most amazing American and historical religious features.
