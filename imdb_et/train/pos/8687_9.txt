It was the second entry in the conventional Columbo series and it is fine today. Since I can watch this DVD more closely and see how it was built, I am impressed by the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who led the fine MACHO CALLAHAN and countless TV episodes) - see how the killer's post-kill operations are shown by the split screen on his two on the eyeglass, see how the murder itself is shown in the assembly way, look at the point of view from the perspective of the body. Also, the score of wild but impressive avant-garde music was incredible from Jazz Gil Melle and helped create so much atmosphere. And supporting Brett Halsey as a golf project was great - such a nuance and complexity in a role that nine out of ten would be a one-dimensional cut. "Formula" was not set for filming this episode, so there are still surprises in Columbo's methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are high quality actors and are happy to see them - all men are familiar with many other roles. All in all, this record in the Columbo series - and many others - is as well designed as a very good feature film.
