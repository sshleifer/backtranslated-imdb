I saw this movie and the game and I have to add that it was the most touching story I've ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I didn't know how terrible life was, and probably still is, for South African children and adults who were in this life and living. It brought tears to my eyes and a lot of sadness to my heart that every person should struggle like this to stay alive. your story is just amazing. It just crosses five stars, I appreciate it ten. Thank you to Mr Mbongen Ngemat for such an amazing story. Although this story has been spoken, it has been 12 years old, but it's still hard in my heart. If there is a VHS or DVD in the game, please inform me ASAP.Thank You. PS There was nothing wrong with children who wanted to draw the attention of other countries to their problems and conditions, in the hope that some people would have heart and help.
