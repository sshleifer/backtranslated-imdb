I recently purchased this movie from eBay with another LaserDiscs. I am usually in military and action movies, but sometimes I enjoy romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are bored with today's FX movies and shiny romantic comedies, you should watch the shop around the corner in a quiet evening. . I like the movie with a lot of characters. There is nothing counterfeit or pretense about them. For example, take Mr. Matuschek: If he discovers that his wife is deceiving him with one of his employees, he tries to defeat himself. Not only because of the humiliation, but also because he has been unfair to Stewart's character. (OK, rodent example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the film's focus is narrow and the plot is predictable. However, I liked it a lot. If you like Notting Hill, you'll love the corner around the store. in fact, Hugh Grant resembles a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
