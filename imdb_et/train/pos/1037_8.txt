"The wrong maker is often the person who has canceled something, not always the one who has done something." - Emperor Marcus Aurelius <br /> <br /> "Watch on the Rhine" DVD could not come at the right moment. He restores us the great Lillian Hellman game that Dashiell Hammett adjusts to the screen (Hellman's scientist Bernard F. Dick's voice commentary confirms his authorship). It presents a fine performance by Bette Davis, who took on a modest secondary role long after she became a queen of Warner Bros's work horse. Similarly, it reminds us that the purpose of World War II was. <br /> <br /> Of course you say we need it. We have heard Cary Granti, who told "Destination Tokyo" (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We have watched jackboots living in the "music sound" of the mountains (1965). We have been to England, where "It Happened Here" (1966) was occupied in Germany. But to tell the truth, we still need to spread the message. <br /> <br /> I have an 81-year-old friend who regularly wears Franklin Roosevelt. He believes that the FDR gave the US a stranger to fight, which we did not need, and thus caused the death of its favorite cousin. He has encouraged the demonization of Allied forces and the trivialization of the Second War by Patrick Buchanan. The political columnist has recently published a bold book with detailed research that claims that Adolf Hitler would no longer be threatened in Poland, Europe or the world if only the third Reich was given a free city in 1939 in Danzig. Buchanan argues that if these selfish Poles were not faced with the Nazis, speaking foolishly with the British and very altruistic France, the war could not have seized westward. He believes that without Total War's failure, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a definitive solution to the Jewish problem. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this site feel that "Look" is the weight of stolen propaganda. Maybe. But my friend and Pat Buchanan have not got a point in the film: Some people are wounding and killing to seize the land, goods, and freedom of others; such people were dominated by Axis Powers and "enough" did not appear in their vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas deserves the Oscar victory. He and Bette Davis made convincing passions for depicting refugees fighting these accusers. They give an emotional blow to an intellectual case to step aside, actively against torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman did not care about Luke as a person because he remained apolitical. Of course, as in Hungarian, he had seen Bela Up the primary blood "proletariat dictatorship", which replaces the obsolete empire and then falls on Admiral Horthy to the right tyranny. <br /> <br /> A great addition to the Hammetti game, Henry Daniell sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer who paralyzes the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme undoubtedly stood on Field Marshal Rommel during a plot against Hitler on July 20, 1944. But in April 1940, he pragmatically reasoned the Nazis, even though he offended Herr Blecher's "butcher" and scared the Romanian aristocrat Teck de Brancov for catching information about an underground driver. <br /> <br /> Teck, a surprising and potential spouse, wants to return money and visas to Europe, where he can continue to lose his life as a result of the great war that is bursting with the empire and greater global economic depression. He has no political convictions, no disruption to the freedom fighter's trade tomorrow. Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris borrowed this burnt case at the risk of cynicism in the old world. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson gives hostile vitality to a captivating male, dominant old gal who knows her mind and gets her in a way that doesn't appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls. He and his hot office-related son belong to the privileged American version of von Ramme and de Brancovis. But this family has never seen destruction and never. They make money for people who could barely go ahead, just not against it. <br /> <br /> This mother and son can easily make choices that reflect this complaint against national socialism and fascism, which today flourishes my friend and bunny Buchanan. "Watch on the Rhine" is the look of a groomed period. Its dialogue reflects the origin of its erudite on the stage, not the fresh sound of the streets. Yet Hellman and Hammetti have gut power. Audiences still need to hear and listen to their call for weapons against the armed forces.
