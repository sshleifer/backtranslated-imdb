"Shall We Dance?", A light-hearted flick from Japan, talks about the excess accountants and family members who are attracted by the beautiful woman of the dance studio she sees on the train during her daily commuting. What he finds in the studio is the lessons of the dance, and above all himself. Funny, dirty and totally charming "SWD" is an award-winning film worthy of more mature viewers. (B)
