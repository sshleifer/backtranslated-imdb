The tremendous black-and-white night-time cinematography, and much more, is highlighted by its supposedly real life report of the 1950s murder in Kansas, where two men destroyed the whole family. <br /> <br /> The story is written by Truman Capote, so you will receive a very liberal announcement of the death penalty at the end of the film, which is ridiculous, knowing the circumstances of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are playing two atheist losers who have been out of life and who are killing this nice family. <br /> <br /> Despite the fun of the shore at the end, it is a riveting story from the start, and the cinematic art makes it even more interesting. Well-known photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job about it. It makes me want to do more contemporary movies in black and white. Watch this on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and all the support cast are great here. The third look at this film took place at the beginning of April 2005, just after Blake, in real life, was declared innocent of his wife's murder proceedings. After that, Blake can't watch this movie differently.
