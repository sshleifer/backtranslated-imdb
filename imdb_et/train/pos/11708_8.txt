The reason people say that this movie scared them is that it did !! That means some people saw the film's purpose. When I first saw this movie, he scared me and thought about life and religion. This is not a blood and gore-frightening film, but what you think can happen to things like the movie was written. Of course, non-believers say it's the only sci-fi movie. The truth is that this movie is mandatory for the thriller collection, even if it is a religious view. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc), this is one of them and it must be. I never saw a Distant Thunder, but I believe it will catch the end of this movie.
