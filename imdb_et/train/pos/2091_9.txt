What Irving Thalberg did to make this movie today is not trying again. Chinese story with casual players, even though they are among the caliber of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is partly because the story was written by a Westerner, Pearl Buck, who received the Pulitzer Prize for his novel in 1932. Mr. Buck, the daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to American consciousness than any other person. Not China's political struggles, but the lives and attacks of everyday people that we found in the Good Earth. Unfortunately, Pearl Buck received Chiang Kai-Sheki Kuomintang's Chinese apologist in all his virtues and majesty. The rest of his literary output never responded to the Good Earth. When asked about the difference, Ustinov said that China was very big and very full, and Australia was very big and very empty. You see this in great countries, China very large and very full of people, more than it does from time to time. <br /> <br /> Good Earth is spoken by a young man from Wang Lung (Paul Muni) who buys a woman from a big house where he was a slave. Woman O-Lan (Luise Rainer) carries her two sons and sees her through all the good times and bad events, drought, hunger, revolution and cluster smell. <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer won second in two consecutive Oscars to represent O-Lan. Perhaps he has made some record that it must be the leading Oscar game with the least dialogue. Everything he does is done with facial expressions, his performance could have been on a quiet film with very small subtitles. I think only John Mills Ryan Daughter had fewer words and he played a spiritually slowed man. <br /> <br /> Muni is not always welcome in how supportive it is in this dominant culture. Rainer helps in the field, carries and lifts children, carries out household chores. When Muni becomes an early man, he takes the wife of another Chinese trophy, who causes him a lot of grief. Still Rainer carries it all. Still, Muni is not a bad person and it is a respect for the film and his actor and Buck that you don't hate him and the culture gap is over. <br /> <br /> We now have a group of Oriental players who do more than just Kung Fu movies. I'm surprised. The good land of all films has not been rebuilt at this point. I bet the Chinese government would even allow some American companies to do it in a real location. <br /> <br /> Then we've got this great classic to evaluate and enjoy.
