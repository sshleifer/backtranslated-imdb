I like Ghost stories. Good ghost stories at night, voices that can't be explained. Now I see a lot of them. Since the special efx has more and more grips in today's movies, sometimes you can find a real pearl, you have to go back to the time when writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good stories. Now this is a very rare pilot episode for the Ghost Story, called "The New House", one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972 ... I was only 9 years old. For all the re-evaluations in Hollywood, someone should do it "as it is" without having more efx than the original. This episode was creepy under hell. I am fortunate enough to find it on a DVD today and very rarely and hard to find. The only other 2 Ghost Stories that even come close were ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott "The Changling". I want someone to make such ghost stories.
