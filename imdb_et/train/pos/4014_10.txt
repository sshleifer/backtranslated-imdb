Spoiler for everyone who is happy to see this movie ever (so not really a spoiler). I saw this movie when it was released and still remembers some of it. It is all located in a small town in the west or in the city. It resembles a more spiritual city with few inhabitants. Among them is a couple where the woman is particularly sad. She lets her husband die at the end of the movie and leaves the city, but has to cross the desert. We never know what happens to him, but just before he left his deadly man, he did not want him and deliberately did not hit him and instead the water supply. He is not aware that he will be very thirsty soon. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny mansion - but this is another story I can't remember too well. The remaining impression of the film was that it was the first time I saw a genuinely evil woman in the movie, pretending to be something other than evil - can't be compared to the "Snowwhite" witch who is easy to find. A very dense western part with few basic characters and still swallowing.
