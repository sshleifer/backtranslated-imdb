It was 1988 when I first saw "Ronnie and Nancy Show" (on Austrian television). At that time, I was already a very big Spitting Image fan (since he won the Bronze Rose of the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course I saved every tape and saw it again and again - especially "Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember this scene when Ronnie stood in front of Abraham Lincoln's painting (I thought it was a mirror) and said to myself, "I need shaving." Or the most entertaining when he played with his dog, but on the contrary! <br /> <br /> It's so shameful that a shining image seems to be forgotten; it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent TV shows made. Compared to other satirical transfers, it was definitely the best. Well, since then, almost 20 years have passed, and I wish I saw the sample again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... anywhere?
