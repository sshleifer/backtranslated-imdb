SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> I am really in the minority, but I liked this movie. It's not classic, but it's definitely an engaging and pretty adrenaline ride. Certainly I thought it was worth at least 7 ratings. <br /> <br /> Maybe because I liked it, I haven't seen the original. people who haven't seen the original version, and so don't compare it. It wasn't a masterpiece, but I did a lot of it and it really made me see the original. <br /> <br /> I liked some things. One was casting Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was great and brought a lot of charisma. Since most of the movie fell on his shoulders, he was really very good and he was. It was very important to him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was that it was made for television. I had no idea it was. It certainly seemed like a big movie and I would never have guessed it wasn't on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I also found that this story is very absorbing. I'm not one of the action films, but I'm sucked in. Plus it was a lot more than an action movie with drama, mysticism, love story, peculiar people every time you turned. (I didn't even know the priest.) And it touched. It wasn't a great movie, but it's traceable. <br /> <br /> And then the end. It packs a strong blow, and if it is included in the story, it is not very difficult to do it at the end. I'm not sure how I feel about the end. The effect was that Kowalkski survived and, although I am very skeptical of HOW, it is a film and reality is not always mixed in making the film. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I found an end to an incredibly unrealistic form, but in a manipulative form that I usually dislike, but for some reason, is almost forgiving in this movie. It is true that many things were just the requisites of the plot (have the villains been more stereotypical?) But the makers got a lot of rights, even if they got a lot of things wrong. But by saying this, I recognize that I understand why someone who is a big fan of the original hates this version because, although I haven't seen the original, I've seen many original movies I loved to adapt to terrible results. (My big concern is not really a sequel.) But I understand low ratings when the quality of the original is high. <br /> <br /> People have compared it with Smoky and Bandit. How are the "Legend Of The Fall" Roads "Thelma and Louese"? I certainly felt the touch of both films (both of which I am.) I don't think it was a great movie. It was better for me than average, but far from it. But it was a swallowing, adrenaline that touched a movie that had a great protagonist. My voice is from 7.
