I love this movie. songs and story are very fun. and the song "goodbye" always moves me. what a great thing to bring the dolls to life, so you really care about this fabric and fabric and whatever. big voices and great talent. Why were all the other muppet films so much less interesting, moving and funny about it? is it mr. Henson Is Just So Very Missed?
