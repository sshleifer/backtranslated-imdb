Loved this example ... smart action, smart dialogue, great real people-style ... please bring it back or make it online ... really remember it. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... It really makes sense in this madness world. Free yourself from these stupid reality shows and give it a second chance. Please bring it back. When it went out of the air, I looked online and liked how I could watch it with minimal interruptions, in fact, ABC makes it easy to play online games when you were missing them in the early days ... the endless days of recording have disappeared. If you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
