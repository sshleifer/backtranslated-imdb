it was a favorite Christmas offer that I would like them to release vhs or dvd because my 33 RPM disappeared and all the cassettes made have gone too long. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a big fan of John Denver, but it was very impressive about music, which was mostly traditional favorites with muppet spin (esp Little St Nick!). It also included some little known songs (original?). it happened in the late 1970s. Hoping to find a copy soon !!!
