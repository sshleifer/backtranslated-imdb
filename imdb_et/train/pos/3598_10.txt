This person, who usually does not enjoy boxing, feels that he only focuses on boxing and not on the characters, this movie really pulled me. I loved to see so many things about Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) in such a short time, so I was amazing. Michelle (Rodriguez) did such a wonderful job of playing Diana, especially since it was her first show experience, she showed true emotion and portrayed Diana wonderfully. All participants had chemistry on the screen and this film made it even more amazing. I highly recommend this movie to those who don't usually see boxing movies. 10/10
