When touching the beauty of this movie, pay special attention to the sound track, not just to music, but to how all sounds help shape shapes. How beautiful the scene of Gino's expulsion opens up is the subject of moral ambiguity! Note that the music introduces the signs that guide us into Giovanna's marriage. Don't expect that in 1943 you will find a lot of Italian political life here. That's not the case. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to music and images, you are guided by a word that goes beyond realistic. At the end of the film, we have moments of Antonion-like landscapes that are more related to the inner lives of the characters than to the real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
