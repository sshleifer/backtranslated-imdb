A very silly film that starts with a soft porn series, makes a comedy fixed in the art gallery, adds a shocking detective in the hotel room and introduces a random murder without a clear reason. <br /> <br /> The following is odd and surreal (especially the stopwatch scene is extremely unnecessary) culminating in the end of the revelatory "twisting", which is as obvious as unfair to the viewer (see the tiny section exactly why it is deliberately unfair) . film /> <br /> The film goes on to be offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals, crazy and amazing "Huggie Bear" -style racial stereotyping on the subway - and unexpectedly treats the viewer as an idiot in closed scenes because the characters explain each other in great detail and again and again, what just happened in the movie. Although the backend of the backend is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a joy to watch: despite the many many mistakes, the whole package is working just fine.
