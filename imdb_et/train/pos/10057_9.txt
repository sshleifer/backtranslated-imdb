I went to sleep with my gf last night, and when he brushed his teeth, I turned the ducts until I found this Chinese film called the King of Masks. First I thought it was a Kung Fu movie, so I started watching it and then it seized and I had to stop it. <br /> <br /> There was a little girl in the movie. absolutely charming. He was such a big actor so little. Maybe it was in Chinese, so naming English made it harder to say ... but it seemed perfectly perfect. I felt so bad for the girl that she was trying to like her "boss", but everything just turned out to be rotten. lol. Even if she brings her another granddaughter so she can pass on her art ... it turns out that the child was kidnapped so she is arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... whatever he touches to be his grandfather nice, just setbacks. <br /> <br /> Finally, she sees how much love she has and teaches her the art of masks. which is just as cordial after all the mistakes of the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely a pearl and completely original. <br /> <br /> Scott
