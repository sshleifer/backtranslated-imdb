What I knew about "Atlantis" before watching it: <br /> <br /> * - This is officially Disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. I'm not sure how accurate it is (I like nitpick), but it made me curious for the first time I heard it. <br /> <br /> * - The preview was mostly cool. Apparently it was also "too secret", according to some critics. <br /> <br /> * - Obviously he did so badly that Disney said, "Screw it, let" Spy Kids "again. <br /> <br /> Just like everything said, how's the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I am a mammal animated fantasy that includes music and extraordinary effects while stirring, but Atlantis goes all out. Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, so it's almost an animation show. The characters may not be so memorable (except perhaps for the ship's medical officer) and the plot is a bit boring, but it's not watching the movie. > <br /> There is a contradiction here that disturbs me. "Failure" (as it was, "only" took, like five hundred million or something; I know that the animators who would have killed to see fifteen bucks of this), is "Shrek" in terms of popularity and "Monsters Inc." has been seen as a proof of the death of traditional animation. How do you consider South Park? But "Final Fantasy"? Truly, story and art are all, not a method. I don't know what a Disney comeback movie is, but I don't think they're out of the picture.
