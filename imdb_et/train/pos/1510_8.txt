Yes, this is a horrorantology movie and it was fun! This is because although the film was obviously horrible, some stories had a light spirit - and sometimes a couple of laughs. This is not a bad thing at all, because sometimes the horror films are a bit tiny and too serious. That's why, and since all four stories were pretty good, it's one of the best films I've ever seen in that style. <br /> <br /> The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories include people who rent a home or study what has happened to tenants. <br /> <br /> The first segment marked Denholm Elliot as a writer of horror with a writer's block. So, to change the landscape, they rent this house. Almost immediately the Elliot block disappears and it runs continuously from the serial number. Immediately after his block disappears, he will start to see his fictional character! Again and again, a psychotic killer appears and then disappears - it seems like he is losing his mind. It may be just the best of stories, because a nice twist ends up being a story. <br /> <br /> The second, though not at all, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor's degree who has died a little while ago for a girlfriend (although his picture seemed amazingly modern). When he enters the city into the horror chamber, he sees a wax pattern that reminds him of his missing lady and is so fascinated and frightened. Later, a friend (Joss Ackland) visits and sees this figure and is tempted by it. All this leads to the end, which, frankly, was a bit devastating. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee then marks an incredibly harsh and cumbersome father for a pathetic girl. During most of this segment, Lee seemed to be an idiot, but in the end you understand his behavior. Although it was slow, it ended very well. The fourth segment was the worst and was meant to be a genre parody. Jon Pertwee (third "doctor" of DR WHO TV series) is a very temperamental actress known for his Drakula images. However, there is nothing right about the movie that is right for him and the little one suits him to win better props for this vampire film. It's actually quite interesting that he played this role because it seemed natural that Christopher Lee, who played Dracula or other vampire basilion times (give or take a couple). I enjoyed the Pertwee line when basically said that Lee and other recent Drakula incarnations were all like Bela Lugos! Maybe Lee didn't take that part! Despite some very foolish moments, it was a lot of fun and fun - maybe as good or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Given that the movie started and ended so well, it was a great act and writing, it's hard not to like this movie.
