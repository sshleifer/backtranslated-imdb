This movie is a real gem. The plot arc is defined within the first three minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motifs are completely plausible. The dialogue is fresh and oh so real. The situations are unique to the characters and are not cliched or hacked at all. Until its peak, it is. Then it is as if the film had left the track a bit and it would be a bit amazing and incredible. But I don't want people to stop watching this movie. The first 3/4 are truly remarkable. I gave him 8. Here are some remarkable performances. Watch this movie.
