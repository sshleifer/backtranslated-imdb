This is an awesome action film with big lining Arnie! It is stylishly designed with lots of tension to keep you happy. The characters were fantastic and Richard Dawson is the main villain very dangerous. Yes, it has tons of holes in the plot, but it is also a very fun and big ending. It was also a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso were great chemistry. The development of the label work was also very good, with some excellent performances. The direction is great! Paul Michael Glaser is doing a great job here, using the colors fantastically, keeping it in style, in the form of fantastic camera angles, and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! good work. It's a little gore. We get some bloody firearms, exploding head, slit cavity, bloody chainsaw slices, skinless bodies, blood and impaling. Action is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, he is a superbly functioning department, has tons of fun in one lining, kicks this ass, and as always has a great physical presence! And there was a ton of fun to watch! (Arnie rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso does it well, she was really cute and she had Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, is right here what he has to do, not much. Marvin J. McIntyre is good as a geeky guy, he was cool!. Richard Dawson is fantastic as the main villain and was very intimidating and he was fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka are doing everything they need to do very well. In general it MUST be seen! **** 1/2 out of 5
