This movie star Emily Watson, which is breaking the waves. This film about one man's obsession takes place at a resort where a tournament is held. Arrives at the chessmen and soon after he gets ridiculously fallen (emotionally) with the woman Emily Watson plays. He falls to the despair that is shocked. It's all about seeing her mother, who is much more interested in another younger gentleman; the right gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a young woman's fancy look because she has a tendency to take odd animals and such. What happens is mostly a trip through a man's psyche. This is about how his past is closely related to his present. Emily Watson is both amazing and an actor who plays the main character. It's definitely slow, but it's worth a look. The end was even satisfactory. :)
