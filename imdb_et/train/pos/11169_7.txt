When I first saw the film, I thought it was boring because nothing happened, but when all the frightening things started to happen, when the church dies and lives back, and the gage and his mother die and the idiot's father must bring them back to life, though he nows warnings and ignores Jud.this is not the best of steven kings. I thought his best work was bright. I don't think people who see and comment on this movie are terrible because they are all they think they are. like that person can do a better job of scaring. I mean that gage's evil and how it kills Judi is a genius. making the most innocent signs of the most innocent one killer is cool. People who didn't like the movie are stupid because it's all a scary movie and not all. don't expect anything from the movie that's not. it was still so good in the general area. I recommend people still watch the movie
