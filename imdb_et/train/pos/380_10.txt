Steven Spielberg, at the beginning of his 80s, left the Whoopi Goldberg Alice Walker's "The Color Purple", leaving the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Looking at Goldberg playing Celie, it is unbelievable that it is the same woman who played such movies as "sister law". This is a movie that could easily be - not that it should be part of the Black Studies and Women's Studies curriculum. There's one scene that can be the biggest editing action ever on the screen (you know it when you see it). I can't believe it didn't win any Oscar; it may be Spielberg's second best film behind "Schindler's list" (maybe even related to it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
