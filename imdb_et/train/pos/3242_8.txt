I saw this movie with my dad. I had to be pretty young, about 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon. The film started a little vaguely, but you could say that the robbers gathered the score. It rose at a pace after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> All actors are big, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's an ensemble, they just play so well. I can watch this movie anytime. I think this is the plot's relative stupidity and characters who are trying to deal with a very strange thing. Jokes are not pink, but they are at the same time fine and extreme, making them so fun. <br /> <br /> Perfect comedy for lazy afternoon.
