An exciting, honest, courageous and unforgettable psychological horror film about the painful experiences of rape - "Descent" is a movie that went under the radar because of its lack of distribution because, frankly, the film is so brutal in its images that if it was released from the theater, he is somewhat biased with anger. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be discovered, not just its dark themes, not only for its amazing direction and authentic style - but above all for its performances. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning, with enough disease and enough vulnerability to do it, not to associate it, but to understand this broken man with his sexuality-twisted perspective not only with raped women, but also with the weak insecurity that is deep inside his own. This is a supportive performance that is so complicated, brave and emotional for Faust. And it's hard to forget. But it's Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. Showing real dramatic games and one of the finest but louder items. While we see Dawson in some good and bad films in good performances, he proves that he has what he needs to deliver a emotionally wiping and moving performance in a credible and thematic way. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of this year (and 2007 was strong) - when this undervalued and intelligent film hit the release of the theater, I shouted for it, as did Dawson and Faust. Too bad was too blunt for a large-scale complaint. Such films deserve better!
