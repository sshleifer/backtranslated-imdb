For those of you who think that it is strictly potty humor and immaturity, you are actually pointless. Although the exhibition includes a part of potty jokes, it also contains many satirical materials and amusing fun social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. <br /> <br /> I also love not being a punchline. Those who are looking for a dictionary like friends (I LOVE friends fyi) will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humor, which is more realistic. We do not walk in this world and we have clever punchlines saying everything in most comedies. Instead, Sarah Silverman's program makes it more realistic. So don't take it as meaningless humor because it is so much more.
