After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally opens a bottle of invisible ink that was part of a chemistry kit. He quickly discovers the invisible ... so the predictable results are coming, which means he uses his new hidden state to torture Tom. Jerry often defends himself, but often has a sadistic line that tortures the cat, if possible, even if it has proven itself. <br /> <br /> Here, he tells Tom that his eyes are misleading him when the cheese is cut off in front of his eyes or the milk dish. Tom can no longer get to sleep on this nightmare, but Jerry puts his paw on fire! Man, I hope little kids didn't think of these cartoons back in the 40s and 50s! I've always found Jerry, a little mouse, more evil than cute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, cartoons have disappeared in a matter of seconds, no matter what the actual damage, and it is back to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this comic is about two-thirds of what Tom thinks of Jerry, and he's trying different ways to locate the mouse (for example, adding flour). on the floor to view his footprints).
