Loved the movie. I also liked most of the participants. But for me, Davis's very bad accent and her stiff action really make it very difficult to see a otherwise convincing movie. Seriously, if another modern actor played the same role as Mrs Davis, they would laugh at the screen. <br /> <br /> I think he "called it". Now that he had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman, who played a part of the woman, I would have enjoyed much more. <br /> <br /> I think I just can't get Bette Davis. I've always thought of him as an actor who "plays himself" no matter what his role is. The possible exception is now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I am sure many other reviewers will carefully (and I hope that the civilian) clarify how I am completely wrong. But I watch the movies he has because I like stories / writing / support pains, but I always think of different actors who could have done a better job.
