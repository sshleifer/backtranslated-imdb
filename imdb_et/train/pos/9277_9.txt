"Cinema is dead, live in the cinema!" Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, said last year at the Romanian film festival Anonimulus, which reached the third edition and is on the Danube. This year, the award went to "Offside" by Jafar Panah. I saw it this evening in Bucharest in the retrospective of the festival. Cinema is dead but still very lively. Panah's film speaks convincingly how Iranian society looks. Digitally Filmed, "Offside" is a story inspired by the real event that happened to Panah's daughter. It is forbidden in Iran, as we know. Panahi manages to do little, but probably a lot of work, intelligence, and humor in cultural systems in a society that makes women stand out clearly. The absurdity of the law becomes comic. The film is happy because the Iranian team goes to the World Championship. Most of all I appreciated the idea of ​​the film, the idea. I would be very interested in watching Panah's other films, which were also forbidden in Iran. I think he can be thought of as a director of activists.
