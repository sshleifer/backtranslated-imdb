This film is the core of flexible morality and yet a unique sense of justice. So many regular Joes among us would love to "stay with MAN". In this case, "MAN" is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, who tells Carla in her office. Later, Paul owes 70 Mr Marchand and the club owner. And then there is Paul's password officer. It seems that the side story of this last character is so much. Observers point to this weakness in an otherwise well-designed underground game in ping pong between our two main characters, which increases the title until their lives change dramatically. They are reviewed by each "MAN" representative. One or both may be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not, as has been said. <br /> <br /> The film has a feeling of relaxation at the end. Carla finally gets off. His boss is forced to pull out. Mr. Club Owner is a pulpy mess in his bathroom. They get $ $. And ... they don't have to worry about reporting to a password officer because his moral weakness brings him to the basement of his misleading wife (or any police to arrest him). This is a critical subconscious trigger lock that strikes us so tight. Don't forget that someone else can get Paul's file later to track his release; at the moment they are free! They can even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> SHOW NOT ME!
