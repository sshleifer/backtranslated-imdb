Have not seen any Japanese grudge movies, but I really enjoy it. When I watch the film, I can't rarely get SCARED. I can jump if the effect and sound are amazing enough, but scaring for the film is a rare thing for me. But I started scaring Grudge. Maybe because I didn't expect anything when I looked at it. I didn't expect fear. I didn't know anything about it. That was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you probably love or hate. Most people seem to be compared to Japanese grudge movies, but even though I haven't seen them, I think it's not the right movie to compare. This movie stands on its own. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I disagree. The story is minimalist and has been done for the purpose. The story-telling procedures used - for example, a broken schedule - are completely done. The director knows exactly what he is doing, and I believe he got his vision when he wanted it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie from 8th 10. It's a movie you enjoy or hate. It's that simple.
