Although DiG! it was welcomed that it is closest to what the music industry is like, as it is highly produced. The director has misled the public to believe that Brian Jonestown's massacre disappeared after the 98th year. And the competition between Dandy Warhol and Jonestown is milked. The truth of this movie is not really open. <br /> <br /> This movie is endlessly quoted and interesting to see when we look at two groups of very talented musicians who create their own art. One of the best things this film has done is the unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended mainly for music and two fantastic bands.
