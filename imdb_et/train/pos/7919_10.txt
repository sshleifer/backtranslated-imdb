There is no doubt that this is a whimsical joke, "Full Moon High" depicts a teenager from the 1950s, Tony Walker (Adam Arkin), who is sending his father (Ed McMahon) to Romania. Of course, Tony bites and grows fur and fangs when there is a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that it cannot age as long as it has a werewolf, and that it must fulfill its destiny - even if it takes twenty years. the movie is just funny when it goes. Ed McMahon's character is over-patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars coach / principal is tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most prominent cast members is Demond Wilson, who is best remembered as Lamont "Sanford and Son" - a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the most fun scene is the president's exchange; then gag with Gerald Ford really did! Anyway, it's real coffee. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a nice psychiatrist - won the Oscar on Sunday evening and thanked his sons, I wondered if he remembered whether he was in the two films in this film (besides Adam, his son Anthony also plays a small role). Quite funny. She is also starring Elizabeth Hartman. PS: Director Larry Cohen is probably the most well-known killer baby "It's alive".
