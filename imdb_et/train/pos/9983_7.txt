This film mainly deals with human relationships and communication between them. The main character is the old lady who starts her life in the dark, analyzing how she lived her life. This journey is precipitated by the pups' economic crisis and his intentions to put him in a nursing home. It is very honest to look at some of the questions we all ask ourselves in some life, and there are many secondary ideas in this film, such as family heritage, true love, marriage, or destiny. Although this type of melodrama is nothing new, it may be useful to look at it with family members to discuss some ideas. The actors are very good and the characters are very plausible, but due to the times some characters may not be fully developed. I recommend this movie on a quiet Saturday afternoon.
