Japan is in serious trouble. The demons have infiltrated Ed, taking forms of the earth and bending them to their holy will. In addition, Ashura, the Queen of Demons, is a close again. The only thing that stands against this serious threat is Demon Wardens, a terrible number of warriors who may be both bad and demons. <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who five years ago took the theater demon instead of Slaying, killing an inadvertently innocent child (in a battle reminiscent of the bar scene Duskist Dawni). One evening, the meeting will meet a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their treasures are intertwined (literally) and bound by destiny for lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese fantasy / sword game epic, you would be wrong. Actually, there is nothing typical of Ashura. It has many different movie genres. Those who just mentioned, as well as comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre quite respectfully (although comedy seems to be forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> There are definitely some movie mistakes. Part of humor seems to be viable and inappropriate. And the operation is not the greatest. But seriously, do you look at fantastic / sword games / comedy films for excellent exhibitions? No, we look at them for action and crazy CG visuals, all of which are Ashades Spades. It is not misleading that the film is not all the operations, but it is enough to have a lot of sword and green blood to keep the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; the films have their own mistakes and this is not a martial arts epic, but it does not try and it offers interesting visual and good sword games. The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes too seriously, and when the viewer does the same, it is definitely a joy of this fun and stupid action of sword game fantasy. <br /> <br /> My rating of 7 fun popcorn movie.
