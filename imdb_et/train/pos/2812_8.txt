"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and it was simple and straightforward. In fact, it was more like a home film and if you want dramatic lighting, see something else. And that's not a tearjerker. But I mean it positively. It shows two men who love each other and how the harm to AIDS affects the quality of their everyday lives. For me, it is almost difficult to say whether it is a high quality film or not because it was so undressed that I had to look for other ways of answering. It's an amazing film, which is actually one of the most amazing and sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have unbelievable honesty because their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes hollow wood products AIDS clean and heartless. These men made this movie for themselves, one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings "You are in my sunshine" to Mark and says goodbye to him is a real thing.
