My Super X-Girlfriend is one of the crazy skater hell. Special effects were excellent and the costumes Uma Thurman wore a hubbub. Uma Thurman is an undervalued comedy actress, but she proved that everything is wrong and nailed to her lunatic girlfriend role. He was just FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson was as good as the average Joe, but he was a brave man who worked with the greatest actors of all time. The supportive cast was also great, especially Anna Faris, who was very good (much better than the Scary Movie franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman did a great job of managing this movie because if it wasn't for him and Uma Thurman's movie wouldn't have done that well. This film is clearly released (Uma Thurman), its director, scenario and its original line. This movie is highly recommended.
