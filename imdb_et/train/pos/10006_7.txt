In this "critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on real events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and late night talk host is a harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). Questions arise about this boy (story), but Gabriel finds to the expanding mystery that hides the deadly secret? "according to the official summary of the film. <br /> <br /> You must stop reading these comments and watch NOW ... <br />. ending with Mrs Collette planning her new life, it should be cut off and sent to the "deleted scenes" land. It's superfluous. The true nature of his physical and mental health damage should be obvious when Mr Williams returns to New York. Maybe his darkness could be questionable - but revelation could have been certain on the "highway" or "videotape". Can a movie benefit from editing - how is "director cut"? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Cannava (like Jess) do not seem like a couple of believers at first. The scene can be created by a scene or two that establish their relationship. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers exceptionally strong testimonials, not "gay". Sandra Oh (Anna), Joe Morton (like Ashe) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all ideal. <br /> <br /> Best of all, Collette's "Donna" belongs to the crappy famous hall. Madam Oh is right, saying that Collette can be, "you know, like this" Psycho guy. " It has been several years when organizations that award prizes seemed to be women because roles were slightly smaller; surely they could have taken some of the awards into Collet. He's good. And President Patrick Stettner will certainly highlight Hitchcock - he even buys a sandwich from a vending machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson deserve all the flight crews. <Br /> <br /> ******* Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin
