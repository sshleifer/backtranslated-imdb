What a good movie! Made Men is a great action movie with many turns. James Belushi is very good as an ex hood who has been stolen from 12 million bosses who have to support gangsters, his wife, and the local sheriff (Timothy Dalton). You don't want to be disappointed, jump on board and enjoy the ride. 8 out of 10
