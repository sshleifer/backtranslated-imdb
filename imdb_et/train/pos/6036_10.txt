I'm not in the target audience of this movie. I am a man who is almost 50 years old who has only recently stumbled upon an independent film world. It happened quite randomly, discovering the movie Clerks on the TV one day in the evening. The first two things I noticed about this movie were that it was 1) technically amateur and 2) excellent. When I read the interview with the director in a local magazine and said that one of his influences was officials, I began to be interested. When he said his main influence was the station agent, the movie I saw on the DVD a week ago, I decided to go out and check it out. The result can be described in the same way as officials, although both films are not so substantive. Both films suffer from technical gases that exceed amazing writing. When Clerks is a day in a living man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask hard questions about himself and his situation, less than I am about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly detained, he is always running in one way or another, filling your life with small things so he never has to deal with them. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and vivid. I can say that despite the fact that I have grown up, I have not changed much, young men still have the same problems they always have. The writer dresses up these problems and topics in a modern folk tale, looks at wonderfully honest signs and makes them completely credible. As far as the indie cinema is concerned, it may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but it is very close to the artistic one.
