Action, horror, sci-fi, exploitation manager Fred I Ray shows that he has a talent for director. Character actor William Smith is one of the best harsh / bad guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best effect of his career. For Randy Travis, he gives his best Lee Van Cleef impression. He's not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make the movie. As far as the rest is concerned, none of them really looks like. Ray did a great job that led it to flick, Smith and Travis were good, I'd give it a B-West scale of 1 to 10 (ten is the best) seven.
