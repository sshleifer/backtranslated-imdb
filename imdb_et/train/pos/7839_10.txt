The film, timed by critics, but loved by fans, has now become a classic. Mixing this movie with supposedly "surrealistic" footage captured at John Lennon's home, with the best film by Marc Bolan & T.Rex, this film is not just necessary for anyone who likes Marc Bolan, but gives an exciting overview of the era <br /> <br /> there were times when Marc was hobbling with Ringo Starr, who was the Beatles [who drove it], and you could even find a short spot from one of Reg Dwight [Elton John to you]. Evening schools in the amazing [and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and rotating and ballad versions for children from the Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes containing Chelita Secunda. using her shine etc, Mickey Finn and even Catweazle actor !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden, when Marc leaves the dining table, sits in front of a battleground and captures a classic acoustic version like Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended! FIVE Stars [Five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
