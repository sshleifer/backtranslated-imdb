Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Life in the 1920s Ireland, Gypo and his Irish people are part of the suppressing British. One particular insurgent who wanted to murder in English arrives in secret. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the 20 pound fee is too tempting. Gypo can kill his friend and fall into the pit of despair and drunkenness. In the meantime, other Irish rebels are looking for an informant. Immediately, Gypo, with a pocket burning hole, is their main suspect, but they who are his friends do not want to believe it. The story of the informer is simple but complicated on his or her moral and emotional issues. It's just one of John Ford's most emotional movies. What Gypo did was wrong, but we certainly understand his motives. We also understand his regret and a lot of compassion. The script is also very tense. This is the place where we are pretty sure we know how everything ends, so we have to wear our teeth and carry it with it. Operation is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who acted in many Ford films, apparently gave his best result (and won the Oscar for it). Every other filmmaker deserves his children. In addition to the amazing script and actor, the informant is one of John Ford's more expressive films. I love the darker side of Ford. In his mood, but also on his subjects, the informer reminds me of two of my favorite Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and Fugitive (1948); it is also somewhat similar to anger grapes (1940). 10/10.
