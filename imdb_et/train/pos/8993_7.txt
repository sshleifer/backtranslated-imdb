Rock n 'Role is Dirty Business and DiG! shows it masterfully. With a project of serious ambition and perhaps foolishness, the filmmaker is capable of a total of seven toxic years following two heavy rock groups. This means that the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to conquer the audience. If you are ever interested in the music industry, this movie is definitely suspicious. movie music, although it suffers from minimal cutting and pasting, is only worth the entrance price. morning after DiG! I went directly to the recording board of Brian Jonestown's Massacre album (i already had Dandy Warhol's sounds). It basically defines rock music exploration, the film succeeds in other deep levels. DiG! is a sincere and sufficiently objective look at the destructive and changeable nature of the creative process and the people who are trying to hurt those forces.
