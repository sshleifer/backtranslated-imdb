This movie is not a cat and mouse fight, as noted in another comment. It's about a cat who has used 8 of her 9 lives and now lives to lose her last. The cat is nervous and fears death all the time, so the name "fraidy cat". The previous life of Fraidy Cat worshiped him as a ghost from different ages and tries to kill him constantly, but he fears most of the ninth life represented as a 9-form cloud and illuminates the bolts of light. very old but still fun for kids if you have a copy. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie as a child almost every day: o)
