I looked at it in July and even in Christmas Eve I found it touching and sensitive. It's not a real-minded person because it's full of fantasy and loves moments that sometimes don't make sense. William Russ did a great job to get Hank. I've only seen him in a long and hot summer, where he played with a weak character. But what was in his eyes, as Hank considered to be with him, was wonderful and gentle. Valerie Bertinelli was wonderful and lovely as usual and very credible in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was great and always smiled when he appeared in several important scenes. There were many special scenes, including where Hank understands who Max really was in life. It's not for everyone ..... especially for those who don't feel well in sensitive movies and that's definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, beware of it. But I think it's worth watching again, so I shut it down. (Yes, some of us still have video recorders.)
