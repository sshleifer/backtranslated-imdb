In New York, there is one person who is the rest, perhaps immortal dr. Mordrians are sworn advocates of mankind, using their magical powers to keep their brother and rival, Kabal, chained so that they cannot enslave the human race. Don't you know that? The Prophet will come true and Kabal will freely break and begin to collect elements (including platinum and uranium) for his alchemy experiments. Can a police woman named Sam be able to win Mordrians with her evil brother? "Dr Mordrid" comes to me in Charles Band's full month archive collection. I had not heard of it, which is a bit strange, given that I am a big fan of Jeffrey Combs (Mordrid) and the film is not so old. But now it is mine and I can enjoy it again and again. The film is definitely fun in the classic full moon style. Richard Band offers music (which does not differ significantly from all other results) and Brian Thompson plays evil Kabbalah. We even have animated dinosaur bones! What more do you want? Of course, the cheese factor is high. I felt that much of the film was Dr. Hanging Strange Comics. And the blue pantsuit was silly. And the plot holes are everywhere (I could list at least five, but why barely). And why is the ancient symbol of Mordrel and Kabbal suspiciously like a hammer and sickle? The combs have never been a strong actor, so it fits with the cheese. These are not complaints. Full Moon fans have been waiting for these things and eating them like cracked grape nuts. I'm guilty ... I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are not a full moon fan or Jeffrey Combs fan ... you can search elsewhere. But if you like the style and discounts of making a movie in the early 1990s, you eat it. The fans of Stallone and Schwarzenegger may want to see Brian Thompson as a watch, looking as beautiful as ever and not able to formulate English in tertiary. I did. I wish there was "Mordrid II", but this company that continues practically everything (is "Gingerdead Man 3" really necessary?), Forward it.
