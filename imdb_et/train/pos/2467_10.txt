Why doesn't it take an Oscar full of bags? This is an amazing interpretation of often filmed / executed work. Visuals are breathtaking (especially on the widescreen ... pan & scan really scans the movie's excellent cinematography and kits). Every frame is in the countryside. Amazing. The game is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for its open titles is clear. Zefferelli is not here, just a great storytelling, just how the film gets, but rarely. Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlet's murderous uncle: he doesn't play him as a mustache-curling evil villian, but a charming politician that allows us to see why only Hamlet suspects an unpleasant game. Branagh also reaches out the nuances between Hamlet's fake / true madness and his revenge on revenge. And many fires came out pretty well, all from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Deparde and Charlton Heston, unnoticed when you were sucked into Branagh's vision as I was. Pleasant piece.
