If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to break the song every 12 minutes, this is a Disney movie for you! My sons loved this movie every minute and I have to admit that I laughed out all over the film. There are no delicate songs to get exciting songs, and all the characters are all loving and self-detectable. It should go as one of Disney's "classics" thanks to its beautifully illustrated landscapes and its non-stop excitement!
