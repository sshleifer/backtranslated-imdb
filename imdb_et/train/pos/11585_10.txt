This movie is full of stock Horror movie goodies: chained lunatics, pre-mediated murder, crazy (unpleasant lesbian) female patient who even has a madder father who is wearing a mask because of his terrible dysfunction, poisoning, horrible castles, werewolves (male) and female) adultery, killed lovers, Tibetan mystics, half-name experimental midfielder / half-plant victim, grave abduction, sensory control, wall-mounted bodies, car accident on a lone road, electric shock, knights of arms - a lot, all surpassed an incredibly horrible score and some of the worst Foley's work. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even poorly duplicated with Spanish horror movie standards) and some edits are just odd. In one scene, where a leading woman's evil scientist goes to her heroine in her bedroom, one of the badly dubbed "It's awesome. I don't understand. Tell me again how this is ..." a movie, is a sudden hand next to a girl's thighs pulled out if he does not appear out of bed for some reason when covering a bad scientist "Mwahaha! All of your werewolves fall under me!" call. Though why they went to the trouble I don't know, because there are many other looting jumps all over the place - even allowing for a frightening pan and seeing this print. <br /> <br /> According to one star interview, the director was drunk and most of the film looks like that. It's a confusing mess. This becomes even more inconsistent when the wampers rampage footage is included in another movie "Wolf Man's Mark" (made 4 years earlier, with the same actor but playing more aggressive and different shirts and forming - is the word "Continuity" there)? and one more wolfman arrivals extension that is amazing with a long stroke. <br /> <br /> The music is incredibly bad, changing almost casually from the creepy orchestral house, to music, bosannova, the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded. Thinking about this, it may not be a duet. It could have been a solo. The piano piece was so simple that it could have been pulled out with one hand, while the player worshiped with another gong.) <Br /> <br /> This is one of the most amazingly trance- states that cause me bad movies so far. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! This madness and perversion will turn against you!" How it is true. <br /> <br /> Le mmik shot: A lover who finds his girlfriend killed by dropping a candle in a comic-style surprise show. Perform amateur management there.
