John Thaw is a great actor. I have to admit that I had an impressive amount of it in an old church who reluctantly agrees to evacuate London streets (World War II). <br /> <br /> That said: the film is also great. A very moving story with a satisfactory ending. Some characters are little developed (especially a school teacher), but none of them are important for the plot. Basically there is a story about an old man and a shop and the film needs a little.
