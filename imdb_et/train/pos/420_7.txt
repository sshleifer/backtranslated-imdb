This movie gives the legendary Wild Bill Hickock saga. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane, are central characters. <br /> <br /> At the end of the civil war, Lincoln mentions that the country's dynamism is being enhanced when people follow the advice of "Go West Youth," which did not gracefully attribute the film to Horace Greele as many others did. But then, he gets murdered and some financiers speculate that they can sell weapons to American Indians abundantly. Meanwhile, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with a little boy while the steamer loads the dock along Mississippi. Wild Bill uses Bowie's knife, which he finally gives to his son, calling it "Arkansas toothpick", which was actually a different knife, although both were used across the border. <br /> <br /> Hickock finally meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks at real people's photos and paintings. Cody has just married and brings her bride to the Old West to settle down. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at their destination, they get to Calamity Jane, who is broken in Hickock. He looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill, "Is that your pug?" The line was what caused some problem with the Hayes board because one of the definitions of "mops" was a prostitute. Demille wanted to go inside the line and one of his assistants noted that Beatrix Potter's book on Peter Rabbit had three rabbits, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. He drove it out and asked the censors to identify a "bad rabbit". It worked; the line remained. <br /> <br /> The Indians were partly uneasy due to the higher weapons they received from the East Funding Agent. Cody and Hickock were asked to help the area explore for troops to escape safely. Cody led forces; Hickock went to get acquainted with the activities of the Commander-in-Chief of India, who was an old acquaintance and who led some hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> Peace Jane gets caught and Hickock can grab her by trying to save her. They bring to the driver, and while neither of them talks, the torture applied to Hickock interrupts Calamity Jane's willpower and tells how Cody is using it. <br /> <br /> Two are released and Hickock joins Cody and his troops, partly warning them that they are trapped. With the help of Hickok, they prevent an Indian attack. <br /> <br /> Hickock decides to go to the gunfire and finally take prison. As they wait for the authorities, Hickock strikes back playing cards. Pretty good in the 1930s.
