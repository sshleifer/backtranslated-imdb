Too bad that many people didn't understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But don't worry! badly explain it to you :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's Dream theme coma. The second part is what is happening in real life. <br /> <br /> Now that people didn't understand, Tony's dream is more than a dream. in this episode, he is prepared for his death. He loses his identity and eventually forgets himself, so he separates all his ties with this world. You notice what I'm talking about on the doctor's scene, where tony says he's lost his portfolio of "his life". They really did a great job of translating because they were thinking about what would happen if you died. <br /> <br /> When you understand the whole plot, you will find a unique thing in this and the next episode with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> Like every episode of soprano, acting and filming is great. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't think was the role of monks. I look at it until I get it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode really touched me, and I don't think anyone else can better see what happens to almost death. <br /> <br /> 10/10 is no doubt.
