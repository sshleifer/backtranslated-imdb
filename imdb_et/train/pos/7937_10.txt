I thought the movie "I don't do them" was fantastic. Earlier I've been following Rob Estes "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and also Josie Bissett for "Melrose Place" and loved seeing them again "I don't want". They have great chemistry (I think they are getting married in real life!) - they both have children and widows with their careers, and they love and try to mix their already chaotic families without dropping the ball. Of course, they stumble, but they keep it together, which is what work and family rearing is. So many people have been talking about this movie - all good! - And the movie was more for us. It would make a great series - appealing for many times! - It would be so nice to see real life on earth, the family shows what today is the reality of so many of our lives - the so-called "Reality TV" that all stations are surprising to us. days. Someone tells people at ABC Family that they have a new series here!
