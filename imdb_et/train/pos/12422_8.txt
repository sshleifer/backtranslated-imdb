With mixed descriptions, I wasn't expecting too much and pleasantly surprised. This is a very interesting little criminal movie with interesting characters, great images, writing that is windless without being good and fast. It also looks good in a funky way. Apparently people like this movie or just hate it, and I'm the one who liked it.
