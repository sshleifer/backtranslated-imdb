I was glad to finally see the release of amazing stories from the DVD in the first season. I had just forgotten what the actors and directors did with this series. For a long time, the only way to see this remarkable series was with VHS 2 or 3 episodes, or when the Sci-Fi episodes were restarted. However, if Sci-Fi hosts re-runes, they usually stayed on the same episodes. Season One had some outstanding episodes like a mission they didn't repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series ran? IMDbis is here from 1985 to 1987, but I thought it lasted more than two years. If you love Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limit, you love this series and you don't have to be disappointed with buying.
