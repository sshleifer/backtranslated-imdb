Horse riding, led by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger), is another pearl in this fine director. For those who do not know the history of the Kansas-Missouri wars during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and visit a sad piece of Americana. In addition to some excellent activities (quite bloody). It is a story of love and commitment, especially between men and a woman. He marks Toby Maguiret, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright and, like a young lady Jewel, I have never heard of him before, I want to see him more.) Actress is top-notch, excellent product values, very well written (custom novel) <br /> <br /> It's a long movie that's 128 minutes, but it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My rating is **** <br /> <br /> according to <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
