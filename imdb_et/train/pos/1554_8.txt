I saw it in the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and frightening scene is when a German mustard is attacked by the German army for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered with head-to-toe (or tail) scary bags. Experienced British soldiers do not gas masks (only) and wait for the gas cloud and German attackers. The clouds of gas are moving closer and finally the British defenders are surrounded. The Germans are slowly moving threateningly in their scary look. Suddenly, the punishment of the defenders ... This gas is like any other thing they've experienced before .... <br /> <br /> Now you know why I've remembered this scene for the last 30 years. tremble, I think you too!
