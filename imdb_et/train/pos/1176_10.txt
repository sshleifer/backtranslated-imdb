First, let me say that I didn't like the fact that The Rock won such a title tomorrow. Next, I feel that Regal should have regained his European title, Jeff Hardy is a beaten champion. Rob Van Dam was too long for a continental title because Brock should have won it. I'm glad Storm and Christian are signs, the best meeting was in my opinion Booker T and Big Show.
