Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is a set of vehicles from the low budget of several 50-year-olds affected by the Cold War. PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is a rugged, sharp, explosive and endless fun with less than 80 minutes of driving. <br /> <br /> Widmark stars as a handkerchief Skip McCoy, who has been raised three times already. But McCoy is not able to bother his misleading fingers, and the trouble is exactly what he's slipping when he hits the gangster's mitten Candy (Jean Peters) purse. The Candy Wallet contains an invaluable microfilm roll for the Communist movement and his latest work for former boyfriend Richard Kiley to make this delivery. However, if Widmark raises it, Peters must do whatever he requires to see a film he doesn't know at first. <br /> <br /> This is a delicious setting with Widmark character, not psycho KISS OF DEATH, real live wire, unpredictable and harsh, but curiously charming. When Bogart or Mitchum took on the role of a movie noir, you knew what you were going to get: a lonely anti-hero who retains his moral integrity and finally won (Bogart) or too laconic a man who promised to pull himself into a trap (Mitchum). With Widmark, you just don't know what you're getting, and its incredibly modern operating style (its movies always keep well) is amazing to watch. Here, he's split up for making big scores, selling the movie or handing it over to the police and fighting "Commieside" on the right side of the law. And he still has to pretend he never took a pocket to Peters to prevent a deadly fourth rape on his page. <br /> <br /> Peters gets his best role in golden gold. Widmark's unpredictability is probably best expressed by Peters; Widmark's spell includes a pretty tramp (and quite unbelievably - a romantic angle in a hurry), but Widmark alternates with her kissing or hitting her. The big advantage of the film is that Peters is a heavy blade but lacks Hollywood glamor (Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role). Candy is not innocent, but she is very vulnerable, constantly moving and hitting men. Widmark strikes his cold at the first meeting and wakes him up, pouring his beer over his face, but on the last act he has a lot of delicacy for him (after he has been one Hell of Kiley). The scene at Peters and Widmark Hospital should not work, but it does. <br /> <br /> Thelma Ritter is great as a stoolie fashion that deserves its Oscar nomination. Ritter's production, like everything else in the movie, is sharp, real, and heart-breaking. His death scene is stunning. Of particular interest are Fuller camera movements and location settings. Fuller loved a good close-up picture and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of inconvenient, tidy, tight techniques that only increase plot tension. Fuller is not afraid to let the camera capture for longer than normal Old-Hollywood really, but pulls Ritter's death away from the scene to give the audience maximum impact. Near and unusual, the corners facing the camera give the PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET a bold and uncompromising contemporary look. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
