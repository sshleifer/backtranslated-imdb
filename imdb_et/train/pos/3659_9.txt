This movie was my first touch with Mr Sica, so I really didn't know what to expect. But what I saw broke all my expectations - a good way. <br /> <br /> The story is not complicated and shows us the life of the boy's orphans, and especially his connection with the poor community of people who, together, built simple metal plate hoods. This small town in another city lives its life and things are going well. But one day there is water supply and a rich nobleman is interested in buying a place. But if the movie's title suggests - there is a miracle. Our character gets his dead mother's miracle dove. What does he plan to do to protect his friends and the whole built city? <br /> <br /> It was just a natural comedy masterpiece. It shows the behavior of poor people and how money and wealth can be spoken and played with people. There are also many funny moments and scenes involved - at first, on the spot where the sun shines and much more. <br /> <br /> So as I am not a comedy lover, you should see this movie because I liked it a lot <br /> <br />
