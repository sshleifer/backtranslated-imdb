The friend took me to this movie and was skeptical about the Swedish movie with subtitles. However, I enjoyed this beautiful film thoroughly every minute. Unnecessary cruelty that a person can do was depicted confidently without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may need to hide their eyes for the first 10 minutes in a few seconds. The traditional humility and brutality and hope for the tragedy were satisfactorily characterized by a fresh corner with signs of very natural errors and functions. I especially liked how the film managed to deal with the hypocritical human attitude of bias, discrimination and sacred pretense. The absolute pearl of the film, which I listen to all who listen.
