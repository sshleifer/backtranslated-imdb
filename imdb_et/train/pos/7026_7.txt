When I was 17, my high school had directed Bye Bye Birdie - which is not a big surprise because it is the perfect high school material and reputed to be the world's most staged music. <br /> <br /> I was a music student and retained strong memories of production and songs, and Dick Van Dyke's film version, which was (deliberately) obscuring Elvis's references and launching it for a despicable 60's audience. <br /> <br So when the 1995 version of Jason Alexander starred in my cable TV screen, I was pleased with what I saw. Alexander turns Albertina's extraordinary performance into a dramatic contrast to her well-known well-known television series. The rest are fun and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who doesn't see her part, supposedly naive and innocent schoolgirl). <br /> <br /> The best musical performances at the show are all preserved in this movie and are presented as musical songs (to allow for the absence of a stage). <br /> <br /> So if you know the music (and there are few), check out this telemovie. This shows that the stage shows justice in a way that probably cannot be improved, which is good enough for me. What is better than changing the work of a writer to faith and color and style?
