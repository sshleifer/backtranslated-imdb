************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason I saw this movie and it was because I have a large number of Richard Belzer. I don't know much about humor. There was a part that was funny like Barbie and Ken Spoof and the dealers and the president. Remember, this is sometimes dirty (dare I say crude oil?) It was sometimes funny, but it could have been better. Probably, if they spent more time in humor and less time to get rid of women, the film would have been funny. Some sketches make you want to drag, and other sketches make you laugh and wonder strangely. Sorry, this movie is dated. If you have the crazy Richard Belzer (so worth it), you should check it out and see chevy chase.
