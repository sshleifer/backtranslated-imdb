To all unhappy people who have done everything in dialogue, budget, this and that ... who wants to hear it? If you missed this beautiful movie, it is your loss. The rest of us who love this movie deeply don't care about what you think. I'm a thirthyshinghing man who has seen thousands of movies in his life and it's in his book in his book. It wasn't supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual overview of what happened that night. It's the most wonderful love story you've ever tried. I know it's cynical in the 90's and the millennium is all tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comment board complained that he made too much money! How flat is this? It made packs of money in every civilized country on the planet, and it is the toughest film on the planet. I am happy to be the majority of the majority. Okay, cynics, it's time to climb back, I'm ready.
