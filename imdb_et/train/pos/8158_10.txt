"Fear of a black hat" is all that (much weaker) "CB-4" should be. The satirical eye of Rusty Cundieff is ruthless when he folds, spindles and distorts all aspects of hip-hop trends and culture. Does "FoaBH" look like a spinal cord? Yes, a little. Is the spinal cord touch a derivative? Not really. The goal is more focused, satire is better focused and, frankly, it's more fun.
