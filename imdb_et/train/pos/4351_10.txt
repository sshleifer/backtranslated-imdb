Peter Falk is a versatile and achievable actor. The film is well written and the actor seems to be a real life. It is a good job for all Columbo lovers. Because it shows what talent Peter Falk is. He doesn't play a detective who is playing a retired carpenter. By the time credit comes into play, you want to look at it again. The interesting part of the film is that the message applies to every person who follows it; the depth of its relevance is the only thing that varies. It is a shame that Hollywood liberals only promote skin and skin because it is a movie that business people should be proud of. It would be a great movie that would become a live play.
