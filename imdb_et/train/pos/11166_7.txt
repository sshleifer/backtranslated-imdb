George Raft, who is Steve Brodie, a reckless, dancing gambler who can never dare to refuse, has been tortured against sentimental, sentimental Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). A soft touch to every panhandler, Connors takes an impulsive waifs and strays, especially the runaway orphan "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, with kittens!) And homeless Lucy Calhoun, an extraterrestrial, ambitious to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this male-dominated culture, communication is mainly in the form of violence (seeing why BOWERY is Martin Scorsese's favorite). The exploding cigars offer running crap. "Swipes" enjoys throwing stones through the windows of Chinatown, one time washing out. (The simultaneous arrival of both Brodie and Beery volunteer firefighting companies will result in a blow to the ground during which the building burns.) Beery randomly drives a girl and casts someone who disagrees with her, including the Brodie she wins, a fist fight at night to moor to regain control of his cabin, lost his contribution to Brodie's courage to jump from Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie makes a leap, but only because the last moment with the dummy fails.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills a framed detail to delight in the everyday life of the fillet; Singers waiters, bullying barmen, Suicide Hall whores who are busy with Black Maria, talk about unhappy strangers and force them to buy inappropriate clothes they don't want. A small but admirable little movie.
