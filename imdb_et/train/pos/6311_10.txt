This movie is a lot of fun and has a lot of actors, like William H. Macy, who has always played such a role, perhaps his most representative Fargo; and George Clooney, who is a very good actor who shows his comedian work with Brothers Cohen in the movie "Oh Brother, where are you?" what results are my favorite movies ever! But it has been difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood", here in Mexico. My city has no good places to buy good movies. I tried to buy it in Blockbuster, but they don't know it by the original name, so maybe it's easier to find it when I have the name they gave him in Mexico, does anyone know that? do not remember!
