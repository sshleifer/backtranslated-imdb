Somewhat reminiscent of the great Westerners of the 1940s, such as the "Sierra Madre Treasure" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story of conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is down and out, but honest, a young man from Texas who goes to the West for work and money. He finds both, but not as he expected. <br /> <br /> The movie scenario includes many surprises and plot twists. Excellent cinematography, editing of cinematography and modern Western music add tension and tension. The enlargement of the great sky is an excellent opportunity. And the acting goes great, with great performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's specially registered country / western song gives the film a strong final. <br /> <br /> The correct name for Neo-Noir is "Red Rock West" for me. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and unlikely timing, so others can handle the scenario wrongly. I usually agree. In this case, combined with a moody atmosphere and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty from normal everyday life, the coincidence and the unlikely timing story that is outside of "noirish." surreal. It is almost the same as intentionally interfering with events to force Michael into his own hands. From this point of view, the coincidences are not the shortcomings of the script at all. These are the necessary plots that point to a spooky story of young men who have to face their demons ... hidden in other characters. <br /> <br /> Everything we need here is Rod Serling, a postcard, explaining his always pronounced voice that ... a young man looking for himself stops in a small, almost abandoned city a thousand miles away . This is his last placement on the journey ... into the dark zone.
