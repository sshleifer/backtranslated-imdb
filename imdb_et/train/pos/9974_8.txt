Of course, this was a remake of a 70-year-old movie, but it had a relationship and action with the current movie, saying Breakdown. She works, is desperately at her hospital with a woman, the police are least concerned. The layers were very good, the part where he was <br /> <br /> at the rest stop was well done, at the end of the movie was a great fisherman. It's better than Bullitt, a boring movie, a muscle car that was filmed badly? The character of Vigo knew what he had to do to escape Johnny Law, the few films had an effect-night vision, CB-okay forgot the name of the movie, the boy had grown up in 76'Caddy, the boy he was upset with. The end is great, you can't tell if he's fooling himself or not, very good-not-doing-or-not.
