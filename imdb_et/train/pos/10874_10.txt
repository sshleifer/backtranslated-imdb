I have to admit that I waited for something different from the first night of the Cut, although I was delighted with the unexpected horror of Australia. I am a true horror blower as they come, and found that "Cut" is not only Australia's best genres, but one of the late parody / comedy films. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that traditional audiences may not receive many comic elements - the movie was not too smart in this app, but made me laugh every time trying to fit into any possible horror music clip. I'm sure it was meant to be humor .... hoping it was meant for humor. <br /> <br /> And of course there was gore. <br /> <br /> 'Customized garden gardens were brilliant - in addition to expected poles and slashes. In short, in many violent deaths, there was a great deal of variety of creativity and creativity, even enough to favor the skeptics of this film. <br /> <br /> Both Kylie Minogue's appearance (short as her look was) and Molly Ringwald were another reason to watch the movie - both performances were fantastic, as well as Simon Bossell ("The Castle"), which is a great joke technician. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the last few or a year of horror products, as well as a beautiful satire / parody - toungue-in-cheek to the end. <br /> <br /> Loved it. Look at this!
