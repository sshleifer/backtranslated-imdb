Young Victoria is a beautiful film and has given Queen Victoria another light that everyone thinks about her. The films sweep away the impression of "I am not amused" by Queen Victoria and show she was a joyful young woman. <br /> <br /> As I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine your reaction when I first saw this movie advertised, so excited and counting those days until it came to the cinema. I was a little worried that it would not be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I found new facts about Queen Victoria, who didn't know before, and it was very interesting to me. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria, in many lights, was one of our greatest monarchs of all time. real personality and his life. His mother's counsel, Sir John Conroy, treated him so badly that he wanted Britain to become a regency. It was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic queen of what she was! Her and Albert's romance was so deep, and it was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, both of them great! Young Victoria is a love affair for the heart, but at the same time looks at a lot of British history ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
