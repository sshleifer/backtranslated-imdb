Telemundo should definitely consider making a short story Xica DVD collection! I know a lot of people including myself who would like to buy novela Xica! It is a very fun novel located in Brazil. The costumes of the actors are beautiful and the city where the novel takes place is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history of this time period. I want Telemundo to resend it, even if it's 2 in the morning. I would highly recommend Xica if it is ever shown in Telemund. I've already reported a million times to Telemundo by email, but my claims have fallen on deaf people. The only caveat on Xica is that sometimes it contains some harsh scenes, so I would advise children under 14 years of age not to look at Xica. In general, Xica has 10 out of 10!
