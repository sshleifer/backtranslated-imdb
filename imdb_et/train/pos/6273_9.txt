I really loved this movie, yes, I know it was pretty far out, there is no way that the Shelby car would have been able to stay on both the road and 540i with all its traction controls and other gizmos, but not the whole movie well assembled. The drill was normally excellent and the rest was pretty good, except for Brit Bad Guy, he was a little too much, what do you think? Anyway, a great movie, great cars and a great actor. I did one that my car was closed and disturbed in my remote controlled garage. :)
