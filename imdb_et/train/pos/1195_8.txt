I saw this movie about twenty years ago during a late show. I still remember a lively movie, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought that Taylor was undervalued as an actor, as most critics saw him as a solid, almost boring leader of a human type, and women simply loved watching his films because of his appearance. However, this film proved what an interesting actor he could be. He did not play such a role during his long career. This is his best performance. He's absolutely incredible in a really bad role. What I read was a very hardworking and simple person in real life and never won enough for such a role. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could have dealt with more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how annoying the character of Lloyd Nolan was. Nolan was a great actor but this character really deepened me. The last scene in the movie has been stuck in those years. This movie is definitely worth it.
