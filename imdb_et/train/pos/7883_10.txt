I saw this movie with a friend and we couldn't laugh! I mean, there was nothing terrifying about this movie! It was funny all the lines Freddy said fun! I think they haven't even made a new nightmare and just went to Freddy Vs. jason. Although some parts were large (as the head blows). and all the 1-5 year old foot films are sucked. it was best after number 1. I don't recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you have nothing else to rent and you laugh a lot. I want to see a massacre of a texas chainsaw that I think would be scary. Freddy Dead Final Nightmare: B-
