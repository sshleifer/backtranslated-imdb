Barbara Stanwyck gives this early, so-called Douglas Sirk-directed universal soap to the shock you need. Not nearly as memorable as Sirk's later melodrama, it's easy to see, looking at "All I Desire", where Sirk is moving in the next few years. Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to his family in the United States after they had ten years earlier. His family and community have different emotions in dealing with their shocking return. Part of the cinematography is amazing and Stanwyck is a tough nail and really gives this film energy. In general, it's a pretty good show.
