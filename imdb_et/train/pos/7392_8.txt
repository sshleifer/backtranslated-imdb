I like this movie a lot. It is a great chemistry between actors and tells a story that is quite universal, the story of a booming son. The most pleasant aspect, however, was how the bathroom was more than just a story. When the father told his son about his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the water and bathing element becomes an almost sacred ritual. There was so little water that a simple bath had a deep depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was very effective. However, there were moments when he turned "too" to sweet ... within the limits of the park. But generally I recommend this movie.
