Winter Day, December 28, 1986, two films at age 14 are eternal. "Hmmmm, police story, it seems interesting," "who is Jackie Chan?", "Never heard of him". Two hours later, after watching the movie, we wanted to learn more about it inadvertently. 16 years later (and with JC movie collection), the movie is still like no other. Ok, maybe I have a soft place for this because it was my "first" (Cannonball Run doesn't read !!) JC movie, but it's a great movie. It has all the classic JC elements, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments say it's dated, it was made in 1985, of course it's dated! But then Jaws, Casablanca, Singin's Rain and Godfather !!!!!! Without a movie like a police story where Hollywood action would be today? PS settings, many scenes are stolen for use in other movies. To really understand it, you need to see it on the widescreen, otherwise you will be so busy (yes, it really drops around the bus!). If you haven't already, look at this MOVIE NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
