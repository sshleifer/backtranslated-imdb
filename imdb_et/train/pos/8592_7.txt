Good evening entertainment - but the plot was not convincing. Garrison's first wife was unrealistic and passionate; The president was a cardboard cut. And who were still the villains? Nothing was developed or explained enough. I still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole was involved. Roisto was anonymous and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in your plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to inject a story into reality - chasing and confronting was good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both unbelievable in their role, Basinger had no character at all and Longoria couldn't be a secret agent. It could have been a very good movie, but it was somehow missed, too many unanswered questions. Disappointment despite the very good scenes. And did they use the "West Wing" set for the White House scenes? - Waiting for CJ or Charlie to appear!
