The man who led the "Third Man" also led the "Who buys" the sequence "Oliver!" Now that it's talent. <br /> <br /> I'll raise my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know there is a "second unit" but still ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br /> I think quality goes out. <br /> <br /> (It will appear in the last scene with Nancy [avoiding the spoiler - all must see Oliver for the first time].) How many lines should I write. <br /> <br /> Don't encourage people to write too much. <br /> <br /> I hope it will be considered a "tenth line".
