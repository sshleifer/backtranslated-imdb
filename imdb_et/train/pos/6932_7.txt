WINCHESTER 73 is a story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) whose obsession was the return of a repeated rifle made by Winchester. The rifle hands change and Stewart keeps it steady. This 1950 B & W effort by Anthony Mann is more than a traditional western criminal film, and traders often look like modern gangsters as old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman who has a questionable round who runs a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) with whom he can marry. He falls on Stewart, but not before he goes a little. Winters are the most complex character of a film filled with unusual characters. See that young Dan Dureyea is a tiny killer and Tony Curtis plays a very small role. Woatt Earp plays a shameful failure of Will Geer.
