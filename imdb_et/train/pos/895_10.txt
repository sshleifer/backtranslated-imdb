I've seen this movie. This movie is best for today's needs. Divorce is a big problem today. This is the best film when presenting this issue. In this film, Indian values ​​are very well outlined. Today's youth must understand this problem. The number of girls is smaller. And because of this problem, girls have committed suicide. If this problem persists, the day when the girl is not is not far off. So, remember this statement, today's young people have to realize that we cannot take bonds in marriages. We need to learn from this movie that Dowry shouldn't take it. And when we understand this problem, we see a new trend in society. This is the biggest change in society.
