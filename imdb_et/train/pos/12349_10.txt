this movie just shows that you don't need large discs, mile-billion-dollar computer graphics or high-paid actors and actors to make a good movie. All you need is a great story and a plot. Captain Akira Kurosawa of all Japanese films excels perfectly. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the epic period. and those who enjoy Kurosaat had previous work. 10/10
