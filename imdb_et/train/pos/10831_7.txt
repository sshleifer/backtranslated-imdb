Great pain makes this movie work; all the characters have developed extremely well and it is clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not exactly the comedy I was expecting, youthful splendor is trying to restore much more white vision than stupid humor. For music fans there are quite a few subtle references, which in itself are smart jokes. <br /> <br /> I hate making direct comparisons with other movies, but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker's films, which I can't help with: Imagine if the commitments really make it big - and then tried for 25 years later to mention the honor.
