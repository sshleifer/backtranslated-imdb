I watched this movie a second time to try to find out why it was not as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have, and discovered a remarkable artistic value - which could ultimately be its commercial cancellation. /> <br /> First of all, this film tries to "serious" scientific literature, social commentary, more than an action-adventure. It is, but it's not really what it is. If you focus on it, you (as others have pointed out) will reach a bad "alien" clone. But again, this is not what it concerns. <br /> <br /> The film is really about transforming Todd (Kurt Russell) from man to almost machine and back to man (mostly * back *). But since it does not try to give you a typical response to Hollywood style, Kurt Russell has to do the conversation without speaking and largely without broad expression. And it does a wonderful job - it can take two views to evaluate it. <br /> <br /> The surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it has never been sufficiently explained whether Todd's ability to hold his army supposedly superior forces arises from his experience on the battlefield or his renewed human being, or what, but the film still makes a great presentation Russell (easy to underestimate) talents.
