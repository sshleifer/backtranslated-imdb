In the first week of May, Holocaust memories are brought back through films every year through televisions. Among the many films they showed, it was what I didn't see. <br /> <br /> The story is related to Hilter's life and how he came to power. It starts from childhood and ends with the highest position in Germany. <br /> <br /> The movie was first featured in the TV series and later turned into a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and burning to give this person a real idea. <br /> <br /> This is a good scenario and narrative that teaches the general public about Hitler's leading events. and try to show Hitler's likely psychological composition. Is the film a biased view by Christian Duguay? who shows Hitler as one of the trails, threatening, angry and screaming man? who was so strong to the Germans and to the people around him. Hitler is not shown as someone with charishma and attraction, and the film fails to convince Hitler. <br /> <br /> Although it was a TV, all production components are first-rate and equivalent to any mainstream film. The production value, kits, costumes, etc. were perfect. <br /> <br /> This film has been criticized for the authenticity of historical events. But still, this movie is exciting, interesting and fun. Robert Carlyle crosses and dominates the screen as no one else does. He's amazingly good? brilliant! I would have liked Hitler's life to be more balanced, because I think Hitler was able to bring out millions of German feelings, and not just the one charged with the Holocaust. As I have said many times, that? very unfortunately - our society loves the incitement or prosecution of one person, as a good or evil representative of society.
