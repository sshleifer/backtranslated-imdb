very few chess movies have been made in the last couple of years, but that's more than just a chess movie, which is a story about the need for love and the need to win it, John Toturro plays a psychologically challenged person, nothing important for him is 64 squares and 32 pieces , the game confirms him as a person if he loses the game he loses, one thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses it in a beautiful form, even a woman's love was not enough to save her from her sad existence. It makes you wonder if there is other Luzonid who are there, I'm sure they are, if you are a chess enthusiast, it doesn't hurt to watch it. well and well done work, he will achieve his goals, unfortunately I doubt whether it will continue.
