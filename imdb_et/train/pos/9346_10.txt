If you didn't enjoy the movie, either dead or hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> Excellent cast, all who gave good results. This film proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler is becoming a highly acclaimed actress. It all started with his performance in Big Daddys, he made a couple of bad movies, then he broke terribly on Monday, the longest yard, then clicking and now ruled me. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest thing to the family is his mother-in-law and in-law-in-law. After her old college roommate (Cheadle), she got around her life. I'm not saying anymore because I don't want to destroy the movie, but I strongly recommend this movie. One of the best films of 2007.
