I go out to the limb and actually protect the "Shades of Gray" as a good clip-on episode that came to the struggle between Commander William Thomas Riker's life and death, who fought for a deadly disease. > <br /> The scenes from the rebound sequences were implemented quite well with the mood Riker was in a situation as he recovered his romantic episodes like "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". The tragic moments were highlighted, such as the death of Tasha in "Skin Evil", as well as "Heart of Inflammation", "Conspiracy", and the "Bad Skin" mentioned above. Riker also showed courage in the light of some humorous jokes like "My ancestor was bitten by a rattlesnake ... 3 days after intense pain, the snake died." This episode highlighted Will Riker's psychological challenge under extreme strength. And yes, I think I am biased to declare "gray tones" as a solid episode, because during my initial incitement, my face was covered with sweat, wondering if Riker would be alive and alive. see other great, galactic, outdoor adventures that go beyond the ultimate limit ... <br /> <br /> Of course, in the coming years I seem to have formed the singular opinion of this particular episode ... but if the prize should go to "the best journalism episode in television history" , I believe that this episode should be highly appreciated in this respect.
