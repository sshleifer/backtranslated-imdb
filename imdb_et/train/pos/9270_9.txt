I have to emphasize before you read this review that it is by no means a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something about it, if hopefully you see that I am generally against politicians ... ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran because this movie is forbidden there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). What a shame, because the film is great. Wouldn't it be "Grbavica", this movie would have won the Berlin International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Rightly so (it was in second place or second if you wanted it). Why? Because it's a movie about oppression. It's not even that it's a complete women's problem. It's about the government trying to keep people in control. By analogy, it is clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But with this prohibition, nothing has been solved and / or they can disappear! The second reviewer was a very concise line: "Comedy from Tragedy", which summarizes it quite well!
