"Against All Flags" is a classic laugh. It has all the elements that an adventure fan could expect in this area and more, a girl in trouble is not really in trouble. Like Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is the best athletic, with enemies running through the period against social standards. Anthony Quinn rounds off the top three actors like the ruthless captain Roc Brasiliano and turns out to be charming for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic adventure fan, "Against All Flags" is a black and black. Although it may not be in the same league as some of Errol Flynn's earlier work (such as Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk), it is still a very fun romp.
