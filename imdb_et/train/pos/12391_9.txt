Small Spoilers <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a successful top model living with her lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon). She tried to commit suicide twice in the past: for the first time she was a teenager and saw her father cheat on her mother with two women in her home, and when Michael's wife died. Since then he has left Christ and the Catholic Church. Alison wants to live alone in her own apartment, and with the help of a real public official, Miss Logan (Ava Gardner), she finds an excellent furnished old apartment in Brooklyn Heights for a reasonable rent. In the window of the last floor of the building, he sees a strange man and Miss Logan announces that he is Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a dark priest living alone and supported by the Catholic Church. Alison moves to her new place and, when she is there, she gets to the guest: her neighbor Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith) welcomes her and introduces her new neighbors. He then invites Alison to his cat for Jezebel's birthday at night. The next day, her apartment and her health will happen to Alison with strange things. Alison is looking for Miss Logan and will be informed that she lives with the priest in the building. Further investigation shows that all the persons you knew in his party were dead criminals. With a frightened situation, Alison grabs Christ again, while Michael examines the horrible events. Alison realizes that he lives in the gate of hell. <br /> <br /> Although IMDb's user rating is underestimated, Sentinel is one of the best horror movies. I've seen this movie at least six times, for the first time in the 70's, in the cinema. On September 7, 2002, I purchased the imported DVDs and saw it again. Yesterday I saw this movie again. Even after so many years, this movie is still terrible. The terrible and spooky story scares even today. The constellations of letters and stars are cast. At the beginning of your career you will see many actors and actors who became famous. Fear movie fans will surely worship "Sentinel" and I'm one of them. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sentinela dos Malditos" ("The Sentinel of the Damned") <br /> <br /> Obs.
