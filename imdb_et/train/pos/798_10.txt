This wonderful drama gave me all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for one second, because every word was united by its mysterious murder. This film touched me because it showed how sad and difficult life could be. I really cried at the end (which I don't want to give away!) Also let me understand how cruel and sick the person may be in the murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only bad cast member was Anne Marie played the actor. The actor did a great job, but the director didn't. I say this because he found someone who didn't see himself like Anne Marie Fahey.
