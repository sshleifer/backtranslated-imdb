Don't listen to prissy critics who are probably bitter players yet painful roasting Silverman disgracefully gave them Spike TV Video Game Awards a few months ago, "Sarah Silverman" is wonderfully bizarre, surreal, immature, ridiculous and would fit quite nicely in the adult swimming line. If Silverman highlights juvenile "doody" jokes and highlights a darker, unthinking downstream, then this exhibition is just a hint, we may have one of the greatest cult comedies since the canceled "Strangers With Candy". But just looking at the pilot, its just a solid, outstanding, outstanding dark comedy / musical but huge potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman has created a fun, fun child's wife - a more beautiful, younger, Jewish American princess from the late big Jerry Blank and one of the most unusual, non-stereotypical images of the gay couple I've ever seen on television. Early reviews suggest that the next couple of episodes will cross the pilot so I can't wait to see how this exhibition is developing.
