"FULL HOUSE" is, in my opinion, an absolute ABC class! I'm not sure if I've ever seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) get married. If you want to know how funny it is, you would have seen it yourself. It was two-part, so you should have seen both parts. Another of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) enter Michelle's birthday station. You should have seen it yourself if you wanted to know how and why it happened. I also have many others I like. Everyone always gave good results, production design was remarkable, costumes were well designed and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in syndicates, I urge you to catch it only when it gets out of the air.
