Wow, praise IMDb and Google because I've been trying to remember this f'ing awesome movie name for over 15 years. Slaughter High, man! Hell yes! <br /> <br /> I'm not going to bring you the plot summary and the actors and yadda yadda yadda, because you all know what's going on. That's why you're still here. But what I do is to explain the memorable memory of the 80-year-old D-Movie Slave. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was about 7, my father rented all these horror films. Would he care that his children would watch them with him? No. So, I saw Slaughter High at this young age. I saw this movie for a long time with me. I haven't seen it, but I remember most of the ridiculous killings in the movie. For example, a post-sex scene (why is a metal bed in school)? Or if the boy is drowned in the pool. Come on! My personal favorite, but ... broken beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie where one of the characters finds beer in an abandoned school, such as 10 or 15 years later, and thinks it would be good to drink it? Then his stomach explodes? What !? And this big line: Let's take our car ... it always starts. Classic crap. I mean, I'll look back almost 20 years later and laugh. But when I was 7, I was scary. That hat hat (or was that a mask?) That killer tends to break me f * ck out! <br /> <br /> All in all, yes, a terrible movie. But for nostalgia and a sense of humor, this movie gets 10 out of 10. Stay up late every night and hope to get the same Late Late Late Movie exhibition, or take a VHS copy and dust out of the VCR.
