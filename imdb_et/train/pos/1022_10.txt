Stargate is the best show ever. All participants are absolutely perfect for their roles. I love the interplay between characters. If you haven't seen this example, I highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star Track, there is a lot of time that it really can't, because it is completely different. I am a perfect trickster, but I would appreciate it showing well over a few stars. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV, so if I want to see it, I have to buy a DVD and the 10th season is not here yet so I can't see it for a while (which is very frustrating). However, this program is very good and must see it, but warn that it is very addictive. So in the summer I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
