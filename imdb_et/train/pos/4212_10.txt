Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, is Pickup South Street a harsh, brutal, and well-made film from his pocket (Richard Widmark), inadvertently acquiring a secret microfilm and becoming a target for espionage agents. Jean Peters is also involved as a harsh broad who is used as a criminal by his evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. This is the film-noir's best and although the performances are very good for his great character actress Thelma Ritter, who steals the movie. Since Moe is a tired street cushion selling necklaces (and who also sells information), he has a terrible role that brought him another Oscar nomination. He's amazing that Miss Ritter was named the Academy Award six times and never won. It should have been his job!
