I've known Bettie's page for years. Its 1950s soft core images have so far become an icon and still have a strong drawing. The "Bettie Page" look is also a very popular heterosexual fetish world and is as distinctive as it is today. So I watched this movie pretty little. The result was no disappointment. <br /> <br /> Among other things, was it really interesting to see the real features of the movie, such as Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager? all have trailblazers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job of creating the desired atmosphere of American sexual repression and hypocrisy in the 1950s with sexuality that was the extreme standard of today's standard. I especially liked using black and white as a visual transcript for the emotional and spiritual climate that Bettie himself found. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol did an excellent job of presenting Bettie's character to all of his innocent sexuality and all his complete na√Øve. Bettie loved to look pretty, loved the attention, didn't see anything wrong with the nudity and enjoyed dressing up the camera with "foolish equipment". The underlying sexuality and deep fetish desires that everyone created were completely lost to him. He still does not understand what his pictures or their S&M content is about. "It does not mean that he is uneducated or too easy to understand that he just can't get on fetishism and never gets. There's no harm. Bettie Page is just what he is. The film captured it quite nicely. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s, represented by Mrs Harron and written by Guinevere Turner, makes me truly happy to live the day and age that I do. Hypocrisy and repression with massive ignorance of our sexuality all with a frighteningly stifling world. The film captures and rejoices, because Bettie can withstand all that she cannot do with her amazing faith and unchanging naivety. <br /> <br /> This movie was occasionally slow but hit all the points Harron tried and hit well. I even recommend this film to people who have little knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what its impact on American culture was. People with such interests must see this film.
