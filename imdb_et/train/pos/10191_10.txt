What is included in this disc is a first-class presentation with the first-rate band. This disc is not heart-weak ... music is incredibly intense and very cool. What you learn when you watch this movie is why Who was so great for so long. It is true that their documents were great, but their exhibitions were on a bunch. In 1969, when this concert was beaten, screaming teenie-bopper and bands (and audiences) from the bucket of the Beatles capsule went into a long and often astonishing example of musical virtuosity - something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity of Britney and Christina's preserved music. What you are learning here is amazing things that can happen when talented musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try out the concert, it's really amazing.
