I work in the library and hope to enjoy this movie when it appeared five years ago. Well I liked Parker Posey a lot (he's a great actor) and Omar Townsend was really cute as his boyfriend (he couldn't act but if you look like the one who cares?), The movie was bad. It was neither funny nor cute nor anything. Posey kept the movie with his energy. But did he study Dewey's decoding system OVERNIGHT and then shelves tons of books for beating music ?? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had a problem with how he saw when he became a full-fledged librarian at the end - hair in the neck, glasses, with no sense of humor - can we allow this stereotype? It is worth looking at Posey and Townsend, but that's it. The TV series was much better.
