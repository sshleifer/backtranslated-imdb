Another Care Bears film is better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, better character development and stories (especially closing songs) are both memorable and warm-hearted. Of course, the film tends to overdo it, but it is a film of care branches. This film is a great picture to show to children, because it emphasizes friendship, love and caring again. Not to mention Care Bears is just too divine!
