I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm glad I saw it. Intelligent, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I wasn't quite sure how the director can create something, but leave it to Natal and the brilliant people C.O.R.E. Create another small budget that seems real (both real and nothing). It is worth your time and money if you have the opportunity to see it, please go. You're glad you did.
