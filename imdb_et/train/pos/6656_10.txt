This movie is just awesome. It was a very sensitive subject and the movie was great. This film did not create any contradictions in India (as far as I know) and its disclosure was also considered low. At first I thought this film would be just a waste of time because most of India the directors and producers used the topic, although it is very sensitive and adds the original story and love that violates the whole thing ... most Indian viewers would agree to this when they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC and so on. <br /> <br /> In India, there have been so many movies that would have become a milestone or mega hit if the love story wasn't added unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> But its treatment is quite similar to the Pinjar film (also a must-watch). <br /> <br /> If it reads, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (Director) for making such a great movie.
