Well, it's been a long year and I'm just reviewing the 2004 final movie. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) was second in the last Metro Manila film festival. As expected, it did not do as much as it was normal for the mobile, especially since MMFF is the season when many families go to watch movies. <br /> <br /> It was quite intriguing to see a movie that wasn't in Filipino or English. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job as a star and director. His great vision and creativity helped this film. He also had a very leading character and was able to express the various emotions needed for the film. The young actor Rebecca Lusterio also worked well. He did a great job of being a younger son of Duroy Bikay. I hope I will see him in many more film projects in the future, perhaps one another in other genres. I think that the fact that this movie was in his local dialect really helped him. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots in the movie were done very well. The landscape was done breathtakingly, although I feel that if I had a little bit of a bit of a different look. <br /> <br /> As for the story, I feel that writers could have been in the lives of even fewer characters. film. I definitely can't get the story of this movie.
