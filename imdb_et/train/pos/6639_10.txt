You are using IMDb. <br /> <br /> You have given some of your favorite movie a nice voice. <br /> <br /> This is something you enjoy. <br /> <br /> And that's all about it. Fifty seconds. One world ends, the other begins. <br /> <br /> How can you not give it ten? I mean to those who give this seven or eight ... exactly how could the FIRST FILM ever be better? A record, a long, still opening image is a great showmanship, a great innovation that fits perfectly with the situation. And a bicycle dog is a cute touch. All this in fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The genius is often superfluous. <br /> <br /> It's a genius.
