I'm probably one of the biggest fans of Nancy Drew. I've read every book three times and I've played a lot of Nancy games. I loved this movie. He kept you entertained all the time you looked at it. I went about ten of my friends and everyone loved it. Three women sat behind us who seemed to be in their late 30s in the early '40s and asked them how they liked it, they said they loved it! So you can see that this is entertainment for all ages. You just have to give him a chance. And it also teaches the lesson, be yourself, even if everything around you is exactly the same. Overall, this step was great. I see it a second time now! So stop it please. This is a really good movie!
