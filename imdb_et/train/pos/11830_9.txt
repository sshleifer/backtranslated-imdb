This is an amazing look where the whole thing is done in just six or seven colors. When it came over 15 years ago, he stunned his audience with his color scheme, being so different from any other film. These colors, for me, make it an absolutely exciting movie to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes that I would like to freeze and somehow transform into learning to paint. <br /> <br /> Characters and story do not match the size of photography, but they are all up, especially the villains. Famous actors who played them here must be "fun" in "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and his girlfriend Tess Truehart, and he is as sweet and soft as his name. Another good add-on is Charlie Korsmo, because the offender's young boy Dick and Tess are coming under their wing. Colorful other characters are known by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other known names, but there are too many of them here. Check out the full credits on the main page and you'll be amazed. <br /> <br /> The only negative position I found was the voice of Pacino, which won you for some time, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would be about 10 minutes better. These "bugs" are all small, because in general it is a fun movie .... cartoon strips that live in an incredibly colorful fashion ..... like nothing you have never seen before.
