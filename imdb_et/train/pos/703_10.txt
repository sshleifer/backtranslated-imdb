I appreciated this ten just because I find it so impressive that one eighteen year old camcorder can do. It's not epic, but it's a lot of fun and I was never bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go into numerous bad films that are massively cast, give this director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know I'm a local cinema for my first big edition. Damn good work and money. What a script! It may be a low budget, but it wins over the big images recently seen by hell. Nanavati knows how to tell the story both in writing and on the screen. Serious defendants for him, can not wait to see more.
