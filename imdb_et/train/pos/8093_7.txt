My friend's idea was to look at the animated LOTR after seeing the return of Peter Jackson's king. So I finally bought out the e-bay, thinking right from the start that he was going to suck. In fact, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Animation was a good time, they used a unique method to combine live activities with animation to create interesting effects, and a man who made Frodo's voice sounded somewhat like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> The book's greatest adaptation, but trust me, I've seen much worse. It misses quite a bit of things, because both the Fellowship and the two towers are compressed for two hours. Worth a watch, kids may like it, but still, the absoutley is not comparable to Peter Jackson's trilogy.
