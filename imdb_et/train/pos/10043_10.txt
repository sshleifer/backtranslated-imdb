This movie re-wrote any film history. No one cares about what anyone thinks about this film, because it goes beyond criticism. Every movie's error is easily overcome with the many amazing things the film has done for it. This is a very beautiful movie and I doubt many of us will see something like that again. I've seen more than I think, and I can still repeat it, feeling what is hard to describe. One for ages.
