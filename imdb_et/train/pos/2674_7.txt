If concentrating on boat, boat, bus, bus trips is a waste of time, you should go back to Hollywood movies that offer this part of a single assembly to get money. In doing so, leave you unrelated and cinematic inconvenience resulting from the actual display of reality. Long outbound travel sequences allow viewers the same disappointment and "waiting time" that characters have to endure. Depressing? yes. Vital? Indeed. an obstacle to this journey is the key to the "root" of this Turkish family. Beautiful movie with a great example. Sad, but worth it.
