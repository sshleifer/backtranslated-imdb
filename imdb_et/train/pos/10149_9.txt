A sweet funny story of two people crossing the road as they prepare for their wedding. The ex-policeman and the public school teacher fall into each other in this great New York environment, although they marry other people. Maybe a little trick that "partners" are both A-type personalities, while our main characters are much relaxed. Nothing hard, but it made me smile. And hey guys - sell Natasha Henstridge's angle and gals - sell them cute romance, everyone wins!
