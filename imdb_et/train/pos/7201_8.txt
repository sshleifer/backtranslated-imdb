A very good dramatic comedy about a playwright who is trying to figure out how to keep his head on water after the end of ideas. The story doesn't make much of the story. I can say that there was little as you see in the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. Little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances.
