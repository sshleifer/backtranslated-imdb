I saw this movie back at the college film festival in the 1970s - I've been waiting for FOREVER to make this movie come out of the video (eventually it's out). It was done in Brazil, so I assumed that it wasn't a video yet. I've been checking out video stores for the past 15 years, waiting for this eminent movie! This is one of my all-time favorites, but it has to be warned, it is strange, as Werner Herzog is weird - its strange reality comes from it. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real incident a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first met the Amazon tribes. The white man has lost the cannibal tribes because they intend to kill him. Before they send him, they make him part of his tribe (their usual). The whole film is like watching a National Geographic documentary when it becomes an accepted member of their tribe. That's it. Cosmic plotline? No. An intense overview of the diversity of human life? Certainly. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... must be warned ... this movie is a nudity - it's not a Hollywood flip that tells the noble wilds ... this movie speaks as it was (read again) above : National Geographic, Super-Realism) <br /> <br />
