In fact, the answer is only a small part of this wonderful Imax film that teaches us gently in selves. C.G. and special cameras - assisted by Imax - represent incredibly average (and external) work of an average person, be it adult men and women, boys and girls or children. Almost every part of the human body is described in detail: digestion, reproduction (Marvin Gaye hits), heart, etc. Some particularly revealing moments include how a baby can be submerged in water and how a brain pulse looks. It's amazing how we work. <br /> <br /> The theme goes through a lot. But we always learn a lot about our body's hell, which we should know *.
