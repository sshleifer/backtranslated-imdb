The first time I was able to see all this, but the forgotten classics, was in the early 1980s, one of our art buildings as a revival. When I looked at this dream of a fever in the sexuality of the 1930s, I was thinking of YOWZA! They got back in Europe with murder. Unfortunately, this film in its original US release reduced the Hayes office with a blue nose (the board of incredible government censorship initiated by the "saint than your" Bible writer, Will Hayes ... a former post office official, if you can believe it), because it is a common topic of human sexuality ( heavily forbidden people actually had sex in the 1930s). The Ecstasy plot is linked to a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a lot older man and later regrets. He (Lamarr) meets a beautiful younger man and has a affair with him, resulting in a divorce from his previous husband (the other is not in Hollywood films, then --- Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the director's first time working in audio format (i.e., the film had the technique used mostly in silent films - i.e., 1920's expressionism). It is still worth looking for a window in early European pictures, with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and Karl Gustav Dryer 'Vampyre (1931). Not rated, but contains this notorious naked swimming scene and some thinly hidden sexual references, which according to today's standards would be slightly more than PG-13 (but would have easily grounded the terrible "X" back in the 30s if it were available) then)
