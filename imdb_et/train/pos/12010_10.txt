Warning: Light spoilers. This film represents events in the life of Joseph Smith, pursued by the Mormons as a prophet in the restoration of the true church of Jesus Christ on earth. So far I've seen the movie twice in my first public month. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith is first the youngest brother of the brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) who is very young, needing surgery. Our modern comfort operation was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show coherence between the Smith family and brothers and Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayer that led to the Mormon First Vision was interesting. . The face of Jesus has never been shown, but you can see an unmistakable nail in your hand. The rejection of religious leaders and many of their New York community is at least slightly sweetened by Joseph's marriage to Emma. <br /> <br /> This movie does not clearly explain the history of the Mormon Church, but simply jumps into the scene. It's not a criticism - just a note of style. <br /> <br /> Practicing the practice of tar and feathers, and it is particularly dramatic and moving when Joseph gives a sermon about the love of the Savior with a loved one, at the same time simultaneously depicting the joy and growth of mormonism as the infant's church, while the ever-growing opposition that spread local authorities. br /> <br /> The film shows many stories about Joseph's life, including some beautiful moments that illustrate his relationship with Emma. Attempts are being made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his infinite love for children, his mind, his courage for dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings and compassion. <br /> <br /> When Joseph and Hyrum drive to Carthage, they will never return home, most of the characters from Joseph's life have been shown along the way, helping to strengthen what had already been seen, but the final scene creation is more powerful. <br /> <br /> Finally, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hybrid is depicted, and the moving ones are thinking about the events they just saw. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie I expected, this church was made to introduce non-members of Joseph Smith. I no longer think this is the case, although I hope the film can do just that. As an insider, I feel that the film is a celebration of Joseph and perfectly strengthens the good things we already know about him. I am curious to see how outsiders look at the film - whether they just see it as a propaganda, an epic story of an American religious man or something else. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully taken away, family-friendly, moving, and hopefully good for everyone. Since the events that have actually taken place in the United States are interesting to think in the light of many aspects of our culture, including freedom of religion and respect (in general) - our contemporaries are self-evident.
