Great activity at Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopsies that hit the screen for a while. Although it covers most of Bettie's young life, he is also able to stay on the mostly focused path, something that most biographical films lack. There are some cute and worryingly funny texts in dialogue and action. This movie is a great break. "American Psycho", and I think it will be due to its best work. Oh, and as a cinematographer, I'll give it to the 100% cine department. It was amazing how well they pulled out the look of the '50s with modern film stocks. D.O.P. Everything is very pleasant. I suggest you see this interesting: 8/10.
