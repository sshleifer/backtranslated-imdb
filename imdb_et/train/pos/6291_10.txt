It was definitely a surprise episode now. This episode is definitely unusual in this series of scientific literature on anthology, where all these foreign creatures, extraordinary events and many other brushes. His seemingly insignificant settings probably do not give any morale at the end of the story. Or is it? Vote with silent movie format, no dialogue recorded but with musical accompaniment. In this case, it is on a sound track that doesn't use organ or piano playing as an observer musician.
