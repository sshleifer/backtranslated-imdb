How can anyone say it's bad is outside of me. I loved this example before I even saw it. For three reasons: 1. The story was of interest to me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3rd James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and watch the first season before you decide it is bad because I know that if you look at the first season, you will love it and go out and buy the 1st season and the 2nd season DVD and then Join the campaign to get the 3rd season! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure many of your "Dark Angel" fans will hate them too. They have a thing to keep good exhibitions! Don't you all agree?
