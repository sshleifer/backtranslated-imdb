This movie was pretty good. I'm not too big a baseball fan, but it's a movie that was made to help you understand the meaning of love, judgment, heart, and so on. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. Bringing together a variety of talented participants and understanding the sport. The plot was plausible and I love this message. William Kallis and the guys put together a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports movies are moving around real stories or events and they often don't work well. However, this film hits the 10th on the perfection scale, although here and there were some minor bugs. <br /> <br /> 10/10
