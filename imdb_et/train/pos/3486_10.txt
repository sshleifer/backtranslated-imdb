Any true wrestling fan should have considered this Wrestlemania to be one, if not the best, of all time. It was full of excitement and surprises. One of the greatest hits of all time was a special guest between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin, ref Mike Tyson. The exhibition that Michaels put on was incredible, especially considering the shape she was wearing and that she was her last game.
