An excellent chess player is participating in the tournament and falls in love with the woman he meets. In itself, this story would be a pretty bad corner. So there is more. The fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world thanks to his glory in the game and the fact that the player has a haunting history. <br /> <br /> This movie moves from romantic lightness to tournament tension to historical events that shaped chess and played pretty nicely. It is easy to grow on two main characters and it is easy to believe that they can hit like it's in this movie. The tournament's extra feature is also very good and creates a nice tension setting. <br /> <br /> I have no idea about the strength of chess makers because I don't play myself, but it looks nice and plausible. All in all, most of the movies fall very easily. But it's also forgotten very easily. So it's nice to watch, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 chessmen caught between the chariot and the hard spot
