This exhibition is totally worth it. It has the best talent I've seen for a long time. The premise of the exhibition is unique and fresh (I think that the ABC leaders are not used because it was not yet another reality show). But this exhibition was credible with a line of pleasant characters and a wonderful story. I'm probably not in the age group they want to show as I am in my forties, but many of my friends also loved it (in the late 30s - mid 40s) and died with high-quality exhibitions with talented cast members. I don't think this exhibition got enough time for the audience. I believe that more time this exhibition would have done very well. Again, ABC does not provide an exhibition showing the true potential. So much shows that chance is an opportunity and not nearly worth it! They need to provide quality that shows the real opportunity and time to really click and get the audience. I really loved these characters and waited to watch every episode. I've been watching ABC video episodes and the play gets better. Although I think they owe us another episode (number 13?). We want to see what we get! Bomb the ABC with emails and letters and see if it can be saved from the extinction of this exhibition. Definitely Jerico worked. Some things are just worth saving and this is definitely one of them.
