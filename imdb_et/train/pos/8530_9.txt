Not sure why it doesn't appear in Peoria, but it's a very funny, smart British comedy. It is set at the end of the "rolling sixties". Peter Sellars is fantastic as a rich, forty something series woman. A totally pleasing Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American girl in London, is originally a "daily fishing" by Sellers. But the urbanized TV food critic is not able to stop himself from the dizzying American blonde. <br /> <br /> Humor, sin, big script, strong performances from drivers and supportive boxes. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and the best gag is the last line. Try it, you like it.
