The man in the fire was hot. I love the classic story of the good circumstances of revenge and what is the better reason for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl. <br /> <br /> Writers did an excellent job in the movie that built the link between Creasy. Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) to make the viewer understand and feel that Creasy had to save Pata. It was also good that Creasy was not a choir boy who tried to save Pata through "right" channels, but instead used tactics and street music. Some may say, "Torture is wrong, no matter," and you may be right, but if you see the pain that Creasy passes through the disappearance of Pita and only the passion to get back, you can't help but sideline with Creasy and pull it out he is even more merciless. There is no success if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with various unpleasant gangsters and criminals and he knew it. <br /> <br /> Creasy's search ended with Pita's return to her mother and Creasy, who died of bad guys. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, it really increased it by showing that Creasy was ready to die to get Pita back. His death was actually noble. <br /> <br /> Denzel does a great job, as do writers. This film deserves good signs, because it was definitely a good movie.
