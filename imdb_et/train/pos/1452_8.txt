Being transplanted into New Yorker, I may be the most critical when looking at a city government. But I have to say that before I even got the story myself, I was captured by the photography of New York and the political atmosphere created by director Harold Becker. Brooklyn, where the political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is a Woerner restaurant in or near Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York in 1996. It was indeed particularly favorable for Borough's political people, although they had a few other hangouts. Not surprisingly, the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi, who is still writing stories of both political and organized crime. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he knows how these two worlds baptize on this film. <br /> <br /> The Nestor Serrano Detective goes to an informal meeting with his relative, Anthony Franciosa, and things are breaking and three people die, including an innocent 6-year-old boy whose father went to school with him. The story of mushrooms and finally it is achieved by City Hall itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his mayor transplanted in Louisian, a country that has a tradition to cherish corruption itself. He is an outsider here and tries to check for damage, Cusack finds more than he wanted, <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello plays the Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those who are not from New York, his character Queens Donald Manes is late the president of a small town, also brought by a scandal. He's a lot of a Brooklin politician I knew the day when friendship with organized crime and their favored people, Aiello. <br /> <br /> The City Hall was goodbye to Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and undervalued talents on the screen. No one traces anyone when he is. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino's best moment is when he kills a toddler at a funeral and turns it into a political triumph for himself. He's a complicated part, he's a good person, but one is caught up in the corruption he needs in a growing place in New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know about Big Apple's political life, City Hall is highly recommended.
