This story is a complicated and wonderful story of the last Harem of the Ottoman Empire, well-spoken and provocative, and we see the inner workings of the lost world now and learn the people who live there. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the story, characters, shows and scenes. A couple of scenes that were quickly editable and sub-titles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise it was a great piece. <br /> <br /> Marie Gillain plays great with Mr Safiya, with whom I am happy to say that he did a fantastic job without it. His and Alex Descase's (Nadir) scenes are charming and cute. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something less of a Hollywood and authentic world they are issuing.
