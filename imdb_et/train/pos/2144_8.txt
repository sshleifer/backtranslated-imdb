Lovely and totally charming movie, should we? made me laugh and cry. At first, Sugiyama-san was not terribly appealing - a little tiny, seemingly committed to his family, but too easily fascinated by the face of the window. His obsession is far and cold. But at the end of the film, I was against him, his wife and daughter, all dance teachers and dance students. This simple story of transformation and renewal is a small jewel that I would see again.
