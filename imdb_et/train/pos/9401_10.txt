What a wonderful film that is suitable for so many tags that he never gets: science literature, film-noir, script and high-intelligence dialogue that requires educated, cultured audiences ... before 1960 in England (and it was shown only in the US in art houses when it first arrived) and never made it in the US. <br /> <br /> The main characters in White Suitis (1951), starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood traditionally use polysynthetic, scientific reference words such as "polymer" and discuss and explain chemical concepts such as "long chain molecules" and then communicate them importance for the average person and the benefits of science. <Br /> <br /> Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video game explosion films that currently (2009) dominate the world's cinema and are certainly dominated by the US's biggest cinema ....... given by talented and credible educated English actors (who are educated, accomplished people) and all of this has been done with comedy, charm, sin and irony that ancient Greek dramatists would have accepted. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie and one day, some worthy filmmakers and their supporters should do it differently. <br /> <br /> It's great.
