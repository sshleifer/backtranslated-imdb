I just bought a DVD and I have to say (after Brazil and fear of Las Vegas) Terry does it again. Like the fan of Monty Python's films, Terry Gilliam's genius follows this sci fi thriller to whom Bruce Willis plays an excellent role as James Cole and (perhaps my favorite figure) Brad Pitt, who played the madness of Jefferey Goines. Must be a science fiction fan or any type of movie fan, because it involves intercourse, drama, action, etc. <br /> <br /> In any way, in the future, 1% of the world's population will live with a disease designed to destroy the human race that has been unleashed in the past by the "Twelve Monkey Army". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (that is, when the virus was fired) to find out about the disease so that scientists can cure their time. Before going further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals dominate the world because of human illness. anyway, when he is sent back in time, he is sent back to the 1990s where he is sent to a mental hospital because he talks to the virus people. During his stay, he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who is mostly responsible for destroying humanity. She also meets her psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe), who finally competes with Bruce to save the world (as she sees she is right in her testimony), she is sent back and forth from time to time and finally sent in 1996 where she then interviews his own peace of mind, but later he pulls up to discover a blocking movie, and later builds up to a somewhat shocking climax where he tries to stop the virus-carrying man (not actually Brad Pitt) and instead kill the police killer.
