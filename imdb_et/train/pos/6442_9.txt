This is a great Swedish movie. It was the first Swedish movie I've seen ... it's simple and deep .. what a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist made an excellent result for the famous conductor who is looking for peace in his hometown. Frida Hallgren was great as her inspirational girlfriend to help her continue and never give up. <br /> <br /> Fight the conductor and the hypocritical priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife comes in contact with him and protects Michael's supreme reasons to help people in his hometown find their peace in music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the end .. it wasn't so good, but it has some deep meaning.
