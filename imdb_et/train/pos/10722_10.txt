Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love, and mom and dad can also look fun. In the 80s I grew up with this film, its plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on a DVD, so if I have my kids, they can watch this movie as much as I can. The plot is fun, the group of kids will start on a journey they never expected when they crashed into space with a gushing robot. They were at the beginning, but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to turn it back into panic. When they got enough oxygen back from the space system, they turned again into better friends and a new life.
