This is one of the most guilty films! <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but still look at her to see her space clothes "like a super cool" with "like a completely bitchin" belt and paste rhinestones on her face. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is actually one of the few "family" movies that keeps your interest. I know that jerks start, especially if you know what happens, but the other half is probably one of the most nervous segments of the family film. <br /> <br /> I could not stand before millions of people and declare that I love this movie, actually renting is quite embarrassing, but I know it here on the internet to hide. <br /> <br />
