It is easy to make general comments about such a movie. The fact that this is one of the only Japanese films of this era causes people to say that it "started the Japanese cinema" and was "unlike the West ever." The last of these two comments is particularly wrong, because Kinugasa himself admitted that he gave up Calig more than once. But the style was designed to imitate and does not take away the importance of this film. Here we have experimental themes and a composition based on already created visual styles that opens doors to stratify real narratives and realities. For this, the madhouse is the perfect place and writers knew it. This is a landmark film, and everything needs to be done to suppress it. <br /> <br /> 5 of 5 - Important
