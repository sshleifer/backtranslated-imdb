I enjoyed this movie and after watching it, I wondered how much "Caitlin Rose" exists in the world. How many other girls are tortured by this sexual abuse and classmates and are too intimidated to open their mouths? How dangerous and cruel can teenagers be against each other, because if this film shows who is right, it is not the most important, the one who is popular and who is afraid of manipulating the thoughts of young people, and influences them to make such immorality happen. Amber Thiessen is the victim of a violent result, and Brian Austin Green is convincing as a boy he thought he loved and his best friend. It's a movie that doesn't get exposure. Remarkable and brilliant, too good to be just a movie made for a TV.
