Put yourself in Carla's shoes. He is a superfluous and unclear administrative decline that is invisible. You know him: he has trained the last three of the three bosses, knows where all the bodies are buried and can even look back on the teeth when brushing. There is always time for another ungrateful task, and it does the best, despite the heavier trees, when it has a table in the toilet that turns into a semi-finished cup of coffee. What? You don't want to hear that? Well, he can't and can't get long until your hearing aid is in place. Prepare to hear your life in hearing impaired people. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs to change her life. Work won't happen anywhere; friends rely on their home needs and the only way out is a collapse that is virtually unnoticed. She doesn't take a break - the contract gets critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla sets out requirements that deliver her real needs: a "groomed" man. This brings approval to the applicant who reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) is doing his job interview all the way from the beginning, and his salary application clearly shows Carla's interest in his non-job-related qualities. He sees the potential of the former, and as the story evolves, their relationship increases in an unusual way. <br /> <br /> Paul has a difficult transition that will return to the world outside prison walls and find himself in another type of prison: one of the office varieties and the other of a restored servitude to pay off old debt. His early skills help Carlal in the political struggle in the office. But Paul sees Carla's ability to read lips more and draws him into the intriguing world. <br /> <br /> This is a brutal movie noir that has not been rated and is probably suitable for older teenagers. Carla grows more powerfully, professionally and personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives us clear advantages for the rest of us. She grows up as a woman who discovers her sensual side when she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles that compete in the man's world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are designed in a strange way for each other. Without Paul, Carla will remain the role of revenge. He has compassion, hopes and best wishes, even if he doesn't make the best decisions. <br /> <br /> You can hear the world through the ears of Carla, the uncomfortable adjustment of the hearing aid, the muted voices, all but unheard of, without a relatively clear voice when you see who is talking. With one important way of thinking, we see Carla's compensated for intuitive power. And we can all use that idea to hear not only what people say, but also what they really mean.
