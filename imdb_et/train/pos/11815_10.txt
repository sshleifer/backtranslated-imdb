At the time I write it, I see over 15,000 votes with a rating of 5.8. There's something wrong with this picture. Personally, I give it to 10. I can see 7 at the lowest or 8 if it was appreciated by people who see this movie for what it really is. This is a movie based on a comic book. This film won more than the share of prizes. Won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 candidates .... from there tells me it's better than 5.8. Some great actors, some great special effects, and I think it's been classic for years. If you're looking for pure entertainment, be sure to check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that can be viewed more than a few times. Al Pacino is great as a Big Boy Caprice.
