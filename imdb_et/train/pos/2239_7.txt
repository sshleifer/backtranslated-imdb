I think this movie only works for people who were all turned off as a giant leap of Lord of the Rings. Well, I was. And so I love this movie. Especially I like all of those LotR flawless superheroes who have been parked so perfectly and disrespectfully. The most brilliant is Gandhal (bold and wise and completely humorous - all wizard): Almghand, coward and dead transvestite. Sauron's colleague (of course the "Sauraus" of East Germany) simply carries a helmet with holes in the eyes like a helmet. Aragorns alter ego is another unfortunate idiot who tries to attach his broken sword ("legend of Ulrike") to the scotch. And "Strunzdumm" (the opposite of Wormtong) is really like Brad Dourif! And don't forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
