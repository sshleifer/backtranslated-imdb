It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented teenagers. This first film was one of the best. The humorous story gave a pleasant 14-year-old Deanna, a little beauty with a great voice, like Miss Fixit in a family divorce. See the other IMDb records for the plot summary, but Deanna and her two older sisters are planning to go from Switzerland to America to avoid their father getting married again. The film can be astonished even in the following shows with great support, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good direction and editing. Of Deanna's three songs, only classic "Il Bacio" comes from the classic repertoire, but when she sings in the police station, the film's place is guaranteed in history. At least it was a spectator who was hit by Deanna and classical music at the age of 15. One of the many nice touches that appear in the Three SMART GIRLS is a brief look at the drunk that pulls his neck to a final glimpse of Deanna when police officers harass him! One unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent writers of Durbin vehicles were locked into a Miss Fixit theme, which was quickly hidden. Deanna never did. His growth is more questionable as an actor than his charisma, which he certainly was. It seems to me that, like many other film personalities, he replaced "naturalness" for the hysterical power he lacked. Ploy worked well with 21 feature films.
