Perfect cast for some people drama. Simon is dead but somehow recovers from outside. What he saw there is shown as empty spots arranged by the German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon worships his death, comforting the death of the people he saw on the other side. Her girlfriend is trying to keep her alive, but she can't decide on her after her last death. Very poor and moving, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and somewhere even boring.
