This is a decent little flick made in Michigan, about a boy who has been haunted by his past, his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and grown up as not so well regulated. In fact, he's absolutely funny, but he's trying to be too obvious. He also has an entourage, his little demon and an angel who follows him. The demon never speaks a word, but he doesn't really have, and he's Max Schreck's horrible. Let's just say that the angel spins a lot of his wheels on it because Eric is busy doing things that make him better, like "freeing" the people he needs, mostly beautiful young women. It's a good idea of ​​madness, and you're kind of at some point to figure out what's going on, but overall I looked at it from beginning to end to focus on the movie, because it's definitely in my interest. In some areas, it is a bit flawed, but I can't really put my finger on it. Decent effort and worth seeing if you like the serial number.
