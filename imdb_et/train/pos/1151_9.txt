Soapdish is one of the best but least well remembered comedies of the 1990s. The film revolves around a variety of non-camera dramas that take place behind the scenes produced by the inexpensive daily soap operas. The first impressive strengths of this movie are this fantastic A-list. "Soapdish" includes some of the greatest actors of this era. <br /> <br /> The film is perfectly run by Sally Field, like Celeste Talbert, an actor of neurotic aging (the costume is thrown beautifully) which makes her look like "Gloria F * CKING Swanson!"). Its supportive cast is like being in the 90s Movie Greats! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy made the film a big hit. Goldberg is expected to be excellent, while the Downey Jr and Hatcher performances imply comical excellence that they would later achieve. <br /> <br /> The film is outstanding when it comes to writing. The script really has a modern edge that is strangely odd. There are also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time. Sometimes Mel Brooks recalls his best and often reminded of this "high anxiety" (1977). Much of the film's humor depends on being often uncomfortable, but quite accurate, with daily television and neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, the extra racing session of the executive management used by Carrie Fisher is both fun and honest. . This is a great script and A-class cast makes it a must-see. It's hard not to love this movie after it laughs at you for 90 minutes.
