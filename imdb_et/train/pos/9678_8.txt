I suggested that my happy birds could talk. Throw the movie at the observer. A lovely story that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Paulie is a cute little treasure. He has quite a few smart lines that really made me laugh. I especially loved the dance series during my showbiz. You can forgive obvious clich√©s if you rejoice in your quest to reunite with Marie. A captivating film with two strong characters who really interact with a parrot separated by a young owner. You would have liked to see more women who become blind and have to give up their reciprocal journey. I liked his artistic and poetic inspiration, a shame that he couldn't share Paulie's reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home, eventually with Marie, maybe a nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to end his journey.
