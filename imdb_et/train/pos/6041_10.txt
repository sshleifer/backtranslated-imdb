This is the one you look at a couple of times. The great writings show that they had to live this story or know someone who did it because they laughed at it. Freebird made me relieve and laugh at my flawless youth. The title was a great choice. Big movie, setup, story, soundtrack and characters. This is a biker flick, but it would be a shame for a pigeon hole. Funny poetry, such as Trailer Park Boys in the US. If you have never seen a TPB, please note if you like this movie. You thank me. I hope I can see these characters more in other movies. Further? Could do. There is much more to the world that I would like to see through their eyes.
