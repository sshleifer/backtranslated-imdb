Compared to the classic in the 1930s and 50s, the texture and character are much richer. George C. Scott was born to Scrooge, just as he was born to Patton. Mr. Scott is known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. Scrooge's character, played by Mr. Scott, looked like the screen. Scott, as Scrooge, brought Scrooge a richer, more robust, even more mobile screen than any of its predecessors in 18th century London as the most important person. Mr. Scott felt that Scrooge had reached more personal, more understandable, but very controversial levels; his role acted with great power that Scott always brings to the screen: but his usual hero's voice is sometimes whispered, almost as if he had comforted the Christmas holidays with one breath, but reveals his own weakness in his next line. He can represent sour and rough Scrooge and misunderstood, sympathetic Scrooge all in the same scene. <br /> <br /> Really remarkable power from his generation giant.
