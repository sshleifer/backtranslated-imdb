It is a clever drama about the lifestyle of Texas honky tonk in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger point to two very credible performances like Bud and Sissy Davis. This movie really opens up the scene of country music and helped introduce America to a mechanical bull. If you love good romance, you will love this movie.
