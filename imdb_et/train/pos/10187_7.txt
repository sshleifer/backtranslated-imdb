Well, I'm honest: it's not exactly Sholay. But you don't get Sholay every week. In fact, in this movie, "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991), you see different signatures. But like most "inspired" movies, it was well inspired, well handled and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo her hysteria, but everyone else is commendable. Especially for Dipti Navy: I saw him for a long time, but he has not lost his grace. Actually, he's much better than the last time I saw him. One more Bollywood star that will probably grow nicer when they are older? <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a nice watch.
