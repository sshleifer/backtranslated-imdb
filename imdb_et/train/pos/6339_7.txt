The Grinch part was made for Jim Carrey and I was very impressive about his performance. Being his big fan, I was afraid, but pleasantly surprised with the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the cutest little girl I've seen on the screen for a long time, and she showed her the deadline to overcome. I even pulled tears at one point! I've never read the story of Dr Seuss from the book, so I didn't know what to expect, humor was quite dark. In general, I enjoyed the movie (other than songs!) And I would recommend it especially for family viewing.
