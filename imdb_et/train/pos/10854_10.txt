This series can be the best Britcom ever and it speaks a lot, taking into account competitors (Fawlty Towers, good neighbors to name just two). <br /> <br /> What made Butterflies so high, even the best, if it not only improves great, classic, stylish and intelligent comedy, but also widened their horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently and in every detail - a great social the change that took place in the UK. <br /> <br /> I remember looking at this example as a teenager and I was just scared of it. The lifestyle described was remarkable in itself. It was the first time I saw real people with cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far from the 70's wolf that had been seen in North America so far. Then there were decorations, shop chest, cars. These people - even children, whose philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were complex. These were examples of "new Europeans" coming to life and style throughout the world in the next decade (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course, the assumption was strange and fantastic. The idea that a suburban dream living person may be so dissatisfied and uneasy was revolutionary, especially for North Americans, for whom happiness has always been defined as money and things (sure that the situation is depicted in American films and television but not in intensity) or film About Montenegro). And if the assumption was not surprising enough, the means of expressing it were extreme. A possible thing that wasn't really about sex or even romance? Butterflies dazzled many, but some people had to amaze their foreheads ... anytime. <br /> <br /> Butterflies were so prophetic in so many ways. Prior to his time, it documented the concept of postmodern self, a comprehensive lifestyle, the concept of emotional loyalty, and the disconnection of generations, and the concept of male dissatisfaction (represented by perfectly tense father-to-son relationships). It is too bad that this series has not been rediscovered in a great way, and all involved gave hope for some time and place to create a substantive snapshot and foresee all the slipperyness and anger that came.
