Yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are some holes in the plot; yes, he has a high quality for television; and yes, Britney Spears obviously wrote the book about self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget it all ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Fun at school after school Special way but fun however. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen when her mother does a good job ... so good I'm gonna watch my movies. He reminded me of all good reasons for Diane Lane. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast will do a good job. If I were a casting agent, I'd investigate these young actors. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are higher than normal TV standards, and music was really great ... better than many high budget movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you're in German mood, it's not a movie for you. If you want a safe, fun and undervalued movie, it's good. This is one you could show to your 10-year-old daughter, but enjoy it yourself.
