Yeah, it's a cheese, it's not a Zombie, but it's not so bad. It has a Beatrice Ring that is a great bonus and it's fun. I was fortunate enough to meet Fulc later in my career and he remained a philosophical experience because he was never happy with it. It is especially worth looking for, especially for the genre and Fulci fans. This is a movie that has been removed too often.
