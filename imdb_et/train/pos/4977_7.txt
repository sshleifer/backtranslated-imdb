So many educational films are nothing more than a desperate drudgery that is only recorded by the fact that "MST3K" thinks of them ("Why study industrial art?"). "Hemo excellent" is actually pretty well done. It's all about blood, heart, and circulatory system. I admit I don't remember it all, but it does a good job of explaining everything, keeping it serious but fun. I think you can always count on the end of June (most famously Rocky the Squirrel's voice, he's playing a deer here). <br /> <br /> Since "Hemo Magnificent" itself can be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is "Gremlins": the class looks at how greml is developing.
