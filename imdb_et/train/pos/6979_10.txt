This is the real character and story-driven drama level that shames most of what we see on television. <br /> <br /> I was impressed right from the start. Do not put down if your non-sci fi nut (like me ...) This may happen on earth, the fact that its second galaxy makes the exhibition more interesting. There are no spacecraft or laser guns (None anyway) So far I have seen up to s01 e04 and I am caught and thought what will happen next because there are so many options. <br /> <br /> The cast game is in the role of a passion. Eric stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show is really good alone, it doesn't matter if you looked at the BSG or not, actually they are quite different. I have read some negative comments about sci fi geek who waited less for drama and more for aliens and rifles, but I would like to ignore them. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive start. Let's hope they don't wear it after 1 or 2 seasons as they usually do with good examples.
