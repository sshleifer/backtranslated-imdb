I went to this movie because I had a free new version of Blockbuster and it was necessary to grab something fast because the store was ready to close for the evening. The white cover and the title interested me. I'm a (relatively spoken) "old" lady and my son is a 30-year-old young man. I adore movies that are purely entertaining, like the sixth mind, the vampire interview, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. However, my son is a graduate of the film and has very specialized foreign films, such as Bergman or Hertzog. We usually hate each other's film choices, HOW we both watched and loved the movie NO! It was different from all the movies we saw earlier. We are both cynical and critical personality types and we usually watch these movies - when we watch them, we laughed and enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It is our opinion that if this film had been advertised and shown in major US theaters, it would have done well.
