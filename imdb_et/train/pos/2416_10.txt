yes, this is a bit silly movie, so if you are looking for an oscars, forget about it ...... but if you love John Candy humor then this is a must-see. We lost John Candy before he made enough of his big comedy brand, and he's better in just one movie: planes, trains and cars (with Steve Martin). A great support from Eugene Levy, perhaps her best work ever with a hot title called Sal DiPasquale. Well done by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. If you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy, you need to see this hidden and printed movie.
