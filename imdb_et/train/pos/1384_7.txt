Also known as "Water Lilies" - this movie tells the story of two girls because they are fighting in their world of love and sex. This story is being spoken slowly and it works very well. It gives a lot of time and space to learn about and add different characters. <br /> <br /> Using a little casting will put somewhat more pressure on players because they all have more screen time than normal, but in this movie people play it well. Everyone is completely plausible. The visual device is great, especially the pool underwater shots add beautiful effect. <br /> <br /> A lot of movies have been made about the same topic and it doesn't really differ from them. It pulls high hats out of some "standard" compression techniques and works with them. It's not bad, not at all, but it's certainly not so good, and I feel it could have been better if he had taken some of the less studied corners. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
