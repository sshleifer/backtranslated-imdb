Everyone has already commented on cinematography (good to big), personalities (bigger than life), structure (chronological, many references to surfing the culture over time). The unanswered question is a matter of greater sociological importance: stopping American culture is more satisfying and satisfying. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. In SoCal's local high schools, we watched 16mm films. I remember the great surfing all day until my skin radiates warmth, putting Hawaii shirt and shorts and watching the last surf film in the night. Often the narrator was a filmmaker himself, reading a script of paper sheets. Sometimes there is also a music track or a proto-punk band. I was never happier. With the exception of shooting and hollering, "Riding troops" saw me back. <br /> <br /> The feeling of living on the edge of life was also strengthened by the lack of money and social and business climbing. ladders, not being in touch with Joneses, pushing yourself for a moment of physical and mental joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question "what is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton, etc., they seem to have found something that some of us are bold enough or honest with themselves to continue: to live life only under their own conditions. Perhaps society would fall apart if we all did what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see the people who actually live in dreams. <br /> <br /> This was the message I really impressed.
