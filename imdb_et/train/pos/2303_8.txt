MEASUREMENT MAN is a warm and touching age drama that focuses on the family of farmers in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops a 17-year-old woman (Jason London), who comes to the bottom of her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how the sudden tragedy of this family's dynamics will change forever. From the 1950s onwards, this has been a pleasant highlight and the scenario will give you the signs you need to take care of almost immediately. Witherspoon is already showing the Oscar winning talent he developed in this early role, and London is a charming leading man. Warfield also gives the role of an older sister, which is also effective, with quiet maturity. Knit to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who play girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mother. I looked at this quiet and influential drama unexpectedly, which creates strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the phrase "family ties".
