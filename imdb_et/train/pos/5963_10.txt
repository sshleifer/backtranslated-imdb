This movie is terrible, but because of this you have to see it. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just the biggest chase scene. When Eddie strikes milk at Tum, she gets down the corridor. Eddie puts up obstacles with fun consequences (like tympanum nailing with a trumpet player, buying a DVD and watching it slowly). The best obstacle is the bouncing mop bucket that one jock jumps but goes out of the ground behind the door. But when he slips, he speeds up to protect physics (mainly friction); but what is behind the door is supreme. There is a steeper staircase in every school that this air blows up. In fact, he probably dies under the broken neck. Not only does he break all the concepts of reality, he makes the most funny noise in this situation. Go and buy it. Trust me, this scene is worth $ 6.
