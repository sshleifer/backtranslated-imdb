I loved this example and I'm still watching the first season DVD at the age of 19. What can I say? I grew up in a house similar to Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference was that I didn't live with my uncle and my father's best. I also grew up with my mother. I don't know what I would have done without Full House television. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace) and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can associate each of them because I am a child of my family like Steph, I am a younger sister like Michelle and I am an older sister like D.J. I really like how the exhibitions always have moral values ​​because I don't like any O.C-like shows today. I also like Full House comedy. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are as fun as Uncle Girls, Daddy's Dad and Dad. The story goes that when the girls' mother dies, Danny's best friend Joey and his brother Jesse move to help raise the children. Three men are trying to raise three young girls - fun. Every plenary character is full of heart, funny and truly credible. Joey is a comedian striving for the heart and soul of the child. Jesse is a cool, motorcycle riding, tough guy, softened by his three brotherhoods and later by his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, Summerville). Both children and adults like this show. Guaranteed.
