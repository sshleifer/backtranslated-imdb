I was literally hated by this movie, so believe me when I say this film is worth it. In general, the story and gags are built, but the film has a charm and fineness to pull them out. The gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss / future father and co-workers see him scratch is not terribly intelligent, but it made me laugh crazy. Very few movie gags are high, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has a charm and charm that can go a long way. <br /> <br /> The characters are also nice. I have to say I want to see more of James Brolin's character because he was in very few scenes where he was. In addition, I admire any romantic comedy that has the courage not to make a woman's character (who serves as an obstacle on the plot) the whole witch. The character of Selma Blair is hardly unlikely and there is never a scene where I thought, "Why did she want to marry her first?" The end is Hollywood-ish, but it could have been a lot of schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I haven't had most of Jason Lee's mainstream position favorable. I just loved her so much in Kevin Smith's films that I couldn't help but feel disappointed to see them in these stupid roles. And he never sees comfort in these foolish roles. Even in this movie, he doesn't see it quite comfortable, but he bets his two cents and deals effectively with every scene. But I still leave my work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves again why she is so damn pleasant. Of course, she is a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me bad, but she also has a unique charm and seems to be a good personality. In other words, his beauty shows inside and out. I don't know the names of the actors, but the woman who plays drunk grandmother is having fun. Julie Hagerty also has a small part and she is always enjoyable to see what makes me want to get better roles. I loved her so much in the "plane" and "lost America" ​​that it was a shame that she didn't get the same opportunities to show off her skills. <br /> <br /> Don't let them down on terrible trailers and even more terrible office registers. It's a funny, charming movie. Romantic comedies nowadays become so predictable that the genre itself seems to be ready to rinse the toilet, so it's always good among these bad apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
