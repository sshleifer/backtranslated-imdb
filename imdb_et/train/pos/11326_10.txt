I looked at the first 17 episodes and this series is just amazing! I haven't been interested in the anime series because Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on the h-game, which I am not sure if it has been done before or not, I have not played, but what I have heard is very good. <br /> <br /> I will give this series a 10/10. It has a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've seen. It also has great Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this series yet, look at it. On some of the anime websites you will find the episodes below which are out of Japan.
