This is a classic British comedy-thriller that I always wanted to look at, but so far there was no way to do that. It is based on a popular performance that has been filmed several times (especially the same director in 1931, but unfortunately this version does not seem to have been preserved in its entirety!); for the current remake, upgrading the plot to the current state of war has been changed. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was mainly acquainted with British comedians through Will Hay's films: considering that it is similar to the plot of legendary ghosts, smuggling and enemy agents, it is very much in this vein (written by Hay's usual writing team, Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); the occupied passenger element was thus an equally tried and true formula. This star is currently by Arthur Askey (by Richard Murdoc) - none of the films I watched before are likely to be a hero like Hay himself and whose personality is just as potentially irritating ... but one quickly warms up to him, and Askey really comes up with a number of clever lines and fun business to justify the fact that the game's flagship (and 1931 film version) was divided into two because Murdoch was a direct partner of the star. <br /> <br /> The remote control (the events of the movie take place during one night of the storm) gives an excellent atmosphere; in the last half hour - with the sudden appearance of the mysterious pair (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and finally the arrival of the title car - is particularly engaging and well-managed. It is also worth noting the rest of the cast list: Kathleen Harrison as a stereotypical scary spinster, whose cardboard is his constant companion and led by all the excitement to take his first drink.
