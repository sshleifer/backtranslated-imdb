I approached this film with low expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and it will win the dance films of dance halls of recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". Music is great and dancing is colorful, but for me it's not a movie dancing. It's about a Japanese institution that gives male office workers a long time to work and leisure after entertainment that doesn't involve their families. Here we have a man who has a full family and a great mortgage and flags for life. He draws an attractive picture of a young woman in a dance studio, which she passes through during her commuting, and this leads her to try out the dance hall. The Japanese language is also that his new passion has triggered a motive, but at least in the end the family and the audience have embraced it. Attitudes towards the dance hall, as broadcast in the film, are certainly non-western, although discipline and music are clearly imports of cultural products into Japan. Cultural contrasts are therefore interesting. Even without cultural knowledge, color, dance and enthusiasm, they all make a fun movie.
