If scientists behave in such a way that H.G. Wells would be sure they would be in the future, history wouldn't have come out well as he did in things that come. It was almost 80 years since this point that Wells wrote the shape of things on which this film is based, and not closer to the world he describes as before, in some ways further afield. <br /> <br /> Although well-known players like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are cast, they are more cartoons than real characters. This is the main weakness of the film, it is dedicated to Wells' philosophy of science, which solves all the problems and the rest of us are fools. <br /> <br /> Massey's characters, two generations of the same generation, think it is a very optimistic view. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels that a person is running too far. And Ralph Richardson is a warlord who has emerged from the destruction of a new thirty-year war with modern weapons. By the way, since the atomic bomb has not been invented, the poison was considered a weapon that almost destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> Wells says science and conquest can never mix. Scientists as a group are too much to deal with such things around the world. Wells's lifelong scientists certainly fled to the right-wing fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. The same people, however, to be defeated, are subordinate to the Allies and have developed nuclear weapons that led them in modern age. If they behaved like Wells would have liked them, someone like Albert Einstein would have led a junta of scientists who would have created a new order after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Wells got it wrong, both in time and in development. He probably didn't see both the computer and the atomic energy. Computer programmers are probably our rulers in a brave new world as scientists. Still what William Cameron Menzies drives, and the set-up sets offer an interesting look at H.G. Wells's thought, certainly to his esteemed thinker, though he didn't get the right things.
