How can I go wrong with amazing Ramones? Which crime is two of them already dead. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's jokes about big musicians who die in kitchen fires while useless people live forever. I paraphrase here, but you get the idea. This is a very stupid stuff, but it has optimism that is refreshing (even if they use the building to blow). Who knew that it would actually become a student concern around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is the era's capsule, where people still believed that music was important and that it could change the larger society. It is full of children who know that the body does not have the right answers. Instead, rock and roll are the only thing they trust. <br /> <br /> But the most important thing is this pure exploitation. Just go in and enjoy the time. If it wasn't, the high school life was similar in the seventies, it should have been.
