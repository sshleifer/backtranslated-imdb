I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I didn't know who the actor was, and I didn't know the film would be different from the preview. I'm sure I loved it. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty celebrates Dick Tracy, a 1930s anti-crime detective, who goes after the biggest bosses in the city. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very powerful man and does not take over his singer girlfriend Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is on Tracy. It gets worse because the new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. He's very unknown. In addition, the famous villas are back from the comic book. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was very colorful and creative. Especially as a child, it was fun and fun to watch. Warren Beaty was like James Bond in the 1930s when he played Dick Tracy. The film ensemble includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patink, Charles Durning. Plus More! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie of all ages and it's a fun movie to enjoy the family. Take my word for it.
