I remember when I was five years old and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon, except when the bras and balls started flying. I have to agree that this movie makes someone and everybody irritated because it's set to discriminate against everyone and anyone ... but the truth is that it's funny as hell because it's deep. I recommend it to anyone who loves cult classic. Also try Fritz's Cat and Fritz's Cat NINE Lives. When I'm right, Ralph Bashki also made this film. This includes a cat that goes through a family of difficult times, streets, jobs, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all these films. Since Coonskin was an offensive title during this time, it was also labeled as street manager. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World very young with Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another comic that dealt with the young man's street life.
