This movie came to me very well, by Matt Groening. Well, actually I looked at both the Simpsons and Futuramat, and it can be mentioned so I thought "what the hell". The film brings home some "what if" that make you realize how happy we are in that day and age, where we take things like soap and water. Interestingly, however, in 2022, men will shave another blade with a safety belt! It is nice that those responsible did not carry the film with unnecessary special effects, fast pistols, etc. Some beautiful "furniture" if you think what it means. Remember "Tuesday is a green green day"
