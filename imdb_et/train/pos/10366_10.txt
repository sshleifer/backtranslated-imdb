Unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting of this Australian film is reminiscent of the "old" Hollywood best. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good. Neill fits the Streep line and takes on - this is one of the best show projects of her proud actor talents and she is the best of her sexy and proud, despite the intensity of her role. This appealing film is a fan of every movie, loved by the thrilling courtroom drama depicted in the most humane, but unpleasant conditions. In the film, which has won several Australian best prizes, not only a superlative director, but also excellent and authentic Australians. This proves that people around the world are the same. And after all these years, people still enjoy the famous Streep line, accent and all: "Dingo ate moy baby!" Including "Elaine Benis" is "Seinfeld".
