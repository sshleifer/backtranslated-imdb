Director Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a film that is not forgotten. Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America's American dream of America. Then Montana becomes the "king" of the drug world by brutally leading his criminal empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant. This film has about 180+ F-words and it's almost three hours long. This movie is fun and you will never forget. You rejoice at Drug-Lord and in some scenes you will find out that Montana is not as bad as some other criminals. This is a masterpiece and I suggest you see it. You don't have to be disappointed. 9/10
