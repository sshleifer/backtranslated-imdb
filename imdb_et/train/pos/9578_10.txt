As others have mentioned, all women who are naked in this film are mostly proud. The plot has a very good look at the hypocrisy of female libido. When men are about they want to be caught, but when the "men" are around, they become followers of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy really becomes a man quickly (we should all be so happy at this age!). He then gains the courage to continue his true love.
