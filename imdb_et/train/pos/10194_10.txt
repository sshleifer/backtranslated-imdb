It would have worked much better than it would have done in "Mitchell Malta". At least we would have liked Joe Don Baker's vision of an otherwise picturesque Mediterranean area covered with this ridiculous, like baby's clothing ... not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger. Mitchell is Mitchell, the film would not have suffered from the lack of free police brutality. Oh well. Comments from at least Mike and Botti cartoons made it an enjoyable ticket price for the MST episode. But I can't imagine it being viewed on its own.
