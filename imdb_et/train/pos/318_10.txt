This is undoubtedly the biggest film ever made. It is almost incomprehensible even for many repetitive views, trying to find out exactly what is happening. The film was almost completely improvised and includes random musical numbers, advertisements, competitions entering the mail, and many other innovations. Besides, what other films are Martin Luther King's Jr.? To decipher the film, hunt the director's book "I was curious". It all becomes clear. This is a great and bold experiment in improvised recursive film making. Victory. Now, if only someone puts out text with subtitles colored * other * than white ..., white subtitles tend to wash and become invisible.
