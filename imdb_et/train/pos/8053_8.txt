This is Sammo's great early comedy films. This is not a dragon entry parody, the main character (Sammo) is embedded by Bruce Lee and emits him insecurely for a man of his size. The nominal story of how his struggle creates problems for his loved ones - he fights. Oh, fight. Good, fast-paced scenes that have a big impact (a white guy playing a boxer looks like he really suffers from a Sammo hit). <br /> <br /> The fun of this movie a bit was pure involuntary. There's Jim Kelly's boy (one of the three experts who hired Samo to take out), but he was a Chinese boy with an African wig. Come on, did they have any real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I think I've seen enough white fake "Chinese people" in old American movies. <br /> <br /> This is one of the fans of Sammo or Bruce Lee.
