I saw this movie today, and I was surprised at the exact dialogue for the main characters. It didn't feel like a movie - it seemed like a documentary (the part that I liked best). The leading women in this movie seemed to me as real as the 15-year-old girls I know. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very enjoyable movie for lovers of independent movies.
