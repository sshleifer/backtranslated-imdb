I really loved it, though it was very disturbing when I read the comments. But like an anime art fan, I can fully understand this perfect work of art, although some of it was against my cultures and beliefs. But hey, this is the world of art .. !! The film's start is very strong, strange and confusing. It's hard to understand the content that makes me respect who did it. only someone who is extremely open can make such a bold movie ... not absolutely for kids. although the characters are cute and divine, they go through some disturbing adventures that cannot be erased (sorry when the spelling is wrong).
