Ang Lee clearly wants to lighten the film, try to act, the characters and the tail as they appear. It is an ideal approach that covers the casual end of the American Civil War through the casual activities of a young soldier who is mindful or masculine. Film turns out to be personalities, adulthood, and relationships. Lee also shows a beautiful panoramic view in the middle of the south as a quiet character that lasts like a rugged parent. <br /> <br /> The James Schamus script is probably the usual carrier of this movie; behind it are a number of well-equipped performances that carry it perfectly. The name Jeffrey Wright alone could carry this movie for me. He has a great but slow burning role: we treat very good (if not revelatory) performances from a large, often recognizable band. <br /> <br /> A noble and optimistic movie. One to look at, if you don't want it, the harsher, bitterer the mountain or the demands. 7/10
