Although this movie is somewhat full of eighty cheeses, I have a place on my DVD where I don't know it and I don't know why. I think I like it because the story of morality is "television is garbage to turn it off and go and get life". For those who decide to listen to the message, you should try to read the book, it is not like a movie. In order for the story to be spoiled at the end of the story, the deadly wounded Richards ends up in an online building that kills itself, all inside and closes the net at the same time. I read it several years ago, but today it would not be difficult to compare with September 11.
