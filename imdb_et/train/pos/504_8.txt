Okay, Star Trek's recent history hasn't been good. The next generation dazzled in its recent seasons, DS9 was boldly where no one had been before, and Voyager started off very badly and never fulfilled his promise. So when they announced a new series of Star Trek, I had no great expectations. And the first episode of Broken Bow had problems. But in general it was a solid Trek material and a good romp. The topic of opening is boring and I don't want to sit on it regularly, but that's just for the remote controls. What was really bad was a totally free gift that almost drove my wife out of the room. They must cut it unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and moved well. The characters, though still new, seem to be round and not always what you expect. Volcanoes are obviously very differently presented, a little evil. I especially liked a linguist who is the first character of Star Trek, who is not proud of death, but rather has to deal with his phobias and fears. They seemed to be true to Trek lore, something that has been a major issue in the past series, although they have enough time to bring us things like shields, a technological solution that can improve something, and an inevitable amount of time. Anyone who wants to start swimming for how long before Borgi is shown? <br /> <br /> In summary, the series has enormous potential. They see the universe with fresh eyes. We have the opportunity to learn how things were later in the later series. How did the Klingons just go to insult to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How was the Federation's form and what made the Earth responsible. Why is the main directive so important? If they deal with these things, not with the fall of newspapers, this is an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran says "If no one has ever visited" (not "someone")
