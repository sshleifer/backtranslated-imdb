Yes, I have a copy of this VHS unconditioned condition that I went to a DVD and if someone wants to bring back Christmas classic memories, I was looking for me at dmd2222@verizon.net.i and I couldn't find it and I thought I can not be the only one on this planet that has this class on tape, there must be other people and if they fit with them, very few who have this classic so that i feel happy and i have all the Christmas except one john denver made the cups again, I think his smoky mountain holiday is not sure, but its closeness.
