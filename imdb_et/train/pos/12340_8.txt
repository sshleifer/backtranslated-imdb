There are indeed a lot of complaints about the Molnar mystical game movie version - Farrell looks good in his role, but his real numbers are frankly stinking. It also largely suffers from being credited with the first film that uses back projection. Sets look fake. <br /> <br /> There are two major strengths in this show: although the dialogue readings slip, visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, where Joseph Cornell reduced the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to just take a picture of him: the credit of Melford's stylish visual on the original. Its great beauty and simple (though static) performance help to improve some of the damage to the ground associated with this film. <br /> <br /> However, one of Borzage's themes is the mysterious power of love, and it is the handling of those heavenly compartments that make it big, from the arrival of the heavenly train to the "hot spot." H.B. Warner's performance is always perfect here. <br /> <br /> So we have a faulty but very interesting version here. I think Lang's 1934 version is better as well as heavenly scenes in the CAROUSEL's Henry King version, which is a dehydrated musical remake. But I enjoyed this version very much and I think you should give it a chance.
