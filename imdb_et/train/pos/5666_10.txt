I loved this example when she spoke on television and was crushed when I found out somebody somewhere decided it wasn't worth continuing! For years I hung a copy of what I had recorded or had a bird on my tape. This is so far. Finally, it was decided that this beautiful series of DVD would be released, and finally I got my eager little hands on the whole set. What brings me to this part; part of this show is everything. <br /> <br /> American gothic is about good verses evil, basically fighting with Lucas Buck (that's Buck, with B). He is the evil sheriff of a small town in South Carolina who runs things like he wants things to run and stop to get their way. <br /> <br /> I felt that the exhibition was wonderfully written and led many lives alive. I really hated when it was canceled, but it seems to me when I finally found something worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole did a great job in the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he is just the right amount of magic verse evil to pull it out. The other actors also did a great job, so I think I could say that even the casting had hit me.
