Although the "special effects" and technical attributes of this film may be ridiculous for some, I have never been able to etch this film to my young and impressive mind when I first saw it at the age of eight. The story of this girl's survival and the experiments she has suffered has remained with me over the years and I have thought more than once about how the girl goes beyond that situation. The fact that this is a real story, and the fact that I was only a child when I first saw it, may be the reason why this film is high. Every time this film spoke on 70's and 80's, I would be cursed for television, drinking in every scene with interest that I can't explain. I think I look at it for the first time as an adult (and with a world view) that it may not be pleasing to some. I really went out of the way to get a copy so I could show this movie to my son. <br /> <br /> Like many other movies, it's not for everyone. If you have impressive human survival stories, these are parties to Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazon, then I believe you can enjoy this movie as much as I have enjoyed it over the last 30 years.
