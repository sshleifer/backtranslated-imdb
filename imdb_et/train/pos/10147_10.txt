Does anyone know the exact quote of "time and love" during George Ede's daughter Fitzpatrick's movement? Did he speak at Charlie and Annna church when they left? If not, I have to rent a movie. It was a great movie. I also loved Serendipit! A great love story for the soul! I met one of my true love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I waited the least, I was not ready for such an emotional relationship. Altho, we got married, I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought. I was pleased with myself and took my love for granted, and she tolerated it for 7 years. Eventually he was upset, but we are still painful and angry and disbelief about how it developed. I had to learn very hard lessons and now we have been three years. <br /> <br /> This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting for unity with one and only true love. I can now understand that within me there is a special feeling and a quote from Father Fitzpatrick. <br /> <br /> I know that if he's still healed, we'll get married again. <br /> <br /> DON'T GET THE FULL FULL AND EFFICIENT LOVE! It has been the greatest lesson in my life. <br /> <br /> The music of this movie is also OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL! This film is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for when it is designed, no matter what it does! Nothing is impossible, even if it's the second time! Thank you!
