In general, I like something light and fun, so this film shouldn't have appealed to me. But it grabbed me from the beginning. The story about family choices and challenges seems obvious, but it raises the question again and again: "What if it were my family? My choice?" I cried and laughed when they did, because I felt what the participants knew. It was hard to see at times, but it was harder to turn. The story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch! It shows what filmmakers can do without gender, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are all real. As in real life, you don't really know what happens, or why people do what they do!
