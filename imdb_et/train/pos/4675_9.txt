I saw "Brother Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and found myself thinking two days later. The story of a girl (Scott Cohen) who returns to her family's custom furniture industry after imprisonment offers all the necessary features of a solid drama - memorable signs; sharp, attentive dialogue; sensitive camera use by a visually thinking filmmaker. <br /> <br /> But more than that, what's too rare these days is an uncompromising vision of mature sensitivity. The director-scriptwriter Todd S. Yellin's talent seems to be full, but we realize that he (as his main character) has paid his fees. He knows how real people in this world are fighting, and he knows how we want to see - or at least experience alternates - success. Yellin nevertheless respects his audience too much to rest his rear ends. Finally, we see that Jake's triumph does not hide in the commissions or even in the respect of his family, but he was unable to give up his work when he tried. <br /> <br /> This is an important topic in the world (and especially in the film industry) that cannot rise above the "bottom line". This film deserves a wide audience.
