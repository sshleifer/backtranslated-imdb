In general, it is a pleasant, light, romantic, musical comedy. I think the length of the film can be a small case. But I'm not sure what you would cut out. Singing by Kelly and Sinatra? No, fabulous dance, what does Kelly do? No. The Time the Movie Takes Out and Develops Relationships with Characters? No (this seems to be a common complaint several times when the latest films don't make any sign). <br /> <br /> Some comments that Iturb did not bring much to the movie, but it gives us the opportunity to see and hear great talents from the 1040s. What if he wasn't an actor? He was an important part of the film because the main piece was listening to Grayson with him. Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought it to the MGM with a screen test containing aria. While listening to the movie, the MGM captures and smiles in brass. You can just imagine it was like it had done its real screen test for years. <br /> <br /> This movie is so full of life that it's hard to capture all the highlights. Throughout the film, great color and lighting were used. You see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did. The nice contrast in the movie is how Sinatra (a woman's man even then) played a role in just wanting to find a date during her vacation. After seeing the movie, you feel good. 7/10
