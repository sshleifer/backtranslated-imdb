A truly divine hero who, in turn, is astonished and frightened by the legs, wrestling with the mattresses, runs into completely closed doors ... just a few moments that burn in my memory "naked truth". I loved what I got into this exhibition: plentiful plots and some good supportive characters gave the exhibition a diamond tea - Tea Leon, like "Nora Wilde"; Cute, crazy and wonderfully unhappy - as refreshing to see an actor who can clown - it's no wonder Hollyood doesn't know how to throw her. But where-oh-WHERE is DVD? The amount they release is incredible that this little pearl remains buried. (Someone fixes me when I'm wrong.)
