I looked at it many times and plan to buy this full function. I love all of Jason Steele's comedy. It is very different and unique and is very enjoyable. I love indie movies and it's just great. The plot is weird but very funny. This short film is spoken by Edward. The order of events is a bit confusing, so this movie is very interesting to watch. First of all, you see Edward's spoons fighting, but then you focus on your life before. It's a silly film, but of course it's still great. I suggest you check out this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. Humor may not suit all tastes, but despite it. It only takes 16 minutes and it's free. SEE SEE SPATULA MADNESS!
