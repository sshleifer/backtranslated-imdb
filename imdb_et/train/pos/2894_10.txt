As a young boy I have always hated "Cinderella" because my two sisters went over me when my parents considered what to buy a Disney movie. I wanted "Dumbo", but my sisters won and got "Cinderella". They enjoyed the movie thoroughly when I closed the back of the room playing my Star Wars action. My love for Disney Theme Parks grounded my internship at Walt Disney World and now I have two youths. I like to show them Disney as much as possible and we recently looked at "Cinderella". With my new respect for all that Disney, I looked at Cinderella with a new perspective and the impression I saw. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a terrible difficulty. Why was he such a spouse, and why couldn't he just escape? I was not too sympathetic to the Cinderella, but when the story went on, I found that I got a story. Maybe they were eye-catching animations or fun loving characters, or maybe it was a timeless song. Listening to songs like "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "Dream on Wish Your Heart Makes", I was robbed back to theme parks. I see myself in this carefree and fun atmosphere, looking at the frightening Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something about this movie just makes Disney magic. It can scare many people, but go to Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed like Cinderella, who are excited about this fantasy world and find out what I'm talking about. Cinderella and glass slippers - as well as Mickey Mouse, Nalle Puh and Tinkerbell - are why Disney is one of the most loved companies in the world. <br /> <br /> Although "Cinderella" may not be the strongest story, it is a kind of icon in Disney and movie history. It is a fun, idealistic and fantasy-type miracle we were when we were children. I imagine there are many, many people there. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it represents everything I love and admire about the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Rating: A (outstanding)
