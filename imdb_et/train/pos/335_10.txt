I've been trying to find out about this series long ago! Thank you, IMDb! I saw it as a child, and I have never been able to do it. Of course, at the age of 6, I was particularly hit by the cyclopside episode, which was completely cool (I spoke of it so much that my older brother made me a figure of a cycloplast plastic cave man, which I still have what I remember, was the atmosphere that was from the beginning Unusual - mysterious, harsh and extremely authentic. If I read the original several years later, I felt the same feeling. It's very hard to hit - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every "Odyssey" I've ever seen has been a huge blow. series of characters seemed real, real people - ancient Greek people - and not some Hollywood stars in costumes. This is a real masterpiece! But - Why not know it better? And why isn't it available on VHS or DVD? I just want this option again see!
