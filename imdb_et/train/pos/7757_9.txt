WEGI WRITTEN, led by Douglas Sirk and published in 1956, is like all Sirk's 50's middle films - pure melodrama. Yet this is an appealing, richly developed melodrama, and the colorful expressionism of the Sirk brand, creepy, barely repressed emotions, symbolism and class collation make it a film that craves. <br /> <br /> The film opens up perfectly, four middle characters and a plot have been introduced because credit is still running. Sirk uses a clever setback to bring us to our world ... <br /> <br /> Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are great as two Hadley children, Kyle and Marylee. She drinks and sleeps with women. He drinks and sleeps with men. They are both worth millions thanks to Hadley's oil industry. Hunky, but poor, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is Kyle's lifelong friend and Marylee's dream lover. Enter into this shabby confusion by Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), a slim, attractive young woman who belongs to Kyle's charms after she takes the phone and flies over her. Mitch loves him too, but Kyle wins. They get married quickly and Kyle ends drinking. But the fate seems to have been written on the wind, and it's not long before Marylee (who is "Mitch", no marriage or marriage), secretly beaten Mitch, confused Lucy and sad drunk Kyle. ... <br /> <br /> Malone is just as great as Marylee Hadley, who deserves her best actress Oscar. He steals any scene where he is. The stack is almost as good as building a melodrama while retaining fine and quiet despair. Hudson and Bacall are much more restrained than the two, but it is in line with their players. <br /> <br /> So what's all about melodrama? Well, a lot of things. Stack's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear, one thing. The circus surrounds the Stack with folk symbols on a film-like pistol, oil lifts and the ultimate phallic symbol, Kyle seemingly incapable of imagining children. Stack seems to have suffered under a massive male superior complex, which is aggravated by his father's preference for Hudson, his sister's desire for Hudson, and his suspicion that his wife will continue with Hudson. Kyle Hadley is still coming to the end of the wrong city, buying a cheap corn liqueur like "butt." <br /> <br /> It's about impossible dreams and their release. The river, where Kyle, Marylee and Mitch had previously played children, is constantly referred to the whole film, which symbolizes Kyle's and (especially) Mary's desire for the innocence and simplicity of young people. In the big melodramatic scene that Malone pulled out completely, she stands by the Marylee River and represents herself again, with Mitch's voice, telling Maryle that she is always her girl. This is where Sirk hits the audience with a huge emotional chord. Who hasn't dreamed of returning to childhood? Who has not lived a living memory at some point? Who hasn't wanted anything? And Hudson's last line of film (yes, he doesn't get a dialogue in the last ten minutes, but close-ups) reminds us of "far from the river Maryle". Amazing.
