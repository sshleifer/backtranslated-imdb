I saw the movie for the first time on the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good Conan Doyle interpretation, and I really don't know what sherlock fans are thinking about. I also think this is the movie of those fans, whether they agree or not, what is mentioned. You may ask yourself if A.C. Doyle is a strong person or questioned. But he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much was it a half biography? No less, if I make this adjustment strong, this is the film you have to see - even if you are not interested in Sherlock Holmes movies or books - watch it, enjoy yourself and have your opinion.
