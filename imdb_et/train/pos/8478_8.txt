I saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart! No other story was unfinished ... I grew up with many great anime movies and it was one of my favorites because it was so unusual - a story of injustice and cruelty, loneliness and life, and a choice that can't be withdrawn and the need of others after. Chirin is done alone when the wolf kills his mother, but Wolf is alone when Chirin follows him on the mountain. The wolf does not kill lamb, although every night he says, "Maybe I'll eat you tomorrow." Its tape is broken and deteriorated due to aging and use. I fix it and watch the movie one day again and cry as hard as I did with the child. Such stories with its depth and feeling and the complexity of its meaning are very rare. This is a sad story, but I have never experienced any of the most beautiful cathars made. I'm glad I've seen this movie and I'm glad to see it as a child.
