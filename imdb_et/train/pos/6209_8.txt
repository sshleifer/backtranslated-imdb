When I first heard Hal Hartley made a sequel to Henry Fool, I was excited (it has been a personal favorite for years) and then careful when I heard he had something about terrorism. Having just seen it, I was surprised that it worked, but still a completely different film than Henry Fool. The writing and the direction were both dead and the actors were great ... special praise went to Hartleys for almost the entire cast of relocation, directly to Henry's son, who was only four original. However, as I said, this film is different from the first, but it works: I agreed to change the tone and theme of the fact that ten years have passed and the characters would have been in very different situations since the first film ended. In this case, there is an unexpected adventure ... and that is all I give away ... not to mention that I have to see it again to really understand what is going on and who is a double cross. Although it was definitely one of the best films I've seen for some time, it suffers from many after-effects as it seems that Hartley is now planning a third plan and the film leaves you hanging. In 2017 I will definitely buy Part 3 (Henry Grim?) Tickets.
