This movie is another horror anthology. It is pretty good, but it could have been used a little more. I compare it to "Doctor Terror House of Horrors", although this title fits. He has four stories that the house is somewhat related to. The first story tells about the writer and his wife. He creates a killer for his last novel and begins to see how the killer travels in his house. It is kind of predictable, but it will eventually make some couples. The next story is a little more unpredictable and you really don't know where the hell he is going. This is Peter Cushing and probably my favorite. This guy buys a house, but it's not a house that is central, but a rather strange wax museum. The third story begins with a pretty good and is owned by Christopher Lee. There's a pretty strange father on this, who seems terribly defending his daughter. The problem is that if you know what's going on, the story doesn't stop fast enough. This leads to a very predictable conclusion. Then the last story concerns an actor who buys a strange little shop of clothing. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a small story about an officer who is being seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. Although I was not very pleased with this explanation because I don't think it would really explain Cushing's story at all. I think they need a little more backwards for that. All in all, it was an interesting collection of stories.
