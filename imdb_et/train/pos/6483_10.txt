This wonderful line, which Laurence Olivier has said perfectly, should say that it describes the beginning of World War II. German origin is not fully investigated by the origin of the Versailles Treaty, which contributed to Hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says it must be difficult to do in a 26-part series with so much convulsion. <br /> <br /> There are many personal, emotional and human tragedies in addition to the anticipated combat photography / action, which tells the viewer an amazing overview, especially if you are not necessarily a World War II buffer / fan. The "testimonies" are shown by episodes and lives that were at home in the main allies / opponents of Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the USA. Demonstrating the extreme bravery of the war on the front line and, of course, the suffering of the civilian population, the death camps, etc. were very well handled and open. I recommend it in all the classes of the younger generation (which can be said to be one of 47!). <br /> <br /> Certain things are quite strange, such as the new jet, which began with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster jet and Gloster Meteor's debut, and the German Messerschmitt Me 262 debut - especially when V -1 saw his debut and V2 was surprisingly smaller. This is probably a small oversight that does not refer to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons that WW2 has highlighted in poor old science. But the big series that made this mark and has done it, if luckily it was. <br /> <br /> A series owned by a box set in history, for a DVD for anyone who is especially a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be very proud.
