The rules of personal taste when it comes to movies, like this dignified little pearl. Make it back in the eighties, early eighties, I discovered this movie, as much released during that time, "Night Patrol" "Bad Manners", or even "King Frat", which is a cover and back cover is bullied and bullied. , the films I have already mentioned, as well as things like "Screwballs" and many others, imagined, and fortunately many years later I still remember some affection and some despise many films that help to maintain my love for a genre like parodies or pastels. <br /> <br /> Made many years after the great success of the "Husband" and having seen how it was down over the years, I now know that this movie would have no chance of hiding the above mentioned ticket offices, nor would it be remembered , similar to the National Lampoon Holiday. <br /> <br /> Honestly, not all that has covered the National Lampoon Logo, however, has been a wild success in my class reunion as one of my all-time favorite movies, with instantly recognizable characters such as Bob Spinnaker, played by Gerrit Graham perfectly, so good Charles Bandi's "Terrorvision", which still remained in his youth's past. Or how would Stephen Furst's messy and ballsy turn like high school lazy drunk sex that is crazy about Hubert Downs. <br /> <br /> Sweet as. What makes me contemplate. As I have already said, personal taste will not tolerate. People can be so cruel, so they never win prizes or compare comedy with similar ones in the world. It's a little. Being one of the earlier scripts written by John Hughes, who later continues his own "Weird Science" movie, and has an excellent Gary US bond song. <br /> What else can I say, this is a movie that is waiting to be discovered over and over again.
