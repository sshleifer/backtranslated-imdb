This movie is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like any Panah film, it was a very realistic drama that represents a common theme of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much lighter than the director's dark and serious ring (my favorite Iranian film). The ingenuity of girls and soldiers between them and the soldiers was so utterly believable (as if it were a documentary) and completely fun. <br /> <br /> Filming and supervising the real game was amazing. It added a reality, like Australia's Kenny, of course, a very different film. <br /> <br /> Performances by all non-professional participants? soldiers and girls? were very reliable. The passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls was very touching. Anyone in this country who thinks that Muslim girls wear a Chador are different from their daughters, should you watch this movie? it is a real eye opener. <br /> <br /> The soldiers showed me the current paradigm. They started with a standard official political response to all the girls' claims. As the film progressed, they found this attitude increasingly difficult. If what seems to be like the whole of Tehran is a wild holiday, then everything is captured and the ridiculousness of the current policy is obvious to everyone and everyone. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected end and gave the film a truly pleasant blend of emotions, recklessness, drama and social comments. Although it is an adult cinema, I think adult children from around seven years would appreciate this movie (if they can read subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran can produce films of such quality as Panah and Kiarostami. Perhaps the constraints imposed on them by directors are extremely resourceful. Australian (and others) filmmakers could take their books out.
