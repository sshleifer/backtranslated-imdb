<br /> <br /> I interact with other reviewer comments for the simple reason that it is MYSTERY FILM, not supernatural! This is not the only movie that has a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires") but turns out to be very common. <br /> <br /> The other movies that come to mind are Edgar Wallace's "Before dawn" and (the most famous) "Vampire character." The film makes WONDERFUL work for a very "horrible atmosphere", similar to DRACULA, Renfield meets the Count on his castle stairs or VAMPIRE LABEL when two people look through the windows of the castle's ruins and look at the organ that plays with the organ, while Luna falls on the wings! Very surreal! <br /> <br /> If they like (often silent) atmospheric touch, this movie is BLACK! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel
