Esther Williams gets his first post in MGM starring and comes out <br /> <br /> from the beginning. This movie is a well-functioning entertainment varied <br /> <br /> with a mature theme repeated a million times more <br /> <br /> in the future - an innocent girl bothered by a terrible woman. Esther <br /> <br /> looks great and, if he wants, he could probably have made more and better movies, but according to his autobiography, he left a lot of work for marriage. In both cases, she is so pleasant and interesting that her fun to see her in a completely different role. <br /> <br /> Outside the "swimming music". Universal was fabulous <br /> <br /> to make a movie with a former MGM after this studio started <br /> <br /> when it started sliding down the hill. Letters <br /> <br /> like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others were able to produce high quality first <br /> <br /> movies on Universal, as they probably still had the power of <br /> <br /> the box office. I wish Esther had done more, but because he didn't, it makes it even more special.
