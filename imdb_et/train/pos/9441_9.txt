The makers of this fine film did a great job of getting you involved with the characters because they suffered this terrible revenge. The terrifying scene in the woods was so magnificent that you forget that these men were just actors playing parts. has never been filmed as I have this one. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on the screen, as well as Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and although he only appeared briefly, James Dickey, the man who wrote the book on which the film is based, Aintry sheriff. should, of course, protect it, but it is an excellent, dramatic cinema.
