An odd couple is a comic pearl. One of the funniest scripts ever dedicated to celluloid - just Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are the best friends: obsessive compulsive Felix and sloppy, irresponsible Oscar. The Oscar's husband has already left because he is unable to live because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves her at the beginning of the film and, after an interrupted suicide attempt, she moves with the Oscar Poker Party. This is when fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire script is brilliant and full of brilliant single-layer. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." fun, but it still works great because of Matthau's comic timing. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sinus at his place of eating and when Pigeon's sisters are fascinated by the very mouth of Matthau and Lemmon is completely out of his element. This requires repeated views!
