I caught it last night. I liked the movie. I went to Russia 3 different times (accepting our 2 children). I can't justify my finger exactly why I liked this movie, except for "bad" turn "good" and "good" in turn half-bad. I liked to have Ben Chaplin review the whole movie. Like "I can't believe it happens to me", whether it's good or bad, it's the same look (and it works). Great end. 7/10 Rent it or put it on a dish like me.
