Surprisingly good movie! There are quite a few jokes through this movie. The only downside is that some scenes go to extremes to show how stupid there are two main characters. We get it, fools blonde, we get it! <br /> <br /> The piece just bothered to be called a "corn". And the boobs are always plus altho, but some strange reason for the movie doesn't play much with this card, even if the plot line introduces two black hair women who act as our two blond evil counters. <br /> <br /> So everything is good for watching the movie. I gave him almost 8/10, but don't forget.
