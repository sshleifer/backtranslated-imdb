Updated from previous comment. Marion Davies, a big and underrated, shows his comic in this late (1928) silent comedy that also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a Georgian hero running with Hollywood Haines, a bit of a player's raw comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion has "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A great lamp in Hollywood and its claims. Davies & Haines has a wonderful team and guest shots like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you must see it) are hoot. Necessary for serious movie buffs or anyone interested in Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays father. Polly Moran is a girl. Paul Ralli is a slippery leading man. <br /> <br /> SHOW HUMANS have used Gloria Swanson's career as a model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film rises parallel to Swanson's one-off Mack Sennett comedies by Charlie Chaplin and STAR Cecil B. DeMille's films from later teens and early 20ths. <br /> <br /> Davies and Haines were huge stars and friends. Strangely enough, MGM didn't talk about them. They're great together! Sweet romance and delightful early Hollywood looting. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned, but they are not displayed.
