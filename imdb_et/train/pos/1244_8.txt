I saw this movie for the first time on television a few years ago and honestly loved it. Charles Dance makes one of the most frightening villains that anyone can imagine. His complexity is such a perfect contrast that is a harshly good hero. I've never been much of a fan of Eddie Murphy, but I found here a winner of my irritating image: a little "Axel Foley reviewing the glass". Charlotte Lewis is to use the hackneyed phrase, but the only applicable, luminous gorgeous. Some scenes are wonderfully created: a dream sequence, a bird, scenes that are stupid to fight, and climatic confrontation. Throughout Murphy is a modern man who suddenly fell into the oriental myth, Kurt Russell's dazed and quieter version of his oriental fantasy. Like this movie, we have James Hong, an incomparable actor whose scenes, though short, even enhance Derek's quality. Since 1955, Hong Kong has defined a subtle actor, the "class act" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is silly; it is not perfect; but it has so many redemptive qualities that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy that you should look at. After four years I have seen the "golden baby" again; I enjoyed it even more! It's really great fun.
