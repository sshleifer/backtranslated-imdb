"I just wanted you to laugh at Purple Rain." This is a great movie. It should have been recalculated to PG-13. But still, prince's first film and biggest. Follow-up was sucked. But I haven't seen for years, so here I remember it. Kid (Prince) must fight for the love of his life, Apollonia (himself), keeping his band together (revolution himself) and tension in his family. But the Time is itself destroying his life. As Morris (himself) tries to steal from Apollonia Kid. Just like Saturday night, Flashdance and 8 miles. Very good. Rent it, laugh and cry and if you allow it, buy it.
