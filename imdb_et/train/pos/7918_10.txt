I loved this movie. Actually, I loved this movie actress. In the second half of the movie, I was a pregnant teenager. Perhaps you remember me better in the classroom when the werewolf exhibited on the film. I was on the female front row, my hands were planted on my face, responding to what we're watching on the film projector. In fact, they twice took me a couple of times, so it's hard to miss this mistake. Thumbs up to full moon high. I wish it would happen soon.
