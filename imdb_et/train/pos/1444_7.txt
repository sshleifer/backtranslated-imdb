*** SPOILERS *** When Hidden In Brooklyn North Det. Nestor Serrano, Eddie Santos, was supposed to meet his drug supplier Tito Zapat, Larry Romano, from the Brooklyn Williamsburg part of the purchase and bust operation, where Tito was striking that things went to both Det. Santos and Tito get together and kill. During the deadly shooting, innocent bystanders, six-year-old James Bone Jr., Jaliyl Lynn, were also killed in the burn. <br /> <br /> In New York in the summer of 1996, the Democratic President's Convention was organized. The last thing the townspeople, Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted to make possible the tragic death of young James Bones, later determined to be the bullet of Tito's weapons killing New York City City Police. <br /> <br /> What was more shocking, even Bone's death is that his killer Tito Zapatti was given a probationary period by a well-respected NY state judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. If he had to stick behind bars for 10 to 20 years, if his car's back seat had a kilo of cocaine! It soon became clear that the person who received Judge Stern for his work was $ 50,000.00, was not another Brooklyn political boss, Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. This is Anselmo, who is associated with Mayor Pappas in a land agreement involving the New York subway system, which would bring him tens of millions of dollars over the next two years and his real estate workers! It would also indirectly associate Mayor Pappas with the killing of bones by joining him with Judge Stern, who gave Tito a free friend, both his and his Gomba or Landsman, a friend of Frank Anselmo. <br /> <br /> To keep it all late, Det. Santons is framed by working insidiously without bossing his bosses. In fact, those who shape Santos go far and hide their $ 40,000.00 cash in their upper summer home, so Tito's uncle Mafia boss Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, pays for his nephew to deal with drugs. activities. What can explain him well, but also Tito, who Tito welshing out of his paying Santos! <br /> <br /> As things turn out to be the mayor of Pappas in the Town Hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who ends up dancing all over his boss, being too honest to find out who was responsible for covering Tito's criminal record, allowing him to get out of the streets. The facts that Kevin discovered brought directly to Frank Anselmo, Mayor of Pappas, a great political supporter, who found out that he had joined Tito's mafia maid to Uncle Paul. <br /> <br /> The somewhat over-sketched "Town Hall" shows how big city corruption, both in the city government and the mayor of Pappas, even in the city scientist Pappas, can filter and drop. The biggest sin of Mayor Pappas was that he had friends with Brooklyn Boss Anselmo, who put people into work, like Judge Stern, who was punished by Anselmo's true superior Mafioso Paul Zapat. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** took only a deadly shootout in Williamsburg to set everything apart from Tito Det. Santos and James Bone, who were killed, but why he was allowed to bring out the street to bring a very popular mayor of New York. Mayor Pappas is expecting much bigger things in his future political endeavors, such as the President or even the President. As it turned out, Kevin Calhoun, his deputy commander, was responsible for his death. As well as the mayor's good friend Frank Anselmo and the person he helped put, judge Stern. Who decided that Tito Zapatti gave up this disaster, resulting in at least half a dozen murders and one suicide!
