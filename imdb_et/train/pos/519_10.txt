I saw this movie first about 20 years ago and has never forgotten it. It is beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted all the time. It is hard to believe that this was done in 1946 because the story is fresh today and really thinks. I am not very familiar with the film technique, but the special effects of this movie are fantastic when it was done. In addition, the actor is excellent and the use of English and American actors is quite amazing. I recently bought a DVD so I can now watch it if I like. I recommend that someone interested in British post-war movies watch it.
