Q.E.D. was a brilliant TV series and it was really one of the few worthy of planning! I suspect that TIVO and storage devices in this era would be much better than in 1982. I look forward to its availability on DVD! <br /> <br /> While it is true that he has some other TV shows, such as The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and Brisco County Adventures, Jr., all of which is a great fan of QED, he had much more intellectual quality. It didn't suffer, but the dialogue was witty and the action was high. The show ran for Mastermind in the UK and had something from the BBC but with better production values ​​than the BBC usually had in that era. <br /> <br /> I was a 19-year-old boy when this series ran for the first time and had a lot to do in my life to make time for the TV. However, I remember my dear mother, reminding me that Q.E.D. we were on and we were sitting on the phone and watching it together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Really, Q.E.D. is a sad loss and if it could be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I would like to see it returned.
