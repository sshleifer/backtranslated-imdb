I just saw "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! With a mysterious and almost spooky movie. I loved the way music went with every step of Philip's feet. It gave me some chills for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the biggest aspects of this movie is that you see Bette Davis stepping into his eyes. He's great, not necessarily because it's his best job, but because it was so common to be so cruel, sharp and insecure as an actor in 1934 ... Bette was a risk-maker who always wanted to be different and that's he was right when he realized that he could be so nasty and bold as he wanted, and people would love him for that. If you're a true movie lover, it's amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> She was just a way to deliver a line that made this part, and for this movie it belongs. Like "Music and fire. It's me ... old kazoo and some sparks" or "But you're Blanche, you're in the chair!" or "ALL MY HIGH, I love the man I killed!" ... They come from some of his films, but you get my drift. She was just as brave, buggy and exotic with these beautiful big eyes. After I see it, I can't believe it was rebuilt repeatedly ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was great ... so calm and lasting, needs love. I thought he was divine and couldn't figure out how each one did not fall to him, but then again all ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was something that was common in writing earlier films. They made such anger that it was almost unbelievable that someone would actually rank first. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would never be interested in Mildred. It's just a simple truth ... Look at it!
