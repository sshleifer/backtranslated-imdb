Following a Finnish experience of just over a week, I would say that this film represents the very nature of Finnish society. In particular, I am very familiar with the phenomenon of young-couple-child-child-child-serious problems, as I saw exactly the same thing in Finland when I was. People's relationships and problems, the instability of the marriage agency, the drinking culture, unemployment and the problem of rising money are all very well set, without subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> A movie that is not necessarily easy to understand and binding to one another, but a common big picture is still cost effective. None of the short stories are exciting or deep, but as stated above, the big picture is not able to give the "real life" feeling and viewer. I think I mean at a calm moment: what's going on in the lives of these people on the street? Well, that's what's going on. Such films are good for feeding imagination. It would be safe to assume that this film could be applied to people living in many countries, but it particularly reflects Finland as it is, and quite damn well. <br /> <br /> One comment about the show: Finnish fan cinema I am, I have never seen any of these actors on any other film, but I found this feature next to the acting neighbor to be perfect. Maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good sample for the whole team. I'll keep an eye on the future by the director and the director. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
