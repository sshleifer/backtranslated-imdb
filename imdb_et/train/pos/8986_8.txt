Anton Newcombe is making a film and is the main subject. Looking at him to hit the song, when the whole album did not show the man is a true talent. He thinks he is a god but is so prollific and interesting. DW is not quite as interesting in music or otherwise. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" Anton tells the operator: "Well you can go ahead with this guitar!" Archive / Great use of home video. Good to see that the rock documents have been made. Cool doc about creative process. If you like this go see Nirvana Live! Today! Sold out! On DVD. Good experience Anton is this movie. 8 out of 10
