This movie takes you to a different time when there was a different pace in everyday life. We get an idea of ​​how families had to deal with war and how quickly we fought young men. A very touching look at the past and a reminder that the victims of war do not just happen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our grandparents, grandparents, or parents went through during the war. This movie is, in my opinion, a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazing as young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe are totally charming and Australian as he may be. It is definitely worth listening to him by saying "High Flight" and making me think about what he could achieve with Shakespeare.
