I saw this movie about a year ago and found it completely ridiculous. I think it's a real winner. It emphasized foolish comedy, but there was also a real plot. Similarly, the comedy hit Elf. It had some serious moments of fun. When Stiller photographed Black's horse, he was usually a sober moment, found himself laughing at his worship. You can actually find a common ground there because I am sure many people have done something they don't want a friend to know about that your friendship shouldn't end. <br /> <br /> When I found out how many people didn't like this movie, I was totally stupid. In this absolutely terrible movie, such as Napoleon Dynamite, there was a higher rating than what makes me think about the reasonableness of IMDb people. Take advice and rent it. If you do not find yourself laughing at least once, I will reimburse you the rent. = D
