I have to admit that Holly was not on the watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. But after the festival's artistic director suggested this film to more than 200 people before screening another movie, I decided to watch it. Wow! <br /> <br /> This film deals with the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does so without compromise. I've found myself shouting several times during the movie and laughing at others. Talking about an emotional skater. <br /> <br /> The leading actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer (who was only 14 at the time of filming) and had to deal with this incredibly complex and challenging role. He reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes whale racket, but the role here is much more demanding when he has to play a child's prostitute. It is possible that he will win several prizes. <br /> <br /> The main story is a girl who was sold to prostitution by her family and was considered a sex slave in the Cambodia brothel. He meets Americans (played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role that we don't see him), who after a while with him decides to help him. But by that time he will be sold again and he will look for him around Cambodia. The story turns and revolves, and the audience can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The actor was strong all around the world with an interesting international show. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourist), Virgine Ledoyen (as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his latest films). The cast of Asia was also great. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult topic, it successfully focuses on telling a powerful story. It was shot in Cambodia (some scenes in real brothels), which adds to the feeling that you are watching almost a documentary. It seems that DP used a lot of handheld cameras and close-ups, and in general it made me feel like you were part of the story. <br /> <br /> After screening, I listened to you when they left and it seemed that they were all stunned. It's not an easy viewing of a movie and I welcome filmmakers who didn't make a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best movie I've seen at Edinburgh Film Festival. Opinion of my husband and other friends.
