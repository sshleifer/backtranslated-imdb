When I found out about Sir Alec Guinness's death, it was the first of his many films I was thinking again. What a great movie commentary even after all these years. And Guinness helps worship the charm of every frame. Her eyes and face are as bright as the white costume. Both her and the film must be considered as lifelong favorites.
