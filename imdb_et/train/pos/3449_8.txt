TACHIGU: SIGNIFICANT SPECIES FOR SPEED FUELS Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii Featuring: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Dog Yamadera - ------- ------------------------------- <br /> <br /> Back in 1995, Mamoru Oshii unleashed his dazzling animation " Ghost In The Shell, which helped to strengthen the international acceptance of the anime, and also gave Andy and Larry Wachowski the overall concept of "Matrix". <br /> <br /> The sequel to the movie, Innocence (2004), was the start of the Japanese animated film, competing for Cannes Palme d'Or, and left the head as complex as its style and innovative effects, as well as its pointless landfill . <br /> <br /> Always a trend leader, Oshii has now provided us with Tachigui: The amazing life of Fast-Food Grifters? who has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell or the Japanese anime on this issue. <br /> <br /> Tell Oshii's "overpowering": not real animation or live-action. Instead, the cast was somewhere near 30,000 images that were digitally processed and recovered in a deceptively simple paper-cut fashion reminiscent of Bali's puppet theater. The movement itself is a stylish, stop-motion style that reflects Shinya Tsukamoto's experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988) sequences. <br /> <br /> "I couldn't think of any method, but that," Oshii said in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiur. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The choice you choose is equally puzzling. Kenji Kawai, who was also the composer of the ultimate soundtrack, appears as a frightening burger fanatic, while the well-known Studio Ghibli producer, Toshio Suzuki, spends time on the screen to murder the bizarre. Others include Katsuya Terada, who traveled with Oshii in blood: The Last Vampire and Shinji Higuchi - special effects that have worked in Godzilla films. <br /> <br /> The story of Koichi Yamadera sounds like a dry NHK documentary? which confirms the comic strip and Yamadera's extensive career here, expressing stoic anime characters like Spike Siegel Cowboy in Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself is a strange post-Japanese imagination of a variety of fast food fields - from soba ramen stores to hard-line runners; American dogs at McDonald's inspired burger chain restaurants. "Food is the main root of desire," Oshii asserted. <br /> <br /> A new breed of consumers has been thrown into the mix: the fast food-grifters, people who don't want to pay for their tucker and constantly refine their complicated munchies free of charge. <br /> <br /> Oshii said that his rear motif was respect for the "art" of eating streets? something that is considered to be a little taboo in this country and that somehow explains the use of "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> Live-action movie director (Avalon, Stray Dog) is also an animation, Oshii has often blurred the definition between two media. In this case, the celluloid result is placed on the gray area between the two forms. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual test is so exhilarating that it can be irritating. Just ask what does it all mean? Oshii films, which are equal parts of the brain and innovative, are often not very clear. When Oshii succeeds, is it a black humor through a liberal dose? here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, death hula-hoop, the world's fastest samurai burger cake? and the very essence of the movie in a very surreal. <br /> <br /> This is a guy who is struggling with the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and may owe both Andrei Tarkovsky and David Lynch. It should not be surprising, therefore, that at one stage the B-52 bomber Yoshinoya looks like a franchise. The 54-year-old writer-director seemed natural. "Japan, which I imagine in the film, may not be a reality," he said. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> Andrez Bergen
