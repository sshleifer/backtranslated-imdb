Waiting for this movie for a long time. It's ads that gave a fair idea about the content and when I finally saw it, I find it pretty well done. Most of the usual romantic movies end up in a way that they love to finally marry or start a happy life after marriage, but in the old life of a new relationship and life, a great correction is really needed. This is what this film talks about when the newly married couple Fardeen and Esha married through organized marriage and start their lives with honeymoon. Action is really spell-binding, though I think Esha was a bit silent and could have used some features for her. The story was well-knit and the dialogues were more or less relevant. Editing and heading were also good, Meghna Gulzar did a good job. To sum up, this is a good drama cum romance, a real combination of what Bollywood offers to a pure entertainer.
