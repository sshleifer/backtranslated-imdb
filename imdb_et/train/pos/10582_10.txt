It's sung. It has a drama. It's comedy. It has a story. This is one of the biggest movies ever made ... period. If you can't enjoy this movie, you must be asleep or some sort of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" James Cagney sings and dances his way to the Academy Award; but in this movie he is better! This is James Cagney's indispensable BEST! He's fast with one liner! He's quick with his feet! This is an unfinished activity. And song and dance skits are classic, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the support cast is great; and the whole film is optimistic, fast moving and awakens confidence. And although this film was made over 70 years ago, it is still traceable. And of course, this film includes Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). He is an ideal partner for James Cagney and Dick Powell! If you like a pleasant, fast-paced movie with lots of singing and dancing, this is the movie to watch.
