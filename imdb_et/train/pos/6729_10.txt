If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or are interested in seeing a real, non-cartoon, then "American America", then Riding Giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is an "unrealistic", easy-to-understand concept once it was, but very relevant if you get any literal meaning of it - it's a 100% factual documentary, but all the opera sciences, and absolutely obvious love , the feeling of experts and knowledge that Stacy Peralta guided and narrated will make this film unnecessarily swell to you, keeping you completely exhausted in everything you are given. br /> This film is both a symphony and Beethoven's 9th, starting beautifully with this premiere in Hawaii, deeply pulling on human emotions in Santa Cruz and ending with fear, triumph and crescendo with Laird Hamiltons. br /> <br /> Like classic music; like Beethoven's Ninth, Valkyry's driving or hairdressers, this may be the only piece you want, but it's worth it. Trust me.
