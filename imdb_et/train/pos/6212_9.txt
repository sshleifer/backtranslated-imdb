I am very pleased with this film, even though it appeared deliberately less "polished" than other Fred and Ginger films, not to mention Harriet Hillard's slightly problematic election in a leading romantic role. <br /> <br /> Again, these films have little effect on the plot - Astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor (who is of course a brilliant former hoofer (of course!)) and Rogers is an ambitious performer. nice musical hall. Though their relationship is brilliant and fun to watch, they have been beaten by Hilliard and Randolph Scott's endless main story that fails to find any chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last-minute decision, Hilliard was in this discomfort because she didn't have a screen to give the film what she needed, despite being sweet and pleasant. The film may be useful in promoting the character of Lucille Ball's wisely splitting world ball to a greater role, as he just seemed to be in every small scene and would have made Helers Broderick's side-blow to Rogers in such a bright film (as an example of the next "Stage Door" you can see great scenes of these two fantastic actor). This Scottish one-dimensional character of Neanderth finally loves Hilliard when Astaire is in the Navy! <br /> <br /> Now an important part, singing and dancing: nothing else can be said about music and dancing, except what is brilliant and touching and perfectly executed, and I often end up tearing down the scene in my eyes. But other movie songs also deserve recognition; "I put all my eggs in one basket" is an excellent example of the comedy instincts of Astaire and Rogers and almost entertain their reputation when they are spontaneously, completely synchronized dances. The other highlighted topics are "I'd rather lead the band" and "Let yourself go", which shows how these two talents could be as wonderfully alone as together. I almost forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) times we see Astaire playing well on the piano; It seems that this man's talents were endless! <br /> <br /> Generally, I prefer "Top Hat" and "Swing Time" (though only correctly) because it has more reputation and everyone is so eager to participate. It is difficult from a fun factor.
