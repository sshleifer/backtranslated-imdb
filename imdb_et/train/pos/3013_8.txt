The talented detective, Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell), is canceling his foreign visit to investigate an allegedly cut and dried suicide case that he has reason to suspect, is really more, rather a deliciously complicated murder! <br /> <br /> As for the mystery films of the murder, it just doesn't improve. Suspicious characters who are all connected to dog shows and all have a good reason to murder the obvious suicide victim of Archer Coe are really hard to think of, or turn their heads around, but the boy, is it exciting to see us. Even the police, the coroner, and the district prosecutor turn out to be colorful, clarify the character, giving this procedure an unexpected sharp reality and increasing its overall "fun" factor. I especially liked the comics that were associated with the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot) who always seem to have interrupted and prematurely interrupted the discovery of corpses or injured men during this working period. Also Eugene Palette's Detective Sgt. Heath offers a welcome, often tenderly humorous, expense, critical comment during Vance's investigation. I can't think of valid criticism to actually give this movie, except apparently that it's not very well dated. This does not prevent the film from simply being viewed. See and see if you can turn your head into a mystery. Very recommended to try!
