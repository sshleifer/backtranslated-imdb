Nagra comes from a conservative Indian family that is not exactly for girls who play competitive football. But our attractive young star can play serious football. Rhys-Meyers instructs Nagrat and encourages him to do so while Knightley is a supportive teammate and friend. If the wedding is planned the same day as the final football match that is a girl? Similar to its unique way, BFGW, when Nagra tries to push the envelope into traditional family ways. Here is the father (Kheri played well) who sees the problem on both sides. Docked the entire point of hokey belated sexual preference for non-crisis when they need a filler they might have elsewhere. Nice final packing for the whole transaction.
