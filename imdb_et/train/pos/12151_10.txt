It's just a display of what you should do for a TV movie. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in college that we stumbled upon it. Cheesy is acting. A poorly written script. Good boy boys. A ridiculous, but somehow obvious, clich√© and banal premise. Driving trucks with your supported spouse. You have it all. <br /> <br /> Familiar with court figures: gold digging, buggy rich boy who wants to do it himself, friends who know better, dad who knows better, but drives his son away. And the female body. Predefined. Selection. <br /> <br /> Wow: and Title. Several things in our lives have been "Texas tragedies" because we look at this beauty. Anyone involved in creating it deserves a medal.
