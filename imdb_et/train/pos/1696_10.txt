It's a cult. My friends and I can meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It's very funny and very dry. I've seen this movement tens of times and haven't enjoyed it yet. The actors are funny and it gets better every time you watch it! If you liked "Mooring out of space" then you love it. Great game in world war. I love the Red-Neck rampage to get aliens, bedspread, DOD, heat-seeking population, Annihilator, Red Camo, breaking speed limit 1800Mph! "I get a bucket!" Very funny. I would love to get out of this DVD! Forget about negative reviews to see it yourself!
