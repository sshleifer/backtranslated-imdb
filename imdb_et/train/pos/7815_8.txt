"Cry Freedom" is a film about how far people go to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first side is an interesting idea of ​​the unlikely friendship between Steve Biko and the editor Don Woods (which Dezel played fanatically) in Washington and Kevin Klein). When the other half deals with Woods, who is looking for answers about Biko's death. <br /> <br /> While most people are in favor of the first part of the film, focusing on Biko's and Woods' unlikely friendship. I found the other half about the Don forests fight Biko story to hear around the world much more interesting.
