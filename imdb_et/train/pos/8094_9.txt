First of all, adaptation is never as good as a book, especially when it comes to a masterpiece like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION synthesizes perfectly with the psychiatry, aesthetics and liberal culture of the 1970s Tolkien universe. Yes - animation and backdrop are sometimes "hard" in their technical implementation, but it is beautiful and very pleasant to give each scene a unique "feeling". In addition to the absolute uniqueness of images, there is absolutely outstanding sound art - it is FAR higher than the performance of new live movies. And while cell animation may not be the most "technically dominant" animation, it captures the actor's expressive and facial gestures, while not forgetting that it is subtle and subtle. Wallpapers vary from the traditional "fantasy" motif to direct abstraction, but the transition to abstract settings is always motivated by narrative and greatly contributes to film themes. If you are a person who needs to have a large computer system in your movie, that everything is visualized for you, then I see how you might not like this movie, but if you enjoy higher action, transcendental image, and JRR Tolkien then this movie must be seen.
