Reading all the comments is very exciting. but can anyone tell me the name of a real artist who painted the pictures for good times. I understand that all refer to jjj. as an artist in the family, but was a real family with a true artist, and he has not yet seen this sight. So if you don't mind telling someone the name of a real artist, I'd like to say "well done" to him. I know this vision is good for newspapers, but do you disagree that he has touched the hearts of all of us. I would like to know if he still paints or is still alive. I would like some of her work to appear in my home.
