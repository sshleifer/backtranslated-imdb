Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the world of Christian subculture (and gave millions in the process) with LEFT BEHIND's books, we were taught by Billy Graham's evangelical association Christian IV Distribution Company, MARK IV Pictures. What I love most about this genre is his incredible attention to detail, sitting in the living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-rapture" misery, we sit in the living room listening to it in news because filmmakers can't show it. The premise of the film is based on the millennium pre-tribulation eschatalogy, believing that Christ will come once for the secret of the true church, and then it will come again on the earth for seven hell. What frightened me in juniors makes me laugh now. Patty and his adventurous adventures (and the two sequences of the film) talk about their remarkable mystery and ultimately the destruction. I don't want to admit it, but I still have to look at it thoroughly. It even has the Monty Python and Holy Grail SAME EXACT score. I think I'm the only person in this observation.
