I really enjoyed this movie because I have a huge interest in American history ... antebellum years and especially civil war. I bought this from a recently viewed video disc sold in a supermarket and I was very happy to add it to my history video collection. Although not a caliber of non-civil war films such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg", it offers a lot of history among cadets in West Point before the Civil War. Maybe it's a gray uniform, a youth or a military discipline, but I am fascinated by the story of the cadet corps from around 1830 until the brink of war. I imagine what he would have to sit with other young men in the classroom, learn how to make a war, then use lessons with his classmates! <br /> <br /> In fact, two classes ended in 1861: one in May, one in June. the film does not really mention this, except by mentioning Henry A. DuPont, who finished first class; and George Custer, last class in June. the reason for these two classes was not so much the war, but it was the result of a return to a four-year course, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (I thought the first class had five years, the second was four years). Cadets like brothers were portrayed in the film, and often they were nicknames ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say this movie is "Santa Fe Trail" because it should have been because of the 1940s film, while being enjoyable, really fudges history. The cadets of several different classes are all over. JEB Stuart and George Custer are depicted as best friends, and they are next to John Brown's 1859 uprising in the Harper ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the war. They met each other (I guess for the first time) in Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was on Harper's raft Raid, but Custer was still a cadet at the place where it was). <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custer plays the role of "61st Class", although his classmates' sons Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictional. I believe they are based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can watch. <br /> <br /> In any case, I enjoy this movie or movie that gives a window to America in the mid-19th century.
