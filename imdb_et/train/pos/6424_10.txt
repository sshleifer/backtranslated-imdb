As a child, I remember being nine or ten and I love this movie. It was all around the Bollywood action / comedy movie. This is obviously a Bad Boys imitation! Whole identities are exchanged, but the arrival of two other twins throws everyone out of the window and then the arrival of colored rogues who dance and sing! The scenes on the film are not revolutionary but still amazing scenes. The movie is really very funny and it was a great comeback for Amitabh Bachan. Govinda is a pearl as always and it is probably her best work to date, she looks like a side impact a nd offers the best comedy scenes that are available in the Indian cinema. Songs .... The songs are as funny as memorable .............. laughs when you expect the least ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly funny and makes you laugh like "Bade Miah" .... her accent ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> "Assi chutki neighbor re daal" is the best song .... .......... Fun.
