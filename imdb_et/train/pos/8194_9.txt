Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie; a film that reflects - better or worse - the socio-political feelings of the state during the Reagan era of the early 1980s. It's also a kickass action movie. <br /> <br /> Opening up with a liberal female judge who gives up the murder case due to lack of tangible evidence, and then goes straight to the coffee shop with several bad hoodlums (a scene that forces the famous, "Go ahead, make my day" line), " Sudden Impact "is one of the non-stop scooters of the action film. The first time you catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector Callahan is sent away somewhat in the city to investigate the background of the murdered hood. It will only be better if there are grotesque criminals at Callahan who work with a mysterious past with a sherriff. Excellent direction and photography, and the occasional fun script make this movie one of the best in the 80s.
