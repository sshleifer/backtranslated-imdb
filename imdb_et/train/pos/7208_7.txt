Writer Sidney Bruhl (superbly Michael Caine from the top) would kill the hits. Enter a young wonderful child (solid Reeve) who has just written such a game. Stay in this Bruhl Excess Hysterical Spouse (great at Cannon) and German Psychics (very funny Irene Worth) and you have a great funny tab. <br /> <br /> Although not up to "Standards," "Deathtrap" is a very capable, complicated, full comical aisle based on Ira Levin's terrible play. The performers obviously wear a material day, where Caine is particularly good at the top. > <br /> In the meantime, the film loses some steam and the end is much less satisfying than the fun one in the original game, but the overall "Deathtrap" is a confident, well-functioning and stopping fun.
