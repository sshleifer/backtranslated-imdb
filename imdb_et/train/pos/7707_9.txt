As others in this forum, when "Fobidden Planet" was offered in 1956, I hurried to see it. This story is an interesting phenomenon that I recommend, because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such a ticket can very well observe and enjoy the story and plot of this movie. Elsewhere in the world other than the 20th century, with the exception of "Flash Gordon", Leslie Nielsen was vocally weak at that time, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman and especially Warren Stevens would all justify themselves. well, it has so many visual splendors, it is difficult to choose a favorite from the movie scenes, approach Alta-4, star ship, landing on the alien surface of the planet, landing through extensor stairs, first view of landscape, rocket shield approach, dr. The Morbi house, regardless of the interior and exterior, the underground complex and its miracles, the setting of weapons, the fight against the monster, the ultimate destruction of the destroying destroyer, the escape from the dead planet - all these scenes are etched into the mind of the viewer because we discover them with the participants. Veteran Cyril Hume's illiterate script was filmed intelligently by long-term director Fred McLeod Wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize that there is no music at all; the movie is carried by words, actors and the story of mystery revelation. It can be seen again and again with joy - I've done it for almost fifty years. Until this famous and beloved movie was created, no film had attempted to imagine the world outside the Earth; and decades later, the ships had to crash on the planet - as if the imagination of the writers had failed and caused accidents. Best of all, many say. It says something negative about the imagination of the intellectual leaders of this country - and I really offer something very positive to those who made it.
