Rookie kept me smiling from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played a role in perfection. The little boy playing his son was fantastic. He remembered this father-son movie. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failure to try is fine when you try. The thrill is felt. I believe this film is classic.
