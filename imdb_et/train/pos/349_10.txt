Call me a fool, but I loved the Valentine's 2001 horror film. It was so well done, well-written, well-functioning, well-run, etc.! All this was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely scary and horrible (Paige's death) and just a heartbeat (first scene). I think the whole casting was a great job, especially three leaders: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both met and got autographs while filming this movie - very nice people!) And Marley Shelton. br /> <br /> I'm very sick of people who call this movie a "second Scream clone". This film is by no means a Scream clone. In fact, this movie works around Scream. In fact, SENSE! Scream was not the only movie that contained a masked killer. Sorry, but it seems that Scream was also a clone (ahem ..., Friday 13th, Halloween and many other scary movies were also hidden killers). I also think that the novelty of the amor-masked killer is great. It's so strange when you see a sweet, amorous face, doing all these horrible things. Another novelty (nose bleeding) makes a fantastic end! The end gives me chills when I see it !!!!! So, even if you didn't like it for the first time, check out Valentine again and give him another chance! <br /> <br /> PS - Keep an eye on your new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming ...
