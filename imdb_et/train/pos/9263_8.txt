This is an absolutely delightful and unexpected movie. Start by following a young person who is hoping to get into a qualifying football match between Bahrain and Iran. When Iran wins, they get in Germany in 2006. The problem is that the young girl is the girl and the girls (or women on this issue) are not allowed to "sit with men" in football matches. Here is a wonderful comedy that is played with the perfect skill of a small ensemble. The film examines the absurdity of restrictions on women's freedom (and the young soldiers who need to fix them in this matter). Some great pieces are not only when one of the girls has to go to the toilet and, of course, there are no lavatories for women in the stadium. Camera operation is the easiest and in some cases it could have been played on stage. But this is a small scale that gives the film a bite. Great Cinema? No, probably not; great entertainment - definitely.
