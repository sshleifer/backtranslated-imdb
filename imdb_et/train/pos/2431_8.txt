The famous was "famous" in terms of its load and style of cartoon release, where the captain is in terrible danger, but the hero saves it in the last second. This particular Casper is the only one I remember where death actually takes. But even in the event of death, there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It is a constant feature of the famous studio drawings that "always wins the round". Popeye always comes to her spinach, Baby Huey is always a fox, on Friday, "Little Audery" is always learning her lesson. And some FS cartoons are really blind and frustrating. <br /> <br /> You have to give them credit. as much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" I don't think anyone would have put a better drawing product at that time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (big Winston Sharples), editing, voices. They were a consistent and beautiful example of the best the art form offered.
