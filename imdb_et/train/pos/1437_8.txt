We often see films that are undesirable in politics, but I still recommend "Town Hall". Having played, Al Pacino played the stars as the mayor of New York, who has to deal with the boy's shooting. But it turns out that something he doesn't really do has any effect. In this film, the characters are as sharp as we are expecting someone from the political scandal. No matter how much you trust a politician, you may have doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I cannot name any specific example that resembles what this film represents, but it is not a point. If we had perfect impressions from the top, this film would shed such ideas. Surely I want to see you. John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer also play.
