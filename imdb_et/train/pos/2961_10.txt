This is the only David Zucker movie that doesn't break anything first. A more fun movie from 98 with Night at Roxbury, but I didn't think anything about Mary was funny, so it doesn't count, except for the honest and the beans. Don't listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, whom he doesn't know about solid entertainment, but look at his comments.
