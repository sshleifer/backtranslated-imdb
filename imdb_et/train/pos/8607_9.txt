He has never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song is always so mercilessly sealed, not just their deterrents, but almost everything. For me, "I'm married to an angel" is more lively and imaginative than any duo with more marked excursions. Sets and costumes are so rich in MGM music as scripts are trusted by Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), Rodgers, and Hart (though MacDonald-Eddy's regular Bob Wright and Chet Forrest changed a little bit), Herbert Stothart (Ozz winner winner Oscar winner) gives heavenly treatment, and best of all, "singing more expensive" looks great in modern clothing and it looks like fun with strange actions. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" nowadays uninitiated and they may be very hard to sit still, but this offbeat, fast paced fantasy is definitely entertainment.
