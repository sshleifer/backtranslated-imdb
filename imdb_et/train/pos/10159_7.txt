There are few movies or movies that have been considered a favorite over the years. One of them was the way of the gospel. I looked at it as a young teen and I would like to look at it again. My favorite things were that 1 / Jesus was blonde, <br /> <br /> 2 / last dinner was a great meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he likes playing with kids, <br /> > 4 / His death was for all people and all the time. <br /> <br /> The film may not be theologically sound or high quality, but it touched my heart at that time. Besides, I'm a Johnny Cash fan and it was a bold venture. If it ever appears on a DVD, I buy it for purely sentimental reasons.
