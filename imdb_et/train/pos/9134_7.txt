"Purple Rain" has never been a critic of the critic, but it is a cult classic and deserves it. If you're a Prince fan, that's for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is a prince who sees his abusive parents in himself and in love with his girlfriend. Believe it or not, this movie is not just about singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is warm-hearted. Sometimes it's funny, but when it works, it really works. Very hit and missed. <br /> <br /> No one can actually act in the movie. Everyone is from a Prince like "The Time" and "Vanity 6". However, it adds the charm of the film. Once the prince is on the screen, it will light up and it is nice to see him in his commercial top level. Finally, go and see if you love the prince like me. If you are not a fan, you will do one.
