one of the funnest mario I've ever played. levels are creative, fluid controls, and good timing. There are also many mad bosses and enemies in the fight. Sometimes the levels become frustrating and if you leave out some difficult levels and still need to get more to fight the boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the camera angle; although it usually works fairly well, it can be pain in some cases. as your big time Mario fan; they are for you. even if you weren't his big fan, I would recommend it. It's a great game and getting what you need can take some time, but it's very satisfying. good to play in short time. this is definitely in your best interest; it's definitely mine!
