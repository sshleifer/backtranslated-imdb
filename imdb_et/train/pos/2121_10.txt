This is a beautiful movie that all players are working great. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry. At the end of the movie, I get blurry at any time. If you want to see a big movie, that's it. Jimmy Stewert is great at funny play and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is enchanting. The diversity of Morgan's character is not amazing. William Tracy, like Pepi, is a terrible comic book and offers some movies for the most important rows and performances. Felix Bressart offers a fantastic job like Perovitch, who is a stumbling block who is aiming for a lifetime that the person with whom he works is pleasant. This is a simple story of how close associates can get and how two people with great hostility against each other fall in love with unusual situations.
