It's a pretty simple, not very active, but very charming movie. There were moments where I understand why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actor, but there were other times when I thought why Glenn Close didn't win Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe won and BAFTA Candidate Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low-paid job just asked by Mr Johnny Cammarer (Danny Aiello) to marry her. She promises her that she will be back in a month when her mother is sick so she thinks, but she needs to get as much of her family as possible to attend the wedding. The only problem is that if he finds Johnny to be one-handed brother Ronny (called Nicolas Cage's name), they will start communicating and the love will go on to that cube (where the title comes from). The Oscar also featured Vincent Gardenia Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe, who won Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney Perryna. Johnny and Loretta didn't get to the wedding, but he and Ronny were together. It won the Oscar for best writing, scripted directly to the screen, and was nominated for the best director for Norman Jews (at night) and for the best picture, it was assigned to BAFTA for best results by Dick Hyman and Best Original Scenario and it was the best mobile globe of the moving picture - comedy / musical and best scenario. It was number 96 100 years, 100 price quotes ("Snap out from!"), It was the number 100 100 years, 100 passion and it was number 41 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
