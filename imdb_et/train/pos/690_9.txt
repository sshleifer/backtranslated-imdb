I had no idea what the film was or even knew it was there until about 1 month ago when I stumbled upon looking for other movies that looked at Dominic Monaghan. I thought this film was a strange idea of ​​any idea of ​​going to bed and what his mind could go through in the hours they sleep when the rest of the world is sleeping, it was an interesting movie and a good part played by Dom ....... though this movie can't be bought anywhere (well I've never seen it before), you have to see it if you have the chance to get it because it's really an opportunity for you to think about the people who surround us, can't sleep and stay overnight because they're not was able to sleep or get every night only about 1 hour, so in general it was an interesting good substance film.
