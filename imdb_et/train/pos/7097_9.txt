Just kidding, I rented the monkey 12 the other day because I'm a big fan of Bruce Willis and I heard something about the movie. Some good and some bad, but it was one of those movies that had to be looked after every second so I was a little worried. Just because I felt for a few minutes when it was one of the films I had to watch several times. But I looked at it last night and I really had the impression that this movie had everything: action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor and even a little romance. All the actors did terrible work, I give Bruce a lot of credit, in his car with his psychiatrist scene he really does with me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just surprised at how big his job is. He didn't make his character who was crazy and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary, but very good and awakening. <br /> <br /> James Cole is a man in the future where the virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of people. population. Animals dominate above the ground, while humans are below, but scientists send to James until 1990 (which means sending it to '96) to get information about the virus. James becomes a spiritual institution that meets his new psychiatrist dr. He tells them that the future, of course no one believes in him, he goes back to the future. But the scientists will send him back to the right year where James the doctor has been kidnapped, but he will tell him more and believe him. Now they have tried to avoid the virus. <br /> <br /> 12 Monkeys were an incredible movie. As I said, this story was so scary because it is not at all hard to believe that we are not far from it. But the whole movie was great, cast, kits, just the whole picture was great. It had a Terminator-like feeling where we could lose something valuable one day if we didn't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the right opportunity, I'm sure you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
