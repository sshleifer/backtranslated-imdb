Omigosh, it's a terrible movie I've ever seen. Say I love horror movies would be an underestimate, and I've seen heaps (given that New Zealand has limited availability, it's pretty much), but never before did I have to sleep ... until I saw Someone can say that it is a ring hanging (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (still different) story lines, but Grudge has his own terrifying movie - watching the cinema, even yelling at a certain point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Actress is great, especially from supportive characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie and William Mapother looks like he is having fun. Although I'm usually a fan of Clea DuVall, he doesn't seem to be in the movie. He seemed to have the deepest and backward story of supporting characters, but he didn't seem to be all there. In the case of Sarah Michelle Gellar, she remains the same for her films and roles, isn't she? The spirits were really frightening, the music and sound effects were cool (especially the noise that occurred when the character of KaDee Strickland was in the phone in his apartment), the end was too cool. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9/10
