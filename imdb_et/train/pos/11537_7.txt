Those Simon had a dialogue for dialogue, and nowhere is it more obvious than the lines he has given to WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON, on the other hand, in ODD COUPLE - a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the credibility of sharing such inappropriate friends in an apartment. Lemmon is a non-suitor Felix Ungar, who after the divorce has committed suicide and is reluctant to share the apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with some catastrophic results. It seems that all Felix says and drives up the Oscar wall, and neither can stand with others because Oscar is the most understandable man and Felix is ​​exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> For me, the most fun scene was when the sisters in the apartment above were visiting them at dinner. The priceless interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to make you sew. The talented Pigeon sisters are the gals who made the voices of Gabble Sisters (a couple of geese) in Disney's ARISTOCATS and here - their comic timing Lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to make the movie fun - where it's a lot of the time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and have enjoyed other screen procedures in your work, you should not miss it. Matthau and Lemmon are completely cast (although they had a role to play before filming) and of course it's easy to understand why it was later rated as a TV show. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Top Simon comedy, which must not be missed.
