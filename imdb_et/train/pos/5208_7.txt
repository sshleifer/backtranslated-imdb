If you want your vision of Chaplin to be limited to a lovable tramp, and you get your stomach smiled from the sin, then look at something else. But if you love the slapstick comedy that one does, look at it. <br /> <br /> The picture is a tramp who doesn't really get a girl. He pairs a couple of kisses and has a blast that destroys their fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "Park Comedies", filmed in Mack Sennett Park, with handkerchiefs and police officers and couples. These shorts work because the format allows Chaplin to shine when it weaves through predispositions. <br /> <br /> I checked the box because it can be considered a spoiler, even though it's not when you've seen those movies. Everybody reaches the pond, except Chaplin. She gets a girl who then played Minta Durfee, Mrs Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
