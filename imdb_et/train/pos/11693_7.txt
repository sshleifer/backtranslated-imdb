This movie is a remake of two films that were much better. The last, Heaven can wait, was great, I suggest you see it. It's not that big. The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock will start showing some comic fun that has come to him so far. But I don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like some very bad "B" movies, where people sound like they are on some bad TV. The situation is forced and it's like they're just trying to get the story so they can start a real movie. Everything seems to be a real fake and editing is just bad. I don't know how they would release this movie like that. Anyway, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and watch it.
