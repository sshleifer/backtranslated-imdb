In this first episode of Friends, we introduce the 6 main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and finally Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discover that Rachel, a rich girl who is a friend of Monica at high school, left her fianc√© on Barry's altar because she discovered she didn't love her. He also decides to live with Monica and become a father by becoming a new job as a waitress in Central Perky. <br /> <br /> Ross, however, discovered that his wife was a lesbian and she lost Susan, her partner. (We see that she is moving into a new apartment during the episode). <br /> <br /> Monica does this episode with Paul's "wine-grower" (and finally sleeps), who gave her an excuse to be impotent she divorced her wife. In reality he was just cheating on him. <br /> <br /> Ps: I was just hoping for Joey and Chandler's haircuts for the first season! =)
