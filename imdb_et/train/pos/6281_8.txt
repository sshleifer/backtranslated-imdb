I've had the opportunity to watch several movies on BluRay and HD DVD. This movie will stay on with this great action and great story. Although if you are looking for a great picture movie, this is not the case. The lack of this movie on DVD made it easier to make a purchase. I've always enjoyed intense activities and great exhibitions that aren't always together. In general, this makes it a great fun movie. Now on the Blu-Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies, you get two things. An image that is almost crystal clear, without distortion or a grainy hd image. I was disappointed when I made this my first blu ray movie. I almost started thinking that it was a blu ray standard. Although after watching other movies I know better. I don't think they spent so much time they had to hand over this movie to hd. This is usually a problem with some movies. For Blu Ray players and Blue Ray tile prices, you should only get the best picture. So I only consider it a valuable investment for people who have never seen a movie or bought a DVD version.
