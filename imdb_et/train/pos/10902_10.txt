I was very moving when watching the movie. how Jonny kept such hope and faith. so many people only care about what they want and worry about all the things they don't have. and they are such small things as chothes, money for a new car. I've seen people tears due to tears. this movie brings everything back to the basics. love, hope that simple but so important things in life.i make our daily problems small and irrelevant. You look at this boy and you will understand as long as you have been blessed with food, the roof over your head and your loved ones around you. you are truly blessed. I know Jonny sees this and I want to thank him so much for sharing this faith, strength and humor.
