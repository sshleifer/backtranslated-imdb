One of the best films of true crime ever made and very loyal to Truman Capote's book, which invented the genre of true crime. By killing Quincy Jones' musical score and terrible action by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake, killers kill Dick and Perry. Why Wilson is not a big star in the mystery of the film after that, it is a mystery for me. <br /> <br /> The black-and-white film and editing of this movie is top notch. The re-creation of murder is frightening and, as it leaves true murders to your imagination, it is even more frightening than if it had shown a shotgun. The movie was filmed in the actual Clutter house that was sold to another person after the murders. The film has a very documentary feeling --- in addition to the real confusion of the scenes, other scenes were shot at gas stations and shops where the killers actually went. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer has a brief trial as a prosecutor, not only filmed in the real courtroom, but also has several real confusing juries that represent themselves as a film jury. <br /> <br /> This is a solid film that you will always see as scary.
