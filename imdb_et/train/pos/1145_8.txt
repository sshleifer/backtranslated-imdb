This is a romantic comedy that emphasizes comedy for change. As usual, Sally Field, as the queen of a nearly soap opera, loves Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline is a little-covered and a little talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson, who works in a Christian sense, seems to be aware that they are madly in love, and so on. A little bit of Bette Davis Margo Channing from all Eve (1950) and Sally Field is going to rejoice over a fun theater tradition if she doesn't make her love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the most underrated leading men in recent years, is also very good and very successful when he succeeds to be beautiful, vulnerable, selfish and lovable at the same time. <br /> <br /> Misadventures center Celeste's fear of being in the forties, loses its audience and reaches its brother, aspiring actor Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue), who doesn't come to his brother as a result. complications. Cori succeeds in getting a small part of the soap opera to silence the deaf people before he discovers his true relationship with Celeste (and also to Jeffrey Anderson), but never. <br /> <br /> Romantic Resistance or Foils by Robert Downey Jr. (soap opera director David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan). David Barnes is so warm for him, but he cares only for one thing: to get rid of Celeste so that he can shine brighter. To this end, he can do all the things Barnes has to do to destroy Celeste's career, but through events and / or perverse logic all his attempts are poor, a lot of joy for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz and Celeste's alter ego and trustee, while Carrie Fisher has a modest role in producing hard nails. <br /> <br /> I thought it was more fun than just the way I saw it (Young Doctors in Love 1982, which created a TV general hospital and was pretty good). Soapdish is funny, with a scary script and a lot of ridiculous single liners and terrible performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr. But look at Sally Field, who is outstanding.
