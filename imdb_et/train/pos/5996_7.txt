Time and again, I have said that if people do not want to make transformations or follow-up, they should stop seeing them and start a world of independent film instead. Having said that, the last time I saw an independent film, I was just six months ago. So here's an overview of the indie that I had to draw attention to Youtube; Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately it can be said that the film is aimed at the avant-garde film-based approach, which is telegraphed with extreme close-ups, scopophilia and fast editing. It is proud of its appearance - and it is right to be. For the most part, this is a very well-prepared little piece, except for one unforgivable ignorance of the 180-degree rule and the comic bad impact that seems to be a self-financed project calling card. <br /> <br /> Despite these amateurish mistakes, most of the shots really look great. We are well presented with props and locations, a good visual action and some very atmospheric, fluid edits that are more commendable, because it is definitely something Youtube does not see at all. The plot is fragmented and although the main assumption is quite simple, it may be somewhat difficult to track exactly what is happening, but here we see avant-garde stories at work; you can't really wait for a simple three-action structure and if you don't, you may not be ready for such a movie. <br /> <br /> If a movie is unfortunately shot down, it is sound. What you hear is a distorted voice that often sounds insecure and worse is constant background music that changes through minimal change and adds nothing. So much attention is paid to visual images that sound is neglected, and it really becomes visible when you realize that you have just left about four song sentences and you have to retreat to pay attention. <Br>> <br /> So, give him a clock, but do it with the sound off. <br /> <br /> The Last Thought; Did anyone recall the cover of the film "Last Human" by Doug Naylor's Red Dwarf? If you have a book then you know what I mean.
