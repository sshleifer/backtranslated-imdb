Last night we watched it in the wonderful world of ABC - and I came to the conclusion that things should be stricter in mice than usual. <br /> <br /> Since this movie lasts only 74 minutes and they were supposed to release it for 2 hours of TV broadcasting, they did it and I don't do it on business that lasted 6 to 7 minutes. And during these commercial breaks, they had another ad equipped with a "TV show" hosted by Kelly Rippa, who preached loudly "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True" magical miracles. <br /> <Br /> Disney took a break again and again after a real movie to tell us, loyal viewers, that we need to keep going. Thank you, Disney, for serving us to create your beloved precious metal sequel. <br /> <br /> In any case, this commercial and cash register made it a difficult task for the real movie "Cinderella" because by the time the ads were finished I had forgotten where the story was left behind. <br /> <br /> Of course, the original "Cinderella" still retains its magic, and the story is still good, although we've all seen it countless times. It is a shame that they had to make it cheaper with the marketing, which seems to be a flat post-control.
