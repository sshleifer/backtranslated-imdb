Matador is a spiritual, dark, humorous and varied melodrama that rises above average thanks to two very interesting and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and always trusted by Greg Kinnear, who has the best role here playing Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor so good if it can. Big plus goes to writing. The clever and occasionally disgusting dialogue is welcomed by Brosnan and the friendship of the slow building between these two different people is absolutely convincing. The story takes a couple of unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly going where it goes. <br /> <br /> Nice director's beautiful artistic touch, such as good music, smart editing and somewhat unusual cinematic times. a nice tone for the film and for a long time you don't know how to mark the movie. But it is also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (i anyway) on the edge of my seat.
