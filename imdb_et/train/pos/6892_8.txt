The closest I ever saw was what Gerard Philippe's exposure in Paris was about two years ago. I didn't care about the remake and I was just over half a century after it was done, I can only conclude that the inclined fence was deliberate, aimed at a long obsolete goal. Hollywood had made realistic sword struggles since the 1930s, when the biggest of them, Basil Rathbone, baptized foils with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and so was only satire. After a while you will not notice and enjoy the Henri Jeanson dialogue, which resembles both versions. Gerard Philippe was definitely there to bring such a role, and Gina Lollabrigida was probably better than Martine Carol, another explicit candidate. The print that I saw was particularly bad and at one point completely broke, so maybe the DVD version would fix it.
