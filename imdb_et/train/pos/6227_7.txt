Certainly, there is less of one of Astaire / Rogers' musicals. It's just very poorly drawn and stretched. For example, it takes a few minutes longer than the Swing Time, but it seems to be much longer. This is partly due to Randolph Scot and Harriet Hilliard's second romance. Scott is rarely ever interesting. I like Hilliard. She's sweet and I love at least one of her songs, "But where are you?" ("Get me behind Satan," his second number, is a weak residue from Top Hat, luckily cut from this masterpiece). Watching the fleet would actually be a bad film, if not at least three of the great dances between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition is waiting for the top of its numbers. Dance is just fantastic. "I put all my eggs in one basket" presents two dances that they have not yet perfected. Its shortcomings make it even more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of Irving's best songs in Berlin. So the film is worth your wonderful moments.
