GOODNIGHT The piece of MR TOM on paper seems to be a big dose of maudlin, with sick sentiment. But talented director Jack Gold is an expert who touches the emotions in the right way, and this is more evident in the massive, deep-seated drama of great production and leadership. One of the best, if not the best, TV films of the 1990s that could have been even bigger if it was released in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Evacuation of children to rural towns and villages during World War II was, of course, a common practice, but it was twice as important for young boys as there was a bad home life in the UK capital. However, it does not move over the home, and building a film until the throat is broken, with the blurry-eyed end, makes us feel optimistic, regardless of what has happened before. It is almost (but not quite) worth what you need to compare the TRANSLATION TRANSLATION (1946) to everything, a modern classic.
