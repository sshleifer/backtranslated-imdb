About 911 in 11 out of 11 countries in 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (the first example) sometimes told to Americans: "we have had more death than you and you supported the murderers," sometimes weird ( but very symbolic and interesting). I really loved Claude Lelouch (the personal life of the New York couple, showing that our daily problems are irrelevant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, heavily anti-wars) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism despite the terrible daily misery) and Youssef Chahine (Egyptian intellectual, peaceful, having moral hardship to accept US politics against Arab countries) is really pleased to see that many Americans liked this film. It shows that we (or are they still in Belgium, but live in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and can question the past and present activities of our government, as we should in democracy.
