Hey people, what's going on. This is me man, one and only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ........ you can't really write a review of the Sakura script because we don't have any. As far as I know, this story was just as we went. I had the best time of my life, that movie was going on and I got so much stank that Jism ran out ........... fun times. So glad you all enjoyed the movie. I really didn't get the fight I imagined. Every time I made some moves, the fight director had to change them. Still, I had a blast and I met some great people. Especially the purple female Ninja, who seems to have fallen into a cinematic scene.
