Extremely funny scenes include amazing shooting (and shooting) from WW1 ditch scene where Australian comedian Clyde Cook is optimistic about non-com and unhappy McDoakes as Boyer / Colman messenger? all under Ralph Sanford's stunningly unbridled eye; lost McDoakes, who guides and directs equally astonished Jack Carson; Chandler Director's Assistant is delighted by McDoakes' opportunity: "I'm a director!" Ace comic O'Hanlon has a double role playing both McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes! Strange, Richard L. Bare, who plays himself in one or more other series, has taken this opportunity off. In real life, Bare's young, six-foot Rock Hudson looks, but here's his veteran actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
