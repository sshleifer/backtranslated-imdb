I loved this movie. The landscape was breathtaking, the plot had some nice twists and the characters were round. However, on two fronts, Rob Roy was above average. First, I have rarely seen a "popular" movie where the quality of the dialogue was so high. Brilliantly choreographed swords were accompanied by many verbal cuts and thrusts. I could give you many examples, but why should I? Just look at the movie. Secondly, this film understood the principle that is rarely recognized. In order for the drama to succeed, it requires not only a hero, but a really credible cable. If you do not have it, good rooting for boys is not a pleasure. And "Rob Roy" is not one, but three - Earr of Montrose, Kilairn and Archie of his henchman. Not one-dimensional crooks, but completely fleshy and very disgusting. It takes a little more patience than "Braveheart" - there's more dialogue and the accents are a bit harsh, but it's a lot smarter and thinner. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
