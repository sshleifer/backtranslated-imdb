It was a really great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very pleasant actor who is very enjoyable to watch. The team chemistry, when they got things together, was remarkable, it just shows what you can achieve when the minds unite with one goal. This team came back from the edge with several losing seasons to win almost everything. I love such movies because they are really very inspiring. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Dennis Quaid's character gets a place in big leagues. You can't do anything but the root of this man. It seems that if somebody should do something, they start doing it. Things just get in and make everything clicked. <br /> <br /> Based on the actual story, this movie really makes you think "nothing is impossible."
