The adaptation of Steven Speilberg's Alice Walkers popular novel is not without contradiction. For the first time, black community members released the treatment of black men, while others asked why the white man is leading this film from black women. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a young black woman named Celie, growing in rural areas of America after the turn of the century. He has two children with his abusive father, who is caught in arms during childbirth. His only consolation in the life of his accident is his sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (played by Whoopie Goldberg, a newcomer in later years) is married to her husband (Danny Glover). The man lowers the spouse, so he has been quickly removed from Celie's life. <br /> <br /> The story is often heartbreaking, because Celie is hoping she can reunite one day with her sister and her children. Throughout his life, he collects a number of letters, including Sophia, a tough head like his son, and Shug, a loud and lush saloon singer who teaches him something about things or love. <br /> <br /> Speilberg's direction is all over this image that offers great cinematography and some stars. I dare to watch this movie and not move it! The "Purple Violet" film succeeds in capturing the essence of a complex story. Although it tends to minimize both lesbian aspects and the African story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the film remains true to its themes, allowing Alice Walker to speak through. <br /> <br /> I could not respond to the controversy surrounding this movie. Suffice it to say that this is one of the few films I can watch over and over again, which has left me an indelible mark. <br /> <br />
