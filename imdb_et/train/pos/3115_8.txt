First of all, the fan of the genre "The Bourne Ultimatum" talks about a breathtaking, virtuoso, great action film. Third, the film has a difficult, important point that criminals are becoming criminals. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or to the rare national constitutional rights attacks by the executive, none of which is necessary. <br /> <br /> So, the last "Bourne" series, Paul Greengras (2004 "Bourne Supremacy" and last year's "United 93") is a remarkable achievement that may be hindered, but which is not really lost by the inevitable genre surplus. <br /> <br /> The "breathtaking" above is meant to be a description of both the free adjective and the physical sense: more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer will probably hold his breath, pushing back on the chair with a relentless, ground-breaking, completely suspensive effect. There is no change in the rhythm and pulling of the film, but it never becomes monotonous or tiring, as some of the tribal music videos do after a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood's Cinematic Art makes Tony Gilroy's scenario the best of Robert Ludl's 1990 novel (which does not bother well with the "Bourne Identity" written ten years earlier). <br /> <br /> Once again, Matt Damon is the inevitable, indispensable fantasy of the deadly CIA agents, this time taking the entire agency to find his identity, past, and mysterious agent program that has turned him into a killing machine. Something like his quietly heroic Edward R. Murrow, always a wonderful David Strathairn, is a nasty official who is against Bourne, trying to conceal illegal policies and brutal procedures. /> Joan Allen plays what seems to be a good fight against police officer Strathairn. And there is Julia Stiles as the agent who comes to Bourne again; As a result of the combination of the Greengrass direction and the Stiles, the surprising effect is mostly silent, its communication ability and empty expression are more intriguing than the mile dialogue. <br /> <br /> "The Bourne Ultimatum" is so good that it is going against the old man against the world, this time the ridiculous excess, because Bourne is unable to limit geography, time, gravity ... and physics in general. (Can you ride up the top of the car? Why not - it looks good.) <br /> <br /> All this "real world" magic - jumping across countries in a few seconds to reach an unknown place exactly when and when if necessary - exceeds the effects of special effects and superheroes comics. And yet, just a helpless pedal would allow "facts" to interfere with Bourne's fantasy of entertainment-based ecstasy.
