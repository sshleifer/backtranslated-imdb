I've seen a few movies about eating disorders, but it was definitely my favorite. The problem with others was that people with eating disorders eventually get better or accept that they need help and that. this film, which I thought was a more realistic reason, because the main character Lex does not automatically improve. He's getting better and it's a drawback. I think this movie shows more than others that I've seen that getting better doesn't happen, it's hard work and takes time, it's a long way to recover. I think this movie shows it very well. There should be more such movies.
