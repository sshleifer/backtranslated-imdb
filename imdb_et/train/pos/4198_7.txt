On board an open-crowded train, with a ruthless pocket (RICHARD WIDMARK) that steals a woman's purse (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is effortless to watch. This is partly because the actor is strong all over the pain, the black and white photography is crisp and adds story and characters, and since Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same league as John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it is just as urgent as the Huston movie, which goes wrong - but the profitability is not quite as strong. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS is great as a hard-knitted girl whom Widmark describes as "much around". He gives a lot of raw energy and sex for his non-bright woman's role as a boy (RICHARD KILEY) in his wallet with a microfilm that the FBI already knows. When theft appears, they are on their way. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds reality to the portraits of a woman named Moe, who buys and sells something for profit, and pays for it with her life. He is particularly concerned with his final scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> It's guaranteed to keep your attention in one hour and twenty minutes running time. Good Fox and Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
