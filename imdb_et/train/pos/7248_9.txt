When I first saw the 3,000 fighters of the year, I had no expectations of this movie. Although it wasn't as bad as I thought. It is a kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior which is cast, which is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story is Elisa Brigant and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of Zombie meat eaters. You may also see other references to Italian horror films: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy and you can see this child as a Paura nella citta dei mort vivian as John Robbins and Cannibal's Apocalypse Mary's brother. A fairly entertaining movie with some of the coolest parts.
