To enjoy this movie you need to be a) heavily in love (without marriage) b) admit that English humor is a marvelous galantic and spiritual life, not just running gags c) be quite intelligent because the authors gave the opportunity to laugh and cry every minute of this movie and only if you meet the "b" and "c" requirements, you can recognize and enjoy the author's input. d) To enjoy the film in full, you must love women like Kirsted Dun, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) You have to admire the creative, little melancholic people who have big and remarkable personalities <br /> <br /> if you meet all these requirements, you will probably rate this movie by 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laughed at (!) so I look at this masterpiece. And I managed to laugh even in moments (I'm always sensitive when good things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
