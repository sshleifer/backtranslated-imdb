updated January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my two favorites in the Wagner opera or music drama to be more accurate (Meistersinger is another.), although it's hard to imagine it as "someone's top" jumps. "The composer's usual libretto is a confusion of religion, paganism, eroticism, and perhaps even homo-eroticism, and its length may seem to the viewer to be dry in color. <br /> <br /> Wagner is a famous anti-Semitic, (Klingsor may be one of his substitute Jews. ) naturally trusted the premiere without transformation (not for RW's aspirations!) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite leader (go to the drawing!) Kundry, which is the most mixed-up-gal and the other likely Jewish substitute, is both a scene and a bad or benevolent <br /> <br /> Given that many of Parsifal's video formats appear to be stodgyil, this opera movie is a breath of fresh air, and directed by Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, but it is hard to know why he made his choices. For example: notorious double Parsifals (every sex!), Dolls, death-mask-of-Wagner set and various dolls and symbols, such as Nazi Swastika in one of the cruises. an, "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote real music to change the scene.) Although Wagner himself died too early to be a real Naz, many of his descendants (also his second wife Cosima) were at least co-travelers, including their grandson Wolfgang Wagner, who still running far away at the Bayreuth Festival. In fact, Wolfgang's son, Gottfried Wagner, has been trying to honestly treat his grandfather with his father. <br /> <br /> Syberberg also seems politically vague about what I have read. In 1977 he made a famous film about Hitler: "Hitler: Ein Film Honest Deutschland" (sometimes called "Our Hitler" in English.). Since it lasts all 8 hours and is not widespread, most people haven't seen it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the leader of this CD, on which this movie is based, plays Amforta (sung by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays double-bass by Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick (both sing by Reiner Goldberg). !) and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and sing Gurnemanzi and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the opera takes place over a long period of time and all (except Kundry?) have described that they are outdated between Acts 2 and 3, no one can see the parent at the end of the day. opera. (The Grail of Magic? In this opera, the Grail is the cup Jesus drank at last dinner and not Mary Magdalene, as in recent times, the idea I turned around!). <br /> <br /> Leadership and singing are all in good working order and the DVD seems to have greatly improved the sound, if not the picture. (Yes, I agree that the "Kna" approach is better, even on the second, stereo, version, but it is probably better than all the recorded versions as a whole.) <br /> <br /> Not a parallell for all Wagneres, but Ma I think it works well as a filmed opera.
