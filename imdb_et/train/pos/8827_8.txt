With a minimal budget, eight-minute working hours and a great deal of imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the most mobile short films I've ever seen. The nuance of the scenario is really remarkable because it does not end until the last moment. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you what's short, because you're enjoying much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of a year for one man's show: leadership, writing and acting in this magnificent short is the most remarkable effort I've seen for years. Also pay attention to the appearance of Marta Belenguer, her reaction image is incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
