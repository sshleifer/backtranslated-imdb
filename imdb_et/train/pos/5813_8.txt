This movie is great. <br /> <br /> Now, I tend to stiffen the story and dialogue with my movies, but now and again, Moonwalker is similar, and it's traceable, despite many mistakes. /> <br /> This movie is just a very fun Michael Jackson ad. From the ill-fated video set to "Man in the Mirror", the assembly that lists his achievements, and his career bits and bobs, goes through all the heights of his life, then runs into a really fun segment that works like a funny music video "Bad" and "Speed" Demon, by following MJ's adventures when he runs a manic stop-motion fan, and finally dances against a rabbit costume. Stop stopping is not as bad as some you think would be. This is satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Then we'll see a great video "Leave Me Alone" and directly to the main feature. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very ridiculous. We see out of Michael's building and then thousands of soldiers. Then we hit a setback, showing MJ and three children stumbling on an underground table. "Mr Big" (Joe Pesci) is an unpleasant villain who has a plan that all children in the world will be placed early on "drugs" (no specificity is mentioned). MJ and the little girl he's caught on, he followed ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really an important part. We get two very cool sequences where MJ turns into a car, then a robot-spacecraft, and of course an amazing "Smooth Criminal" sequence. <br /> <br /> It's so movie, but it's fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. It has most of its biggest hits and some cool little bits and some pretty special effects (especially the Robot / Spaceship series). It is worth it, especially if you see that you want to get it from eBay. It keeps the kids quiet for a few hours, as well as most of the 20 times who were children when they were first released.
