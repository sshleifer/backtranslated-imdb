The glacier flap inside the tailgate hill sends its three characters, who remain in an endless damp sliding tube with enough strokes to dazzle the children, as well as the dull audience can be blinded by the end-2001 closing order: A Space Odyssey. Miles is in sight, but it is still a great rush and excitement scene. An excellent opening sequence also occurs when a hairy squirrel-based critic tries to hide his precious oak. You've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but when it happens, it starts to domino effect when the mountain begins to crack and results, avalanche. The horror goes on when the critic tries to overcome the impossibility. <br /> <br /> The movie has two characters, a mammoth called Manfred (Ray Romano), and a pin (John Leguizamo) trying to travel south. They find the human baby they receive and decide to follow the older numbers again. They are united by a card tiger called Diego (Denis Leary), whose predatory intention is to bring the child to his tiger kingdom, leading the mammoth and the salmon to the trap. The Diego Meat Family wants mammoths the most, but the values ​​of friendship learned by Diego make it easy to make a choice. <br /> <br /> On a world trip, there are fatalistic natural hazards, including a crushed volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to blend for a moment that resembles a castle escape from Shrek. The characters think about why they are in the ice age, while they might have called it a big flour or a Nippy era. Some of the signs want the forthcoming global warming. Another great line of questions about mating between girlfriends: "All big men are never around. Sensitive can eat. Drawn lines, charming comedy and a light-fingered adventure make it quite easy. Also, food is so few that beautiful vegetarians find that dandelion and pine cones are "good eating". <br /> <br /> The vocal talents of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary will be good for their individuals, while children will rejoice at their antiques, adults will love their reefs on their talents. There's little violence and intense content, but kids are excited about jazz and they get one of their early old good and evil battles, and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic links. Animators are majestically using fantastic background landscapes. <br /> <br />
