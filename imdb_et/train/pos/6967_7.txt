The same creative team, Ronald D. Moore and David Eicki, as well as the new series creator Remi Aubuchon, prequel a new imagination for the Battlestar Galactica series. Caprica is housed in twelve colonies about 58 years before the Battlestar Galactica events. The new series, in addition to its human book, also crowns the main steps in developing Cylon racing. <br /> <br /> The pilot and the series are set to follow two families; Graystone includes Daniel (Eric Stoltz), computer genius and corporate tycoon, and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter, Zoe (Alessandra Toreson), while Adama includes attorney Joseph (Esai Morales) and his son William as future Battlestar Galactica admiral. . <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, a series of great experienced actors from Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker, as well as some very talented relatively new actors, including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> Battlestar Gallactica fans have similarities and consistency to this series, but it is also very different. At least in the pilot, there are certainly elements of science fiction, but they are smaller in this series. Caprica scenes, which reflect a more technologically advanced society, are also retro-sensitized, achieved by some architecture, costumes, and photography. <br /> <br /> Although the look and feel of the two in this series has some important differences, some of the themes seem very familiar, religion is once again very important, while the rare issue of BG is much more important. We also touch upon the existence of the soul of terrorism and whether it can have one or not, as well as crime and government issues. <br /> <br /> The pilot has been expanded and is proud to launch in 2010 before launching the TV. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, this series has been filmed in Vancouver
