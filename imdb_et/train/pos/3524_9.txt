Attention from Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY several years ago when I was not yet jazz. Until the end of June, Paris's brand new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY exhibition, called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, will feature NINE extracts from jazz films, including PHANTOM LADY's famous drum sequences. I've seen Gene Krupat and Elisha Cook Jr in almost all of their movie films and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr was in DUBBED. This was some progress, as most of his other performances were killed (mainly Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP). 2. Krupa was probably named by Cook PL. I can recognize her style because she had already finished her career early (and abused), namely the 1937 Hollywood Hotel SING, SING, SING, and finally everything we could call in French "la caisse claire". 3. The sequence of PL, at least as shown in the museum, is not censored.harry carasso, Paris, France
