Paul Reiser steps away from the start comedy to write a warm, humorous and gentle story about the family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us. ABOUT FOLLOWS does not set new standards for the film, but it is a good little story that reminds us that the family represents important bonds. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been working diligently, temporarily pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), her daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and her son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day Muriel remembers that she has left after years of marriage! His daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately start looking for their location, confusing and hurting the shameful Sami to sort the boys with Ben. The road trip becomes a time when two men can learn who is with each other and what each of them means for their status as father and son and family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and now introduces Ben to his lifestyle and fun. The journey ends with telephone calls about the location of Muriel, and why he left and the cleverer grouping of the wiser family draws the story to a warm end. It's not what it looked like: it's better and well, different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser play each other as they are, but in many ways the film is a short moment when Olympia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matrices on film. Worth a look. Grady Harp
