A young girl who is in the middle of this story is transplanted to the height of the conflict in the late 1930s to a foreign country, Spain. For this girl, everything is new, in its alienation. War and his father are his constant worries, while he has to overthrow the provincial culture that has been in New York years. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directs it to film numbers. The Carol family is obviously divided, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is a left-wing air force pilot, the rest of the family's sympathies are Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't add anything that has already been said, much better, but it's easy to see. The wonderful landscape of northern Spain is shown. Don't expect a lot of action, because most of what happens to Carol and the young boys that he treats with his friends. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol sincerely and innocently. Maria Barranco is Aurora of Carol's mother who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, a teacher who makes friends with Caroli. Carmelo Gomez, Alfonso, is the man Aurora left for America. This actor, who usually plays a leading role in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, as he remains the mystery of the whole movie.
