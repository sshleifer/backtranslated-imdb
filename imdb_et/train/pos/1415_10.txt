I saw the German version of the movie on German television and I was really surprised. I like to see documentaries in general, but I don't remember seeing what is better than "Earth". I knew some of the Youtube video scenes that I found by random browsing. I also remember that I saw parts of the film on multimedia products that work on high definition TVs displayed. After seeing the movie, it is clear to me why the video is so popular with Youtube users and multimedia retailers: it's just so fantastic and remarkable that you can't help but watch on the screen, whether you're generally interested in nature or not. . <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 without hesitation. Movies are definitely more exciting, but for documentaries, "Earth" is definitely one of the best genres.
