What is love love? People seem to have major problems with transgeneration. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie didn't hit my eye. The film had a roughly 4-minute-long grainy picture that stopped me from surfing the channel. I couldn't believe how amazing this film was. It affects so many people's emotional levels that he never managed to move me in any way. This is definitely one of the best independent movies I've ever seen. I didn't see those characters as sex, but people. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent movies. Congratulations to all the fearless filmmakers!
