Especially at a time when there is not much science fiction (1973), this terrible vision of the future where everything has gone wrong. Too many people and nothing works. The only people who can live comfortably are rich. It's set in New York in 2022 (I think) and it reminds you of your worst Calcutta vision. <br /> <br /> I appreciated Charlton Heston's behavior after seeing him in Orson Welles' evil touch. He was (perhaps) able to portray a variety of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here he is broken to be a policeman who is just a bit corrupt (taking rich foods from the rich) and is completely corrupt (actively malicious). The film seems to be happening at night and everyone is sweating, except for one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Although I had not seen it before, I knew the famous ending (not shown here), but the end is definitely for. <br /> <br /> Big scenes with Edward G. Robinson: Council (made up of elderly Jews with heavy accents, so it seems) where the truth comes from. And then Thanatopsis goes to check. <br /> <br /> Dirty, prior to Star Wars dystopian science literature.
