This is an almost inactive film that follows Jack, insomnia when he goes through hallucinations, visits dead friends, throws himself out of the building, and doesn't have much time to tell about hallucinations. br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is truly credible. Confused and scared, but sleepy, and from time to time misunderstood what he sees, we follow him, trying to find out what he sees and how to sleep. <br /> <br /> Introduce the talking dog (the second hallucination) and the kids who suddenly appear in Jack's bathroom and bedroom without explanation of how they got there (more hallucinations) and you have an interesting, desperate, 43 minutes.
