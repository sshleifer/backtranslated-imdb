I must admit that I did not read the original story of M R James, although I have read many other supernatural stories. I've also seen most of the previous BBC Christmas song stories, and I think it is more than most of them, but equal to Signalman. The direction and mood are perfect, like show lights and of course the story and writing. I enjoyed it thoroughly and I can only count on this quality more by the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC is going to do some more (not necessarily M R James songs) so it's promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
