Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD Release. Cantonese / English Subtitles <br /> <br /> From time to time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with the "Matrix" and I was perhaps one of the fifteen-year-olds who still believed that the Terminator was better than the "matrix". I was just a simple teen boy looking for a good action film and then there was a bright light on a TV station I never saw. One evening, I noticed in the TV guide that Jackie Chan, the star of the film, "The Story of Police" would be later. Being fifteenth, and I only saw "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour", I said ... "WOW AWESOME" and sat down to watch it and shouted "WOW AWESOME" as the movie progressed. Two weeks later, after SBS had shown the Trilogy of Police Story, I knew I had found my new favorite music. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong policeman who interrupts a great drug sender, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu Secretary Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin) keeps the police as a witness against Chu and Chan is assigned to defend her. Things go bad - badly bad - when Chu's case is rejected and he decides he wants Fong and Chani dead. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of the biggest films ever and certainly one of my favorite Jackie Chan films. It starts strongly and ends with one of the most amazing things ever filmed. Everything is great. But some funny parts may seem a little tasty for more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> Like the story, this is yet another effort for Jackie. For the action film, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this respect when he acts in & intensive plot of the New Police. It's not "miracles", but maybe it's good. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of Jackie's best works. It captured me from Jackie Chan's movies and should give a nice start to any potential Jackie fans. The bad news for everyone who sees it is that Jackie Chan's movies aren't much better - 10/10
