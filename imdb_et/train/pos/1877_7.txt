Arthur Bach's life in many millionaires is unlucky and attracts him to the social people below - he pays for the whore at the opening and then it is tremendously tempting to shop. He drinks a lot, and sometimes he drives while drinking, which is not funny, of course. The film is great, but behind the comedy is reality. John Gielgud wipes the floor on everyone else's screen and created a character for the era. Talk about the value of Oscar. Moore and Minnell have moments, but Gielgud as "Hobson" remember most.
