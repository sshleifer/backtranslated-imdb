The third and final part of Bourne's trilogy (duh) has remained a bit of a lotus, but it covers it with extensive action stages! Especially Twi takes time and works better with this movie. <br /> <br /> The director and the star (Damon) themselves agreed that the last part is hard to find because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced. How did they get around this? Action scenes, once, but they also did another thing that I can't reveal because it would be a spoiler. But if you watch a movie, if you notice it! I read funny that this adaptation of Bourne's books is the least accurate for all three films. If this means something to you: o)
