This is a strong film from a historical and epic perspective. Although the story is simple, it's simple and simple. In fact, this is a simple story of a simple, respectable man whose honor is in conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period. but a well-told story without much of the hollywood that smells on the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can get people on the screen. :)
