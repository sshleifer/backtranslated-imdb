Okay. As you can see, this is one of my favorite films, if not. It is a character drama that is absolutely fun. The main character is a businessman who is in the "same thing, different day" mentality. She sees a woman who is looking for melancholy speaks about her train from the dance studio window everyday and wonders her and decides to find out more. He decides to join a dance class only to find out that he is not a teacher. From there, he links with four other dancers and learns to dance and understand a mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no free (or any) gender, how a small group of people learn how friendships are shaped and developed. <br /> <br /> This movie has been rebuilt with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and new, while the appealing isn't as enjoyable as the original. The film did not make America big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscar because it was broadcast on television in Japan (movies cannot be released on TV or they are disqualified for Oscar candidates). It won several awards in Japan for the best film, cast, director, etc. for its "Oscar" awards.
