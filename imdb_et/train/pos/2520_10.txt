Despite what others have said (* cough *), it's my favorite movie all the time. I don't know how long I was waiting for it, but when I finally did, I fell in love. Of course, it is strange, but it gives it a more exciting taste. For those who don't know, Moonchild is one of Gackt's and Hyde's first films. They aren't very much at all, maybe 3 or 4 top. So, give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler wasn't the best in the beginning either. I believe they are throwing an odd situation there, but I look to find the best points of this movie, the emotions displayed and not. That's why I've always given this movie and I give it to 10 out of 10.
