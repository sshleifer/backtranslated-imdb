As we all know, the genre of sex comedies is quite full. Just superfluous is no longer enough. I've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and activities that sex comedy really needs other positive points to turn to these days. <br /> <br /> When I came to a 40-year-old virgin, I knew basically what to expect; I watched all the ads; "Is it true that if you don't use it, will you lose it?" What I did not expect is heart and honest attempts to develop character. There are still strange "off-the-wall" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler's films and there is still an inappropriate language to drown the Noah's Ark, but the film is somehow worth a love story and yes, even a message. <br /> <br /> The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) the person I can associate with. In the first shoot, I see she even shares my love for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (she has a movie poster on her wall) and, during the whole movie, we see her truly pure antique collection. Andy also has a lot of video games and professional knowledge about movies and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because she prefers her bike. The most important thing is everything; Andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear, and he respects women so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everyone will start thinking that he is a serial breaker. It's like the story of my life. The other characters are funny little stories to go with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work to a certain level, but not as Andy does. I felt it was kind of disturbing because Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only real human characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think that because I mentioned one mistake, I can bring another noticeable. The story is smart, but too predictable and romantic. it is quite simple. It deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what will happen at the end. Of course, its final detour is a bit different when we wait, but you know what's going to happen and I'll assure you that it does. These are definitely small blemishes in the movie, but it's so good here that I can just ignore a few mistakes. <br /> <br /> When I say "good", I mean, of course, "bad." It's a sex comedy and she wants to be bad. Most of the time I think it was successful. There are so many fun scenes as Andy is trying to get rid of erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or a scene where Andy goes with her Trish daughter with a sex education class where she gets more questions than anyone else. Ah, and we must not forget the classic chest waxing sequence soon "Ooh! Como se llama!" An interesting little comment about this scene; Actor Steve Carell actually wax the stomach and the pain shown is real. Of course they only made one, but it was still a very brave thing to do. <br /> <br /> In fact, since we are talking about Steve Carell, I would like to say that he has now risen to the comedy captured in my list, which is kind of strange because I didn't even know who he was before seeing this movie. I was just so impressed that his writing, acting, and timing is that I really want to keep an eye on my future roles. This man is the talent of this 40-year-old Virgin proves that. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I had doubts about this movie, but the early word was positive and I knew it was something I finally saw. I'm glad I did it because it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen and doubling for a long time, what you feel is worth seeing. It is not just a series of sex games that have been agreed with each other, but it is a series of sex games that are interwoven with a very valuable and truly touching romance. Now, excuse me, when I get my guts off; I can't believe I just wrote it ... <br /> <br /> My Review of Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
