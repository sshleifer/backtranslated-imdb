This film is unique because it is neglected ...... The different story is simply that it shows how to survive or maintain, one can find the ability to love if you have both an open heart and an open mind. I first saw this cable in the late 1970s and it really was at a time when the gay community was limited. I believe this movie was before its time to portray a bit of a dull lifestyle. It is really classic in the sense that it was the predecessor's extended family. This movie should be available on DVD / VHS so that not only can Meg Foster & Perry King's usual performances be recognized, but show how far we have come and still go where the relationships are.
