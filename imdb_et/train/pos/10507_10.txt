This game is amazing. Really, you should get it if you don't have it. Although it is ancient, it was amazing when it came out. I believe this game is always classic. It's just as good as Super Mario World or so. When I was young, I sat with a friend and I played for hours, trying to win what we finally did. It's not nearly as successful as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you are a Mario fan then this is very important. It's fun and fun. Everything you could exclude from the fantasy game, except for good graphics (also in 1996). ROCK IS 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
