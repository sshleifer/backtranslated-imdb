Hayao Miyazaki is not equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation in storytelling, but is often compared to Walt Disney. It is just as unfair as it appears in watching Miyazaki films that he is a higher artist. She has an exciting gift for both adults and children, and Laputa is really a fantastic journey. <br /> <br /> But where can I start to film the film so magically and breathtakingly! Miyazaki's works are no longer astonishing. Laputa is a big-scale adventure and I don't know how the film can be so precise and imaginative. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child who dreams about an adventure that is so great and so magical, what would it be? The answer would be to sit on the strap and look at the laputa because it is really a childhood fantasy. Every minute of the movie is rich and enticing ... from the back of the train to the amazing airplane ... and the magnificent view of the floating castle. Not to mention Joe Hisaishi's great result! Everything you ever want in an adventure movie is here.
