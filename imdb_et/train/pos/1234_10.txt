I grew up watching this movie and I still love it as much as today when I was a child. Don't listen to the critic's comments. They are not accurate on this film. Eddie Murphy shines in her roll. You can sit with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to everyone. This is comedy with fantasy. Demons, dragons and a little bald boy like God. This film takes you from LA to Tibet, admiring views of the stunning temples of the Tibetan mountains. nice view! So go for your self and grab it! You won't regret it!
