Gary Busey is the character of the title, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your usual reckless careless servant who has served his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes (38 and counts), he never ceases after bad boys. <Br /> <br /> When a top-level US tank called "Thunderblast" crosses Mexico, it is hit by revolutionary / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva). Boat villains. Involved military personnel are held in detention, including Prime Minister Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), a former McBain girlfriend. The army then recruits McBain for rescue. <br /> <br /> Busey may not be physically present, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have been the best driver for such a movie, but he's a blow to a confident guy who's quick with wisecracks. Fluegel is a great female leader; she not only sees incredibly sexy, but makes a fine butt joke. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez, and always welcome William Smith (like the Russian great) are devastating the tradition of classical cinema. Supporting casting is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman offer a script based on the story of Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray. This is a script where you just know that writers are in their languages ​​on their cheeks: they know that their material is absurd and cheesy, and just have fun in the window of credibility. Steve Carver, Executive Director of Veterans, keeps it moving and gives an honorable amount of fire, explosions, and general chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is a fun fun action fan who doesn't mind turning off their brains now and then and just enjoying a rich selection of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
