When I watched this movie and began to see its symbols, I could feel it was a great picture. When this feeling comes and the film really fulfills these expectations, the experience is rare. I really felt this in the movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuban Gooding Junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts that were both worthy of Oscar. Supportive casting was equally strong, creating a winning base for image growth. I can not hesitate to say that this movie is not deceived.
