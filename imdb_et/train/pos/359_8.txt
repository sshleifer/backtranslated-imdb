I can't believe I'm just seeing this movie - I think maybe I thought it was another movie about abuse of slavery, and I kept Sweden for the same reason - just as I haven't seen Schindler yet - I don't want that other people's pain would be "entertainment", no matter how authentic or informative it should be. <br /> <br /> So I think the main thing I noticed about purple was that it wasn't that white people treated black people. Black people were perfectly capable of raping their daughters - or giving them away to treat them as "spouses". It was a painful look, but everyone redeemed himself and the actor was phenomenal! I couldn't believe the character Oprah was 35 years old! And I adore Whoop start - he was amazing. I'm so glad that I felt sadness last night and Showtime ran purple.
