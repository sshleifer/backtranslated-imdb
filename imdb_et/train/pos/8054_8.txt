"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts movies I had the chance to see. Sammo Hung depicts a Chinese farm boy who comes to the town's friend. Similar to Tang Lung, "Dragon of the Dragon". Wherever Sammo goes, the problem begins, so he has to rely on his martial arts skills to solve the differences. Luckily, Sammo is studying martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strikes his nose with his thumb exactly as Bruce Lee does, and also releases his wilt. He also uses nunchukse in the scene. It was like watching fat Bruce Lee. At the end of the movie, there is a big showdown that consists of foreign fighters. Sammoga must meet each opponent one by one. A similar "death game" where each fighter has a different martial arts discipline. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I've really enjoyed and the first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Great fighting scene and lots of laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung movie, which I highly recommend to all martial arts fans. 8.5 / 10!
