I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming and fun romantic comedy to find the right person. When you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was a really boring man. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suitable for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. Anyway, all the people involved in this movie did a great job. Finally, I recommend finding this sweet, charming and fun romantic comedy for the right person for any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who hasn't seen it. You laugh a lot, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, get back with a friend and see it.
