Rentis movie joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that I went and found a used copy and bought it myself. Now that all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I'll give them Sasquatch hunters. It has to be said that although there is a rule that made the film much better. Talking is not allowed when the movie is turned on unless the words are repeated in Sasquatch. I also loved the credit at the end of the movie. "Thank you for Jeep, Tom!" Whoever Tom is, I thank you for not making a movie without your Jeep. In short, a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie, maybe you are looking for something else, but if you don't mind having a laugh at the man on the monkey, take your copy.
