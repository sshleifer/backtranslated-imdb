Halloween is one of the best examples of an independent movie. It is very well done and has more psychological elements than you can understand at first glance. This is a simple film that was very well talked about. Music is perfect and is one of the toughest points ... If you haven't seen this movie yet, you have to review it. The cast is all terrible. I wish they would not follow the outcome. The first one was by far the best and should have ended as if it hadn't continued. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She didn't look old (she's just as proud today, without a haircut and seventies). Scenes through the mask are one of the most frightening things!
