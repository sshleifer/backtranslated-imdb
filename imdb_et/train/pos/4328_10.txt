I've purchased this version of DVD to compare it with the current version of BBC 2005 (which is brilliant). 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft who adapted Tinker to Tailor Soldier Spy TV and who died this year (2005). I remember doing great things, especially from Rigg and Elliot and moving music. (Music is much less underestimated in the 2005 version, but it is very talkative.) Just picking up other commentators on a few points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boyfriend, not Esther. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in either version or played Toby Esterhas in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are respectable and admirable adaptations from Dickens' great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and sentimentality can sometimes win you, but I don't think you're crying - and laughing!
