"Child and child" viewing was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals, the integrity of the viewpoint and the beauty of the atmosphere and the characters stayed with me. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. Foolishly simple. In a container of this simplicity, the world opens up to pull you in and leave you breathless. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I found out. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you can trust - give yourself over. Dare to say that this is a love for any innocent heart. It reaches the eye of the viewer - of all ages - and opens the world through new eyes as it would be seen from the heart. from the perspective of ecstatic participation in reality. I feel I have the privilege to look - not, to participate - this film, the work of true art.
