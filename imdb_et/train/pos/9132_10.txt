I start by associating my first meeting with Prince's music. It was at the bar, on my 39th birthday, and the girl danced with "1999" to play on the speakers. I asked people who is this singer? I was told it was a prince. It was so good that it disturbed me from a beautiful topless dancer. Later I started listening to other Prince songs and really digging them. When Purple Rain came out, I knew very little about this Minnesota. The film blew me away. I immediately became a fan of Prince's "War Baby" generation # 1. Later I learned that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and he got me and my nephew V.I.P. Prince's concert where we sat next to my mother ... how cool it is! On returning to the current topic, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, who called Purple Rain a quick classic. I've seen it more than 17 times and love it completely. I thought Prince's action was good, Apollonia bothered a little, but everything went well. John Gielgud was not able to play The Kid, so Prince took that role. The film is visually stunning, with a brilliant pace (it will never be slow) and terribly targeted. I'm doing the best movie music of all time. The last time I looked, it was about a 7-year gap and it's still there. I'm so proud of other Minnesota prince Rogers Nelson and I would like to speak to him personally. He walked in front of me during the aforementioned concert and said, "Hello," to my nephew, but not to me. She talked to her mother. I was a little broken, but she's still 1.
