Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) has been disrupted without love; he cannot overcome his love for a lost person in the past. He hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives a list of his mistakes he needs to fix. But time is irreversible and sometimes the pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first point to impress "Cure" is a stylish cinematography that changes color black and white. The concise and sharp scenario is capable of developing a tragic and dark story of love with an unexpected plot point in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a bit picky and it is related to the fact that English is not my native language, at some moments I have to repeat the whispered words of the narrator. The unknown lead actor has excellent performance and is extremely proud. I hope I have the opportunity to see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of the director and writer Ryan Jafri cannot be better. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not Available
