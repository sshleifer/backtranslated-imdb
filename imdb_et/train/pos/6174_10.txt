It's really regrettable that most people outside Canada think that the only things Canada produces are snow, mountains and hockey players. This movie is the second ultimate Canadian film I've seen in a few weeks (the first was The Red Violin), much better than all but the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is nothing more than that; he is a medieval member of the Parsi Bank in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensitively explores the different things that happen to her family, her friends and her work and her influence. At the same time, it is fascinating and I expect it to be a middle class city dweller at that time in India. <br /> <br /> However, I was ready for this. read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. A movie, as you might expect, cannot capture the complexity of the entire book, but if you really want to read a good book and see a really good movie, read and see "Such a long journey."
