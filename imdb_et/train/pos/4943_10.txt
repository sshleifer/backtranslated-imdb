It's the easiest way to make a movie and it's the best. <br /> <br /> I had doubts, though Freeman is a great actor, sometimes involved in bad projects; it is not one of those times. <br /> <br /> This is a small story that lasts just over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we're getting used to the fact that film lengthening and lengthening may not be better, the director uses a short time for his advantage, since the characters are from the beginning so well defined (freeman and vega are in a great way) that a bit of background information about them seems real, Morgan is himself, although his name is not mentioned, he has been movies a few years away because he was business saturated and developed fear to commit to the script , and doing research on the character of the indie movie, where he plays the store / supermarket manager. The story begins with the fact that he is dropping in a neighborhood supermarket where he meets with 10 or less cash registers (Vega) and has to run for his own reasons "production" forgot to take him away. br /> <br /> In many ways, this film element, Morgan offers to laugh and strive for his surprising smile and positive outlook, showing the accomplished actor who has taught his mind to be able to identify all he sees in the character he is could play, and Pazi (by the way, an extraordinary beautiful woman, even more wonderful than Penelope Cruz) brings about the vulnerability of a 25-year-old separated woman who works harder than everyone else without being dead. it's a chat room, there's a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well kept; spend the last 20 minutes to ask for more screen time is an odd couple, but the short story is characteristic, so the director had a good speech to not give.
