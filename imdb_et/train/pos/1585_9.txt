Born in Berlin in 1942, Margarethe von Trotta was an actor and is now a very important director and writer. He has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director whose dedication to the woman's sensitivity to the screen outweighs his artistic strengths. "Rosenstrasse", which has collected different and even strange comments (the article in the New York Times was one of the most negative aggressive comments I've ever read in this book) is not a perfect film. It is a good film and proving a rare understanding of successful opposition to the genocide regime of all nations, which is generally impossible for the Germans who show Berlin on the street. <br /> <br /> Co-author von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident associated with looking for a young woman to get information about her mother's unpublished life in the German capital during World War II. <br /> <br /> The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) is dead and in a surprising appeal to the Orthodox Jewish way of life, which apparently had been stalled for a long time, not only "sitting" (Jewish weekly mourning ritual), but firmly insisting on his faith compliance with strict precepts. His apartment in New York reflects his dead husband's workforce. His American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother, have broken a bit by the mother's restrictive orthodox Jewish practice, but they are inclined. Mother coldly rejects Hannah's groom, a non-Jew called Luis (Fedja van Huet). If Ruth warns he won't give Hannah if he doesn't give up, thin Luis. Hold the voice. <br /> <br /> The relative comes to pay tribute and also hints at the interesting Hannah about the wartime mind of her mother's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is interesting - she asks her mother who decisively refuses to discuss this part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up by parents who fled from Nazi Germany on time and I knew many children whose families as a whole, but usually partially, fleeing the Holocaust. These days were not simply discussed. <br /> <br /> So Hannah, having learned that the German Gentian woman saved Ruth's life, is talking about Berlin's hope of finding the savior still breathing. If he didn't, it would have been a very short film. But Ruth, a pretending historian, is looking for 90-year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow. When lucky, interviewed, but repressed by memories, Lena tells her story, the scenes moving smoothly between today's Berlin and war capital. <br /> <br /> Young Lena (1943) Katja Riemann) was a subtle pianist who married the Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the emergence of the Nazi regime, he had to use "Israel" as the middle name, as Jewish women had to add "Sarah" to their names (by the way, I would like IMDb not to give Fabian the name of his characters along with the lie) Israel "accompanies - it simply confirms the Nazi classification <br /> <br /> Although Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, "Aries" married people were released. For some time until 1943, when the regime decided to take them (most of them were men; the minority were Jewish women who were married to non-Jews.) Roundup is shown here with all its intimidating intensity. <br /> <br /> Young Lena is trying to find her husband, all she and many other women know they are limited to Rosenstrasse Satisfied women gather together, some seek help from German officials who are predictably refusing to help and are also abusing them orally ("Jewish loving whore" is one name). Alana has Lena more or less accepted the eight-year-old Rut, who hid her mother (remember, Ruth is now sitting in Shiva Manhattan). Svea Lohde represents the child Ruth. <br /> <br /> Women are finally dominated by increasingly angry demonstrations. Men and a handful of women are released. As the real story of the Nazis gave, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the Madmen admitted their struggle for killing (the second was the ending of the euthanasia campaign to release the mental defect and the chronic disability of the disabled, but this is another story)) <br /> <br / > Von Trotta builds tension and every woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to grow old with Lena, who slowly, one collects, suspects that she is not a regular historian, but rather who needs to learn from a girl she was rescued by a child whose mother was murdered. /> The contrasts between the 1943 Rosenstrasse, the set and the alternating, rebuilt, unified Berlin of the street provide a recurring thematic element. Today Berlin bears the legacy but not the scars of a terrible past. Von Trotta is doing this very well. <br /> <br /> The main players are equally impressive. Lena's husband, as strong, has also been shown to be completely helpless with the ability to expel (which is clear to all characters - including the local police and the military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). Elder Ruth is catalytically forced to fight demons that have long been suppressed by his happy New York City. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death causes a need to discover his family's past. These things happen (although the Times critic does not know). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta's hand is solid but not perfect. The scene at Goebbels, which enjoys Lena's violin game, is unnecessary and disturbing. The claim that he has imprisoned the Minister for Propaganda, the most fanatical winner of Hitler, to rescue his wife, reduces the marvelous achievement of protesting spouses and relatives. Most German officers come from central casting and are formed by Erich von Stroheim's "copying and sticking" school, created by German nastiness. But it's understandable. <br /> <br /> The story of Rosenstrasse has been the subject of books and articles, and some argue that this is a paradigm case claiming that many more Jews could have saved more Germans protesting. Unfortunately, this argument is pointless. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were on a line between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. That is why Rosenstrasse protest was practically single. Whether one buys or rejects Goldenhagen's assertion that most Germans agreed with the accomplices of actual murderers cannot simply deny that the Nazi endemic anti-Semitism broke into a virulent strain since 1933. <br /> <br /> Elderly Lena notes that what women achieved was a "beam of light" during evil. Most of the fatal men and women lived over the war. This was the "beam of light" and von Trotta's film is a beacon of illumination, which shows that some were saved because of the courage of great ordinary women, and it is celebrated for every life saved. And always. <br /> <br /> 9/10
