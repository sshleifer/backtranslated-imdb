Midnight Cowboy was rated X with its original release in 1969. Here are some of the scenes you understand, but a little. The movie Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York to become a hustler is sometimes a little annoying. Sticked as a cowboy, he tries to live as a hustler, making money with a love act. It doesn't work as it is planned. After the boy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) pulled him out and stole his money, they get friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe must try to make money. <br /> <br /> The movie was probably rated as the main theme for X, but how we see strange things. Editing this movie is great. We see the sequences of dreams of Joe and Rats that the real world interrupts in a nice and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and supporting actors are doing great performances. Especially, Hoffman offers fine, famous features. This score is made by John Barry and it sounds good. All this makes this great movie that won a good picture of the Oscar.
