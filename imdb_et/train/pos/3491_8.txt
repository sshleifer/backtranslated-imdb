The cast is excellent, acting good, the plot is interesting, evolution is full of tension ... but these elements are hard to cram on a film that is barely 80 minutes long. If it took more time to develop a plot and sub-blocks, it would be much better. For another 30 minutes, the substance would have made this very good movie just as good.
