In the early 1970s to mid-1970s, Clifford Irving suggested writing Howard Hughes' final biography, claiming he had spent six months preparing for the book, taking part in a reclusive millionaire. When all this turned out to be wrong, Irving was accused of being a criminal and spent several years behind bars (although he always found his conclusions accurate). Transmission of Flash to 20001, months before September 11, a book titled "Forbidden Love" (published in the US as "Honor Lost: Love and Death in Today's Jordan") by an unknown author, Norma Khouri, Jordan a woman who reported her best friend Dalia's murder for mercy because Dalia, being committed to the Muslim background, met a Christian man. This, as Irving's biography of Hughes, appeared as a potential occupant. Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski is trying to get into a curve, which was Khour's attempts to lie. Within 104 minutes, the film tries to expose Norma Khour, who is telling the truth, or is she just a forced liar with her own agenda / brother. Interviews with those who know him / her (including the former spouse, his publisher, and others) tell the story. This is a toothpicked, well-produced documentary that can give many fingers the same number of potential culprits. Not rated, but includes pervasive bad language and dreadful murder reactivation, which is played a few times (but nothing is almost graphical and distracting, like what the last epic of torture porn, like Saw: Part 84). Not a good choice for little ones.
