Personally, I think Sayonara was the biggest film she ever did. It touched all the emotions between anger and romance in order to end the tragedy. And Brando could have won the best actor. Anyway, the movie is fantastic, the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it! Do it and fall in love.
