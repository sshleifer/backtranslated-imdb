"Kennel Murder Case" starts rolling and does not end before the end. Everyone had a reason to kill the victim and several people tried it. William Powell is amazing as Philo Vance, a gentleman's detective. Mary Astor is refreshing as a niece who only wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her heritage. This movie is related to "Nancy Drew, Reporter" DVD, which is also fun. If you need to rent a disc (or check it out from your local library), do it. It's pure entertainment!
