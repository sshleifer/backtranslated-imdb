A few years ago, I commented on the "Real McCoys" TV series in IMDB. I said, and I repeat now, it was a charming, funny and entertaining show that had great features. <br /> <br /> I recently saw the composition of four old episodes of PLUS in 2000 with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. Like another writer mentioned here, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) are not referred to, but may be monitored by SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The reunion exhibition was well done and gave us a lot of unknown knowledge. One of the inside information we didn't get was whether Kathy Nolan regretted that he gave up the show in an unpleasant dispute that left Luke "widow" last year, which wasn't very good. Nolan went on a bomb comedy called "Broadside", about World War II Pacific women nurses. Is it? BROADside? No, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike the fact that television now has such a buggy, terrible and violent TRASH that undermines our values, Real McCoys has been thrilling in decent values ​​and fine people. And I thank all the people involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing it to my family. We have never forgotten it.
