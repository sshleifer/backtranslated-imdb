Artemisia Gentileschi, daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, showed early promise as a painter. Artemisia, taught by his father, was born in an age that denied talented women the right to get their work alongside the vision of men's art. His tragic life crowns in this biographical film, which was produced and composed by Agnes Merlik. <br /> <br /> Having read Susan Vreeland's novel "Artemisia's Passion", she made us study more about this woman's life. his work and his legacy. We also read Mary Garrard's "Artemisia Gentileschi", which should be a compulsory reading of all artistic exchangers. <br /> <br /> "Artemisia" presents fictitious facts that we have read about showing a young man's early life as he begins to paint. He had clearly influenced the work of his father, Caravaggio, Agostino Tas and other Florence painters of that period. The film is based on his relationship with Tas. Artemisia, unfortunately, could not go as far as he would have been because of the prejudices against the arts. He did not help his scandal where he was accused of rape Tas. She had to go to Rome to go beyond her unsuccessful life. <br /> <br /> Valentina Cervi is beautiful Artemis. He is a proud creature who woke up to men with passion. Michel Serrault plays with his father Orazio. Mickey Maojlovic is seen in Tas, a man who wanted Artemis, but got into jail. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a glossy finish that Benoit Delhomme's camera work is all in glory. The picturesque places of the film offer an idea that inspired this painting school to show on its canvas. Krishna Levy's music is good at what we see. Agnes Merlik drew his own visual style with a certain hand.
