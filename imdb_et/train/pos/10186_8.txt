Okay, I know it's not good light for India. But the overall theme of the film is not India, it's Shakti. The power of the warlord and the power of his mother. The relationship between Nandin and his wife and son will absorb you in your heat. Then things go awfully wrong. The strengths of this film are the communication between Nandin and his father - the power of their dysfunctional relationships and their changed lives. The performance of Shah Rukh Khani is just a comer compared to the incredible desperation of Karisma Kapoor. The love, violence, and redemption of this film are easy to get, and to find relief and sadness at your peak. Musical gaps are strong, credible and well done.
