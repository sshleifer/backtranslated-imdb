Anyone who thinks anime is something other than sex and violence will be silenced after watching this movie forever. This is a good film that talks about Tetsuro's attempt to punish mother's death, but is also growing in this process. The train train type represents Tetsuro's journey from boyhood to male. The movie's musical and visual styles are a bit dated (you can say it's 70's movie) and the animation is just a little better than your average "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and characters are so strong, it really doesn't matter. Must see any animation fan!
