Fantastic movie. One to attract all 5 senses. It is not a real historical report and not all information has to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions such as A-list play and very attractive actors like "heroes" like Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Nedi's right hand), and unpleasant ( sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play drunk and corrupt Victoria police forces. It also creates a very unreliable story of love between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to attract all the Romans, women are particularly susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned rescues fat from the drowning of young people, and his father calls him "sunshine" and he was "in sight when he looked down at me, his hand in me," it is very romantic and persuades viewers of adjacent submissive Ned Kelly. Besides, do not all the Aussiid underwear love?
