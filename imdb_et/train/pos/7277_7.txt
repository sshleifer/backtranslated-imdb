This is a strange film about an archaeologist who is studying the culture of ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes out the mummy (really fake) from the burial cave and brings it home to study. Well, pretty soon he will start to admire and talk to this mummy. And soon afterwards, his son will be mummy in the spirit. Even strange events happen as the spirit tries to destroy a woman's family. This is really ATTENTION and it will make you sleep for the first few times if you try it. But if you hold it, you can just finish it. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the mummy's secret? Is the mummy's spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to determine what the motivation of the spirit is, but if you like a small budget (and 70 hairstyles!), Spooky shenanigans will be a comforting appeal. <br /> <br /> How I have described that story is much clearer when the story of the movie is overwhelmed, boring. Can a boring film be exciting? Well ... somehow it does. Maybe it is a good movie from the heart, but it's done quite uncomfortably. I do not know. What I know is that I've enjoyed it quite a bit, despite my longing. <br /> <br /> Spider Baby fans are interested in using some music in this movie. (including instrumental song version). <br /> <br /> An intimidating and quite well-done sequence that shows the boulder and the stone in its possession that will eventually attack some people in a caravan. Other movie scenes are just spooky or peculiar; but this one scene is actually pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Look at it! It's strange and it's worth your time. Maybe you even want your shelf.
