I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's not as sharp as it sounds, it's a three-part documentary (every episode is 50 minutes) with Slavoj Zizek, Slovenia's superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst. Zizek takes us through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. It was led by Sophie Fiennes, of several talents from the Fiennes clan (she is a sister to actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it quite a bit, although I think it's even more enjoyable on DVD because there is an oven of ideas that needs to be digested. The analysis of Freud and Lacanian can be quite difficult and the whole series could change for two and a half hours at the end. It does not help that poor recommended coffee and bladder possession caused me discomfort over the last hour. <br /> <br /> My only real problem with this is that Zizek chose movies that were probably quite full of Freud's themes. He spends quite a bit of time on Hitchcock and David Lynch's films, not exactly the crowds of the crowds. I would have liked to try to support his theories by using a broader selection of the film, although it is really only I say that I would like to see the fourth and fifth and six. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny and some of the humor looked at her present, which was a lecture, adding to the real scenes she discusses. So, for example, we see him in a motorcycle on the bay of Bodega (from Hitchcock birds) or sitting in the basement of Bates Motels (from Psychost). This does not mean that his theories would not be provocative. Even when I disagreed with him, it certainly made me a bit deeper about the movies. That's exactly what he's trying to achieve.
