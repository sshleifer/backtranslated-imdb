No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best performances. Mencia is renowned for the rumbling and fun of racial issues. But he does more than a stand-up performance in San Francisco. In general, the Mencia material not only laughs, but also thinks about what is really wrong in today's society. <br /> <br /> In this hour-long performance, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, which women really mean when they demand equality in the workplace, terrorism, her opinion about the passion of Mel Gibson Christ, and the argument that she was affected by her Jesus, and how society should treat them physically or mentally disabled. Mencia even discusses whether she should have the right to talk and talk. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which in many cases causes him problems with his critics. For example, he goes a little further (and admits it) with the funny Pope John Paul II and what he's probably doing in heaven now. <br /> <br /> Mencia's main message in all of her performances is that we all have a voice and that we should use that voice to talk about what we feel and are not afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have the right to freedom of expression and that we must use it as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this performance, I would definitely recommend looking at Mind of Mencia, his exhibition at Comedy Central.
