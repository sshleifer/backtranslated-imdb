This movie is an hour or so with great entertainment and has some really funny moments. I loved Matti and Tiny's character. They seemed the most interesting and funny characters and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as well as his good relative) and a police woman and a blonde biker woman offer welcoming eye candies. I have to say that I saw striking similarities between Matt and the other Aussie actor Eric Bana. My personal favorite was the brothel scene, loved it. In general, I liked the movie and it gives about 8 ratings. But the punishment was disappointed. It was rather a lateral paw than the relevant ribbons. <br /> <br /> Of course I am joking. :)
