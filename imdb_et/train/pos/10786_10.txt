I and my sister use it to rent every time we have movies and our parents get so crazy (but they let us anyway) and I love it ... I can't find someone living near me who knows what I do I'm talking ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find it on the DVD somewhere !! I'd like to watch it right now because I loved it as much as a little boy ... and I'm 15 years old! I remember so much about it ... this is where I got a little bunny fufu song and all my friends know the song, but not the movie! I think the little girl slides there with her little playground
