First he saw Joe Sarno's pearl back when I have to say that after I saw it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. First of all, I thought the film was moving a little slower when I was waiting for Sarno's film, but when Jennifer made her entrance, the first time I saw her, I sat down and noticed. Its presence in this film is difficult to avoid, and spices for each scene with which it is associated. I've seen most of the rest of Sarno's movies and other movies starring or featuring Jennifer Welles, and I have to say that it was both Sarno and Jennifer's collective best. Sarno's direction in this adult drama film is great, and Jennifer showed (figuratively and literally) a mastery that makes it visible. The co-stars Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both frequent Mrs. Welles, and also Sarno's often-celebrated stars, are marked by incredible performances as an adventurous but ordinary housewife couple. This movie is Sarno classic.
