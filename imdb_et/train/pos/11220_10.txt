Aim to the top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that has been classically written over it. I loved this series completely and still remains my favorite anime. And although it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. Steam is a serious end of the drama episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to live his father's death, killed by human race's first insect race. Humanity is in war. Just because of his father's death, Noriko wants to become a fighter pilot. But his lack of trust turns out from time to time and he expands. His friend, Kazumi Amano, even doubts that Noriko will be selected as a pilot. Noriko coach Koichiro Ota believes in him. And he has made it his personal mission to see he succeed in becoming a pilot because he was a survivor in a battle where Noriko's father was killed. The fighter, destined to serve with Noriko and Kazumi, belongs to Smith Toren, the love for Noriko, who is killed in their first composition, and Noriko's childhood friend Kimiko Higuchi. The inclusion of Kimiko is also interesting, because Noriko is left behind in space, Kimiko stays on Earth for normal living. And because of the time dilation, Kimiko usually gets older on Earth, Noriko is relatively old at school. At the end of the series, Noriko is about 18 years old, while Kimiko is in his mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great anime series to see if you're a giant robot mecha and Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other exhibitions or you are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's art, give it an opportunity. It will grow on you.
