The film is extraordinary in its gay icon and extends it beyond the asteroid music and cast. Throughout the film there is a childlike miracle that is seen through the eyes of the protagonist. The world around her light-hearted world is comic and beautiful. In some ways, this is a slacker movie for girls. See if it is your entertaining, relaxing nightlife movie. Buy it if you want to combine different media and love (?).
