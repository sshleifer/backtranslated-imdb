Like his early masterpiece "The Elephant Man", Lynch proves to his detractors that he can speak a straight, simple story without losing his artistic lack. This is the real story of an elderly retired man (Richard Farnsworth's expert game) who decides to travel with a tractor in a country to visit his stranger who is now standing at the door of death. The beautiful beautiful film of life is the beautiful score of the Badalament, the beautiful photography of the countryside (love these corn on the ground) and the casual hand that shows man's basic humanity. Its extremely slow pace can sleep for some viewers, but those who stay on the road will eventually get paid.
