Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has a supporting role as an expert in the psychology of dreams. It has some brilliant visual effects (not everyone loves to climax, especially in 3-D) and some good style stories. It made some movie series in boxes. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a strong anamorphic widescreen (1.85: 1) transmission (including Pan & Scan) and strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has an original theater trailer, Jump to Nightmare's opinion and Cast & Crew. The Elm Street Series Box, Eighth Disc, interviews the sixth film cast and the team. The sixth film is also at the top of the film in 3-D, but it can also be viewed at 2-D. This is the latest "Elm Street" movie until Wes Craven raised Freddy's second, darker style "New Nightmare" and silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror movie "Freddy Vs Jason". Watch the fun fire Robert Shaye (co-owner and "New Line Cinema" co-leader), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenter is Crazy). Director's story. (*** Â½ / *****).
