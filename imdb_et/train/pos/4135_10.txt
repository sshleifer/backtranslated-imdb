It's an absolutely charming film, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It is very humorous and cast is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with his Shakespeare work, he shows in this film that he is in no way limited to playing classical theater. He leads the transition from a cynical divorce lawyer who is trying to avoid women and their embarrassing ways, to the lovesick puppy that belongs to Lady X, played by Merle Oberon effortlessly. The dialogue is wonderfully funny and refreshing and the atmosphere is enchanting. Ralph Richardson was also happy to watch. I highly recommend it.
