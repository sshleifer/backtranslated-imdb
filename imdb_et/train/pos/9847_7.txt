It was fun to watch this movie .. despite the feeling that I had a lot of time that this movie was almost a copying of Monsters Inc. There are quite a few things that are very similar between the two, the relationship between the animals / monsters and the little child, the other animals trying to break this relationship, and so on. It seemed to me pretty much throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the redeeming qualities is, however, Scrat :) Very funny character, even if he has no purpose :)
