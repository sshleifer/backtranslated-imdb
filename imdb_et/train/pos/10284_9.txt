"Kiss My Ass" United States "<br /> <br /> House of Games is a dramatist debut by David Mamm, an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. This marks Lindsay Crouse's most sold psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to fight with a player who has led one of her patients into suicidal thinking. In doing so, he leaves his somewhat normal life safe and comfortable, and drives downtown to visit the small townhouse playhouse. <br /> <br /> Player Mike (playing great with Joe Mantegna) is somewhat sharp and blunt. He offers a Crouse character agreement when he is ready to play with him, at the back of a big cash game, he is giving up on patient debts. The card game is created and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler will see in the familiar work (trust of others) and the exciting relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an important view for any movie fan is the constant guess who is under control, whether it is a psychiatrist or a con-man or whether it is a well-known man with big bluffs David Mamet. > <br /> In House of Games, the direction is boring and most of the time flat and uninspiring, but in every movie by David Mamet, it is the story that is at the heart of the whole process, not the directions. In the games house, this is partly due to the excellent performances of these two contestants (good-looking and disturbing), but mostly like Mammoth's work, it is a dialogue that grabs you and slowly pulls you into the film. No one in the playroom says what they think, and conversations become battlegrounds and word warfare. Everyone bluffs and doubles, resembling the natural queue of poker games. This is the theme of the whole movie and is used to a great extent in time to create tremendous tension. House of Games can also be seen as a "class war" division movie. We have a middle class with Lindsay Crouse, a well-educated educated psychiatrist, and Joe Mantegna is the exact opposite, the American working class earns a living with "honest" crimes. <br /> <br /> The film seduces the viewer like Crouse by Mantegna, and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying American cinema. The ultimate in the movie is definitely everything you see and watch, it's stunning. <br /> <br /> A very enjoyable movie experience worth repeating. 9/10
