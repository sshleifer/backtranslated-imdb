About thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published a lengthy interview with Belgian comedian Georges Remi (better known as Herge, creator of Tintin). This film comes with Sadoul today when he recalls the interview while we listen to the cassettes (Herge died in 1983) and saw some old photos and materials about himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in Herge's request, and we now know that they were dealing with her separation from her husband after being associated with one of her associates (who later became her second husband). Interestingly, the film does not deal with the exchange of Tintin's books from early and imperialist books (Tintin in Congo, Tintin in Soviet countries) for only a few years later as imperialist books. Blue Hope). All in all, I came out of this movie knowing some more things about Herge and seeing him a little more unlikely than coming to the theater.
