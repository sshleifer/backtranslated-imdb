I don't understand what that genre fans like about this movie. It was really fun. Special effects were wonderful. Overall, I agree with the evaluations and IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited until it came to a home video, which I felt was another reason I didn't enjoy the movie. I believe that special effects movies should be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case. For me, the film is compared to two films that appeared at the same time. Blair's witch and mommy. Both of the movies I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated fear film ever. Mummy made money and it was a pure dreck. People liked this special effect. Mummy and The Haunting films are not rich in character development, they are mostly entertainment trips. With this analogy, Mommy B-ticket to Haunting's e-ticket was.
