Spoilers! Classic 70 Sex Trash! The Swedish gal (Helga) was what made this movie so big. She was beautiful, but for me it was how sexual she was. He published enormous sexualities throughout the film. His best scenes were when he was himself. Every time he was on the screen, I changed over. <br /> <br /> Doctor Julia (the twilight man of the movie's twilight) was also visually very interesting. Although most 12-year-old girls have larger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use what she had little, and her scenes (especially the silk blouse and the black skirt) got my attention unramerces. You also had to love the big tentative scene where bats removed their nickel; I don't know if I've ever seen anything more ridiculous but sexy. Classic stuff!
