This is the best version (so far) that you can see, and most of all, Bronte. Dalton is somewhat difficult to imagine when Rochester, who proclaimed Jane Eyre, is not beautiful. But his behavior goes beyond that and Zelah Clark, as he is, is also full and credible Jane Eyre. This production is long but worth it. Almost direct quotes from the book are in the script, and if you want a true "romance" for the first time in the literature, this is an opportunity to see it. I have all the copies of this movie and have read and read the original. Filming may seem a bit out of date, but it will never be.
