It's not the best Bigfoot ever made, but according to the latest standards of nature, these amazing movies, which mostly appear on the Sci-Fi channel, are quality stuff. It has some activities, humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but there are some practical F / Xs I like. <br /> <br /> In general, watching a movie is worth it if you are a B horror / sci-fi fan and you need a fix. It's better than Sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> Action is better than what can be expected in such a movie and management is more than enough. Wait a bit for lulu because the characters are "advanced", but they know things are getting faster. If you watch a DVD, you can pause the chapter or two.
