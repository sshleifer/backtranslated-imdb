I've been watching this week in VH1 every night. It is a terrible revealing portrait of the drug epidemic and how the drugs were displayed in the media in the late 60s and 70s. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, Morrison's Death, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 has shaped the complete complex image of life and times in the "years of drugs". From the San Francisco Bay area to Studio 54, this documentary shows the development and progress of drug trafficking and the death and new life that this American culture breathes. From Marijuana to LSD cocaine, this document shows how drugs got into the country, hippie movement, conservative resistance and the impact of drugs on art (music, movies, etc.). Made interesting interviews and news about reel footage. <br /> <br /> Drug Movies: Journey to the Easy Rider Smoker Madness Blow Boogie Nights
