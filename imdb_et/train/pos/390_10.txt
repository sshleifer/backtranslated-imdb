The first thing I thought when I saw this movie was: It's not really a movie, at least what we don't think spontaneously when we hear the word "film". it is completely symbolic, all of it has a figurative meaning. So if you are not used to expressing it symbolically, it is strange if you do not know philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you think it is just a fairy tale ... and even weird. , chaotic. For me, the Zu legend is completely transparent. And I like it. It tells us about the images of the struggle between light and darkness, the struggle that is as old as humanity, and everyone who is sensitive in this life faces it. The film is probably made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and the vision of the world and man are different. But if we are all human and we have the same human nature, we necessarily have common experiences and understand each other. This is really a beautiful movie! And me, what we had more movies like, movies with meaning. There are too many empty stories that are good only to move forward faster.
