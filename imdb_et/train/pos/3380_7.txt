I've seen tons of scientific literature from the 70s; some were scary and others thought provocative and really scary. Soylent Green fits into the last category. Yes, sometimes it is a bit cumbersome, and yes, the furniture is good to eat or two, but some of the film seems terribly irrelevant. Here we have a film that is 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as blind, scary and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson value it better than the Ten Commandments, and the Robinson assisted suicide scene is very light on Kevorkian and her. Some attitudes are dated (can you imagine the disappearance of the concept of "women as furniture" by filmmakers in our o-so-politically correct 90s?) But it's rare to find a decade of film that can really think of me. This is one that I would like to see on the big screen because even in a widescreen presentation, the overall scope of this movie cannot be paid for it. Look at it.
