Most of his life has been within the limits of law by Salva and his leader Bigardo. We see them in an underground car, where they are so flat to get their pitch donations, nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a tempered tiny criminal, does not even have the redeeming qualities, ie until she discovers a reality show on television that gives her an idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and exhibition activities are the winners that Salva capitalizes on. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo have been in jail after a duo-critical priest. Salva shows that she is natural for a reality exhibition. He turns himself into a line of Christ who is a quick success of the program. Espe, a nonsense woman who is an exhibition producer, cannot escape the unusual attention of Salva. Ultimately, Salva is a victim of her own success. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, whose first production is this film, was somewhat successful in the way film plays the role of television. Spain, who was vulnerable to such programs, has seen its role in the bizarre that the director felt to see the attack on the public and wanted to put his story from the perspective of those who make the naive audience successful. <br /> <br /> The ensemble has some good moments in the movie. Mr. Mole, like any actor who decides to control his first feature, would have been more effective at the picture in front of the camera. Good actor Candela Pena is one of the best reasons for watching a movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.
