Steve Carelli's stars like a person you can associate with Dan in real life (sort of), a movie that I didn't like but eventually liked. Not that the movie is ridiculous funny, it's just that it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, that's not what Office fans would see from him, but you know what, I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell's stars like Dan Burns, a widowed father who's daughters, don't like him. One weekend he and his daughters drive to their family. There he is in a bookstore and falls for a woman. When he returns to his house, he finds that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) has met this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in real life, sometimes I found a little incredible. Is the Burns family really one who is practicing and playing board games together and doing a lot of other family things? I doubt it very much. I don't know any of these families. Does it stop me giving my thumbs? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life: *** / ****
