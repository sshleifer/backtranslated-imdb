This twilight movie was a failure when he was released at the same time from the very popular "Amelie", both of whom had a great Audrey Tautou central. Laurent Firode, a talented director, made one of the most enjoyable films that has recently come out of memory in France. The French title refers to how butterfly wings can cause chaos along the Atlantic, but also Pacific hurricanes, which cannot be believed by looking at these colorful insects. From the very beginning, the director moves all the characters in the film, and how each of them has another connection, something difficult to imagine, but in the context of the film it seems to work well. <br /> <br /> A possible meeting in the subway will set the tone of the movie. Irene, who goes to work, asks a woman sitting in front of her to tell her what her Zodiac sign is and what she reads from her paper. Irene, it looks like it crosses the road and finds her play on the same day. When Irene leaves the train, a quiet young man sitting next to her tells her she has the same birth date as Irene. They seem to be on top of each other from the beginning, but unfortunately they do not rejoin the last frame of the movie. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, doesn't have much time to do, but he shows he has a presence and plays his part well. The talented youngsters make a valuable contribution to the success of the film, as easy as butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We look forward to Laurent Firod's upcoming movies because he seems to be a heartfelt director at the right place and with the ears of how people are connected.
