I'm not tired of saying it's one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story is in a fictional state, but apparently it is about Kennedy's murder. A true and honest district commissioner (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that a single Daslow (= Oswald) has designed and executed the murder, and although all other officials want to close the case that he must constantly investigate with his team. br /> <br /> The manuscript is written and fast and keeps the tension complete. Only part of the Milgram authorities' experiment is (though not uninteresting) a bit inappropriate. The final sequence - explaining who is actually Icarus - is partly photographed slowly and intensified by the Morricone soundtrack, the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in the movie.
