George Lopez never tried to stand up for comedy and he's still not. But this exhibition is a work of art. It will never show where jokes keep you from laughing every time you remember it (and jokes that are memorable at that time). At this show, it's a good challenge and the characters range from an old, short drunk to a dyslexic teen. I don't know who writes this exhibition, but that person does a good job. If they were to continue the exhibition, I am sure that this will be a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for good, traditional comedy, George Lopez is an exhibition for you! One bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine Bel-Air's fresh prince is "Will Smith". C'mon man! But otherwise this exhibition is a genius! 10/10
