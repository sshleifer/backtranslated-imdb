When you usually watch a short film, you are always afraid that creating a movie will try to throw it too much. That's not the case. A great story about young girls who have had enough and other world forces trying to change things right. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari is doing a great job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helping the young girl as well as the father give great performances in this great short film, but Eric's performance is definitely a concealment of this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie for its complexity, performance and great story.
