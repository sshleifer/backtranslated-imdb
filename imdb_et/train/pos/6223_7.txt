Today's sensitivity sometimes makes it difficult to watch older movies. It's annoying that you have to see that a stereotypical librarian with a background color has to take off his glasses and become quite a flaw and a fool to win. Especially such a low and constant man. He is obviously a player (I do not trust him to trust him) who does not want to settle down, who only looks at stupid attractive women and always calls them "child" (ick!). Even after he had completely changed his appearance and his life, he would go to him only after he had (allegedly) been rejected by another woman and learn that Connie had spent all his money to renovate the boat. I wanted him to stand up against him, not to pathetically follow him! His sudden conversion within minutes was completely unrealistic and didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Besides this sub-block I made this movie. How can you not like sailors dance with each other? (You can say they were from San Francisco ....; D) "Samples" dance was great, looking at Ginger Rogers deliberately "on the right steps" in and out. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and art deco set was beautiful. And I really enjoyed "We saw the sea" (although they used it too many times as if they realized it was their best song). Anyway, the plot was a little weak, like most of the musicals (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but the dance was worth watching the movie. I wish they could have shown some pictures of San Francisco, because that was when the film was supposed to be set. time. I have to try to stop all the knowledge that I put myself into the land of fantasy.
