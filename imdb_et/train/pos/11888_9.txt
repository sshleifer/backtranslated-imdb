It was very warm from the heart. In French, I enjoyed this "TV" movie, which I think deserves to be more widespread. The action was good and the connections between every member of this French family member seemed so strong and so natural. There is no doubt a big film about family and involvement in homosexuality and AIDS. One of the strongest aspects of the film is what is the privileged relationship between the oldest son (Leo) who has contracted HIV and the youngest son (Marcel) to whom the rest of the family is trying to hide the situation. Two characters <br /> <br /> are gradually exploring each other when time is out of time for Leo, who doesn't want to spend the rest of his life under his drugs.
