Don't make a mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is the most beautiful Jane and never has one more wonderful one. He is visually stunning. This omission takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. It is not only a classic Tarzan aura, but also the feeling of a continuous saga. We are involved in two white hunters looking for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, another robbing catalyst whose character can be one of the best and most researched in film history. And these testimonials make this a great activity for the flick to stand out as a classic. There is an uncomfortable racism depicted. But the Africans are depicted as individuals, and at the end two even more heroic than white hunters and stand out as such. In fact, this unnamed person refers more to the audience than any other sign. This film is also one of the reasons for enjoying this movie. The great lion attack has never been repeated, and the horror is obviously expected to be characteristic of the reactions, the more the modern gore film works with the graphic image. If I left out, it is because I don't want to photograph those who haven't seen it. But that's all you could want in the movie.
