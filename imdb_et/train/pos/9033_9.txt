I watched this movie without knowing it, and found it like Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on parents and sons. In both films, the son does not want to follow his dad in the mines and dream of a better life away from his home town. Both sons see their classmates seeing and both have a strong female model to teach them. <br /> <br /> The biggest difference I found between the films was that the October sky was an endlessly interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts on performance and Chris Cooper plays badly well with his father when he made American beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with fine leadership, very different from his other leadership qualities such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
