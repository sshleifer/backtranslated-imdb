This film is inspiring to anyone who has been or has been in tough peace or emotional jam. Be sure to laugh at what is the best medicine! :) It remains a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace has to find a new way to make money, and it's not exactly legal that adds humor. Even my boyfriend liked it not to believe it was a chick-flic.
