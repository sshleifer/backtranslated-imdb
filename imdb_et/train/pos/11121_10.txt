Like a man who has seen all seasons, I can say that JG surprises me. I mean, after you saw him laughing at paranoia right across the seasons and after every u made him, he believes he's a gangster, u thought to myself: OK, he's a good actor and he's gangster on the skin. But after seeing how he opened his eyes and lived for his life, I mean, I can almost feel the pain he "made" when we believe he passes through. I was so touched by his performance, which I immediately thought about Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These boys were definitely the best of their generations and even more so. But nowadays they are either old or dead (Brando) and it is OK that they make fewer movies and their performances are "lighter" than before. I can't wait to see Gandolfin in other movies where he plays a completely different role. Do u recommend my older movies where he gives a memorable result?
