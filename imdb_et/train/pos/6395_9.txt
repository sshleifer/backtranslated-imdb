For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Future racism that lives through life and proves that it is not just an ordinary cookie, Carl Brashear is an amazing game that puts Cuba in its best light Best performance in your life. Niro, who is a lively legend, gives the film something. Voted his movie movie, but he gives this film so many good deeds, great performance. And beautiful Charlize was and always is a big plus for every movie. So if you haven't seen this movie, I recommend those who love bravery, the size who is looking for inspiration. You have to watch this great drama. My vote 9/10.
