Having seen most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is his best film and most unusual. It is an ancient piece of the Chinese period, full of full-length martial arts, where the location of an underground trap full of traps and caves plays as much a part as any character. The action is awesome, the story is tense and entertaining, and the design is truly memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise is not made available on DVD and vhs is impossible to drive with your fingers, even when you go to North America's second largest city in China (like me). If you find it, don't give it up.
