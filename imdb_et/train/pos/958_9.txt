Wow! I've recently seen so many bad low budget movies, but that's great. A very realistic picture of police life on the East German coast has a strong contrast to other criminal films or series. I loved the main actor and the absolute refusal of any common clich√© about the police. This movie is realistic like documentation and entertainment like drama at the same time. The perfect compromise!
