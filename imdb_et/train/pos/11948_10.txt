"Match Point" and now "Scoop" have convinced me that not only Woody Allen makes clean-up movies in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the right cast member) but confirmed what I have known for years: he shouldn't focus neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson is playing journalist Sondra Pransky, who is charmed by Sid Waterman (Allen) in his lost box, where he meets the ghost of the murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) who tells him that the serial numbers afflicted in London have been committed by millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) . So, she knows her and ... well, I don't know how much I can't tell you. But I can say that this is probably the funniest movie of Allen for years. There's his common sense of humor (especially his line of religion). <br /> <br /> So you are definitely the movie. If anything else, you will fall in love with London. But usually it's just so funny. Even if you don't like Woody Allen, you have to love it.
