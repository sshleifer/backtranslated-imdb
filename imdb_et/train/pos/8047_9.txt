I accidentally and really enjoyed this movie. Timothy Busfield's character has not redeemed the qualities and, at one point, the women of Busfield and the Melon ogle, when they pass ... Melon's parade from the parade is different from Busfield. Janel Maloney is terrible ... She looks like Tea Leone, but the biggest difference is that Janel actually gets ACT. Some very nice things in this movie and pay your attention during the cable.
