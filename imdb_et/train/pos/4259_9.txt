Solino brought me his deeply drawn characters. Being a simple story of rivaling two brothers, it was not just hatred or jealousy. The film was most liked by how I discovered the feelings Gigi went through, especially when he had to go back to his homeland in Italy and leave the festival without attending a film award ceremony. To see the nature of such a hard work between his artistic dream and his mother's innate feeling was so depressing. Even at the end, when he made another attempt to reach his father, he was so brave. And like in real life, most fathers can never bypass their walls to reach their children. I can even identify with Giancarlo, a brother who is more confident and older brother, with so much uncertainty. A really beautiful movie that made me laugh and cry.
