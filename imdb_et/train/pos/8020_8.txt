I found this to be the most enjoyable Muppets movie because I felt it was the lightest and had the best comic delivery in most of its lines. Muppets is trying to go to Broadway to sell the original music they have written, but along the way they get into the usual problems, including Kermiti's memory loss here. Although there are not so many great fires here as in the original "Muppets Movie", there are also some Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simply scheduling and delivering so many lines is great and the situation where Muppets is is fun. The original songs are also good here and the end is satisfactory. There is not much to say about the movie, but fans of the Muppet should definitely see it. This is the most fun Muppet film and it's definitely enjoyable for everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 Off ****
