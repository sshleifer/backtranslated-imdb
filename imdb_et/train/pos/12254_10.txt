I've seen this movie after watching the Paltrow version. I found it very good and I thought it wouldn't be so good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and more enjoyable! I found Jeremy Northam more "pleasant" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong is trying much better for Austen's Knightley. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who loved Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies changed some things but remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
