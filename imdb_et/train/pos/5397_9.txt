Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri - directed by Hideo Gosha - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei (together with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) is one of the best existing chambara films. <br /> <br /> His story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izot)) works at Nakade, who wants to become a day. Okada, being "cleaner" for Nakadei, is treated like a dog - and for quite some time she understands - what she really does for Nakade. <br /> <br /> But this movie has so much more - every time a Japanese movie fan should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means punishing heaven)
