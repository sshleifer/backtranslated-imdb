In the panic streets, Richard Widmark plays a US Navy doctor who has intermittently interrupted his body during his week. When the police officer Paul Douglas correctly points out that the man died on the chest for two months. This is not a question here, two of them become unwanted partners to find killers and someone else who is exposed to the disease. <br /> <br /> As any number of people noted, for some reason, director Elia Kazan is not bothering to cast small parts on anyone who sounds like Louisiana. In New Orleans, where the story goes, I can confirm it personally. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can apologize because they can be assigned there as a naval doctor, but not for those who are native. <br /> <br /> But there is a plague and the news The New Orleans PD is starting a secret to the city underworld. The dead man came from Europe and had underground connections. The wise man of New Orleans, played by Jack Palance, jumps to a whole lot of faulty conclusions and starts harassing a dead boy's cousin who is going to show signs of plague. Palance received rave comments on the first film, where she received a note. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this movie is Zero Mostel. It happened just before Mostel was on the black list and during that time he did a specialty of playing, which would be the hard boys who are really flies. He plays the same type of role on Humphrey Bogart's film Enforcer. Unfortunately, I can sort of identify myself with Mostel in the last chase scene where Widmark, Douglas and half of the New Orleans police are pursuing him and Palance. Seeing that Zero tried to keep up with Palance, there was something else because I'm in the Zero League now in the Heft department. <br /> <br /> I joined the action with a good clip, there is very little time for this movie. If it were less, it would be an Indiana Jones movie. This year's Panic In The Streets won the Oscar for the Best Scenario of the Year. <br /> <br /> My partner used the New Orleans Coast and the French Quarter well. Some similar frames are later used in Waterfront. In fact, Panic In The Streets is about people who don't strike when they really should. Very similar to Waterfront. <br /> <br /> The panic streets are all proud of those involved. Now why Elia Kazan couldn't hear some decent New Orleans in small roles.
