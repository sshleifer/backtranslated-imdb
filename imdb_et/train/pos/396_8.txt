Legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember Tsui Hark's original Zu Warriore 18 years ago. During one Christmas, in rare weeks, when Channel 4 in the United Kingdom showed weeks of Hong Kong films, Zu Warriors was such a thrilling young man and his brother, and so memorable that it has been etched into the memory now grown. Indeed, I think that the original Zu Warriors is one of the first films I saw as a child, that I can clearly remember the story and scenes of activities. And memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classic primary. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this Zu Warriors rewrite, it felt like it was scared. Could it win the dreamy childhood memories I had of the original, or does it follow the path of other remarks and die more terribly than the bad and their broken neck found in these kung fu films? <br /> <br /> The answer is, I can't say. But it was because it is not really a remake. Stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The Zu legend tells the story of King Sky, a single warrior whose captain Dawn announces his love for him, but his life has been taken from him by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, Dawn is reincarnated as Enigma and Insomnia is back for Zu destruction. Meanwhile, white eyebrows and red King Sky are trying to stop insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plot is not full of twists, but it has enough details to interest me. But I see this movie as one you love or hate. The film is about a lot of special effects, most of which are related to several computer environments, such as The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the others, this film was not the one that exalted the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful. Nothing seems to hurry - unlike Hero. The backgrounds were complementary and not at all powerful scenes. <br /> <br /> The story also includes many characters, and mixing so many people makes the movie intriguing. It was probably on the edge of "too many chefs," but in general, each character had a story. However, some roles seem to me to be "extended cameos" and I somehow questioned its necessity. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play a very central role in the film. but I couldn't say that this movie showed its best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to be at least in her maturity, but it is still quite raw. Kelly Lin was a new revelation for me. Despite his very short roles, I have apologized and admitted that I have said that I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed the "original". Given that both films have been made by the legendary Tsui Hark, these two films are part of a chronicle that shows how film making in Hong Kong has changed over the past two decades. And one of the beauty of this is that you can't really compare two movies at all, as much as apples are apples and pears are pears. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, both thoroughly enjoyable movies are your own right. And I'll go back to seeing the original again. <br /> <br /> Two look, but not compare.
