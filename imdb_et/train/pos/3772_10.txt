Bill and Tedi's fake journey is the most wonderful film I've ever seen. While acting and scenery etc are poor who cares. The story is brilliant and the jokes and words they offer are the best, the ideas are also great. I suggest someone to see this classics. The best part is obviously when they "die" of death, I burst 10 minutes and left the next part of the movie. It's so much better than the first, which was also great. It's possible to have a more fun movie all the time !!!!! But I think the best parts of the movie are when Bill and Ted scream perfectly and play the guitar solo, it was fun. Rock Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen bring out the third movie !!
