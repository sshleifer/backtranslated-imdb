In contrast to some people's summaries, women in the film are not geisha. They are Oirans (prostitutes) who live outside the most famous amusement areas and their lives and experiences represent the lives of many women in the Tokugawa era. I can't say that the stories were especially enlightening, but their charm is how typical they are. Topics are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I greatly enjoyed the direction of the art and the actors. I felt I had a glimpse of the time and place I couldn't see otherwise. Participants, especially the 4 women who played the main oiron, were excited to see. I recommend this movie only to those who want a taste of Japanese culture or those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. This is a great example of both.
