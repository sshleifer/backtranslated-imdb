Belushi's most enjoyable and Courtney Cox before the small role of friends. I often think Belushi has been used too little in Hollywood and this film role is one of his best. For those who watch their TV shows, this is a very different and pleasant character. The film itself is not a destructive or new message, but rather it is sweet and loving. Casting the names of familiar faces and strangers is a perfect balance, although Lovitz's whining can be tiring and Michael Caine's charming spiritual instructor is a little sinner or not good. Hamilton, because Belush's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and wondering why she married her. In addition, Renee Russo wastes the "prom queen" who went away. However, it is a nice way to spend two hours.
