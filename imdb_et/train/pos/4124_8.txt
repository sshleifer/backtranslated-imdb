Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were all stars of this series. What made me so good when I looked at it was a real underwater approach. The exhibition has a youthful energy for exploring infectious water. <br /> <br /> The show was educative and also shows the viewers' things diving from someone who seemed to be the perfect pro, Mike Nelson. There were excellent exhibitions and the program always seemed to be well produced. Probably the drama of scripts sometimes struck the same comments in more than 1 episode, but each play has it with some other era of American television.
