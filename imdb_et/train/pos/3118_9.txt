Having never seen the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne, I was very reluctant to see Bourne's ultimatum. what happened to seeing the first two movies. Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with Bourne's ultimatum before it reached the interval! I don't think I've ever looked at such a sophisticated and captivating film, especially the action film. Since I am afraid of the usual activities and thriller-type movies, it was such a big news to me. Ultimatum is one of the most appealing movies, it grabs your attention from the first second to the last minute before the credit rolls. Matt Damon was just fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot of my great performances in Bourne 1 + 2 and now it's a fabulous actor to add to my list. I look forward to more movies in the future. <br /> <br /> Stunt was treated with style - everyone was great and was shocked by the impression of this film. Well done.
