For a certain age, W.W. II was a decisive time in their lives, and whatever followed was never comparable. When a movie opens, a widow but a lively woman (Judi Dench) listens to a street musician who is trying to play the classic song "Stardust". <br /> <br /> It resembles his memories when he played almost all of the girls' bands that created bomb attacks during the war. Drummer Patrick (Ian Holm) was happy to draft and enjoy women. Patrick and Dench's character meet and decide to join the band, leading them to mini-adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band has reunited and makes it successful. <br /> <br /> The film is subtly written and underestimated and is a great performance from all involved. The characters are well-developed and all the people who haven't lived in their years. And there's all this glorious old music! <br /> <br /> This is not Steven Spielberg's pontification, but a serious film. The war affected everyone and this lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is not afraid of entertainment when it teaches.
