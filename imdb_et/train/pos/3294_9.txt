This movie was opened to poor examples in the first few weeks. Then Meena Kumari died and it just brought the crowd in. All Indian radio songs, especially the Inhi LogoN, were played so often that I was sick during them, despite their beauty! Yes, it did all those years to do. It was because the marriage was very unhappy and Kamal Amroh had a hard time finding money to make a movie; looking at sumptouse kits and costumes, not surprising !! Meena Kumari does not live and get sick, but listens carefully to Lata's voice. Inhi's logoN they have their 50-year-old younger voice, while the songs re-recorded with Chalo dildar chalo show clear progress. I just want someone to find that Ghulam Mohammad's songs, which were not included in the film, have changed because of fashion, which required fewer songs and published them. In a recent Lata interview (2007) Ghulam Mohammad gave one of the best composers he had ever worked with, except Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Also note that the actors in Chalo dildos are hardly seen by the actors, very unusual. Raj Kumar is just a short distance from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed Meena Kumar. Kamal Amrohi made it necessary and focused on the stars and the moon. Any other film, this song would have been close to both. <br /> <br /> As this is the best film I would ask for a different one. This means you have lost a lot of Indian cinema, not in any order, such as Barsaat (old), Devdas (older versions), Bandini, Do Bigha Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan, Pyasa, Kagaz ke Phool, Sahib Bibi steam Ghulam, Kabulwallah, Abhima, guide, Sujatha, Bombay also Babu, Daag, Parineeta (old), Umrao Jaan, etc. etc. And if you appreciate music more than a story, then the list would simply be Rata Naya Daur, Tees Manzil, Mahal, Aag, Jugn, Anand, Mera Naam Joker, who has grown up in beautiful prices at Barsat Ki: the list is really endless! <br /> <br /> So enjoy Pakeezah, but don't miss any of the above ...
