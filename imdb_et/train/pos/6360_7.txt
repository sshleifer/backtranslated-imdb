I just read the lead file for this movie, which is on the front page with voting results and cast down. <br /> <br /> Why is it that some people can't film what they should do This movie should be a light heart, a blush, a family comedy, things that make children laugh and things for adults, and that's just what this film does. /> <br /> I laughed at my nuts on this film, I thought Carey was doing great performance and the whole movie (if followed during Christmas) will give you a little festive joy <br /> <br /> and every movie to knock, because it is not "Taxi driver" or "Godfather" and take the movies they should have, entertainment!
