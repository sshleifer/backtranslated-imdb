This film has a lot of raw potential. The script is sharp, dialogue is (usually) excellent (although it may lose cheezy votes), direction and cinematography are surprisingly good, although some experiments just don't work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once upon a time a geek boy, always a geek boy; And the sad, simple fact is that he can't play anything except Fox Mulder. He's standing, he's trying to be slippery, he's trying to be macho. Finally, he is just trying too hard. He crosses his character, he moves his lines, and in every way he is Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, each of whom is in the class of maintenance. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a spotty moment or two where he dramatized his role, but you could say he was having fun. He looked at a part, and he became both physical and atmospheric. Angelina Jolie was also very good. He had no great role to play; In fact, though he could have used much stronger ... his character was not nearly developed enough, although he did what he had. And his and Hutton's chemistry was obvious (gee, maybe this was why Uma left him ...); Had David Duchovny not split his role, it would have been much better. 7/10
