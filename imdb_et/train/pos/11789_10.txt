Hi, this little movie is interesting for the artist, the filmmaker or the music creator or the visual artist: <br /> <br /> She can feel and explore David's touch / style directly from the simplicity of short relatives. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic distance between frames, pans, and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even with a simple film, this work is multi-layered. For example, there are some sounds that sound all the time while others appear (albeit fine) at certain points to support certain frames. <br /> <br /> Several types of pans can also be seen: some move up and down gently back and forth. There is a diagonal pan. Sometimes zooms back and forth. <br /> <br /> Flash and element composition / placement in space are as usual and probably the painter's / artist's job. It can even be felt in this dirty room. This means that fine art can already be done by placing the look / view and creating the scene. Then there are visual items like digonates, parallels, etc. Also, light disintegration and colors, although without excessive research on textures such as large products, are also good. It's an artist's sketch ... <br /> <br /> All of this is not calculated, but it is done with an inner feeling, and this feeling gives David a touch / feeling like any real artist.
