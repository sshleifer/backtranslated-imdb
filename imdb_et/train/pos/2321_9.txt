Here's a love story I look at. And for the most part it is for two reasons. One, it focuses on young people, very young. People who are still teenagers and love for the first time or at least think they are. All of us have been in our lives and the "Man of the Moon" is an excellent reflection of our memories, perhaps adding some more details and increasing it even if one of us is experienced. Another reason is that it is a triangle of love. And I believe that as teenagers, this is the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe that characters can really fall in love or are just so loved that they just believe they are and after the tragedy or so it will believe it for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Moon" is cast with great talent. He marks Sam Waterston, a truly versatile actor who is well capable of playing both harsh district officials and rigorous but caring and clever fathers as in this movie. Also, Tess Harper, Jason London and Young Reese Witherspoon. You look at a young, talented actor because he is fourteen years old and thinks about ten years down the road, he goes to the Academy Award. All cast members pull out the big shows and with the help of the compelling scenarios they increase in real-life situations. Like all this happened. This is a movie I would like to see more often. Love story or not. I would like to see movies that make everything real and not fake or incredible.
