This movie is a great way to end the series. Peter (son of Puppet from Master III) has grown up and is now a Puppy. Well, this girl has to destroy the dolls and learn Toulon's secrets, but she's listening to the story of the dolls. Most of this movie is Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Puppet Master Curse, and Retro Puppet Master film (sorry, but I think Paramount won't let them use scenes 1). Personally, I Want Puppy Vs. In the end, demonic toys would do, but the way this movie ends is, in principle, saying: "This is the last movie in the series ..."
