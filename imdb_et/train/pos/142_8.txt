The second part (actually episode 4-8) hit the Danish TV series is slightly smaller than the first one, but also has a lot of laughs and scares. This time Udo Kier plays two parts, like the monster and his demonic father. Other parts of this time are Dr. Krogshoj of Søren Pilmark, who has to face dr. Against Helmer's terrible revenge, and once again, Mrs Drusse is trying to solve the mysteries of Miss Marple. After finishing the deaths of fishermen and, after the leaders, Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), you don't know how they can do part III, but I hope Von Trier gives it a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, Down's Syndrome Dishwasher # 2, died right after that. Look for Stellan Skarsgård's suitcase. ***
