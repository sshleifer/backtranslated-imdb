This film is a bit unusual in that it got a very thin plot and the film itself was made very slowly and calmly. Although this makes it quite different from the usual Grant movie, it is still very traceable and fun. It's kind of like someone said, "We're just watching Cary around and seeing how he disturbs all the little problems that come when you have a house rehabbed". Given the fun of the actor's movie and the great support he receives from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. Although the film has quite modest claims, it gives the material the most. It's a great movie for Cary Grant fans or the whole family.
