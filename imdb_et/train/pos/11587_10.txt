I love this movie and I'd like it ever. It's just an exciting legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I loved it and I would like to see it again! I don't remember it too much, but the fact that the Indian boy lives with his family in a nice village, and I don't remember what happens, but he should go to the desert only. Her sister is packing her food and she's going. When he is there, some other Indian boys will run out and put some feathers on him and he will become an eagle. The legend says that if you see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was always fascinated by legends, especially American legends, and I would like to publish it one day on a DVD, PLEASE RELEASE IT, whoever is worried!
