Finally! An Iranian film not made by Majid, Kiarostam, or Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, entertaining black comedy where subversive young girls hit the "system" exactly in their ass. Everything is football and it's funny, really funny. The director says, "The places are real, the event is real and so are the characters and extras. That's why I deliberately decided not to use professional actors because their presence would have brought the wrong concept." Non-participants will take you straight away if a. your heart is made of stone b. you're blind. The exceptionally written film challenges the patriarchal authority with almost absurd freshness. She has won a jury prize in Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it is almost perfect. Where can I get it?
