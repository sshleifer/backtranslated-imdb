What do I say about such a beautiful movie? I saw it in Atlanta, Georgia at Dragoncon, because it's my main city. I am a very sci-fi aficionad and I enjoy action movies. I happened all night and was ready to call this day when I noticed this movie in the morning. It's not a sci-fi or action movie. Let me just start by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade or Eric Etebar, having looked at a few episodes (his performance seemed outdated and robotic). But he really managed to win at this stage. I really mean to win me. Having seen Cellular, I didn't think there was much for this man. But his production of Kasadyana was just amazing. He was convincing as a very demon. But there was so much detail about this character that I was completely surprised. Later I watched it online and found that Eric won the Best Actress Award, which is well earned, considering his best career and earning his respect. Now I read about this project and about creating this project, and let me just say that I didn't pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very nicely done, but I was even more impressed with the story - what I think was even more of his goal (seeing like movies like Godzilla with huge influences just pulled me down). I couldn't sleep after that movie, I thought about it over and over again. The situation of an abusive family is never easy. I showed my friend a friend on the net and almost cried because it affected him by being abused. This is one movie that I constantly think and recommend.
