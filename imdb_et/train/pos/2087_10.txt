This movie was released in the year I was born, and it's like my 2007 year. I looked at it again last night when I didn't see it after high school. Although it was full of 30th sentiment and the actor was a bit stereotyped, it was still great. The story of Pearl S. Buck came alive through the magic of chemistry by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel, which served as the Nobel Prize for Literature by Buck, lives in the hands of Sydney Franklin, who, along with an excellent script, tells the story of the peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father receives his bride. local landlord. Buck's story writes about Wang's success in his willingness to listen to his wife, mostly from time to time, and the love of the earth. Finally, he realizes that his wife, like the earth, is the source of his wealth, happiness, and mortality. Buck always had strong women in a critical place to influence the results of events in the pre-feminist world. German-born Luise Rainer brings to the living Olan an imaginary but decisive peasant China. Muni also hits the na√Øve but respectable Wang, which is finally caught between the wealthy and peasant worlds. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale's uncle Henan Oz's wizard, Walter Connelly like mewing, unifying uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son - but this time not Charlie Chani. <br /> <br /> A classic can be a movie that can be viewed over and over again and never tireed. If this is indeed the case, this film is classic, no doubt at all.
