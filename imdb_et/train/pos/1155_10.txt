It's very funny. There's a lot of cast in it, which give great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. This is a well written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I don't like soap operas, although I never look at them. But I love this movie because it's so crazy and on the wall that it wins hell from every foolish soap they have on the television during the day. In my opinion, this is the best film of 1991.
