<br /> <br /> So, if I am not a poet myself, I have no real opportunity to pass on the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsworthy's effortless movement as he shapes the beauty of nature for his work is enchanting. Watch her stay on the web for a few minutes when she talks about her job, and then get paid when the camera cuts a wide picture. Be surprised at how easy it is to act, and then understand the triviality of the light breeze coming across the web. <br /> <br /> The Goldsworthy genius does not see any boundaries because it is inspired by nature. This is a fundamental change in nature, where his work, although complete in his sphere, is complete.
