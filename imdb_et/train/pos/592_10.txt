At Arlington Heights, there was never a caf√© in basic school (1961), so I drove my bike home from school to lunch and always looked at this game. True, I was 11, but I thought it was the biggest thing! I draw hidden images on my board and see if my family or friends find it. I also remember the great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) when the contestant got the final hidden picture game. I even had a home version! <br /> <br /> I don't know why this game took so long. I liked the music and the hidden images - the only thing I could ever get was the lemon, which was hidden as part of the bridge of the garden. <br /> <br /> Really good memories are associated with Camouflage.
