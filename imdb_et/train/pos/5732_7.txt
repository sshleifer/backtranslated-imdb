Since September last year, I have borrowed four to six films from the Harold Washington Library every week, with an impressive DVD collection. (HWL is really a circulating library: three-quarters of its films are out!) Recently, I was glad to find David Lynch's short films. Yesterday, knowing the little animated series, I took Dumbland. I'm here to report that for eighteen episodes, David Lynch fans are well spent. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable feature of these short pieces is their soundtrack. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Embarrassing voice accent stops. Physical violence gives a blow. Splitting birds and buzzing sockets brushing the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. Crude oil animation often keeps the sound synchronized, but the sound itself hit me for Lynch's main interest in creating and distributing this work. In some ways, these eight shorts are unique lynx rhythms. <br /> <br /> This means the situation is strange, ugly, deep, stupid and funny. And there is enough room inside to think about how absurd we are of people. I can't say I'm looking at the collection again, but for anyone who has been exposed to the inland waterway movement, Dumbland is half an hour away.
