I saw this movie for the first time in a Canadian motel. Although the channels were reflected through Easy Lube. My friend kept flipping, but I told her to go back. Nothing just about easy lube seemed like. I watched the rest of the movie, which was pretty funny. Collect a couple of credits and got home to watch it. There was Chevy Chase's first film. I didn't remember her in that. He didn't remember much, so I rented it and gave him another wine. It's pretty funny and quite graphic. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie, not so funny. Love your fingers, light oil and I'm a part of the president. The dealers are also too cool. I'll give him 6.5 or 7 out of ten
