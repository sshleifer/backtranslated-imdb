Ever since I remember, I loved planes and flown. I am now in a college with a private pilot license and wanting to become a commercial. I never remembered why I was so tortured until I was at home in my basement with my old tail spinel and it hit me, that was it. My parents bought every tape they had, and that was the only show I look at as a child. I remembered the topic when I grew up and I can quote it today. It's absolutely amazing and I'm planning to buy a DVD soon! It's really great for kids and adults and is absolutely timeless. I can't get enough of this show.
