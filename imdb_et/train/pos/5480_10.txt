It's a great movie, it shows what our government is going to do for other countries if we don't like their government. This is not as bad as what Reagan and Bush did with South America, but the US still does not have such a business. These films also prove that American media offer government propaganda. That's what they did with the Aristide of Haiti. The reason for the failure of this coup against Chavez was over 90% of the vote for Chavez. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a political documentary, but it would be a great movie if it were a drama, it's amazing that it's real. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer is lying when he says, "Chavez grabs waves," private media is constantly working with all of Chavez's propaganda.
