I looked at unedited episodes online and was so sad that the show wouldn't come back. It was the best mature mature talented actors and amazing chemistry. It seemed that all the actors were personal friends in real life. After all, the exhibition was busy, sexy and very observable. Of course, some story lines are not realistic, so what ... Characters are all pleasing and you have them. The exhibition reminded me of the cross of two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great ghost for everyone. Note to ABC execs: Nielsen's rating reports don't show you real results. The audience of the exhibition usually registers it. I've been very disappointed with the big networks where we are flooded with reality TV or teen-oriented shows. Why get mature, thoughtful and well-functioning material, do we need to exchange HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for sending other episodes online. New streaming media is gaining popularity among viewers.
