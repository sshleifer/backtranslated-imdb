For a long time, this movie liked better than the original Care Bears movie. Last summer I watched both of them together and decided I was wrong. The first one is a better Care Bears movie (as you have guessed when you read my review about it). It's not a BAD movie, it's just ... VERY STRANGE. <br /> <br /> First of all, as some people have mentioned, it does not fully allow any knowledge of the first movie. I can't think of another sequel that is so blatantly contradictory to the original (especially the sex of some characters and how they are all fulfilled). When I was little and watching it, I was quite confused and tortured. I felt the same look as an adult! <br /> <br /> The reason why a movie is really good (when you separate this first movie). I can't think of any other film that is meant for DEMON babies because it is wool! Now, for a moment, I have not said that the evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and Care Bears are good, I find it cool to have SUPREMELY EVIL BEING in the infant's movie. It's like the bizzare "Santa Clause vs Satan" movie in Mexico that you sometimes hear. Anyway, the demon's name is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the career tools in return for giving his special powers. A very dark baby for flick? And did I mention that Darkheart appears most often to a girl than a 10 year old boy? Freaky! In the meantime, there are some other children in the care facilities who take care of BABY CARE BEARS! Oh man! Demons and baby care bears SAMALIS MOVIE !!!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say, everything will be clear (but not until we see Darkheart trap the souls of Care Bears in this scary chandelere in a [surprisingly] deeply disturbing scene). But I have left the question of whether this film has found a cultural audience that it deserves so much. I can look at it myself again.
