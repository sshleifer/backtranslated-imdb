(No spoilers, just plot details) I don't understand this episode. Do you want to watch a small episode of Smallville? Look underground - now it's a home dish. Tom Welling gives a good result (I don't say it very often) and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he's most of the time. The alternative universe scenario seems to be quite realistic. Mars Manhunter, who previously appeared in "Static", returns and tells Clark that a doctor who is the leader of the crazy shelter, where they are being held, is actually a phantom, and when Clark wants to return to his universe, he must kill him. Overall great episode, with good functioning and decent pace.
