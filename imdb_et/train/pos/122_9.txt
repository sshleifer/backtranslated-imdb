I had started losing my faith in the latest events in a typical Hollywood movie. The story lines fail and the camera's work is simply copied from the last movie of a similar taste. But then I saw Zentropat (Europa) and my faith was renewed. The metaphorical story not only burns, but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you down the road and hits you on the Europa 1945. We have all seen hundreds of thousands of ways on the death screen, but the beauty of this movie is how it takes every slow moving moment that leads you to death. Unlike many movies, a knife is not cut after one second (for example) but forces you to look at the devastating but sensual beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can all do something other than what this movie is trying to say, but it's definitely worth the time to find out what that really means. I would like to talk to anyone who wants to send me an email about the film. Enjoy it!
