When a Christmas Eve returns from a shopping trip, the abused suburban housewife (Basinger) finds himself in a struggle for survival after the divergence with a criminal group of young people takes a violent course. <br /> <br /> Directly to the UK DVD, Susan Montford's director's debut may not be awarded. This is a shame because the standard of writing, directing and displaying is really very good, and it certainly surpasses your average quality directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives his best result for some time as a woman who has been abducted by her abusive husband (Craig Sheffer). Although Sheffer does not get more than a threatening presence, Basinger combines these short scenes - showing painful vulnerability, which, however, hints at the rage that ultimately contrasts with young people. It's a really big, underrated play, its transformation from victim to aggressor has been smoothly played. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas, who I was initially thinking of, was confusing because he (along with the other three youngsters) just didn't seem to be in much danger. However, if all four youngsters were physically more powerful, the later scenes where Basinger tables against them would not have worked at all. The fact that they are four middle-aged men, though somewhat loose, is the key to how the film works as well as it is. <br /> <br /> In addition to some other pace in the second half of the movie and here and there, there are a couple of cheesy lines we have here, a big thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the movie is over. Some may be opened by the slow burning of the scenes or the sudden end of the scenes. Others are sometimes brutal violence. I say I give him a chance, it's definitely more time than Saw V.
