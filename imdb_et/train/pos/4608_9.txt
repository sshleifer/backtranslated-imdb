Many film and martial arts fans consider Jackie Chan to be one of the greatest silver screensavers, and the police story confirmed his reputation as a successor to the late Bruce Lee. When he enters a dragon that fell under the so-called pink sign of Lee in the 1970s, the same can be said about the police story, and in the 80s, Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Forget about Rush Hour trilogy or any of its US efforts - one movie that really characterizes Chan's excellence, not to mention that he started his status as a big hit, as a bone-breaking kung-fu talisman, as well as his film career this is the police story - the first number of successful films, located in the continent, today in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I have seen many of his efforts - as well as the US-based Rush Hour, the Rumble in the Bronx, the Medalian and The Tuxedo, and, frankly, many of them pale negligible compared to the police story. In these films, we saw that Jackie had a less "fooled" version that couldn't get the best out of his fighting skills, let alone fight sequences that were not as good as those in such efforts as Drunk Meister, the name of Police. <br /> <br /> The stunts of this movie are extraordinary and are the best in all movies. The shopping center scene is literally unique and must be seen as believing: glass planes, Chan, who has been left outside the bus to travel only as a walking stick, crazy in the streets of the city, and Chan successfully used all sorts of lifeless objects and aids as a weapon to fight bad ones. Given that he is known to harm and break every bone in his body and cause himself to be harmed, Jackie's persistence, showing his versatility as a stuntman himself, not relying on one, is somewhat testament to his kung fu expert's reputation. Especially if he has impressions for you. So he has proved that he is not a one-time pony when he starts to develop and come out with different and smart moves. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is not much to discuss, but what this is not about the narrative, it forms its end-of-end action and combat sequences. As far as dialogue is concerned, this is not really a big aspect of the film, so most of the fans of Jackie and martial arts are more interested in the action than the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike saying Matrix, there are no wires or CGIs, no computer protection. What you see is what you get - and what you get with the Police Story is great Jackie Chan's epic, full of action and pulsating tricks. It's miles better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour, and all other American efforts. /> <br /> Police story is a great movie and one that I would definitely want for anyone who is a fan of the novice Jackie Chan, but who's not sure who to watch.
