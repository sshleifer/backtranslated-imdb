I just looked at Q. today and forgot how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that everything is right in the world. I love the clues to Mozart from the opening when "Einstein" played "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" playing a violin by Eming Kleine Nachtmusik during Ed Walters' IQ testing. I love being depicted as an intelligent woman and being encouraged to pursue a career, especially in the unique situation of the 1950s when this film is set. (I myself have been a teacher, but I stayed home to raise my children, so please don't think I'm a nice libber for women.) It's wonderful how a man who is just a "fat-free monkey" is finally seen as important and worthy as Catherine's groom, a clinical behavioral researcher. My message is that we do not do what we do, but who have defined us so much more - no labels. There are so many small gags and one liner that is almost thrown away if you don't look and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I made some things in the movie that aren't listed on the page. On Ed Walter's symposium, there are 3 instruments (stairs, ruler, etc.) hanging from the right side of the chalk. In the next camera with only 2, Tony Shaloub's character is Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti when he introduces and is listed here in Imdbis. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. In some evaluations, this may be a piece of fluff, but it has a lot more substance than many give credit to. Not just what big casting is put together here. Watch it and enjoy!
