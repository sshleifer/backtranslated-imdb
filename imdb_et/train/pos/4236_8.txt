Take this film about what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not epic like the original, it's a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's incredible. Everything else was just OK. <br /> <br /> What it is, I think the movie is fantastic, but I like everything Burton has done. People need to calm down and end the end of this film world. It shouldn't have been a remake and it is not. <br /> <br /> The end was cool. . I took it to a parallel universe.
