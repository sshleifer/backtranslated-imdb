Intelligent, nervous and exciting, "The Invisible Man" appeared in 2000 as part of Sci-Fi's usual composition, balancing the fantastic artistic direction of Farscape and sometimes the melodramatic script with sharp, cynical plots and modern tweet. The exhibition sat between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who", but there was no denial that "I-Man" characters were beyond the cartoon. Even characters that have been predicted, such as Keeper, Officer, and Eberts, returned the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventrescal were chemistry, which changed and shifted elegantly, made even bigger by the rotating door team of writers and directors. Effects should never kill a plot and science is sometimes incredible. The low points of the show are still fun and I've never seen such tense pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be praised and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD display. Every time I meet Sci-Fi "Hercules: Legendary Journeys" marathon, I roll my eyes and sighs, mourning the excitement of science-fantastic television and the possibility of "Invisible Man" and its expression being represented.
