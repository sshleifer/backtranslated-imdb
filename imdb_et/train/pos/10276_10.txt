Opening a movie with Bach Toccata is a phonetic hint of what opens up in this intense drama. All the film components, Bach, who have been interested in the interest and entertainment of their listener (and performer), are in this film. There is no mutual tendency between the two leaders and the last woman I feel he claimed to have been raped, even though his sacrifice feels he was warned that he is a victim. Momet examines the emotional gap and the differences between the genders, but I feel he has failed in how they give a healthy sense of humor when they greet each other. If Momet has ever developed a healthy humorous attitude between genders, I don't know how this work would have ended? Because it exists, it is very tough and average.
