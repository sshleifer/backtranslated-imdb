With the South Pacific, boys and dolls are for adults - it's dirty, sexy and full of men and women rushed. <br /> <br /> There is an energy and drive that makes it stand out from the pack - the strength of Jean Simmond's performance and the young Brando's charm, and the already masterful Sinatra adds a lot of feeling and appearance to the pieces. <br /> <br /> Boys and dolls win because it is shamefully what it is: MGM's musical. <br /> <br /> It is still good to watch and listen to great songs and dance numbers - it remains the classic of the nineteenth century cinema and will be seen with joy in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommended.
