Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) goes out of the reform school and goes back to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) is doing her best to keep her in trouble, but it just seems to follow her. In addition to his connection with the gang of Gates, Gabe is followed by real gangsters who have a scheme for collecting fires for accidental buildings. They need someone to blame and Gabe. The task of the termites is to work the law in their favor and give gangsters their desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene that introduces Dead End Kids is really pretty good. The boys go to the street to the new resident's furniture and continue on their own. They talk to each other about shameful accents and talk about drinking tea; Bernard Punsley is sitting in a chair. The boys continue to fight with the new boy, but after he has proven himself to be a good fighter, they ask him to join the club. <br /> <br /> The initiation scene is also pretty good, full of trouble, it seems dangerous first, but really pretty smart and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, as Billy Halop learns to be a boy's mayor, he has a dream of school work. It is a wonderfully staged children with small holograms who visit her and shoot her questions. and really tells what kids do. Being aware of bad behavior on and off the device, these guys make this movie nice. But instead of feeling unpleasant, it makes a big laugh. This is a preview of what many boys would have received in the Bowery Boys series. We even get some distorted words from Leo Gorcey.
