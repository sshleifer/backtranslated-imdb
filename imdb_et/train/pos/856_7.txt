The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan is the only entry price. He plays some sort of "James Bond's psycho twin brother", separated at birth. As an intense striker, his character is very sexual, but even better, very funny. Add a cheerful, uber-pleasing American "boy in the neighborhood" to create contrast: adjust the contrast: plenty of locations, bright colors and fast humor provide great entertainment. a woman, but the film's focus is on two companions, the new "odd couple", and that's the part that works very well. There is a big (probably R-rated) laugh and look for places where the story goes a little deeper.
