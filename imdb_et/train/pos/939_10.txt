Okay, here are a lot of comments I could add? <br /> <br /> I'm still trying. The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYthing. Sets, outdoor conditions, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. Music is sweet. Supporting casting is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and the nephew, played by Roger Rees. His undervalued sincerity touches and his voice is the sound of Christmas. David Warner is also a completely believable Bob Cratch. He is a difficult life, but he remains positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said that his imagination is too harsh. I could no longer agree. His exchanges at the beginning of the cold or the harsh were not characteristic. He is a terribly frustrated person to whom life and his own spirit have been left to heart. At the time of return, it is obvious that he is not all. Here we see that he has hope. If he had disappeared completely, his partner Marley would never have come. And after all, we are not counting on any of us. I think it's a huge part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge watches his dance with his employer at Belle, you see him smiling with a smile when he tells Belle that he's going through his life with a "smile on my face." Clive Donner was smart enough for the director to allow those moments on the film. Sometimes they remain on the floor of the editing room. <br /> <br /> And finally, his transformation is so joyful that I will cry tears of joy every time I see it. His apology to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so touching, is not only the spirit of Christmas, but also of humanity. The joy he brings to Fred for his wife is so obvious. And the line that reaches me every time, "God forgive me the time I have wasted." <br /> <br /> Bravi's pussy!
