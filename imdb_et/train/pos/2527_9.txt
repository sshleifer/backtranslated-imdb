That's what I call "pre-Sci Fi; Sci Fi." It is no better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good "mood" type movie. These two true artists are the best, as is the story. Karloff is doing an amazing job as a scientist who sees himself as a vanity, pride and scientific competition. I was caught up in the idea of ​​looking at a man when he dropped into the three above-mentioned concepts. I was sad and at the same time fascinated by two letters as they did. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that makes a remake. This time Harrison put Ford in the Karloff section and perhaps Kieffer Sutherland as a Bela Lagos. It can be almost as good. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best that Hollywood EVER produces. As I said, it doesn't improve. Not possible.
