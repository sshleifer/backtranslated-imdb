I liked watching Cliffhanger at first when a woman (Sarah) was full of fear when she slipped, I thought it was a scary scene because I think if you see you see, your nerves in your body will get to you because it makes you full of fear and your heart strikes faster. I liked to watch Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he is known as Rambo and Rocky.
