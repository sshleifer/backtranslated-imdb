I believe this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has done so far. This movie should have appeared to the public in theaters on the big screen. It's available on video, so make sure you're looking for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and scenario. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless. The masterpiece of the genre.
