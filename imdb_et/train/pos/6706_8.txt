I remember this show because it got on Saturday night for regular viewing. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a young girl who moves with her aunts who have found out to be witches and she's one. So Sabrina has to learn how to manage Mr.'s abilities and use them effectively. He also has to deal with a school that is a cruel rival, Libby, his best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle ... <br /> <br /> The show was funny and fun. It held Saturday evenings for entertainment for a 10-year-old boy. And made him laugh out loud ... And flirt with Libby.
