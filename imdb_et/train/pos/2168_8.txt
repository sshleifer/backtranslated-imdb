I saw this movie back on television late in the night, but it was a worrying experience that has remained so far. <br /> <br /> The premise may seem a bit unigeneral - an earthquake, a hidden ruin of a poisonous nerve agent's subterranean storehouse above a small town, and a microscopic amount of substance in your food. City dwellers are losing their ability to use the demarcation between every spiritual and the foundation that, from time to time, floods all our minds, and that we usually know that we simply must not act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is slow, but for me it only adds to the grieving anxiety, as the behavior of the townspeople begins to break slowly. There are a number of surreal and very disturbing scenes that have always been in memory all the time. <br /> <br /> This raises interesting questions about what we can all do if we give our most forested instincts. Did I enjoy it? I'm not sure that "enjoy" is the right word. Did it make me think? Certainly. I still mean it. Scary stuff.
