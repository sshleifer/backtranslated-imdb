This is a film that heals every time I see it. There are so many nuances. William Tracey, like Pepi, is a joy that brings sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas is the only "villian" of the film and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan, is a cheerful title shop owner, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar way is well used here. I especially liked Felix Bressart, like Pirovitch. Very credible in all aspects of your role. This movie, however, belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented from its perspective, and the action revolves around it. Mr Stewart is more than a film-carrying task, with an amazing effect that uses many emotions. Just look at Stewart when he has fired his job. He is able to convey the traumatic shock, anger, fear and embarrassment of the event. In my opinion, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest filmmaker in media history. There is no one else who has ever been caught up in the film, which would be able to listen so fully to what it feels. At the time he made this movie, he still had a big part of his career, but he is the master of his ship. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts' best films and one of the most enjoyable and enjoyable romantic comedies. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
