Stylishly targeted, picturesque and excellent? Crosby's interpretation seems exactly right, Hardwick has its best role, while Bendix also has treatment? this Yankee complaint is universal and irresistible. One of the main pleasures of the film is, of course, songs. As can be expected, Bing has a good voice. And even though the Hardwicke solo has been cut, we still hear her heartedly when she dances happily with Crosby and Bendix in her famous "Busy Doing Nothing". It is also a coffee to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, while enjoying a wide-ranging performance and a career as a singer, rarely had the chance to listen to the cinema. She is a beautiful voice that is more than suited to her delightful look and looks very much in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes. <br /> <br /> Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his budget using all the resources at his disposal to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Maybe the tint is too small, but who complains?) <br /> <br /> In short, as the trailer actually describes, entertainment is a joy from beginning to end.
