La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic Spanish film. Everything that happens in this film has a symbolic meaning. This is completely different from the usual movie that is accessible. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, but it is only good for people who want to search for the meaning of a movie story. I need advice that this is not a sample movie. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy !!!
