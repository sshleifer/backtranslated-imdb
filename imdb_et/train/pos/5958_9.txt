Unlike some comments, the mine is positive. This film surrounds the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like. Some of them are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not the same, dissatisfied with everything and everything, the type of life - much like real life. Some story lines do not develop, they just happen. But like real families and good friends, they stay together. Such parents who buy a child are such holes! You are a happy ending. Poor Delmar is stuck between a stone and a stone that takes care of itself, mother, son and tries to keep all his life together. It does not stop at the sunset or the house and everyone lives in the dream world, but is a very real life that depicts people who live every day, month and month. Generally it is a good story and a great movie !!
