I think people appreciate this incredible movie. People see it as a typical horror film that has made us scare and prevent us from falling asleep. Whatever he was trying to do would have earned 1/10, but I watched this movie with some friends and we found it very fun, and although it was a good movie, he has Stephanie Beaton. That's why I think it deserves a movie for pure entertainment 10/10. <br /> <br /> The general view of this movie is that it has poor performance, a simple script that can be 10 years old and can not be taken seriously, and people therefore consider it low. But I see it as an entertaining masterpiece with a funly funny script that is even more entertaining for the actors, and although not very serious, it's a lot of fun.
