Children - regardless of age - do not want to know about their parents' lives. And adult children are often seriously confused and confused by any evidence that older parents have active libido. Finally, many members are very uncomfortable looking at a foolish, frumpy widow who would go unnoticed almost everywhere to discover her aching ability and need for raw passion with a man half his age. <br /> <br /> "Mother" is a provocative gaze on hardly filmed reality - a woman who is not ready to stay at home, watch TV, and plant her husband after nearly thirty, and a controlling, dominant chap pack it into a massive heart attack. <br /> <br /> Mai (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each of whom does not work on their way. The man's son lives with a beautiful woman who can lead him to the bankruptcy court with his extravagant business. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) is a teacher who has aspirations as a writer. She is attractive, not beautiful, and she seems to have a close relationship with her mother - at first. <br /> <br /> Returning to your house after burying your spouse decides you won't stay there. Rejection of a typical widowhood with the legacy of dull days and without adventure goes to Paula, who has a young son. Paula's boy, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a harshly beautiful contractor who seems to have taken a terribly long time to complete May's son's house. May is a pretty hard drink, coke-sniffing with Darren, whose treatment by Paula should have been reported to be a member of the Royal Royal Cards scholarship. <br /> <br /> Next, Darren and the descendant and now bubbly living (dare to say born again) stupid dumb. The scenes of love are graphic, but the second is the amateur artist Mayi's pencils and ink sketches, which then play a role in a relaxing drama (or attack, take your pick). <br /> <br /> The theater in Manhattan was packed early in the afternoon, showing more than half of the audience in May. The fact that some were shocked or disturbed to see that his own erotic abandonment is in the hands of a much younger person is underestimated. <br /> <br /> This glaringly honest look at an older woman's aroused passion for decades conscientiously at her husband's desire to stay at home and raise children (she also mentions she doesn't like having friends, man) surfaces many questions. Although the drainage of May with Darren is not an incest, there are real psychological dimensions and issues, the mother's daughter's daughter's lover. And Paula hasn't made a stout since the beginning. The thing that is published is the relationship between the mother and the daughter, which, from Paula's point of view, leaves something to be desired. Mrs Bradshaw is a wonderful daughter who wants her mother's support and her love - she has not been a terrible hand in life, but it is not a bed of roses. <br /> <br Mai can rest assured that he recognizes both his sexuality and looks, indeed the demand, the future of happiness. But he is also inevitably vulnerable. He is trying in unknown emotional waters. Who controls your relationship with Darren and why it's hard to understand is less resolved. In his sixties he is still going on. <br /> <br /> "Something Gotta Give" has recently shown mature sexuality, but amusingly antiseptic that no viewer would be confused. After all, it is Jack Nicholson and always the beautiful Diane Keaton, who enriches the rich world. To ensure that serious psychosocial problems are investigated, Keaton's young girlfriend, Amanda Peet, Keaton's daughter, not only blessed the game, but ensures that the audience knows she and her old (dependent) lover are never in the bag. <br /> <br /> It's not easy here. Inspired by Anne Reid, some inconvenience is being forced upon others. His naked body breaks for sexuality for some and seems absurd as an object of physical attractiveness to others (viewers' comments left today reflect all of these views). <br /> <br /> Tissue and empathy for director Roger Michell to solve exciting problems. <br /> <br /> 9/10
