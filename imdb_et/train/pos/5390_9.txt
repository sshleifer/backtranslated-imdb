Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code film featuring some of the best. It is located in the hospital's maternity department, especially in the room of women who are likely to have problems. It has an older woman, a harsh, unwanted mother (Glenda Farrell), a weak young woman, an Italian woman and a main character (Loretta Young) who spends 20 years in jail for murder. His wife (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second pain to find out that everything is fine. Aline MacMahone plays a sister who is great in her work. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and fun. It is in no way terribly shocking, but it is interesting to see such an unnoticed object on a silver screen. Action is great everywhere. Loretta Young is beautiful here in her prime. Eric Linden goes out and is sincere. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great, as always, for precursors and good reasons.
