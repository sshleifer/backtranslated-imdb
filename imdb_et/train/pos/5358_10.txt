This is one of my great films from the 1980s, which I always mean. <br /> <br /> Running Man is one of Arnold's best and most diverse films even today, and when I first saw Running Man, I was so excited to see such a movie. I just adore all the struggles and it's really a special movie. There are also Jesse Ventura, legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. killed in films such as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and more. All Arnold fans should love this movie from beginning to end, because its activities are packed, filled and one of Arnold's finest.
