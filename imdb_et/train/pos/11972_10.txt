I grew up, watching Full House as a baby. I stopped it for years, but about two weeks ago I started to look again. Now my children are watching the exhibition and love to watch it. My kids can't believe DJs, shows and I are the same age. <br /> <br /> I really show it because it is an exhibition you can see with your family. It has good teachings that your children can learn. There's also no drugs or violence there. Even if children have a problem with the show, they can always open their family for help. This is the message children should receive on TV now, turn to your family for help, not drugs. Children should look at more examples like Full House, not half of the confusion on television in the days. <br /> <br /> I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is on earth. It talks about real problems and family matters. There is always a lesson you can learn from the exhibition. <br /> <br /> I am voting for the show at 10.
