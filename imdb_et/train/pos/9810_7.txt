Albuquerque is a film that has all the western elements of Class A except one: a story that actually belongs to Class B or C. It was acceptable at the time the film was made when people were so excited to see the western color, but nowadays it's just very primitive. Nonetheless, for people who enjoy the old west, it is fun, the original color and sound are very well kept on the DVD that recently came out. Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick, Lon Chaney is always average and Randolph Scott is a little bit happier than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque, you hope to see something that reminds you of the city, but the city shown here can be just everywhere.
