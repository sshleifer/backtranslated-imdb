I was watching this movie for several days in this summer, the final result was just two scenes in the movie. The location was in Sylvan Lake Black Hills. Moving the wagon, stopping the wagon, etc. So this Dakota youth is looking forward to seeing the film and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was killed so that the shooting scenes were real. (Yes, Doris, the animals were injured while filming) I think Jack Nicholson copied the end of Shining? Great 50s West / Social Comment. It should be in the same class as High Noon for real Western drama or used as a social statement such as Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause for 50-year-olds.
