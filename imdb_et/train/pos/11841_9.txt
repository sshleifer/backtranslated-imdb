It was a good story for a good movie. My kids (10, 7, 5, and 4) loved this movie, too. The music was also fantastic. No, the horses are not talking, but the story is spoken by the Spirit. And hear the story the horse has spoken when the view was fun. <br /> <br /> I think the title says everything, "spirit". This film really gives a feeling of family and home and friends. I have to say that this 4-year-old boy and 5-year-old girl really touched this movie and even got into it, they laughed so hard and were fun for the spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "Spirit" with your family and let your spirit raise this heart-warming story. Your kids love it. I think you too.
