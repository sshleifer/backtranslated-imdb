Ah, I loved this movie. I think it was all. It made me laugh more than ten times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I'm writing this from a girl's point of view. I think it is a shame if he only appreciated 5.2. Too many boys are voting? It was much more than other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman, I don't enjoy all the stylish cinemas, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be low and not as funny as they should have been. But, as I said, this movie was almost everything in my opinion. Great script, good lump liners, exquisite action. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character reminded a lot of Gabrielle about Desperate Housewives, but what? It was fantastic. I keep this movie on rainy days, days when I feel low and need a few laughs.
