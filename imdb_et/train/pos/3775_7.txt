My take: silly, but imaginative confusion. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter will return as two more punk-rock idiots with the adventure comedy BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now a cult classic. In this order, Bill and Ted are given much more to do than to travel over time. They can also travel in Heaven and Hell! At the beginning of this stage, Bill and Ted are preparing for a "band battle" that can make them more famous than ever. At the same time, for years, the futuristic civilization has been working with the first film timer (always watched by George Carlin) that praises Bill and Ted. There's the evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, HUNT FOR RED October) plots to get rid of two idiot rock stars once and for all. So he sends two identical android copies (according to Bill and Ted: Robot Us) to do dirty work. <br /> <br /> From there Bill and Ted will die and have to find through hell, the inhabitants who get into the worst memories of the duo, and then into the sky to try to save their girlfriends on earth ... and their exhibition. While traveling alongside, they play board games that have no other death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), which resembles a similar moment in the 1957 classic SEVENTH SEAL, helping some intelligent aliens and more. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY has many surprising special effects tricks that are not modern, and even some of the humor and time and appearance are somewhat dated (until frankly, it seems that the film will also appear during the wrong year, even in the 90s But this is not a lack of imagination and a lively move by both performances and direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative, and yes, fake. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
