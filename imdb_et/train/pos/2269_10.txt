I've just read the novel "Mother's Evening" recently, I've had a DVD for a while and I watch it so often. Few movies that I have and what I've seen have been thinking about me and asking as much as it is on my mother's night, I'm surprised not only by Vonneguti's shine, but also by the translation of text. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or watch this video with VHS, it must be on a DVD and accompanied by a director's commentary on the movie. To see how they took a fairly simple story but complicated their content and dialogue and did it so well, I believe that every viewer is surprised. <br /> <br /> The film has few drawbacks. the text doesn't hurt that much, the movie can be a book, and it's the best adaptation I've ever seen. I recommend both the book and the movie so that the service just says to watch it. <br /> <br /> It will change you when you do.
