I went to this movie cast and the team show was my friend whom the producer's film called me. Forget what you've seen in advertising, forget what you've heard, watch this movie yourself. I was surprised at it. In The Grinch's World, Charlies Angels, Day 6, unbreakable, there's a movie that's worth your hard-earned bucks! Beautiful scenes, wonderful cinema and cast what you want to eat with your heart. I found this to be one of the most organized Christmas movies and minds in the past years. Robert Deniro deserves oscar. If you could get an oscar for everyone involved in the package, this would be a movie.
