It's just 2 episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can already say it's one of the best things I've ever seen. It is on TV, silver screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so good that it's almost demoralizing! As a spectator, it's so much fun that I'm annoyed that the episodes are over two weeks, not Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negatives are actually positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern man who has gone over TV commercials before. Compared to movies, it seemed that television was always dated, quite annoying and well, generally boring! "Five Days" has indeed brought the 21st century into a television drama, so for me it has changed. Look at it.
