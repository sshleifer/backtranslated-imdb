This is Jackie Chan's best film and my personal favorite. After the disappointing US, James The Protector led by James Glickenhaus took the Jackie concept and made it hit Hong Kong. This is probably Jackies' most violent film, the audience slipping during fractures. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his team made the most of their struggle. The bones were broken and the blood flowed through the process of making the film, as you can see from the credit. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple police and robber thing, something special, after it was rewritten by action. I have to say that the English version has some dynamic copying, but it shouldn't put you too much. <br /> <br /> So take the guys around, open the beer and enjoy. By the way, the film was nicknamed "Glass Story" by the stunt team. Why? I'll let you know!
