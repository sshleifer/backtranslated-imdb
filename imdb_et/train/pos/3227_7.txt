Kurt Russell is a strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action thrill from Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Yellow plays like Rambo and Shane on a garbage-dump planet. the character of the title, the "obsolete" genetic soldier who was dead. Supportive casting of colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and surprisingly scary Michael Chiklis, is capable. They spend most of the movie that scares Russell and the rest of it is alive. Russell's performance here is one of the best he has ever given. Almost without words, he expresses emotions, feelings and meanings with a look and feel. It's almost mime's performance. When action moves the gear, it strikes the ass - and does it with a strong, silent and factual journey. There are mistakes. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "boss" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a big impression of Frank Burns M * A * S * H ​​as a disgraceful officer and Gary Busey pulls the gut (and almost hits his belt) as Todd's mentor. It is an underrated and excellent sci-fi flick and recommended for anyone wishing to visit Blade Runner universe a second time - David Webb Peoples wrote both scenarios.
