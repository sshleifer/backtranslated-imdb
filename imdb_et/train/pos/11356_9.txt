This is a great movie. There are a lot of things: between the killer of the serum, the bureaucracy of the Soviet Russia, the ride of one man and the man (the leading detective) and his boss. <br /> <br /> What is most relevant to me is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (apologize for the bad spell, please!). For some reason it moves to see their development of hostility and offenses, paying tribute and cameraderie and working together. One line of the film is for me: "He would say something wisely, but he is emotionally capable." <br /> <br /> A great part of all the pains, even the smallest parts were made with credibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast paced thriller; it actually moves slowly like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfied and not exploitative about crimes at all. <br /> <br />
