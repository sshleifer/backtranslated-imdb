This movie has been on my wish list for ten years and I recently found it on a DVD when my partner's granddaughter was given her. He looked at it and was excited to know that it was for my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939, and he wanted to know more about it - and me. Fortunately, I borrowed it from him and looked at it independently and I shouted at it. This includes not only the emotions, class distinctions, hardships and warmth of interpersonal relationships (also cruelty (spoken and unspoken) of these years, but it was accurate! Anderson's shelter and WVS canteens brought it back. The difference between a relatively untouched life in the village and a war-torn London was suddenly abandoned, I lived again in 1939/40 and my evacuation from London with this production! Naturally, he is not expected to have more than this exact detail, but it went far beyond the exact presentation of the facts and touched on deep chords of people's answers and the only semi-precious values ​​of those years. This is a great movie and me l have already ordered a few copies to send to friends.
