My family and I have often watched this movie over the years. It is clean, healthy, heartbreaking and cordial. We show our sympathy between the two families of the thousands of miles between the two countries, and the most unpleasant coincidences, that is almost like God's intervention. <br /> <br /> 5 yo Jodelle Micah Ferland, who plays Desi, who is a little girl with a heart, does a great job to act, and for me she was a prime choice for leadership. <br /> <br /> Overall, 10 out of 10. this sweet human story. Children of all ages start tearfully, then look at it happily, and it brings the family with smiles and good feelings.
