When I first saw this movie in London in 1958, I was bowed. I've never seen such a movie before. It had a strange, hypnotic effect, unlike the films he had seen before, and it continued to have a lasting effect. <br /> <br /> I believe Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. Certainly, the interaction is amazing because it is capable of influencing the viewer. <br /> <br /> When it is converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I would like to hear it and buy it.
