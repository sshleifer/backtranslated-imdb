I always have a little mistrust before watching British films, because I usually found them with a useless and boring scenario (such as Vanity Fair or The Boleyn Girl), but with excellent product development, European landscapes and those thick British accents that make movies an artistic value that they really do not. Luckily, the great movie The Young Victoria doesn't belong to this situation and it deserves an enthusiastic suggestion of its interesting story, excellent performances by Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and costumes and locations that unexpectedly make the movie look rich. And I say "unexpectedly" because they usually don't pay too much attention to these details. <br /> <br /> "The Victorian era" was one of the key points of modern civilization (in my humble opinion), not only from a social point of view, but also from a scientific, artistic and cultural point of view. I honestly did not know very much about the beginning of this era, and maybe that's why I enjoyed the simplification of political and economic events that made so many landings of modern times. I also liked how Queen Victoria is depicted, a young and intelligent monarch, whose decisions were not always good, but they were at least inspired by good intentions. I also found a very interesting representation of the romance of Victoria and Prince Albert, because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects and emotional emotions. The only failure I found about this movie is that Julian Fellowes, a screenwriter, used a love story with some romantic cinema clich√©s that look a little out of her scenario. <br /> <br /> I liked Young Victoria, and I took a very nice surprise with it. I hope more movies follow the example of this movie: costumes and landscapes should work to support an interesting story, not its replacement.
