Like his earlier film "In the Glass Cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than his predecessor. This is one of the visually executed and haunting images that you could ever see. Increased drama, intensity, and the undertone of violence threaten melodramatic or distant, but never move into it. In this way, it draws an almost impossible task: to be both up and down so painfully as to be so charged and so underestimated, and even the finals of explosives are virtuoso festivities. Unabashed, gorgeous and very tense ... this movie is just great!
