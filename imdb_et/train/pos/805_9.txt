The "return of Jedi" is often remembered for what he did wrong, not for what he did right, and it is a shame because the last chronological part of the Star Wars Saga is a shining example of epic narration. It succeeds in consolidating one big finale into the rows of songs in all previous films and doing it very convincingly. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is Ewoks - the cute and cuddly bear that allegedly served the Star Wars demographic expansion - and in the middle the film tends to slow down a bit. But the last hour is undoubtedly the best piece in the whole saga, with Luke finally coming to Darth Vader, the most well-known villain in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Returning Jedi did so many things that people tend to forget: it gave an amazing conclusion to the story of Darth Vader (which was somewhat unlikely from "Empire Strikes Back" very convincingly here), an exciting opening in the Jabba Palace, Ian McDiarmidi a masterful presentation as the Emperor, Luke finally reached him, Solo and Find Romance and the extremely powerful moments of the Endor moon. <br /> <br /> Yeah, there are little annoyances. But they are generations of annoyances that have had time to nip every scene. It is still a magical and moving cinema, which is also a great last chapter. It's not a "good" movie - it's awesome!
