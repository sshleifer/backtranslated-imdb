I'm a fairly pedestrian with some down. However, I occasionally try to raise my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my experiments. I was scary in front of the whole movie. I liked it so much that I got my tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking film. I saw this on a big question to the viewer: what is the duty of victimization, which can be accepted, asked to accept? Of course, as a military member, this is an important issue for me. This question strongly contemplates the viewer of this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
