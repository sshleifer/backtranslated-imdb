I found this movie to be very funny, I loved the way this modern sports policy did. This movie is not as funny as South Park, but it's pretty funny. And since I'm a sports fan, I loved how they entertained some of the most ridiculous things in sports. This film is also great for non-sports lovers, probably better for them, because they have to live in thinking about why people follow sport in brackets, and there are so many crazy rules and complexities for sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found that the real game they came up with was interesting, like a horse with bases and psychic squares (for taking pictures of a person). In general, I suggest you see this movie and believe that you will eventually love this movie. But if this comedy style is not your favorite, you probably don't like it. (but it's for every comedy movie)
