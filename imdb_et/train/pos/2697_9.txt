There is nothing revolutionary here; GARDE A VUE is almost exclusively limited to the drab police station and mostly to one interrogation room, but directed by Claude Miller (who made this great film THIS SWEET SICKNESS). others) shaded images of outer tables in intercalators as a minimalist locale scenario. Miller's pulling power, especially early on, is breathtaking, and the sophisticated scene of the interior, as a result of its fine interior design, makes for an enchanting look. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is great, as usual, to legitimize the character with a clich√© on the paper: a laconic, nose, tired, detective of the world. Ventura lives in this role, making it completely believable, although the script allows us little access to our internal work; the film ends when it seems that it is forced to face its failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault is the equivalent of a suspect child killer who scares a single meaningful flick. The exchange of these two is often a more tense and constantly metamorphic aura of space, a battle of thought. Serraulti's character is repeatedly regrettably naughty and insidious and ruthless; then later .... <br /> <br /> The GARDE A VUE "message", if one should look for one, is condemning the police methodology and the pressure that makes the police arrogant. if necessary, terminate cases at the expense of justice. Most of its length, although the film shines more than just an example of how to turn a potentially complex scenario into an extremely dramatic drama of the cinematic economy. <br /> <br />
