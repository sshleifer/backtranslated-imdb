I found this film to be fascinating from the outset - like the Spielberg movie - and found the plot to be interesting because I was trying to find out what the real situation was. <br /> <br /> Beginning - before opening credit - the action begins with a break immediately. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are very nice. (I'm having trouble with any Baldwins because Alec's curriculum is political, but William wasn't too bad in this film.) There were several very unexpected turns that helped bring pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in many places where the soundtrack had annoying high-level sound - something like 19K Hz. I suspect that the microphone took video monitors on the device.
