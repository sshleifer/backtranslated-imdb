Another quiet love triangle film Hitchcock, no secret, but very English, very well paced and captured. Soft Boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits Circus Boxer "One Round" by Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his sparring partner, partly to keep up with the real but terrible Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis). At Jack and Mabel's wedding, the verger standing in the church passage has registered a shock to a very tall and very short man, a fat lady, connected in the eyes of twins, of course, claiming what aisle to sit on, and the wedding party is fun. On the rest of the movie Jack has lost Mabel and beat his way back to his heart or something. It was another era in which the pub's dress and boxers dressed out the ring. Camera corners, tempo, use of symbols, cutting all very stylish and masterful. Editing the camera work and the last boxing game is very exciting. Brisson's good prospect is well used in it; his smile is not as attentive as he is in Hitchcock's Manxman and is not annoying. But do boxers have such needles?
