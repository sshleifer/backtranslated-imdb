Though I think this film would be rapi as an anti-Vietnamese, it did not see that such a case would be as much as the film was just an honest look at the perspective of the young boys who had war so that the public did not support. it showed their fear, despair, their ride ... all, open, naked. Like a soldier himself, I felt a lot of issues in my experience in the military - especially in the boot camp. All this film, even though it was made with a very small budget, looks good, is very well assembled and offers great performance and control. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for another great film by Colin Farrell. 10/10
