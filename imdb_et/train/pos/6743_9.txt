Dana Andrews is one of those actors I probably saw in a dozen movies, but who has never really registered me. He is often confident, quiet, playing similar roles and somewhat undervalued Glenn Ford, an actor who takes some effort to really appreciate; but if you hit the right movie .... <br /> <br /> And that's it. Preminger's look at the New York subfloor is just as dirty and poor as almost every 50-year-old man, and Andrews is an element too tough Mark Mark Dixon who just doesn't know how to play to go on: he hates criminals too much to always play with the rules. At the beginning of the movie, he accidentally kills a murder witness who is involved in an illegal mess game that Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the movie to cover his involvement and bring mobster his "justice". Along the way, where he participates in a stranger married to a killed man (Gene Tierney), he must also try to get his father out of the hook for murder. <br /> <br /> Joseph LaShelle was amazingly photographed with a hard and sparkling dialogue with Ben Hecht and a really powerful ending with tragedy elements and found just a few minutes or two, one more age and may still be my favorite Preminger film. good if Laura.
