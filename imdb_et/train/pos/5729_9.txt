This is a bit of a puzzle for many artistic Lynch crowds. They try to write it down as a meaningless, raw material for the Lynch project. As it is, Lynch moves between his actual cinematic art. Well, it may be a peak, but one of those intriguing farts you are trying to do and what you feel you enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dumbland, distilled from it, is an art. What you can do with the aspects of modern life, but laugh. If you took it seriously, the nuts would go. You grab it, smells, tastes, feel embarrassed, unreasonable stupidities, and then express it in any chosen media. This is art, and art is not stupid. But that's Dumbland.
