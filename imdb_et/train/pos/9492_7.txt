This movie was enjoyable, but for the wrong reasons. Co-ordination of sequences is ridiculous and makes the movie a funny moment. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a catchy scene near the end, where Williamson Gintyle says, "You're sure you'll get a girlfriend!" I enjoyed this movie only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the style that has to be written on the back of the napkin in four rows and the rest ad-libbed most likely. Over 30 parts of the film have only a 10-fold credit list. It seems strange that no one has a credit in the movie, maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look. One thing this film does is that it is quite violent, so that the movie, which is worth seeing, triples with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty.
