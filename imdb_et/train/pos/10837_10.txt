As an aging rocker, heep and quo - my two favorite bands - are mentioned, but the incredible cast (everyone) - and the fantastic story - I like this creative genius. I can't recommend it more - and Mick Jones added so much (alien leader and primary songwriter with the biggest rock singer Lou Gram) - I watched this great job more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - what voice - and Jimmy nail - talent oozes from every pore - Then Astrid .... and Karen ..... what else could an aging rock ask! 10/10 - bloody brilliant. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, West Oz, originally from England, Windsor.
