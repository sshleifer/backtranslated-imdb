Both my friend and I thought this movie was well done. We waited for a light-hearted comedy, but we got an inflatable action film with comic breeds. Both thought that the film might not work as well in the box as the previews believe it was comedy. I was impressed by the supporters and, of course, Dave Morse is always doing a terrible job. Most of the painful supporters are veterans who are not the first timers and they were strong. We both felt that writing and direction were first-rate and commented on buying this movie. If you don't buy it, rent it out in time.
