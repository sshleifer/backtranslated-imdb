"Ship Ahoy" was probably made to show MGM talent. The film is a fun trip to the sea, which is on the way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at a time when the country was involved in World War II. It was a typical price for studio centers, which gave the film entertainment in public entertainment, which was disturbing during the difficult times when the country lived. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Eleanor Powell will see in her best musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer. Red Skelton is also seen in the direct part, where there is not too much clowning, because he is catching a beautiful Mrs. Powell on a ship that takes them to Puerto Rico. Irresistible Bert Lahr has good chances in the film to show that he was a funny man. Also, Virginia Gray is a fun girl whom no one deceives. <br /> <br /> With Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, there are good musical numbers, including the amazing Buddy Rich, who has some solos with Mr Dorsey and Mrs Powell. Young Frank Sinatra also seems to be a band singer supported by Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic journey that should be enjoyed by fans of the genre that MGM completely controlled.
