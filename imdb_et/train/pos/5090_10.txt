I loved this movie. Great story and actors and good movie sets. It told the story so I can easily understand and pay attention without falling asleep. I would like to know where I got the soundtrack. I can't find it anywhere. Please send me an email if you know where I can get the soundtrack. Other than finding a soundtrack, I thought the film was exciting. Swayze did a great job. I think it's some of his best work. His past films were OK, but it really talked about change. It goes down in history because it is one of the best TV channels ever woken up. Congratulations to producers and writers of such a great job.
