From the sky, a meteor falls, waking up a plate-saw that long used a terrorist attack around Lake Krater. Because the monster eats local people, they try to get out of the monster of killing. <br /> <br /> Recent attempts to send old horror and horror films, such as the missing Cadavra skeleton and alien passage, are somewhat controversial when films such as Crater Lake Monster are available for screening. This is a movie that these films are attacking and just sending it is the real thing. Everything that these movies are trying to be just a cheek with a tongue and so much more fun. It is a true history movie that had unhappy luck just when Star Wars changed the way we look at the special effects. A monster, a combination of stop motion and life size, is a charming delightful little beast. The filmmakers violate the public monster and its chaos. Of course, it's clear that it's all fake, but isn't there any incredible stopping of movies? In fact, I think it's really cool monsters, what it is. <br /> <br /> I like this movie with a low budget. If you want a real authentic ride in a monster movie, look beyond. It would be ideal for a double or triple function with similar lake monsters (Boggy Creek, etc.).
