I'm surprised that we can even see this old movie by saying one thing. We usually don't get good opera films and here is a real great opera game. Of course, the images are not large. It's dated. But if the opera is not guilty; and I'm an opera song. I can't even detect one lips synchronization; if we didn't know it was Tebald's sound, there was nothing to convince it to be Sophia Loren. He does everything proudly! Her dark makeup is good; and he played a role in a great life! The rest is great, as is this stunning ballet group. Most participants are excellent; Loren is truly wonderful. His rival in Amner is also terrible. Who does not care for this 1953 work is shameful. Verdi would have enjoyed it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi is behind Aida behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
