So often with the adaptations of Stephen King, you just get a collection of characters that talk about the Book Dialogue. It really pulls the heart of the book. Perhaps because they do not use a large piece of books directly from the book, but it is a bit more of a story about improving events. Miko Hughes as a Baby Gage is a big part of this success. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really act like his parents. There's a scene where Louis shouts Gage and they're very natural together. Fred Gwynne is great. She nails Maine's accent perfectly without going to the parody and is smart and warm as Jud should be. (8 out of 10)
