I have to say that I really had no idea I was going to sit and watch this movie. I think that was the fact that I have nothing better to do with the class. But once in the television movie my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt is on my eye. I wasn't really his fan before this movie. I liked Twister and as good as it gets. But something for this movie really did for me. I see myself as a huge fan now. From this movie ... there are high marks on me. Give her a chance, it won't let you down.
