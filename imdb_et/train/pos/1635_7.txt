Back in their high schools in Salina Kansas, they filmed on-site "The Weinberg's Brave Young Men" and the film teams were quite prominent for weeks. Finally we learned that the film was "Academy" and was a bit ummm, "lower eyebrow" than we had believed. <br /> <br /> I had to see it because I was there, and the local audience seemed less satisfied with the show. I was 17 years old and thought it was a rather artificial experiment in the post "Animal House" -type comedy, just up to jokes. <br /> <br /> I looked at it several times, and my opinion is a bit softened. it's stupid, but sometimes he's a little bit of "mad" magazine humor, at least as much as "Mad TV". Ron Liebman may hate it, but he is almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment would have been a short scene on the Santa Fe avenue where I had parked my car when I bought some guitar strings. Too bad that my Pinto's short look usually seems to be cut off on a TV. has not seen a new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they are on sale.
