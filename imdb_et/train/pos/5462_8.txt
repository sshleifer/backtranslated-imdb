First of all, if you are planning to look at it, be sure to follow the UNCUT version (although it's very interesting to go back and then look at the scenes reflected by censorship), it makes a huge difference. This film is a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who has been forced by her father to prostitution since the age of 14. When his father suddenly leaves, he is able to go alone in the world. After reading the philosophy of Nietzsche's life, he uses his sexuality to manipulate men to give him what he wants and to leave those ruins and despair for his love. Throughout the film, he becomes more materialistic and manipulative, and the audience starts wondering if he has any moral feeling at all. In general, Baby Face is a very shocking film of blatant scenes of sexuality that most people do not want to see in black and white. Although there is no explicit sexual activity on the screen, it is very clear what happens to the camera. , especially for the shock value of films. When I was looking at it, I thought that this pace seemed a bit slow in some, but I think for the first time for most movies. In fact, I think that almost all films made in the early 1930s had some problems with little momentum, or some parts just didn't go right. That was probably the fact that film production wasn't quite perfect yet? it only takes a few years. Compare the film of 1939 and compare it with the film of the early 1930s and I think you can see what I mean. this is really a big difference. All John Wayne fans are also surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous for his insecure role.
