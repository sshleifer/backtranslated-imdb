Well, I disagree with the other comments. Piedras is much better for those Magnolia or any other film mentioned. <br /> <br /> I think someone just wrote it just because he didn't live in Spanish society, as I did (and I'm not Spanish) is a real character with characters that is very well done in one of Spain best actress Antonia San Juan. movie, well with our different societies, personally I don't like American contemporary movies much (I like classic and some Andy American movies, but they are very few). <br /> <br /> Whether a movie is a constant constitutional person who likes it or not, we make all the mistakes, but some may find out about the mistakes.
