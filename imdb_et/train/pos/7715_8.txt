First of all, find this movie almost fifty years old! Yet it still remains an amazing movie of all time. Interestingly, how much of today's modern celluloid production will be spoken in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple but strong enough and the consequences are nothing phenomenal. I still remember the first time I watched it, when a monster enters the ship's defensive powerfield and you have to see that first and only time. Would I be scared of being able to tell you. It seems today, but still effective enough. <br /> <br /> Scene scenes now show their age. You see the contour where the tiger was framed with Altaira, but they are simply visible. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the effect that the creature melts its way through Krell's doors is wonderfully done. br /> <br /> It is also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (which is better remembered for airplanes and naked weapons) as young, but still mature. He was 30 when this movie came! Almost 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all, there is a good movie that is definitely a favorite for years to come. Timeless.
