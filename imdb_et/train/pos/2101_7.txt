Forget Neo and Bourne, and all those who were baked consisted of modern heroes. They only look at 12-year-olds to recommend a large audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Because they can't be Rambo or McClane, or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood promised to allow a lot of fakes that don't have beard and fill teens to see something that looks like friction. <br /> <br /> "action sets" are just a painful look and every girl can challenge their masculinity. This explains how our silver screens have become obsolete in recent years. Better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane wins ... wasn't a bearer!) <br /> <br /> I have a new time when a new hero stepped up and put end their rule. This "Largo Winch" movie is far from perfect and perhaps from time to time too predictable, but at least Tomer Sisley gave a very promising performance as a horse. And the only time he was weakened was when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest in my case. <br /> <br /> I didn't know when I entered the theater hall, but it can be a movie I've been waiting for ten years. For the first time in France, Belmondo, after the film, can be so well-designed and well-established in the B-genre that it doesn't work. In the meantime, all we had to chew, was a giant pile of manure or something that was too limited to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, I mean to you) .. I believe that "Largo winch" is both popular and high quality filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I was very happy with the theater and hungry more.
