I watch this movie all the time. I watched it between a 3-87-year-old family and everyone; They all loved it. It really shows the true scene that the dog has, and the love and loyalty from the pet. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's nice to love comedy movies, tiny movies, or even pets. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, the animals are remarkable, the scenes are truly thoughtful and the characters are perfect. I liked the characters being real and nicely blended: Shadow (oldest, golden retriever) He's a wise man, filled with the wisdom and mindset of every dog, Chance (American bulldog) is basically a puppy with a funny side, comic character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She is a real cat who shows what a real cat is doing for her owner, a real girly.
