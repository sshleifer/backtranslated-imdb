I do not understand your objections to this film. It's a tense and exciting extension of "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is at least a little unrealistic is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still late and not in prison at that late date. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, we are presenting three theories about what is happening: 1) Sharon Stone's character is killed by all these people because he is crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) The complicated cop of David Thewlis kills these people to shape Sharon Stone's character; 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge. What bothers most people about the film seems to be that none of these theories have ever expressed a "true" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric institution to kill the police, the only killing that takes place on the screen.) <br /> <br /> I think it's a brilliant plot device in the spirit of "2001, A Space Odyssey. "Who takes care of what is real? The blonde is really crazy, the policeman really is a curve and the analyst really wants revenge. The interaction between their character and that of others is important. As in real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complex than film Get over it!
