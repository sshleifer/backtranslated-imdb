Maybe it wasn't as good as the whole, but the second episode I was saying was so memorable that I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries. Watches, but leaders are attractive and exhibitions were interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Halley was one of Francis's most interesting characters and the show actually reduces some of the difficulties with his hand. Interestingly, the electronic hands used in stories are probably less functional to the user than after the Second World War.
