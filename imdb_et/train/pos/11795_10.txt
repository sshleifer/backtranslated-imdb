I will never forget the movie or events that lead to Guyana Jonestown. It just seems so tragic, but it has to be said. Powers Boothe Leads Rev. It could have won him an academic award easily when it appeared in the cinema. This is a mini-series you don't forget. You will not forget the pictures of the brutality, control and obsessivity of the unique cult. His rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered a paradise. Mass suicide is terrible and almost unrealistic for someone's imagination, why so many people (900+) volunteered or were against JOnes orders. They no longer do mini-series where we leave the mouth open and hungry to find out what happened to others.
