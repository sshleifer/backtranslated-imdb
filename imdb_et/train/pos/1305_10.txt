This movie hit me from the guard when it started at a coffee shop in Arizona and Richard Grieco, (Rex), "Dead Easy", 04 decides that you have something to eat and it's all hot and annoyed by a sexy waitress. While Rex goes out of coffee, he sees the National Trooper and asks him, "Are you fast?" and then all the hell loose more than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill", "80" is a television reporter and is always looking for a shovel of news. Maggie comes up in the jacuzzi and Rex calls her to tell her she wants a local top policeman down in the western style. This is a different film, but Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors to help with this picture!
