I like this movie for several reasons. I have a soft spot for movies about complexly drawn criminal cases such as TOPKAPI. I also enjoy movies (such as TOPKAPI and BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET) that break the genre. One of the best is the disoriented KRIME. <br /> <br /> Over the years, Corbin Bernsen has encountered four drawbacks, and he decides that everyone can benefit from the bank robbery he is planning for a small town in Montana. But he has not given the criminals any details and no one at all. Soon after they were sent, two New Jersey police officers (Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck) were arrested, who had fled earlier and had the right to return him. Though he is under their guardianship, four minuses (Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Philips, Ruben Blades and Will Russ) appear without a clue as to why they are there, except that Bernsen planned something. <br /> <br /> The first twenty minutes of the film are slowly dealing with the four minuses that Gwynne and Philips are able to overcome in order to find out that they need to trust each other. At the same time, we see that Bernsen is patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from O'Neill and Roebuck - not too hard because they have never been the lightest bulbs. The result is two sets of plots that are against each other in the film: four scams are trying to figure out what the Bernsen scheme was and how to use it, and Bernsen is trying to preserve his freedom from his traps and restore his cabin (and hopefully his gang will find that drive him). There is also a third, smaller, plot that includes the growing annoyance of the local sheriff Hoyt Axton and anger against the New Jersey idiots who get into their hair. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of pleasant moments, like Axton, O'Neil and Roebuck, in a house surrounding the city where Bernsen should hide inside and yell (through the megaphone "Come out, we're surrounded!"). , just to make the scene go to the tremendous level of Montana, that Bernsen fights and stumbles through miles, where the police think he is at that moment, our four cons, which luckily puts the oldest (Gwynne) in control. their car and they have to drive a lorry. Unfortunately, it is a lorry carrying a manure. <br /> <br /> Conclusion of force robbery, including banning all police cars critical time (Philips specialty cars) is also a timing, intercourse and comic result. very fun and definitely worth it.
