It comes out of the left side and it really isn't what you expect. But I love it. The most memorable movie experiences come as you ask me. If you are not a mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so weird, you are cared for. <br /> <br /> Cast is fantastic, but not so big that it's understandable. Special effects come out somewhere (seriously, it's like a strange dark romantic comedy until they do - then WOW) and they're great. General cinematography is easy for the eyes, editing and sound are of very good quality and the twisted story occurs without clich√©s. While none of these aspects make it single, "what the hell?" ALONE makes it a treasure of the movie. <br /> <br /> People who play this movie make no sense. This is one of the 90's most often neglected valves that you have never heard of or love so much that you jump to mention this title. <br /> <br /> I'm in the last group.
