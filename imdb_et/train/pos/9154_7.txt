Very good, except for the end, which was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script was great when it worked. The visuals were often very grainy, but it was added to the film because the snowy qualities were in good places that helped create the mood for the film. This effect has destroyed the incredible end. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie to 8 out of ten, but the ending ended up at 7 because it seemed that the first 75 minutes of the movie had radically left and seemed to be forced to end by making the filmmakers wise. <br /> <br /> This movie was, however, much better than movies with much larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like home video with some extra equipment. Not many special effects when they go, but the ratio was very good.
