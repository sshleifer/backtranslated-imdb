Kurt Russell is the best man who lives in the glory of his past, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar reverse rare low key, like Jack Dundee. He left more than one way to the Big Pass. <br /> <br /> You will see some of the most quoted scenes that have ever been put into one movie, as Jack lifts his rat, Reno and his call. Caribou goes out. <br /> <br /> Don't miss the classics that are not afraid to show off in the football mud, how it should be played (note to NFL).
