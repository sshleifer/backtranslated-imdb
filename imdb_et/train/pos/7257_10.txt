The reason I say this is because I wrote the script and knew it very little until I was asked to see the movie. I wrote it to some manufacturers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was my friend, I heard about it. I had only written the first draft, so I was reasonably concerned when I heard it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson if he could make another draft for me. I also asked if I can see my original script because I lost it. I was told too late. So I did the only thing I did in the situation and took my name out. I had no idea what they would have done for their script. Then I was invited to watch the movie. I was so impressed that I asked very quickly to rename my name. This is a beautifully made piece, quickly written from the first draft, I assumed I was asked to do much more; maybe if I had it that good. I would like to see my original script if anyone knows where it is? I would also like to see the movie again, I saw it once in a small Soho spectacle theater.
