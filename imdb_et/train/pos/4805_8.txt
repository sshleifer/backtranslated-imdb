When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be like a Duchy (2008), but when I saw The Young Victoria for the first 30 minutes, I knew it wouldn't be a sure movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully captured. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really put me down is the performances. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is a star in the film that brings Victoria to life and with this film she shows that she is a great actor and possibly chooses her first Oscar nomination. Rupert's friend is almost a brother as Prince Albert, but he has a great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also sure of Lord Melbourne, although I was expecting him more. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have both supporting roles, but they are forgetting. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the film is unfinished. Maybe the scriptwriters made too many things in the script, I don't know, but I know the movie. <br /> <br /> But this is a great movie about the early years of Victoria with excellent performance from Emily Blunt.
