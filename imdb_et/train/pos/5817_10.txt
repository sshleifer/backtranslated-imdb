If you want to remember MJ, it's a good place to start. This movie contains sweet stories, MJ as a robot and a crazy, cluttered plot. I remember a lot of the night going to this fine full-length movie in college and wondering who has decided to call this ridiculous part of the green light. <br /> <br /> There are many songs there. A lot of dancing. There are many songs during the dance. MJ strikes it as you should wait. But there is much more to this movie. There's a blame there. There is a fat child (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit to whom Michael Jackson should dance (probably also clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not made of clay). <br /> <br /> RIP- We Love You Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
