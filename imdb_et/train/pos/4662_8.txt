I just saw Hot Millions in TCM and I completely forgot about that pearl. Ustinov wisely and inseparably creates a plot that wisely has two double men brilliant ... Well you see. Maggie Smith is the perfect worshiping secretary / neighbor who has a hard workplace but has a warm and lively personality in this picture. He creates a warm, witty and real person of a good image, who in the long run ... well ... <br /> <br /> Molden and Newhart as top managers accept the challenge that can be a banal role and make them out of their comic life . <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just happy to see and I know at least Romero Ustinov extends his helping hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant to be a return to the growing computer age and to the average person or person with this problem, but in fact the characters are so involved and so fun to see that the bottom of the computer is almost gone ... I say almost. <br /> <br /> Shoot your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for great performances and a friendly, forgiving and deeply engaging plot in this picture.
