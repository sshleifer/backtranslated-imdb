After "Beau travail", everyone was expecting Claire Denis to make a masterpiece that never came. It is now. Denis throws in this film, a brilliant ornament of cinematography, elliptical editing, and deliberately obscure narrative events that seem strange and even act as a stranger. There is a nominal value (partly derived from the same name as Jean-Luc Nancy's book) for a more mature man who needs a heart transplant, who is looking for a Tahitian son whom he has long since abandoned; but in most cases it is an exploration of the idea of ​​personal and cultural invasion. To fully understand, it takes a couple of views and at the end they have problems, but it is still more advanced and more exciting than anything else I've seen this year. Leave it at your own risk.
