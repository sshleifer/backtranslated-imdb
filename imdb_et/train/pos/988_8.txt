I liked this movie. If a man who was in gold on a $ 40 million bank transfer dies, his cell partner "Baitina" will be used to bring him to a high-tech mad killer partner (who has his unknown tracking device without his knowledge)). This is an action, spy-type movie that has enough comic scenes to keep it light. It reminded me of the country's enemy. Well done and good enough plot.
