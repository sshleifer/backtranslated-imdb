I was lucky enough to catch this movie at the Maryland Film Festival during volunteering. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies and especially William Castle tricks so it was definitely visible to me. <br /> <br /> This is William Castle's life and work, which I think was an underrated director. True, he made some cheap budget horror movies, but added some real live theater tricks to these movies that you no longer see. For example, she had nurses when someone had made vibrators in her movies to have a heart attack and led her to TINGLER chairs. <br /> <br /> This is a really well-made documentary and brings it to a rather shady director. in the light and celebrated their contribution to the horror. It also paints the castle as a character of life that was very pleasant and smile. <br /> <br /> Unlike most movie movies that mostly show that film historians are SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews mainly with his family members and directors affected by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. Must see the classic horror and sci-fi fans.
