I've been a fan of Jodie Foster because we were both children of our Disney years. I loved her tomboy antics in films like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" was such a big deviation from all this. <br /> <br /> When other young female actors of this era turned to childhood, which is hidden in comedy ("Little Darlings", anyone?), Jodie went on a depressing and tragic story for teenagers who were tempted by the temptation of temptation and addiction to death . <br /> <br /> It wasn't Disney. It wasn't Porky. It was not "Halloweed". It was a dark and powerful story about destroying young people's lives. Unfortunately, this story, which still plays every day across the country, can be played back (using the current soundtrack) and still be perfectly relevant. <br /> <br /> This is not the best movie, it is tired in some parts, not all performances are particularly prominent. But Jodie Foster continued to show her carpets as a real adult actor (the trend started when she was very young in taxi). <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 Barkys
