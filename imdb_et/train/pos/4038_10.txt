It may be the only movie that actually goes into the movie, which is American college experience in the late 60s and early 70s. Go ahead, name another movie that approaches it: "How straight"? "RPM"? These are cartoons. "The Seven Returns of Secaucus" has its own moments, but it is a retrospective film (of the inmates themselves) more than the time and place of the film depicted in time and place. "Driving, he said" portreys - with the fine and nuanced it should be, and short shorts in shorts where this is the only suitable way - anti-draft movement, ambiguous college sports vagueness (especially when there's war there), period sexual revolution and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was so. <br /> <br /> The whole cast deserves praise (as of course the director), but special praise should be given to Bruce Dern as basketball coach and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual - except for this time - love interest. Leading William Tepper also appreciates a real round of applause for both the perfect occupation of the period student-athlete and the real college basketball playing in the film (remember Anthony Perkins "Tall Story"? Yikes!). <br /> <br /> All in all, the classic class - and the last movie somebody is currently in the 6th grade - should write comments ("boring", "repulsive" - ​​um, better, boy, return to your Arnold movies) . Why is this movie not accessible?
