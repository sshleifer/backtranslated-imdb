Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the brink of puberty, is starting to have wonderful dreams that will affect her in real life - especially with the Mark's boyfriend (Elliott Spiers) with whom he meets in his dreams. <br /> <br /> A very unusual fantasy with some really awful moments. Despite being teenage girls and PG-13, it's not for children. Also, if you hate fantasies, stay far away. But if you play something else, it fits into the bill. <br /> <br /> Well-managed Bernard Rose, with just a nice music score and some nice, scary stunts. The only thing that prevents it from being a really big movie is Burke - she's not a very good actor (not surprisingly it's been her only movie) and it makes the film hurt. But everyone else is just great. <br /> <br /> Spire is great as Mark; Glenne Headley (British accent very well) is also very good when Anna's mother and Ben Cross are both intimidating and sympathetic as Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A dream that came out in 1988, it's already gone. It's too bad - it's really very good.
