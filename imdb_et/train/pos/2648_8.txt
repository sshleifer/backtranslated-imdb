Indeed, the story of two ransom brothers and their fall from grace (through drug addiction) and later redemption. One brother, self-proclaimed genius, played by James Franco, is your typical sensitive but intelligent person. The other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less decisive when he himself depends on his family's expectations for both children. Not too heavy a hand when the drug fabulals want to be, and ultimately a realistic vision of the family dynamics that drug problems cause. I recommend someone who is interested in such characteristic studies, and I congratulate James Franco on his efforts in what was clearly the work of love.
