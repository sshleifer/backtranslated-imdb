This is one of three of the 80 films I think they were unfortunately neglected and, unfortunately, still overlooked. One of the others was Clownhouse, headed by Victor Salva, a film that was terribly forgotten due to Salva's legal / sexual problems. The second would be Cameron's Closet, which admits to me that it is somewhat underestimated - not big, but not nearly as bad as I've seen. The paper house is worth your time and I think it is one of those very quiet films that will stay in your brain for much longer than you think. I mean, 10 years after I've seen it, and I'll give it a break, while something I've seen 6 months ago is broadcast.
