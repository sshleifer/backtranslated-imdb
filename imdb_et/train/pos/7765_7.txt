Douglas Sirk leads this excess drama of unhappy wealth. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are boyfriends of different looks. Kyle is the feminine son of an oil maid; Mitch works for Hadley Oil Company. Both love the same woman, Lucy Moore; but it is Kyle who has the tools to take her off and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the city's nymphomania and carries a burner to Mitch, who seems to have always been cleaned by Hadley. An ambitious claim; just over the vertex, but the stars make it a movie. I was most impressed with Malone. Rounding the story: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch, and Robert J. Wilke.
