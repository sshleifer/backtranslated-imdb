Very nicely made film. It stays in your memory. Better than romance than flying or war, while flying parts are realistic and almost flawless. Like myself, the airlines enjoy this movie even when these planes are attracted, have no sensitivity and never fall in love. <br /> <br /> Fun to watch Crow early. She is good and excites the charm. His "High Flight" reading is great. <br /> <br /> Rejoice, Boom
