When I first saw the Springo division last spring, my first reaction to BRILLIANT! But in the future, I was given much more than a masterful film. This picture has a unique voice that removes all film history. <br /> <br /> The opening assembly provides an excellent palette that the jeweler JP Sarro uses to entertain his artwork on canvas. <br /> <br /> Sarro uses the camera as his brush when he brings us along a ride that surrounds the audience with a huge action film that goes beyond the usual form we are used to and dives deep into the subject of blinding, revenge and companionship. This film is the dream of any director in his heart. <br /> <br /> But Sarro was not alone in this epic action. Writer Tim Sheridan's writing was the same breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such a presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!), where Vanessa appears to be one coalition and scapegoat, is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the coolest endings I've ever seen. Sheridan is next to Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> In the final note, it is clear that this production was not small. <br /> <br /> That's why we have a lot of praise for Scott Shipley, who seems to be a creator and a genius alongside Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I seen such a magnificent production paying so much attention to every little detail. The work of the producers is one of the hardest in any movie and Shipley makes it easy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film combines creative writing, stunning and a masterful direction. This is the best art of the film. When the movie ends, the only thing you want is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo division is a groundbreaking, masterpiece, and most importantly, the Romeo department is indeed an art.
