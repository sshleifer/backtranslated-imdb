Gregory Peck's magnificent image of Douglas MacArthur from Corregidor's Battle in the Philippines at the beginning of the Pacific War, largely through his removal as UN Chief of War during the Korean War, offers a reason to believe all three of the above. Certainly, the most controversial American general of MacArthur, the World's Most controversial American, will be presented here as a man of massive contradictions. He claims that soldiers want peace first and foremost, but obviously war; he consistently denies all political ambitions, but almost everything he does is deliberately used as a presidential candidate; apparently he believes the soldiers under his command must follow his letters, but deliberately violates the orders of the President of the United States; it shows great respect for other cultures (especially in the Philippines and Japan) and is nevertheless completely immune to its own country. All these things are in balance throughout this movie, and finally, the viewer is left with conclusions about the person, although one has no doubt that MacArthur sincerely and passionately loved his country, and especially the army he devoted his life to. <br /> <br /> Pecki's performance, as I said, was brilliant - in fact, to the extent that it overshadowed almost everyone else in the film (which is probably relevant to who he represents!) except Ed Flanders. Although he offered a convincing look at Harry Truman and his attitude to MacArthur: sarcastic (repeatedly referring to MacArthur as "His Majesty"), angry, frustrated and finally completely filled with Him who simply does not respect his authority as president. Marj Dusay was also intriguing when MacArhuri's husband Jean, who was dedicated to his wife (whom he himself called "General", though their relationship seems to be happy enough.) I enjoyed this movie very much, though maybe I would have liked MacArthur's early life a bit learn more. I've always chosen MacArthur as president of Eisenhower's response ("He's a good president - he was the best fucking officer I've ever had"), which seems to be a summary of what MacArthur considered to be the president's role, especially during his war with his military commanders. 8/10
