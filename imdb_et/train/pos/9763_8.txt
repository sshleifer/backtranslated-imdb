Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I saw in theaters. My father took my sister and me, and the funny thing is - when we got home, the father asked, "What do you want to do now?" and we said we wanted to see Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad took us back to the theater to watch it again - at least how i remember it. I was five years old then. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty scary for five years. A scene with a giant ocean of candy and a hypnotic camel scene. I don't remember that movie a lot, of course the start was magical and some scenes - I wish I could find it again and probably looking for it now. <br /> <br /> I remember I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
