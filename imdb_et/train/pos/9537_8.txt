Some may feel that this rating is a bit generous, but for this film I think the directors have done the good job they had made available to them, this is also a movie of the taste of the film! <br /> <br /> My direct idea was a direct link to the classic cult film "The Thing", ie parasitic aliens who were out of space, infecting human hosts to destroy the thorn, if possible! <br /> <br /> You see how this movie respects such a movie and other horror / gore genres, but carefully preserves its originality, well these things fight against each other and then eat the fallen rival! Just killing and selecting a person if he needs a new host! Then choose another fight with another infected host! And this movie even throws a love story, but I'm not saying anymore, otherwise it will give too much. <br /> <br /> Great! But as I said about the taste, don't be surprised if you don't like the movie. It's a small budget and yes, it's blood thirst, creatures / aliens / things morphing your arms out of search for raw weapons, ie saws, drills, knives, and even a strange weapon for everyone, but destroying your opponent. I found myself what I was showing, but at the same time glued to the screen to find out what was going to happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you like gore, you like foreigners, you like fighting and maybe even a little love that was thrown somewhere, then I have to recommend this movie as you see it. I just wish I came over before, I did!
