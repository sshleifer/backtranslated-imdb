One of John Ford's best films, The Informer, does not include the great landscapes of the West of America. Instead, the intense drama Ford knew he was playing the face of British character actor Victor McLaglen in a less harsh landscape. The former prize-winner, who had already faced Joe Louis in his ring, is giving the Academy the award-winning imagination of the shameful IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on his worst night. <br /> <br /> The plot is gracefully simple: in 1922, Dublin, a hungry and humble man who has been thrown out of the IRA because he can't kill a cold-blooded informant, becomes an informant. For 20 pounds, he sells a friend to "Denmark" and runs for the rest of the evening and gives his blood money for fast-moving offenses, denials, self-infirmities, and a desperate desire to escape his consequences. measures. <br /> <br /> This is an outstanding complexity for the seemingly simple Gypo character, which is the most impressive achievement of the movie. In most of the films, the Gypo type is thrown into a dirty lout, because at best it would have two or three lines and they should be destroyed quickly so that the hero and the villain are in their showdown. In "Informer" Gypo himself is both a hero and a villain, while the showdown is in his internal instability, each of which is clearly shared with the public. <br /> <br /> Since Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929, RKO gave Ford a modest budget. The director and his associates, especially Joseph H. August, gave the advantage of creating a claustrophobic masterpiece for a warrior with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar "The Informer", John Ford also won his first with the best scenario and the best result.
