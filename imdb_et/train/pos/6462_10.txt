I'm not going to spoil the content for anyone who hasn't yet looked at this humble masterpiece of Kay Pollak. <br /> <br /> The world-famous conductor, played by Michael Nyqvist, is looking for peace from stress, moving back to his childhood. the village. The villagers, who have kept the genius silent, slowly attract him to share his size. <br /> <br /> Every role in this movie has a very specific goal and it shows significant potential in each participant playing short, but precise words of his chord, with a symphony of love. <br /> <br /> Not in love with a sense of relationship, but in every symbol of a deep buried spirit, each showing its own current story, their needs, skeletons, desires, and more. <br /> <br /> I don't forget to mention the two main parts of Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist whose dramas are played in unforgettable emotional harmonies. feedback. They touch each other because of their disability-related pain to love themselves. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist has really tried here in a very complicated setting, one of those movies that is either catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic it got from start to finish, not for one second less or more than enough, you missed the feeling of change and taste more. <br /> <br /> By now, it is definitely one of the best films I've had the pleasure to watch.
