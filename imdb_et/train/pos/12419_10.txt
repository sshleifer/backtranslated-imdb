I love this movie like no other. The next time I try to explain my virtues to the ignorant, but now allow me to quote some pieces of remarkable dialogue, which, please remember, is the cheek of the whole language. Aussies and Poms Understand All Others Well? <br /> <br /> (Lyric title song) "he can sink his beer, he can choose his last double Bondi move." <Br /> <br /> (the second song lyrical) "All bombs are bastards, bastards, or worse, and England is a universe ** e-hole." <br /> <br /> (an artistic program during a television interview): Mr. Mackenzie, what artists have been most impressed with you because you have been in England? (Barry's response) Flamin 'bull artists (<br /> <br /> (naive young pom talking to a girl): Mr Mackenzie, I think you have aboriginal servants back in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? that Abo would be alive in me. Mom makes most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) around us. <br /> <br /> This is just a fun farce of this bonser Aussie. .
