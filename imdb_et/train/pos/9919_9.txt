Pleasant, breathtaking and terrible, this ghostly beautiful film is "now an apocalypse" without fiction. At a slow pace, in a quiet mood, it gives a good look at the poisoned patches of Earth, which may be the hallmarks of inevitable doom. <br /> <br /> I think there is no doubt - nature is troubled and we are sick. Greed, the essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress, has turned us into something of cancer, being consumed by the host and dying with it ... <br /> <br /> Made landscapes are a rather unforgettable viewing experience - at least I don't turn my toast and iron again in the same way.
