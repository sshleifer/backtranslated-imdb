I saw it recently for almost forty years. It keeps well, especially Lionel Bart's great songs. ("Who buys" with this magical counterpoint, but one of many standouts.) <br /> <br /> I disagree with another post that gave my G rating. A credit rating agency that was completely new at that time was never meant to mean a "complete" rating of "G" (general). <br /> <br /> Describing it as inappropriate for children reminds me of the description I have ever seen of Oz's wizard: The girl arrives on a strange land and kills the first person she meets. He then goes on to three male companions and kills again.
