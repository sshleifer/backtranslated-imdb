Different Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered all over and the team "They all laughed" is a very family affair. If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn were short but passionate about the past image it is the air of an almost private movie that is made for the enjoyment of the participants and for the wider audience to entertain is only a side effect.If it all smells of funny "jokes" of self-expression, you will be glad to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well for this particular threat and offers a sweet and quite innocent "I love NY" sneaker there is also an altar where we can worship the late beauty of Miss Hepburn. Don't make that mistake, it's his picture. Mr. Gazzara admits this to his suicide in all his scenes together. The plot - the detective bureau engages its clients too personally - is of minimal importance, it is at the forefront of the two films. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is that his camera seems to love his actors, from "targets". There's a glimpse of each of your movies that only special artists can attract the inanimate optical devices. Miss Hepburn is especially useful for this love. Further knowledge of his work can be found in the collections published by his essay letters and directors, mainly "Who the hell is this?", Recently in UK bookstores. The "They All Laughed" soundtrack ranges from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York City Hall concert to Sinatra to Latin, both eclectic and urban. Mr B, the "Golden Boy" image was definitely faded because it is the essence of a movie business, but it is equally sure that one day will be restored, and if that day comes "They're all laughing" will be recognized for the good work that it is.
