BASEketball is an extremely funny movie that offers an actress that makes the movie much more fun, comedy material that is more than funny pants, and a pretty good plot, despite its classic slackers vs. an evil rich man. and the only thing I didn't like about BASEketBall was that this child wasn't really necessary in the movie, but if the child wasn't in the movie, some funny scenes would not have existed. because basically all the reviewers did not like this movie.BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.
