VIVAH is my BEST FILM in 2006! PERIOD !!. In my book this is one of the best 100 movie EVER MADE IN Bollywood. It is sad that this film does not have so many reviews and is not so popular. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again a real achievement from the director who does it again. After POV and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj have again brought a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest and most lovely movie I saw this year. After seeing Don 2, who was CRAP and later Dhoom 2, who even won Don on this issue, I finally see a film that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I don't know why Bollywood moves away from the beautiful culture we have, and we are making a Hollywood remake style like Dhoom 2 and don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and relates to a lot of Indian organized marriage system, which I would like to have. Our system, which teaches us to follow the parents, follow them and, of course, obey their thoughts, is so wonderfully shown in this film! Of course, there is no force in choosing your partner and it should be a short meeting between the couple and their own to decide how this film is perfectly shown. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie ..... VIVAH is a story of a journey between a beautiful engagement and marriage period. The stage where the boy meets the girl! .... Both understand each other .. Both try to evaluate whether they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the different ones that occur during marriage. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is great in the movie ....... Shahid is OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like HAMAR SHAAD'S MAIN FEATURES REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> Overall, MUST be for anyone who still believes in Indian culture and tradition, and I am sure! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I have to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
