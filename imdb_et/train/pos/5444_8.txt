Class Reunion is a very humiliated pearl of comedy. It's 1982 and the 1972 Lizzie Borden High Income for a 10-year reunion, including regular stereotypes, a hunk, a baby, a fat boy and a string, and so on. classmates are Walter Baloer, the class that was in the classical choir that was wearing on the rest of the class, and since then Walter has escaped and is now going to release his humiliation ,,,, <br /> <br /> excuse me for very funny gags and croissants. Too much more to say about the movie, but if you enjoy Naked Gun & Airplane's movies, you love it, and what the second movie is about is Chuck Berry's music. A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
