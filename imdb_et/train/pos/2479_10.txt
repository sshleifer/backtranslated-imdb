(I apologize for my faulty language, I'm not a mother tongue ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a film that requires almost a general response. Personally, I agree with all those superpowers who are around. But I do not use it to describe the empty road film in a semantic way. Because they are "perfect! Only one! Best!" - Reviews make some people out (including me). <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for another "Hamlet" with the ability to compete with many theatrical and cinematic works - don't miss it when it happens somewhere. (Unfortunately, not too many people see this option. There doesn't seem to be a DVD and the German version - which is quite well done - is not available in any form.) <br /> <br /> If you decide Get a copy: Release the one that cuts this movie for two hours (or so). It is of no use and is not fun and gives the wrong impression of a film that deals with the flow and architecture in an interesting way. And it's also down to 4: 3. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
