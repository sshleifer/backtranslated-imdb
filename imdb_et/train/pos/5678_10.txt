We can still use the Black Adder. Imagine Rowan Atkinson continuing the role of Prime Minister Assistant, which is played by wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as Mr Prince George and Edmund as his excellent assistant. I love the episode that Kenneth Connor's guest celebrates as British ces. Every time Edmund says to Macbeth. These two people make a foolish spirit to prevent evil spirits. It's the funniest things you see. Of course, none of this genius of brilliance and comedy can be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind films like Love Acently, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and funny. I was hoping last night on Saturday evening that Hugh Laurie would respect his background for British humor. If the SNL band did some research, they would know what a treasure it was for Hugh Laurie to be the arm of his stage.
