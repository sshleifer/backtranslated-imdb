Contains a spoiler <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the weakest film ever made by Paul Verhoeven, the headmaster of "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop". <br /> <br /> This is probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven stole a completely mediocre script and did the best. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is pretty good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even the sound of Skunk Anansie. Unfortunately, the film becomes flat in the second part, when it became a regular film or perhaps a very bad "Alien" clone. Finally, it is especially ridiculous <SPOILER> because Kevin Bacon is back in life after a series of incidents that (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him. </SPOILER>. And the whole thing is quite low - indeed: the issue of becoming invisible has never been fully explored. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 **** - Stars
