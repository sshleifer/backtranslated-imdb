"Century Stories" was a half-hour series and appeared on the first syndicate in the television season '54 -'55. It was also the first Western TV series to win the Emmy Award. This is West West actor Jim Davis, a rail detective Matt Clark, a series of Clark and his associates rail detective partners (Mary Castle Frankie Adamsena in the first half of the year and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" in the second half) against the West of the 1860s until the mid-1860s Until the beginning of the 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to look at and quite realistic, mainly thanks to Jim Davis' leading luck. He seemed like a real western character. Another note. When Matt Clark arrived in the city after a long ride, he seemed to have been driving a long horse because he would be covered with dust. <br /> <br /> Very good early adult west.
