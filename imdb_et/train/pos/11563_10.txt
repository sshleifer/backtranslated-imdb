I saw it for many years after the TV series and initially I didn't care about it. Then when my memory of memory passed over time, I looked again and found it to be completely fun. Based on these productions based on Simon's production, it is not much open on the big screen and it is one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are excellent, like Oscar and Felix, and the support cast is excellent, especially by John Fielder as Vinnie. Felix cut off the Oscar in the middle of a ball game dinner, Oscar burst around the Felix apartment, persecuted by Pigeon Sisters, who were Felix's fools. and, of course, the legendary cafe-scene (later hanged by Nora Ephroni "When did Harry Met Sally"). Razor-sharp dialog. If the boys think Felix has overdosed, Oscar says, "They may be vitamins! He could be the healthiest room in the room!". Fantastic!
