I loved this movie. I knew it was full of camp and stupidity like the original series. I found it very warm to see that Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar came together again. Anyone who loved the 60s Batman series should have enjoyed returning to Batcave. You could say that the actors created this movie, especially Adam West, for fun. And I bet he would be happy to jump back to his Batman costume if the script had requested it. I told many friends about this movie who decided not to look at it ... now they wanted it. I have all the original 120 episodes of VHS. Now this movie has joined my collection. Thank you for reconnecting with Adam and Burt.
