A very enjoyable movie that tells you how to watch old music / secrets. It may not be close to Agatha Christie or even to Thin Man's mysteries as a movie poet, but it is much more interesting if your typical "boy meets a girl" or "let's put the show" on backstage music. The music is not Busby Berkley or Freed, but it can increase the classic "cocktails for two" and the strange "sweet marijuana". The film will run in real time during the stage event, "Vanities" opening night, where murder - and soon another - will be discovered backstage. Is the murderer known before the curtain falls? Of course, however, the search is fun, though somewhat predictable and loaded with comic relief (fortunately, the shape of the shape of the girls' goddess, Toby Wing). The stupid cop is a bit too stupid, the leading hero is a bit too pleasant, the leading lady is a bit too gracious, the bitchy prima is a bit too funny, and the beloved waif is a bit too self-sacrificing, but to go stereotyped, they are pretty stylish. There are a lot of really gorgeous choir girls who are even better than girls for the same period of Busby Berkley music, which sometimes tends to be a little halfway. Yes, this movie could have been a lot better than that, and the Duke Ellington's number is embarrassing, but if you enjoy diving into old movies, it will be a tremendous torment.
