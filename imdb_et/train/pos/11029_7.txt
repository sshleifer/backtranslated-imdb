I'm far from being a fan of Sylvester Stallone, and I think the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in French film Taxi 3, which is almost a minor role. And yet I have to admit that this movie wasn't really that bad, even though I was worst of the worst. From a 4,000-foot-high mountain he cannot force himself to be a mountain traveler. For almost a year, he has not set aside food, but he returns. Soon after he has returned, they will receive an emergency call from migrants who are trapped in snowstorms. At least this is believed by migrants. In fact, there is a group of robbers who fell by their plane in the mountains after their bold plan to steal incidents that were full of flying government aircraft. Cases have spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbing tools to load them ... <br /> <br /> This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but it is an enjoyable one in the genre. I especially liked John Lithgow, who is a champion and leader of wealthy robbers. I knew him best from the TV series "3rd Rock of the Sun", but I also enjoyed this movie. Generally it works well, it had a lot to offer and of course some liners, but also a very nice interior design. This film was filmed in an excellent natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valley, the rivers of the mountains and the woods ... Maybe I'll give this film a higher score than what I usually give to such an action / adventure movie. I'll give him 6.5 / 10. If you don't expect too much, it's an enjoyable movie.
