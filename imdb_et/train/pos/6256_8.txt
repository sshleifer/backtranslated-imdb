Maybe I can face myself here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece of my time, I looked at it last night by TCM, the question arises: Why did they do it? sacrificing their lives, many of them died on the track, why did they make such a life-threatening journey to find food for their animals (!) when they reached "milk and honey", why not "they stay there? Would you put your life and life at risk? Your community life to find food for livestock? As dangerous as it was for this purpose, this type of people show inbred ease. Cow death? Better than me!
