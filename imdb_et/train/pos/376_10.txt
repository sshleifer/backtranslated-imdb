Spielberg's first dramatic film is not let. This is a beautifully made film that lacks the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all African-American films, which are the center of the story, must be directed by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic, despite being based on a book. What's more, Danny Glover was great as Mr.. But it is completely out of it and there is someone else. But the film's overall resilience comes from Whoop's Goldberg. She's great as Celie. You will never forget these signs when you have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I heard that this musical version will be a movie, and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as it is because it's a movie that shouldn't be missed children.
