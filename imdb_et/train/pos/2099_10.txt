It is great - admirable, set, clothes, music - but most of all the story itself. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there are no more comments about this movie - certainly one of the best in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> It's also a great movie to see in parallel with the big "Random Harvest" that has the same opening crisis <br /> <br /> - Medieval, unknown English WWI officer is at the hospital at the end of the war suffering from shell shock and full amnesia without his name, origin or wherever he belongs - he has turned out to be a very wealthy man when he "recovers", does not remember years before the war - <br /> <br /> But the similarity of films ends. <br /> <br /> My warmest thanks to everyone who participated in the film - especially actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (which is a wonderful and surprising choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> It will stay with you forever.
