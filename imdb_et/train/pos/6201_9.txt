Hal Hartley Henry Fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work. It has a deep character, a subtle, sophisticated dialogue and an excellent, emotional end that fascinates. I remember stopping it several times during my first viewing to swallow what I saw and felt. Henry Fool was a complete film from start to finish and had no sequel. <br /> <br /> So I was surprised when I heard about Fay Grim. Fay was not one of the main characters in the first film and seemed to exist more than the worrying introduction of real vanities and ignorance to his brother Simon to cope with his maturity. In her film, Fay matures, although her maturity is very different. Simon went from almost autistic isolation to a somewhat introverted genius. Fay starts his adult journey as an immature, completely normal, spoiled child, and reacts to an assault on ridiculous circumstances, becoming a mature, perfectly normal and experienced adult with no advantages. He deals with the problems that every person does, firmly, with little thought and tired of contempt. Although Simon learned to control his mind, Fay learns to control his emotions. <br /> <br /> The movie features many of its pleasantly recalled elements, but it differs greatly from most of the film's tone. Henry's fool showed you a tough, boring, unknown world that contrasts with Simon's inner passion and creativity. Fay Grimas is a living, crazy, emotional place in the world that shows his contempt for youth and, on the other hand, expresses an inner wise woman who had never been developed or nurtured by her same weak mother. <br /> <The film is in two parts, the first of which concerns the start of Fay's fight and subsequent tempering due to authoritarian hostility, and the second deals with his battle to soften just enough to restore Henry. First of all, Henry Fool fans might think about how to keep the movie sequel, and I thought it was profane to follow such an intense movie with spy and physical comedy. But this is where the Fay Grim lies. Fay's journey continues, and as I said before, he's one to look for the peace of mind that gives life, not the creative chaos in the backlog. Parker Posey is a great actor who catches Hal Hartley with a sense of humor. It is possible that Elina LÃ¶wensohn will play a role in her emotional contribution, allowing Parker to play both a straight man and a comic against the lively, performance-like comedy that is taking place around him. <br /> <br /> The film starts to rub. Hal Hartley movies are all games and every game must be a full circle. Finally, it is shown that Fay's newly-developed character and integrity is the successor to his era with the deadly intensity of Henry, whose piercing honesty and unique passion will spark a spark on someone he meets. <br /> <br /> Fay Grim is a great movie that does not exceed Henry Fool, but shows through Hal's range that his artistic nuances are proof of his genius. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think that anyone who downgrades this movie did not just respond to the milestone (and especially Parker Posey's), but Henry Fool's movie couldn't be much of interest to him.
