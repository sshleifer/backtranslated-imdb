Atlantis: The lost empire has one of the best, smoother animations and smartly written dialogue on any Disney movie viewed. And I was convinced of it for 15 minutes. I especially love Don Novello's vocal work with Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. It is too bad that the whole movie seems to be moving about twice as fast as it would be - at least in the first law. One important aspect of the Disney movie is a satisfactory antagonist that Atlantis does not offer. He's the best. On the way side of the film is mediocre twisting. That is all. However, this is a great movie. Everyone should check it out.
