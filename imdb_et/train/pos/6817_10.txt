I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie about the real meaning of the b / c family, the history of our country, the fun activity shown in the film. I look at the time @ top about 4 X a week and I just love it! I would like to have a sequel in the past to see more of Susan's father in the past and see how Susan walked with her new sister and had no phone, computers, playgrounds, or anything else in the 21st century. I hope that everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as I thought you could say I'm time in the top fanatic and I don't mind. Lil boy in the movie Robert Lincoln Walker was just wonderful, I don't know who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he plays movies or TV shows?
