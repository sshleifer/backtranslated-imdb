THIS WORLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I liked it when I was 4 and I still enjoy it in the 16th century! This is an absolute masterpiece! Without it, the video collection is not ready! I like it every second and not just that the film has some special effects, but it sends a big message to the audience who might seem stupid, but actually the movie is very COOLY! Although Michael Jackson has now seen films, people still don't see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He's so talented! He's incredible! MOONWALKER IS NEED TO SEE !!!!!!
