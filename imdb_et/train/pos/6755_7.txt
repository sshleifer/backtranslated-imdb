Ah, noir. My favorite genre. The aftermath of Otto Preminger's "Laurale" is a movie noir placed in post-war New York, where corruption and violence are rampant. It marks Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics have landed with his hot water. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon is trying to blame the commander of the crime, Tommy Scale. Dixon is close to his goal when he participates with a dead man, the beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, in a typical way of doing things, things quickly go down the hill. <br /> <br /> Although the film has no interesting camera or narrative, it has constant fear and darkness. Like most great swans, it is also quietly silent, sucking the viewer right from the start. <br /> <br /> However, like most Preminger workers, it's not something I'm watching again. It does not have Wilder's word of mind, Hitchcock's visual leniency, or Welles spatial experimentation. Like Lang's later work, the "sidewalk" feels a very "clone" of what a dog should be, not something truly artistically genuine. <br /> <br /> Film is nothing special. It's about a cop who slowly finds himself a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a little time, flirting with the concept of the idea, but this scene is as far as Otto goes, or dare to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is also disappointing. There's no intelligence in Otto. The camera is not intended for anything. It does not play space or architecture and does not step up the police step by step. It's just a tripod setting that has a random dolly and in. Meaningless, though most people don't care about these things. <br /> <br /> However, there is one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (noir drill) that enters the vehicle's lift (the second cage) and is taken to the top captain on the floor. Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet", Otto constantly retouches the movie "upstairs" in hell. It works well, but the design does not support it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems to have content that follows the Hawksia form that Noir has, not the toy's possibilities to go to. Like "Detour", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In Lonely Place", "Violence Act", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "When the Pavement Ends" is one of those well-made second-rate films noirs. It is competent and appealing, but it has no special magic.
