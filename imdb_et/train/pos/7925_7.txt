The stupid movie is really funny. Yes, it is your dead moments, it may be a bit too obvious, it's slightly down on the other side and the story is inconsistent, but it's ridiculous all the time. And it's worth seeing only Ed McMahon as the right-hand cake. This movie is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny, undervalued film.
