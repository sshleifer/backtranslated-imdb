I thought the film might be a little more complicated, psychologically, but action and voice were top-notch. The animation was difficult in many scenes, but very good. This is one of Batman's return / eternal films that include romances and Wayne conflicts and dating motives. 007 fans would love it and so women, great theme song! Wayne was portrayed very well in this movie and Penquin was back to his true form, this time with no mutant genes! I liked the fact that Robin was not used too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer game, a somewhat indigo child, or a mind of the future. the letters, decent talents and characters were drawn so that they would look like the persons who deal with the voice. Kelly Ripa was fun in this movie. 7/10
