This movie begins with a fun 15-second character and continues throughout the movie. I can't remember a scene where I didn't turn to look at people with laughter. she is the perfect actor for this roll because she looks and dressed. <br /> <br /> The comic parts were great to see that the actors were not very big or popular. As you can see, people see a movie like IMDb. I think it should be 250. Lets put it so I haven't seen this funny movie from an American pie or original vacation. look at it if you want to laugh. I'll give you the 2 biggest thumbnails of this movie I've ever given, because I found out IMDb, a great movie site.
