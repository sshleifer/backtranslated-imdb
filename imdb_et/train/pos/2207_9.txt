It's not a bad word to say about this movie. I was not initially impressed, but it grew rapidly for me. I like it a lot and I think it's shameful that many people don't see it being forbidden in some areas in the past, mine is one of them. The film brings shock, gore and atmosphere to the department. The result is a beautiful midrange. It seems only fair that Chris Young went to one of the best composers in the company. The action in this film is somewhat high when in some places there is some wood and the effect is very real and sharp. All this is a very good praiseworthy movie in my book. In some reviews, I have noted that the film has been hit hard by the shot of the famous killer P.O.V. And I ask: What's wrong with that ??? This is a classic shot that creates fear for the good fans of the genre and is great to keep the killer's identity secret. The only thing that stops highlighting this movie in my book is that the twist of the surprise (uncovered killer) is not being handled more carefully, I mean, it just happens quickly, though big performances make it almost reliable. Aside from being a great movie (although I prefer the original title), PRANKS is a shame that so many people will find it out as just a cheap mess. It's more than that, but only a few know that due to the fuzziness of the early 1980s, it has disappeared. What a shame .... It's really a good movie for people! Believe me!
