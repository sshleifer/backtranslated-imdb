The fortress in heaven is undoubtedly a film by Hayao Miyazaki. After seeing it for the first time, I am happy to say that it does not disappoint. On the contrary, you get the value of your time, which means (what Miyazaki films worry about), it's nothing more than great! <br /> <br /> Made early in his film career, the castle's sky awaits many brands in its later films, where strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow due to external circumstances, helped out with very interesting (and sometimes lovable) characters. And of course the usual battle of nature and civilization, flying machines (much!), Beautiful painted landscapes? but unfortunately there are no pigs (at least what i have noticed after i have seen it only once). Never before, Miyazaki had already received his theater debut two years earlier, Nausic√£a, Princess Mononoke, her magnum opus. The fortress in heaven is a little part of these two, the soft action is packed for the first 30 minutes, similar to its TV series Conan and the Meitantei Holmes episodes led by him. Here we introduce Sheeta, a girl who literally falls down from the sky, and is found only in Pazu, a young boy working in a small rural town. Surprised by his amnesia and suspicion of a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu helps her find out where she came from, escaping from the military and the gang of air pirates. As the film progresses, the plot becomes harder and more interesting, revealing Myiazaki's best. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack resembles a very enthusiastic contest (or, conversely, when the castle was first produced in the sky) and, like its director, Joe Hisaishi, _ composer_, starts with a very light score, it becomes more complicated and beautiful when the plot goes on! <br /> <br /> Note for copying English, a good interpretation of two leading characters, although Anna Paquin Sheet has a very thick pressure (which the actor still had at the time of her career), and directs Mark Hamil as Muska, joyful but sad evil! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this person!
