Like a bad movie lover, I definitely hit this service. The plot is not really so bad, but there are some cases where you really have to ask yourself, "What the hell is going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are many many things that make this a fun movie ever. First of all, Rudy Ray Moore was both fat and slow in filming the film, so that the special effects consist of speeding up the fighting scenes twice. There are also scenes with slow motion, jumping to ten feet high on the wall (playing off) and naked men who leave in large letters, and sex that literally puts it under the roof (with a cable that holds the roof against fire). <br /> <br /> Of course, Rudy Ray Moore's movie wouldn't be complete without a totally free and casual comedy club scene where Rudy makes fun for all customers. doing some strange dances. There are so many things about this movie, but they are badly entertaining and if you take your movie off the film, you may have another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 Actual Value, 10/10 for Cheese Factor, 10/10 for Errors and Goats, Average 7/10.
