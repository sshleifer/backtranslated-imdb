This movie was so big! I am a teenager and I and my friends love this series, so it just shows that these films draw attention to all ages. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says "pink cheeks" when he talks about his girls. She is both a great actor and Erin Cottrell. They do so well and have such a great chemistry! I really hope they can work together. They are such attractive people and they are very good actors. I have finally found movies that are good to watch. Recently, it has been difficult for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time these films are not rooted.
