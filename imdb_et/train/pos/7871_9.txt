Madhur Bhandarkar goes to the taboo and gives the most realistic picture of today's society. The director even gets the impression of his earlier films, such as the Satta and Chandni Bar. The questions just mentioned in the last film are explored and displayed here as a whole. Casting is amazing and the decisions of each scene can be seen in many corners. In most cases, the film leaves you with many facts. When you start guessing things, you get the most, but there are no signs in many scenes. It finally leaves a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Seekers include Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Dialogues are well written and you feel you have lived around some of these people. There are still some scenes that make you think more in depth. The songs are in the background and Lata's voice in a very meaningful song, "Kitne Ajeeb", leaves you feeling alone in the middle of modern society!
