I haven't seen this movie, but I have to. Reading all three books by Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I am actively looking for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The dissertation that Peru has seen in Polynesia is alive and well. Given that this crew had no GPS and only an old-fashioned valve (tube) with a 6-volt output, their trip was heroic to say at least. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of the copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in buying it.
