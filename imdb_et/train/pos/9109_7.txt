Basically, this is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese Revolution. The competition was easy to understand, but usually the directors start from a historical fact to talk about something else or they show the period before or after, everything that happens in a few days, when the revolution works, happens here. It can also be considered a documentary. The film focuses on these two people, showing both normal and non-normal heroes, because the revolution comes from humans. Although it was made from the military army headline, you can understand that these were the main characters. Nice color and lights throughout the film, for a great work for a director who is his first film, he doesn't fall banal. Well-shown emotions and passion for people and the crowd. Maia's (main) character is well done and for Stefano Accors there is also a good interpretation that can show Maia's boundaries, it is not a hero.
