Atlantis is a new and right step for the Disney feature. This is a good choice for making a movie with such a mysterious legend as "Atlantis". I had no expectations about this movie, but after that I don't really understand why this movie is so bad reviews. Even in my country, the reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of Disney's greatest, even if I doubt that this movie will ever become "Disney's classic" reputation. Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same leaders as "Beauty and Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to prevent the reputation of their monster movie, he's just a joke.) <Br /> <br /> Well enough enough. "Atlantis" is a traceable, exciting and very enjoyable movie. Even this movie is a PG-rated action, it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it doesn't destroy the movie. Comic-inspired animation is perfect for leaving the movie and the set in the usual Disney style. It's colorful, dark and detailed. Deep Canvas sequences are quite impressive. The film is sometimes funny, even though I worshiped rather than laughing at the film. (SPOILERS) The characters in this movie are also very nice, but unfortunately there is not enough time for everyone to get to know, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> James's Newton Howard score is absolutely great. It's bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive thing about this film is how they make Atlantis sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really fantastic (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but there are still some questions that the story didn't answer. But fortunately, there are not so many. <br /> <br /> So you're good at yourself, don't listen to the reviewers and look at "Atlantis" because it's waiting for you ...
