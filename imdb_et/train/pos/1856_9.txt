He glorified himself as an excellent supporter of "Glory", he proved he was not "Malcolm in the middle of medieval actor" Malcolm X ", he showed his brotherly love to act" Philadelphia ", he pulled slam dunk in" He got the game ", he didn't pull hit and shake us like a "hurricane" hurricane, he gave us an effective education on "Training Day" and now he has shown that he can also direct the lead! Denzel Washington's debut "Antwone Fisher" is a more moving film of the year. 'The story is in no way connected with the Miami Dolphins of the 4th century against New England Patriots in the last game of the season 2002. Unlike the dolphin tragedy, Antwone has an emotional joy. The film is based on a true story of a young naval officer with an anger management problem because he has a childhood Denzel plays a naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and persuades him to find his natural mother Derek Luke's debut performance A ntwone is the best admirable act I've seen by a novice actor for some time now. I actually saw some detailed deviations from Luke's behavior, as I have seen in Washington in the past. It was like telling Washington to Luke la la Luke that I'm your father. Okay! I'll let the Star Wars jokes go before my readers send me far. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work was masterful as a psychologist. But what do you expect from the actress "Master D". Antwone Fisher was written by none other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional sin he entered into his storyline was a "fisherman's king" material. I'm talking to the chief. Washington, who is trying to feed the right "Antwone Fisher". ***** Great
