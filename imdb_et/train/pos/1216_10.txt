As a child, I preferred the first Care Bear movie because it seemed so dark. I always sat down and watched the first one. As I grew older I learned to prefer it. I think this film is too dark for babies, but when you grow older you learn to tear it because you understand it, it doesn't look as dark as it was when you were a child. <Br /> <br /> This movie is, in my opinion, better than the first, everything is so deep. This may be at odds with the first movie, but you must ignore the first movie to watch it. The boys are just admirable, I'll search for this "Flying My Colors" scene. I tend to bother everyone. <br /> <br /> Sound is great! Great hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love all the songs in this movie, I've downloaded them all, and all I listen to, I listen to "Our Beginnings", also known as "Recall." I've always preferred this soundtrack to the first, even though I just love Carol Kings' song in the first "Care-A-Lot". <br /> <br /> I think animation is great, animation both movies are fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and looked at it about 10 years later and saw that the animation of that time was great. It was very surprising. I don't think it's strange / strange. I think it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is about how Care Bears came and beat Demon, Dark Heart. The end is surprising and again, all Pokemon Movie wins with the Care Bears moral problems. This will leave you with an impact. Again, this film can teach all morals of all ages.
