This movie came and went to the theater. Because of this nature, you can see why it didn't get well. It was unfairly put on, because his theme is more than the actual film itself. Higher education is not remarkable, but it was a good film that tried to talk about a frightened topic in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Planet / Story: Higher education is mostly in the middle of Malik (played by Omar Epps), a na√Øve star who has to deal with not fast enough, and a stern professor (played by Laurence Fishburne). He is friendly to both Fudge (Ice Cube) and a gorgeous lady called Dance (Tyra Banks). Later they have to deal with some campuses. Remy (Michael Rapaport Game) is a confused child who kindly arrives at a local skinhead on campus. When they put their views on it, it becomes as racist as they are. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Higher education is not without its mistakes: character development is scarce, Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and manager Bhead Rhymes are not suitable for this movie at all. Plus, the women who are gay after the men's abuse, turned to the movie before, so you know I don't like that part of Kristy Swanson. Moreover, this film was not half-bad. Laurence Fishburne was good when Professor Phipps (although I can do without accent) was the best result of Fudge Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport was good as a confused Remy. All in all, this was one of John Singleton's best films and one of the reasons I put it on the garbage. Cinema needs more movies like Higher Education, Mississippi Burning and American History X and fewer movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very useless Shaft remake.
