It was a good story ... he had a nice tempo and all the characters were cool. <br /> <br /> Over the past two weeks I've been watching a whole lot of movies and it was supposed to be the best I've seen in two weeks. <br /> <br /> Jason Bigg's character was still the best. <br /> <br /> Although it was small, it was smartly designed from the start. <Br /> <br /> It can be a romantic comedy and I don't like the most, but writing, direction, performance, sound, and overall design were just nice. <br /> <br /> This movie just recently seen the movie quite high - and the rest were big budgets or better publicized. <br /> <br /> Good work in writing.
