This is a short film made by a fan pretending to be a preview of a new movie, with couples Batman and Superman! This is a movie that fans adore and look at in places like ComicCon and was made by the same person who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. it separates. Certainly, CGI effects are not perfect and costumes are far from perfect. BUT, it was done in the skeleton room and for the fan films it's incredible. I was particularly impressed by the surprising Superman - he wasn't a mighty little man! If only this were a preview of a real movie, they would have been fans of Omaha to see it. Great work.
