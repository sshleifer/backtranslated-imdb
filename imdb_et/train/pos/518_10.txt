Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the US. During the Second World War, a British Peter Carter (David Niven) plane will be shot, but he will survive. He meets and loves the lovely June (Kim Hunter). But there seems to be a mistake in heaven - he should have died! The French spirit comes to get him, but he refuses. He will soon talk about his case with the Heavenly Tribunal that he should be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> Sounds ridiculous, but it is actually an incredible movie. Script is good when actors play roles straight and it's beautifully directed - Scenes on Earth are in the breathtaking Technicolor (I've never seen such beautiful blue skies) and scenes in the sky are black and white! Niven is sometimes a bit stiff, but Hunter is just great (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is great as a Niven assistant. The whole picture is amazing (especially the staircase and during the final test period) and the special effects are really big (considering the age of the movie). There's also a very strange sequence when Niven gets into a completely naked young boy who is shepherding the sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful, thought-provoking film - highly recommended. This is unknown in the US, which is a shame.
