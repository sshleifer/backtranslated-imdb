Originally, it was a movie that Gene Kelly celebrates, but when the players didn't get her, they got the "world's biggest actor" and the result is pretty good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has a hard time doing what he does best, putting a big stake on the fucking dice because he needs $ 1,000 to get a seat. In order to get the money he needs, he has a $ 1,000 contribution to his old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he can't get Sergeant Sarah Brown (big expectations for "Golden Globe" and BAFTA called Jean Simmons) go to havana. Meanwhile, Nathan has trouble helping a woman who wants her to ask for marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Robert Keith also plays as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley like Big Jule. An interesting romantic comedy where Brando sings all his songs and Sinatra is smooth and cool. It was named the best art department, the best cinematography, the best costume art and the best music by Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, it was named the best film of any source by BAFTA and won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - musical / comedy. Frank Sinatra was the number 100 on the 100 biggest pop culture icons, Marlon Brando was the 100th largest movie star in 30, he was number 100 among the biggest sex symbols, he was 100 at 100 years, 100 stars at men, Sinatra was 35, and Brando was number one 1 at the world's biggest actor, "Luck Be a Lady" was number 42 100 years, 100 songs, film 23 was 100 years Musicals, and it was the number 36 of 100 greatest music. Very good!
