Good old black and white Graham Greene is based on people in dangerous times who are doing heroic and mysterious things. Hardly a blow or a hit and a hundred times more interesting than what was today drawn by Hollywood. Bacall naturally lights up on the screen and Boyer is fully involved. They don't make such films anymore.
