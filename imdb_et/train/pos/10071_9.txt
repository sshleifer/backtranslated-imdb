When tradition says that the artist has to hand over his great skills and magic to the heir, the aging and very proud street artist, known to all as the "king of masks", the young man's apprentice becomes desperate to receive and grow. br /> <br /> His warmth and humanity, tho, find him paying a few dollars for a small man who has destroyed natural disasters in China, in this case the great floods of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Take your new 7-year-old companion to live with your valued and beautiful monkey "General" to discover that your child is a child. <br /> <br /> His life is changing instantly, because the love he knows about this little slave girl is embedded in an amazing tradition that requires him to go through his art only for young men. <br /> <br /> There are many stories in this ... Many people come into contact and Chinese culture opens up to our western eye. Thousands of years of legacy come from a drama tea cup, and few leave this DVD behind the dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not as big as I found the entire sound level across the meter, and would see video transmission lines in several parts of the film. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
