When you see this movie, it should be noted that this is not an ordinary film. It has no real story, only a number of gangster characters that fit together perfectly. Dialogue is wonderful, you can just put back and listen. The film shows why it is difficult to describe it correctly. <br /> <br /> The reason why user comments on this movie are so confusing. <br /> <br /> For one, love the movie and recommend it to anyone who loves one liner and things that are different from normal. You can't really put a finger on this marvel, it's just a comic world where the gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. The movie you see more than once.
