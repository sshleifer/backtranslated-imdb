Kay Pollack (the man behind this film) is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways. He has written a number of good and well-written books on how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. In most of his books and in this film, there is a message that your thoughts are actually your problems and that the cause of your anger is never caused by what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy but hardly ever do it. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn very important in life, you must remember your minds and listen to all the "hidden messages" (or instructions for life) that most parts of this movie contain when you listen and watch. Look at it with your ear. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and get the most out of it ... <br /> <br /> So look, remember: <br /> > "Mind is like a chute, it doesn't work unless it's open!"
