Ulysses as a movie should not be compared to the novel in any way, because they are two completely different entities. Nevertheless, the film still retains many of the elements of book work, but as it is a visual media, it is more difficult to draw a stream of consciousness. I think this is the best film they would have made with the material ... and it comes from someone who routinely talks about films that are not similar to their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still fun.
