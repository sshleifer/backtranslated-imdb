Looking at it again after many years of remembrance and remembrance of the flop that was in its initial release, I am surprised how well it has grown. One of the reasons for this failure was that one generation thought it was superfluous and the younger one was disappointed that it did not show complete hippie honor. Seeing now, it is clear that Antonion was already aware and fascinated by the enthusiasm of the keen changes and the lack of a clear vision of the future. The lead couple are great and it is a shame that they took so much of the perceived failure of the movie. They are ideal and perfectly convey different contradictions and show that they love love. I blame others for emphasizing student insurgency queuing at first, but I have to say that it is one of the most beautiful leaders in the search for images and definitely got the best people and nature. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned a very explosive end.
