Rob Roy is and passion and action are underestimated! Liam Neeson is giving his career one of the best Rob Roy MacGregorit. Jessica Lange is perfect in her husband's Mary letter. They have the greatest passion and chemistry I've seen on the screen pair. The best filthy aristocratic performance. Tim Roth is one of the big screen villains. Her rape from Mary is disgusting and harassing. He's a really big movie with this movie. The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best sword fighting. Scripted ans kicked and Michael Caton-Jones direction is flawless. 10 out of 10
