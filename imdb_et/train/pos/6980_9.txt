I have to admit that I was one of the skeptics who predicted the prediction prematurely before relatively anything was disseminated. I decided it was going to be a cheap spin-off headed by Ronald D. Moore, who holds the retcon-wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot gives an excellent impression to the viewers. Access is wonderful! Of course, experienced BSG veterans will find themselves in plots that focus on the development of cylinders before the first war. (58 years before BSG pilot events). The pilot also allows newcomers by clearly presenting their plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Don't be mistaken: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are presented with an enthralling, brain-drama marked by provocative, courageous and contradictory ideas. Casting maintains BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are just amazing. The depiction of Morales by Joseph Adam, inspired by the portrayal of Olympus by William, gives a glorious look to William's heroic father. The portrayal of Stoltz by Dr. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions. <br /> <br /> If the pilot's quality shows what's up, RDM and the creative team have continued their BSG-legacy TV shows with another masterfully-created television masterpiece.
