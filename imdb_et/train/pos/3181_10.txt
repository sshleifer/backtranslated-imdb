I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, where he won the best picture. This movie is great, with great pain that works well as a band. My favorite performances were Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. There are also some great effects with dragons and cockroaches that I was surprised that this film was made with a small budget. Writer-director Adam Jones, who I believe he also received his written prize, is doing a great job. Audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed keeps you all laughing at the movie. Surely it must look.
