I was a little scared because of watching this movie. But Italian titles like it never met and I love the step so much that I decided to try it. And how surprised I was! The story is different from all other recently seen dance films that have a deeper meaning than just "winning". It is touching and well written and well targeted. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts, she is so mature and focused and ATTENTION TALENT (and what talent Rutina Wesley is, my jaw fell into the last dance picture). Honestly, inspiring is how he dreams and doesn't let him stop. The fact that he is not a typical super-hot chick (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her truly attractive and real. Seriously, why is this movie so low? In the first 5 minutes you realize that it is a good job. Actually good. I even called at the end of the movie. And the dancing routines are just sick.
