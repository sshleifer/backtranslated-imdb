Fortunately, as a student, I have been following "Diagnosis Murder" for several years. Basically it is a doctor who solves the murders with the help of his LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM offered 8 extraordinary entertainment. What changed it from many other police events and what is worth seeing many times was its casting and the quality of writing. The main majority gave good results and the roots of Dick Van Dyke's entertainer appeared through magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM were fast paced, clever scripts and, of course, a toe-tapping score. Unfortunately, it is unfair compared to "Murder, She Wrote". DM is much better with more sophisticated concepts to solve and diversify. Now the TV is in a worse place. Gone are the emotions, family-friendly policeman. Now it's just a frustrating "sharp".
