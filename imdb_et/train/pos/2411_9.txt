This film strikes me with one of the most successful experiments that has ever been able to find plausible answers to some of the nagging questions in the recent scholarship associated with "Passion" (Christ's suffering and death) accounts in the New Testament. (What motivated Judah when money was not a problem? What could bring the Sanhedrin to meet high on Sunday? Why did Pilate fall?) This is a film of a Christian of serious thinking: "The passion of Christ" is undoubtedly a lack of eye-catching and archival characterization. As for yourself, I find the portrait painted here - the willingness of ordinary people to sacrifice as intelligently as their own interests are at stake - much more realistic and deeply disturbing. (Interested in "just my job" to look at a person's eye that drives the first pound on Christ's wrist is as cold as any moment on the film.) The film does not require "authenticity", but settings and costumes always feel more "right" than much more recognized efforts. This is a slow film, but if you agree with the limits you have set yourself (that is, after all, "death" - not the life of Christ) - then ultimately very rewarding.
