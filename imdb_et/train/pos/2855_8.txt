An entertaining and meaningful movie, Non-Stop has made it worthy of comparisons with "Run Lola Run". The film evolves rapidly into a tracking sequence, during which viewers become aware of the three main characters through setbacks and sequences of dreams. Chase is not a fast paced peak, but a journey that makes up the majority of the movie. During the "Run" we see that the characters grow and forget for a moment their harsh lives, the "macho" roles they have bought, and finally forget why they started running first. Similarly to the struggle for "clarity" for the characters of "Fight Club", the characters of this movie have the opportunity to evade the false values ​​that we all create in society for us. Running them is a way to truly flavor the life from the unshakable point of view, and all three find some clarity and joy in the process. where instead of learning from their experiences, the characters seem to return to their wrong macho roles, which I thought they had escaped during their trip. <br /> <br /> But the only real problem with this movie is that it wasn't previously distributed outside of Japan.
