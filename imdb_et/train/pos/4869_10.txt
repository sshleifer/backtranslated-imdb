Not for people who have no quick mind or Balkan blood drop in the veins. If you don't have one, you can't understand it. And if you don't understand, you can't enjoy it. For example, if you think Picasso is the name of a Citroen-produced car, probably when you see the Picasso painting that you just walk around, judging it to be a street painter's trash. :) So do not judge before trying to understand it :) Finally, I think it's all with an open mind. My N1 still remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember, not all things can be framed. Because there are things in this world that every frame doesn't fit.
