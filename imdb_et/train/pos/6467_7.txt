Two movies back on Indian violence; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story about a man who gives everything to someone, Deewaar focuses on the main topic. It is not hidden that many Indian violence rages in Pakistan for years - for whom India is not a Govt. he has time or compassion or no other side. I'm sure some of Pakistan's military personnel are in India, but we're focusing on the film. Full participants. Some were directors such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays Major, did well. Akshaye Khanna did well. Amrita Rao had nothing to do with a couple of giggles and a couple of songs. I think Sanjay Dutti's role was the safest, though it wasn't too long. He was doing well here and his dialogue was also impressive. Comparing it to LOC, which was nothing more than a daily movie where the story went in all directions (when that story was) - Deewaar is a well-managed film that keeps the pace and justice for all participants. 7.5 / 10
