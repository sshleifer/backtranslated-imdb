Frank McCarthy, who compiled the Academy's award-winning biographical film Patton, is following it with great respect for another American fighting force, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a person, his genius and his egoism a strong character. With MacArthur, you never knew where one started and the other fell behind and too many times when they interrupted. <br /> <br /> The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour movie or a TV mini-series. It would cover him for his days at border crossings with his family until the West Point, where he still has the highest average of scientists ever achieved by the cadet. It would talk about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legend that builds bravery on the battlefields of the World War I Israel. He should also say that he unleashed the bonuses for veterans of the First World War of 1932, probably in view of the final Kaboshi opportunities that President Herbert Hoover had to re-elect. In recent years, MacArthur had suites on the roof of Waldorf Astoria in Hoover and New York. It must be the topic they avoided. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the years 1941-1952 and is said to be a setback. The film opens with MacArthur, who turns to the student body in 1962. When he speaks of the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's mind goes to World War II and his desperate struggle against the emerging Japan on Corregidor Island and Bataan in Luzon. The film takes his struggle to win back Phillipines, the Japanese occupation and the first 18 months that culminated in President Truman. <br /> <br /> MacArthur as a movie does not work at all when it was not represented by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman as President of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flander. This is part of the movie I enjoyed best, seeing MacArthur and his relationship with both men. <br /> <br /> O'Herlihy FDR captures an aristocratic squire and an extremely fearsome man who was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was a man who got his points with unusual fineness and wit. Sometimes he liked somewhat too much for his own, but he was the main politician of the last century. Note how he works with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and as a potential rival at the same time. <br /> <br /> Flanders Truman is how people remember him, dumb people who did not like MacArthur's horror. . Of course, in historical books, Truman released MacArthur in 1951 for a contradiction. MacArthur was unreasonable, there was no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> But I can write a full dissertation on Truman-MacArthur's relationship. It does not have to reach the crisis ever. I have always felt that FDR would have solved the whole thing much better if it were still president. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also very beautiful, and Gregory Peck is catching some of the stories of this beauty that made him so much a legend as a victory on the battlefield. Listen to Peck on the Japanese handover, MacArthur's farewell to the people before the joint session of the Congress and, of course, his speech to the cadets in 1962. See the newspapers and see if you agree.
