Great British Indy movie! The fantastic chemistry between the three main characters creates some fun drug-fed kits that Cheech and Chong would be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels on the big screen (even if he has changed sides from Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and pamper women! He loved the last fight scene he nodded to Zulu, and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he put himself in the pop ... ... he didn't act .... he's really good faith in British hippie! !! You don't have to be a biker to enjoy it and it's right on my Friday night after the pub's recurring viewing. <br /> <br /> Let this movie go and you won't be disappointed.
