For decades, many Zorro films have been made, but it's shameful that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. <br /> <br /> The Zorro fighting lion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First, it is in the 12 chapters of the Republic series. And this time, Zorro hasn't played the star of a top studio like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, or Antonio Banderas, but Reed Hadley, an actor-like actor. Although Hadley does not have such a strong presence during the proceedings as others, he does enough work to help him not be the only hero here; as the title suggests, he also has a fight legion. Another big difference is that the device is not California. This story takes place in the center of Mexico in 1824, where a living god-suffering person induces the indigenous Indian population and the illegal band to help him overcome the newly created Mexican Republic's overthrow. Something, Zorro and a handful of followers are going to stop something to stop. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, at least one incredibly fun moment for an episode, so-called. sound effects for ridiculous actions. In general, however, it represents all the best press and probably the best Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most serials and will never be incomprehensible or inclined. Action - Fans of Indiana Jones Films Mark a Lot of Bits Borrowed From This Sequence.
