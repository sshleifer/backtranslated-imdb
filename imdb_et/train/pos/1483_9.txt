The sophisticated modern fables telling that marriage promises to be relaxed and eventually relaxed. The main thrust of the narrative is "homily", which is spoken by the state priest, following the wedding of the young cosmopolitan couple of Milan. It identifies the future course of marriage, which is a bit of a tension in modern life. The "moral" story of this story is that in order for the marriage to work now and in the past, this relationship is needed by both the family and friends. This film was a relative blockade of Italian standards. It's a terrible shame that this movie isn't available in a DVD or VHS file.
