The performances of this film were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric gave this Jim Thompson novel in this great adaptation an excellent result as "Kid" Collins. This movie, which was a good film, was far better than the "Grifters", a movie that really fell off the roots of the cellulose fiction / movie, which the story came from. I recommend this movie to all movie noir fans.
