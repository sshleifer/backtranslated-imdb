Queen playing is difficult. On the one hand, the actor must be majestic and imperative, and on the other hand he must show vulnerability in a difficult situation and a collection of courage and resolution to overcome the odds, because almost all queen films are the main line of this plot. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is quite as radiant as Victoria, but it is not as perfect as I would, she is not blamed. I can't help but feel it is a new adaptation of Mills & Boon compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young Queen Elizabeth. So Blunt doesn't get at least a royal game of emotions, at least not in full, because he's young, Victoria. To see Old Victoria, see Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice for a movie. The last time he did it was C.R.A.Z.Y., which was great and made him famous. It was quite a different film, but I remember it is great and it is probably the main similarity between the two films. But when Vallee wrote to C.R.Z.Y, it was Julian Fellowes, and although I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story of this movie was much less interesting. Soon I lost all government policy. Perhaps it was less appealing because the monarchy was not possible to intercept. I'm just saying.
