Great. A robust and real life in a pioneer space on the western plains, with an emphasis on the role and place of the woman. A moving film that is loved and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent film; never made money. Certainly, the pioneer is not a romantic, unrealistic version of Hollywood.
