This is one of the best ever made movies. This is a realistic idea of ​​the life of rural grazing, which was a great part of American history. It's 1906 Wyoming, where life hasn't changed much since the last century. The film preserves your interest without the added Hollywood myths. The whole family sees this film and is interested in how life was like in America when it was mostly a rural citizen. With this film you escape from the present and witness the daily life of 100 years. In a beautiful, picturesque environment you can see the hard physical work that was needed to survive, and the constant concern and concern about the elements and market pressure that make progress between success or failure. Watch this movie and experience life as it was in the history of most of our people. This movie is worth your time. My only question is - why not have such movies yet?
