The film was filmed on Movie Flats, directly on route 395, near California Lone Pine, to Whitney portals. However, you may find splashes of cement and iron wrought in plastered over the stones where the kits were built. And you feel the area of ​​any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about the plot because I'm sure it's elsewhere. The movie stars are three athletes - Fairbanks fils, who must have learned a lot from their father - Grant, an acrobat in their youth - and MacLaughlin, a professional boxer from South Africa. Their physical skills are all visible. <br /> <br /> The moment of this movie is not taken seriously. It's about Thugees, the sect of India, where our English word "thug". I can't go through all the surprises in this movie, but I should probably point out that director George Stevens was a polemic background with Laurel and Hardy's films, see his choreography of fighting scenes - and went on to Shane and Anne Frank's diary for a long time to dissolve. The dynasties rose and fell. Geological epochs came and went, while Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed "Place in the Sun". Here, his comic mode, he stands out. <br /> <br /> This is a story of male tying and it would be easy - too simple - to read homoeroticism as many people do with Howard Hawks. Or anger for women. But that's not at all. Sometimes the things on the screen do not deserve too much under heuristic attention. Men make bonds by working together so that women do not. (Women share secrets.) Read Deborah Tannen, someone's idea of ​​an antifeminist. Well, if you think about it, it should have been evolution. Most of the history of humanity - about nineties of this - hominids have been hunters and collectors, men tend to hunt and gather women. Hunting is more effective as a team company. The men who weren't very good at joining were Darwinianed, leaving men who had a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaughlin have got this pot. <br /> <br /> Sorry to talk about evolution, but I'm an anthropologist and this is an occupational disease. Did I ever tell you that a horse in Vaitong, Samoa, slipped on cement and fell into a bath with me? Joan Fontaine is beautiful, really. Only he got to know in his later years and wondered why he was in so many films. I lived in Saratoga, California, where her sister Olivia DeHavilland grew up and went to the monastery school. Pretty place. <br /> <br /> If you miss this grand British Empahh adventurous, living farraginic chronicle, you should never forgive yourself. It is so famous that it is Peter Sellers in The Party. Yes - Colonel must know.
