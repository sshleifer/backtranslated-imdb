When a small hobby named Frodo Baggins suppresses his uncle's magic circle, Gandalf examines that the ring is an ancient master of evil darkness. When the ring comes back into its hands, it gets back its power and destroys the Central Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends tried to destroy the circle with warriors. This is an underestimated adaptation of classical novels as it only covers the first part of the story. Regardless of this, it is an epic and perfectly animated film. <br /> <br /> Animation is perfectly done with a rotoscope that tracks real-time video. Ralph Bakshi worked well with a small budget. The film also features Leonard Rosenman's great music that fits every scene. The script has some holes in the plot, but it must be apologized, given that the original agreement was to make the book trilogy into two films, which was much in the first letter. My biggest grip is some character designs, Samwise was a little too funny, the other hobbies worked perfectly normal. The other characters are actually well-written on the screen, and the people working with the voice are doing a good job, I was pleased that Legolas is actually a little more useful for the plot. Rotoscopic orcs are more comical than scary, while circles are horrible and worrying. In general, I think that a little more money and better writers would have done so much justice, but something enchanting about it. Ralph Bakshi boldly adapted the screen of these classic stories. The film is terribly painful to mask live movies, but it is still a great movie for animators of all ages.
