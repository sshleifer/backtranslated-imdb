The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parent's father's birthday, which sometimes has a tragedy, the question is what this year is, and you are surprised ... This is a very well-prepared film with a story that has perfect humor and seriousness a balance that is rarely seen. You get lucky, you get hurt and basically everything. Finally, you can't fall in love with Mia (if you're a boy I think (main actor)) She's a very well-chosen actor, like many other actors / actors. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
