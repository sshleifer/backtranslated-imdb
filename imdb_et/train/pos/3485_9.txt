This Wrestleman just didn't do it for me. While some things, such as warfare and the involvement of celebrities, were a setback for old times, it seemed to be "In Your House" rather than anything else. Over the average ... it's worth a few games, like a tag team title match, although it's worth noting that changing the title meant something because it was the opposite the next night.
