Raising Victor Vargas is a movie that you definitely need to see. It was a very affectionate feeling and had a lot of humor that sucks you. It's as much as the real life that teenagers have to go through. Victor, a brisk teen, but at the end of a good heart, loves all the right places for girls and family. At the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love when he deals with the old-fashioned grandmother and the girl he wants to use, actually using him. I suggest people watch this movie because it's like you look at a real family. That's how much the film is. One heart felt a moment when Victor's grandmother throws a victory through something simple. Victor was really a heart and couldn't believe he was doing something like that. It made me feel it was real. In general, I give this film B +
