For me it was more of a wake-up call and understanding that most of us all see, hear, read, and think depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of high-level spin doctors trying to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people with a constitution they bought freely do not influence this media control or any attempt to deceive. This again shows that at the end of the day, the needs of many are actually weighing on their little needs. It is also enlightening to see that in a country where there is no religious civil war, democracy is not really difficult to implement.
