If I think that Jedi's return is epic. Yes, Ewoks was there? They are an interesting addition to the film (not to mention that they are similar to Vietcong, who were also able to take a technologically advanced army of primitive acts). Jedi is definitely more darker than the rest of the movies. The best part of the film was Emperor Palpatine (represented by the amazing theater artist Ian McDiarmid). Palpatine is so evil and cruel, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers. Speaking of Darth Vader, what an amazing end to such an iconic character. Vader is really a modern Greek tragedy and I think people can understand and appreciate this after Sith's revenge came. His redemption at the end was mobile and really brings you a happy but bitter feeling. The best part was of course the special effects. It's amazing how the film from the early eighties can still try out your graphics with time. The Jabba Palace Scenes (Finds Amazing in this metal bikini) and of course the epic three-way battle at the end is still a stunning look. In all of Jedi's deep plots and emotional moments (mainly between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke discovers the truth for Find), the incredible special effects are the best end to one of the most enjoyable franchises in film history.
