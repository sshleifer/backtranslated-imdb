I've always enjoyed Pokemon movies. Yes, I know that all these are very sharp, mediocre in a certain area and firm, although they are aimed at small children who are in some areas too adult to be able to protect them, "Hey, lighten, it's a children's film," but all that is left out, are they still not good entertainment? I think they are so and I enjoy them very much. It is just as enjoyable as the previous three and definitely. It has some really sweet and touching moments as it is a nice and fresh introduction to Pokemon Celeb. This is not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third installment, although the third is not bad, and the whole series is just fun, harmless, the popcorn family fun and shouldn't be considered anything more, no less. This film has some signs of intensity and interest, especially around the peak / end, as well as all the contributions and characters, while slightly weaker than the previous three, I thought it was still pleasant and humorous. These films are the lowest and most criticized of the four feature lengths and do not deserve it.
