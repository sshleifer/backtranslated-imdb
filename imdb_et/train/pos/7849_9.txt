This short is a mess. The word fails here because it is almost indescribable, technically extraordinary after more than 90 years (visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing), this is not something you look for when you want things that are everyday or "normal" because most certainly is not, it is strange, gang, it is worth the pay, but if Ren and Stimpy such things make your head hurt then you could skip it.
