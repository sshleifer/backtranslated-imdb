It's a great documentary. Every fan of the car should have a copy of this outstanding film. Director "Stephen Low" did an excellent job and the main characters of the movie were father and son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and sounds amazing. And best of all it's IMAX! Great home theater test drive.
