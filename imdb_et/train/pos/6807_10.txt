I have copies of both films from the classic classic, where Robert blake is a mighty fine actor, where most of the 1967 movie Blake is more shown in a jail that tells about his childhood, where he killed the family. to show much in the classic that really went, doesn't tell us what actually was killed, but it's a great eye catcher when you watch the 1996 movie Cold Blood, which the classic does much more.
