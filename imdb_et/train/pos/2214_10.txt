My family goes back to New Orleans at the beginning of the 1600s at the beginning of the 1700s and watching my movie I knew my grandparents had never spoken, but we knew it was there. I have obviously black relatives, ie African Americans and others who can "move" white and choose not. It's hard to see history when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that the Roman River is part of that history. It makes me want to cry, and it makes me want to hit my grandparents' ass, who owned these plantations, and wonder how my big grandmothers lived on African heritage under this oppressive and yet aristocratic existence ... And at the same time I didn't would have come out of this history, I would probably not be a successful business woman who today lives successfully in a fairly integrated world. The actor was both an actor and a great actor, but it is a film that needs to be done. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself why she "symbolically" writes about my family and I'm not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
