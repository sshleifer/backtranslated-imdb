Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on the European train. These two come from a very different background, he is American and he is French after they talk a little about the train. Jesse manages to get out of the Celine train and explore Vienna with him. Over the next several hours, the two Vienna Vienna will take everything the city has to offer and entice one another with madness. But does this renewed relationship last past the sunrise. <br /> <br /> This wonderful romantic comedy is a fresh air boost to the genre that has fallen. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" has never been "small cast" because of being boring. In fact, it is flourishing thanks to the tones that make you love your characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. Smart dialogue makes it essential for romantic fans.
