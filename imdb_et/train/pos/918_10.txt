If anyone is interested in collecting this film, PLEASE READ THIS COLLECTION: First TV show by CBS on November 30, 2003, TV on Christmas The sequel to last year's city without Christmas Peter Falk reiterated his role as a versatile guard Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Sister Kathleen McAllister, a divorced small town, whose depression ... over the hospital ER she claims can force $ 100,000 in debt for a short time when she puts a picture in a photobook journalist Noah's newspaper. Greeley (David Cubitt). The photo shows the bravery of Noah's brother Hank (William Russ) who left the city 25 years ago, and has never been seen since then. Hank would like to quietly explain the city without explanations or fanfare, but it would be impossible if Noah's newspaper posted a $ 50,000 fee to identify Hank, known only to the public as "Christmas for Christmas." And this kind of photo is very curious: it also shows Santa Claus, which probably floats without a passenger. This hard-to-understand "Santa" is, of course, an angelic Max who appears all the time and reveals the whole story for solving various problems, giving advice, tying up a loose plot - and even sharing a musical duet with Kathleen's talented girls Socorro (Jennifer Pisana). <br /> <br /> ASKED CUP: WRITE US HERE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
