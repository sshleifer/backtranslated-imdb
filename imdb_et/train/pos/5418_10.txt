Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in the 19th century in India who, with the help of a waterboy (Sam Jaffe), are freed from the culture of a murderous cult. The actors' chemistry helps to make it one of the most entertaining films. Sam Jaffe is extraordinary because it is a boy who has been thrown out and who is all abused and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. On a voluntary basis, Rudyard Kipling's poem is based. Must see anyone who enjoys this type of movie.
