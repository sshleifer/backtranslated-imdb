Where the sidewalk ends (1950) <br /> <br /> One end, the other begins <br /> <br /> This is a prototypical noir of the movie and as such it is perfect for both style and content point. view. Photography and night settings are first higher (Joseph LaShelle lets the scene to relax on the scene) and close-ups are pure expressionism. I can only watch this visual film when the actors fight and the plot smells. <br /> <br /> But here for the first time, and on the plot, what I consider to be the core of most of the Noir films is the alienated male (who represents many men who returned to the United States after the war returned). In fact, not only is Dana Andrews a convincing, lonely detective, but he has a small but important colleague in the film, the head of a female (first) spouse, adorned with a former GI that fell in difficult times and a boy. The fact that one man kills another may be of monumental importance, in general, an ordinary boy who struggles with his internal problems, while the medals carrying the medal slip into a random death with a silver plate. The woman moves from one to the other - we assume that they will marry and have children, as suggested in the movie earlier. Even if it pulls on it after the interpretation, we see another man caring for psychological luggage through the crisis with the highest moral order - turning himself against small crime just at the moment he's actually got it. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more modest and mobile type than Kirk Douglas plays a similar role in William Wyler's detective event, which was only made a year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You can easily see both of the movies next to the textbook comparison and contrast session. The fact that Andrews as a detective Dixon is morally struggling through it and Douglas as a detective McLeod cannot explain why one man gets his girl and the other does. Gene Tierney pulls out a very sympathetic, frightening and ultimately normal and "real" type of woman - not just the priest, which is desirable, but someone to whom Dixon actually marries. The criminal plot is indeed secondary to the main drama, but it is effective enough to play with types and clich√©s. Bit portions are kept gently, small details (like portable craps tables) are nice, far away from the actors' characters or Casablanca gambling glamor. But then Curtiz's big movie is still in detail - it doesn't make any effort to be subtle and real and penetrating, but is sweeping and memorable and inspiring. They come in the opposite direction of war and represent conflicting opportunities for their leading men. Bogart starts his active work, Dixon and Dixon have killed him. Through, thoroughly, but not washed. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that for many, perhaps most, movie clips, what you call "happy" endings. The man wins his opponents and turns his inner self and the mover, then and now, understands how beautiful that feeling is.
