Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve several murders among the wealthy after the show. <br /> <br /> Usually I hate too complex secrets (like this one), but I love this movie. It moves very fast (only 72 minutes), is beautifully managed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just accelerate the narrative), is a very brilliant story (including a solution to the murder of a locked room that was simply incredible) and very good. <br /> <br /> Powell is very happy and big as Vance - he doesn't seem to be acting - he is Vance! Mary Astor is not given much to do, but she adds class and beauty to the production. All others are also very good, but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. She is a very good actor with a very special voice and some of her lines were fun. <br /> <br /> Basically, the great secret of the 1930s Hollywood murder. Worth viewing. <br /> <br />
