Despite narrow narratives, Johnnie To's elections are known at such times as he had ever been in a longer picture, where many characters and plot lines were abandoned or ultimately unsolved. Some of them have been dealt with in a really great and much better order, in sample 2: harmony is in the round, but it is still a reliably appealing thriller in the disputed trio elections, along with the usual shootouts and explosions (though not violent) in the ever-changing alliances that can turn to a phone call the time needed to do this. It is also a film whose most ruthless nature is not always the most endangered, because the end of cooling is too clear: one can imagine that all the trauma that one of the regrettable bystanders poses needs psychological counseling. br /> <br /> Simon Yam, too often a changing actor, but always at his best in To's, may never have a better lead, especially because Tony Leung's much more extravagant performance makes his silence more powerful.
