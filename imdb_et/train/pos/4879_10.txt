A Chinese scholar, who critically criticizes the noble national, warming politics of the clich√©s around the emperor in the military Japan, is accused of being a "communist" and jailed for life. His loving husband, who fully supports his wife and his ideas, is left alone to save his family from hunger. This film is a great shape that has been set up for the role of the mother in human history. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not only a subtle, but a monumental scandal in the title role that she did not receive in 2009 as the best female role in the Asian Oscar. It went to a young girl who had a very limited ability to act. <br /> <br /> This deeply moving and most "human" feature is visible to all "real children".
