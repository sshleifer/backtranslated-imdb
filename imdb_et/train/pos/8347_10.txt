Maybe I'm rating too generous ... but I love this movie! I've seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I love it again. It's just a simple romantic comedy that has nothing big or monumental. But I'm a great romantic and this movie * is romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins and Walter Mathau is so funny. Scientists make me so ridiculous ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's such a clean, good movie - and it's so rare now! My 20-year-old brother also loves this movie, so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) I advise you if you need to laugh, or if you are just lonely and you need to * look at romance if you can't attend. This is good!
