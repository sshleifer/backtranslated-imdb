I'm afraid it was a movie that must be CALLING to get something out of it. I'm not a useless movie like ..... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58", what do you know where Riggs is really crazy? it is not a film that is the end of the beginning. You can run anywhere to talk on the phone to do whatever and enjoy it somehow. I have previously noticed that most people who do not like this type of movie are the type that will do the most for anything but watch the movie and then slam because ... .. duh they don't get it or don't understand it or what happened. <br /> <br /> DON'T SEND BIRTHS!
