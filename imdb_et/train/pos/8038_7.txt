Two snipers travel to the jungle to find their targets; slippery South American drug addiction and outstanding overall. <br /> <br /> With a moderately successful seasonal atmosphere, sniper is the most reliable thriller on most accounts, taking time to create characters and their hardships and tops in some good sequences. Director Llosa is not always able to maintain the mood and could have tightened this story somewhat; some detours here do not add much. But this film is much better than its Stallone / Stone travesty Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, which is usually incredibly tiring, surprisingly well, as the inexperienced sniper informed the veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this film was his last great big budget Hollywood project. He can do this role in his dream, and he is very convincing here, repeating the role twice of the DVD aftertaste.
