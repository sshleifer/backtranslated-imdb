This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was "enchanted", I should say and be surprised because it was uniquely made. Cast, sequencing, impact ... everything! Great! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what was remarkable elsewhere was that it was said to be entertaining, healthy. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a contemporary fairytale performance. . It's like a modern peter pan ... just amazing <br /> <br /> I'm sure to buy a copy of it from the moment it came to the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double black this one ... !!!! 10 stars!
