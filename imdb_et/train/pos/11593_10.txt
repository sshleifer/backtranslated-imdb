I remember seeing this movie as a child in Disney's wonderful world one day. This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I've been looking for it. I have to say that of all the children's films that I saw, it was more than all of them, and after only seeing it once, I hoped I could see it again. The story and pictures of this movie have burned in my memory. To date, I never saw it back in the 1970s after that day, actually I didn't remember the title until the internet search was released to me earlier today. I loved it and I want my kids to see it. Does anyone know where I find it?
