I've seen the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are definitely great, but there is something terrible sweet about Powell and Arthur chemistry. Jean Arthur SHINES when he looks at Powell. There is unmistakably low pressure between them. This film may not have the Thin Man series, but it is undoubtedly its charm. When I looked at it, I was sure that Powell was dealing with Arthur. My friends thought the same. This is one movie where I wish I could step back in time (dragging and licking lips with Powell!)! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to a "perfect person". Okay, that sounds too much, but I can't help myself.
