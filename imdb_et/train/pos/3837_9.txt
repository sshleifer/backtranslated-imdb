Forty years ago, when films touched on issues that are not yet acceptable in "courtesy" societies, they used codes that allegedly flooded most of the audience's heads, warning those who knew what it was. Probably a decade of film was not as enthusiastic as the strange hidden Desert Fury placed in a small gambling chest in Chuckawa, somewhere in the California desert. The Purple Sage Lounge and Casino is owned by the amazing Mary Astor, snacks and cigarette holder. The city is driven by a handful of daughter Lizabeth Scott, looking at Technicolor as $ 20 million. But listen to the dialogue between them, which refers to the older lesbian and his young troubled companion (one can only ask if the original script by A. Bezzerides made this relationship explicit). Even more daring is John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey in his mad jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster to the sheriff, mix and sit back. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall to Scott. However, it seems that Hodiak has not only a past with Astor but also a woman who died in suspicious circumstances. The high sun heats these ingredients for hard cooking, where facial slappings are abundant and admire the shifts. Don't move this hothouse melodrama full of exotic flourishes when it's your way; this is a remarkable movie.
