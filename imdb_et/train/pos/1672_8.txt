Scorpion's tail is a very stylish giallo, directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be the only giallo-master for Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote the mystery of this fabulous, dunnit, rather complicated but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder. Ultimately, it is also worthwhile to have a big plus, because it is not always the case for the giallas, because they tend to stretch the credibility of their endless red herring and final solutions. The less you know about the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> The pure giallo brands offered here are beautiful cinematography, a memorable music score, proud women (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black gloves murderers, and explicit sexual scenes called some parts. <br /> <br /> In most parts, it has been working well, Goerge Hilton has done quite well with its usual suicide and others. Martino guides his hands, keeps things tight and with some terrible sets of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you are a giallo fan, it must be visible. If you want generally well-written and arresting thrillers, this is highly recommended.
