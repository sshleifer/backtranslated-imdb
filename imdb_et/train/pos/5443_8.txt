What it is, it's a pretty good movie. I like both Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both produce strong results. The interest of love is OK, but it's more of a man's movie than a good date movie. I love Harleys, and I hated to see these colors in handmade lacquers over 14, which had good old army olive oil. Here is a little history lesson that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played an important role in World War II. I don't know if the training was such bunches! The film kept my interest all the time without being slow, with good riding arrangements. I love watching the demographics of the voice history - an 18-year-old man gave a film 10 (a real bike lover, I think). I'm not giving it to 10, but I gave it to 8. I don't weigh every movie on the same scale. There are films that were big budgets, with big actors, so you think you're good so that if they fail, they won't be big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak. So it gets a lower rating than this movie. I look forward to more George Lucas.
