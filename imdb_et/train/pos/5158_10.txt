There is something convincing and strange about this episode. From the very beginning, the atmosphere of tension arises with the knowledge that a certain planet will explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have come down for the evacuation of the population, all of whom seem to have been left behind by unknown parts, except the librarian of the elderly. <br /> <br /> Librarian's polite but secret advice, where all citizens have come to an end to the crisis, where all three members of the company's team suddenly come to different ages in the past. Kirk finds himself in an era similar to England in the 17th century, while Spock and McCoy are left in abandoned, frozen waste. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two readings and the different dangerous situations in which men get in is perfectly handled, the return to the present is an unknown opportunity, while the minutes count as an explosion on the planet. <br /> <br /> Imaginative writing and fine-tuning characterize the episode that Mariette Hartley has left as a woman in exile until the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as a city librarian. The classic episode City For The Forever is somewhat reminiscent of the story of a rich and compelling finale that ended one episode later. It has to be one of the best series, especially remarkable given the generally lower quality of the third season.
