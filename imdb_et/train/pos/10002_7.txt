This is the best undervalued film by Brooks Cannon. Of course, its faulty. This does not give a realistic overview of homelessness (to say differently, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of salon singers or Titanic gave a realistic view of the Italians you know). Many jokes fall into the apartment. But still, this movie is very pleasant, as many comedies do not, and the story of some of the most traditional members of society is truly impressive. He is not a Fisher King but he is not. My only complaint is that Brooks should have led someone else (I love Mel as director and writer, not as a leader).
