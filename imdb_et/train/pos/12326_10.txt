I saw this movie for the first time at the Berlin Film Festival and I had never seen a Hong Kong movie before. I felt like I was sitting on a skateboarder: the action was so fast and there was no dull moment in the movie. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when Taoist drinks, songs and struggles themselves - one of the many scenes that emphasize the extraordinary musical component of the film. This movie is a sure black!
