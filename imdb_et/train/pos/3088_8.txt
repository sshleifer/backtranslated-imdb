Unfortunately for me - I stumbled with this exhibition until the end of this life. I only got some episodes (about three) before ABC canceled it. I loved characters and story - but most of the biggest actors! I was a Sex and the City fan so I saw two characters I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was & Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared") as well as Jay Hernandez (Carlito Way: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan) . I enjoy watching the young actors and I felt that this exhibition would push my career forward. I hope it gets back to the DVD at least, and maybe WB will take it for another season? In the meantime, I look at it from the beginning of the ABC website.
