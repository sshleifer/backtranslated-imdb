This is t.v. should be. And pushing Daisies meets their expectations. The beautifully designed and well-designed exhibition, Pushing Daisies, is one of the few examples that will fail, be good for the whole family and create your imagination. It does not mean the normal activity of every other exhibition, the corner of sex, money or murder. This is a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic piece may seem impossible, the concepts are real for us all. You want something you can't, hoping someone wants us, runs away from the past and look for a family, even in the most unlikely places, etc. <br /> <br /> I know ABC has basically canceled this wonderful exhibition here and will probably replace it with some exhibitions that go beyond integrity. I don't think everyone will come back with money ... it's too bad that there are no other shows in ABC that really know you after watching.
