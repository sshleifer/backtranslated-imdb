It lasted from 1959 to 1973. This is more than the longevity that talks a lot about this series. It also changed in the fashion and taste of the '60s, the psychedelic 60s, and was popular in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I remember the repetitions of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements, stories, pains and productions that made it extraordinary. Lorne Green had its iconic character in the series. His complaint was between generations. All family members could enjoy it. It balanced morality with violence, serious humor. As a result of this effect, a comic strip was made out of it. It is a shame that this series is no longer repeated and many do not know its importance.
