Sometimes it's hard to say why a movie is so effective. From the moment I first found "Stone Boy", something said it would be a great movie. Nevertheless, it seemed very unlikely that I would ever be able to see it myself. Then one day I saw my local library's online catalog that they had recently purchased the DVD edition of this movie. What I am very happy about is the depth and quality of cinematography, which the old VHS copy can never be copied. <br /> <br /> Speaking of cinematic art, I have to make it as far away as this film is the most stunning aspect of this film. As a photographer who deals almost exactly with The Stone Boy's visual style, I am sure that a large operator can carry a movie with almost one hand. Here he has a lot of very talented stories and a director who fully understands what the story needs. But for Juan Ruiz Anch√≠a to be behind the camera, almost every scene makes beauty. And you can almost never say that. Most movies will never wait for such a thing. The scene after the scene captures some details, a bit of visual magic that takes your soul away. <br /> <br /> Director Christopher Cain has had a long and interesting career. As much as I can collect, this film is not very representative of it. But sometimes, to get a director at the beginning of his career, before all the big budgets and the loss of focus, there is a real exquisite magic. Cain returns to this film, lets things happen in their lives and then more. Just like in the early days of John Sayles films, the characters are given room to breathe, talk about time. Side stories happen because they do, and that's life. Cain displays a remarkable, raw, even painful understanding of human history in this film. <br /> <br /> Work a lot on this story together. When people speak when they are in this movie, they do it to the real people, not to play the characters. The Gina Berriault Script allows a huge amount of talented and respected actors, such as Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Frederic Forrest, to just spend time. Whether the things they have to say are small or deep, all that falls on the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> If you look at the participants or the great sound of James Horner, it seems strange that such a movie is almost forgotten. Perhaps a big part of what makes The Stone Boy is the time it was made. In this picture, this is a pair of feelings of the 1970s that reminds me deeply of my childhood. People are talking about the 80's in terms of contemporary style and music, but it is not the 80s I lived or remember. The appearance of the images, the undervalued and dark awareness of the actors, and the overall result should get under the skin of every person who grew up in North America in the period or near it. I see myself in that. I see how I saw the world. The film, like The Stone Boy, sees the world as it really is. <br /> <br /> To get this feeling, please see: <br /> <br /> Black Slave (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Hearts (1984) ), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993) Roan Inishi Secret (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
