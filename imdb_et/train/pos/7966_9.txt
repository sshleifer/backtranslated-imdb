As a child, I thought this film was great. He had animals, it was beautiful music and he had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. I love this movie for various reasons. It is a well-trained animal that is put through various stunts and scenes that look great on the camera. It has beautiful, well-written music that fits perfectly with the scene, the fast-paced melodies and the heartbeat that is still crying. Even when people do it. And this is my favorite actor Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> Based on this book, this story is about three pet pets, intelligent, too trusting, and the name of the father's lab, Shadow's name, witty and vain - but still smart - a cat with fear of water called Sassy and street-smart ridiculously curious and a little neurotic bulldog, Chance. Three of them are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Animals are breaking and worrying, planning a trip through the Sierra Mountains for their life trips. A truly incredible journey. So what a mountain might be at home. But what if it's not? <br /> <br /> I recommend Homeward Bound to people who like three amazing players who give the characters the lead characters, and to someone else that ... yes, everyone is going to see it.
