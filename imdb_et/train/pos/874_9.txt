This film draws you so deeply into two main characters. I put it on my laptop without reading the cover (not to mention talking) and intrigued two solid hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that occurs between the secretary and the offender is almost felt even without physical contact. After all, I couldn't decide what more I wanted: our hero and heroine to pull out of their capers or just complete their passion. RML could have been done without a curious subplot and the traditional 100 minutes would have been a lot. I'm sliding. After several Netflix, Blockbuster, and local library duds, this film restored my faith in great film art.
