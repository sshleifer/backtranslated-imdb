The film can be great. I just watched it last night, but I feel like I can't give this honest opinion because I first read the book. The book is so much better than the film I was disappointed with. If you intend to watch "Human Bondage", don't read this book in advance. On the other hand, this book is so good and contains so much more than a love relationship with Phillip Mildred, but you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie. I'm not making this statement lightly. I read the book on average every 4 days and read various authors like Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Respect for People" becomes my voice as one of the ten novels ever written.
