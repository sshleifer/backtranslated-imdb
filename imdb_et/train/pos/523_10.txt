Why is this film not the best of 250? This film still looks amazingly fresh 56 years after its production, but it could only have been done after W.W.II's perception of the closeness of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped in one unexpected moment. And what after life? At the end, I liked the meeting and the gathering of all nations. A phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer, a typical British judge), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) defends Peter Carter (David Niven) and also June (Kim Hunter) against American prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - that's why it's American) . It's all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing film, a real "tour-de-force". The message of the film is clear: the law is the most important in the universe, but nothing goes beyond the love between people on earth. The way this beautiful story is spoken is more interesting than any Hollywood movie could ever do.
