A Bug's Life is very detailed. Everything is covered. The film looks good and animation is sometimes jaw. The film is not too frightening, it is basically a modern seven-samurai of Kurosawa, only with errors. I liked the interaction of character, and the bad guys in this movie seemed really bad. It seems that Disney usually makes his bad guys a copy. The cops are threatening and Hopper, the leading bad man, was a brilliant creature. Check it out.
