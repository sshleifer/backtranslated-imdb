The obvious parallels of Walt Disney's charming fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. There are more coincidences than comparing Bedknob and Broomsticks to Mary Poppins, although many of the same creative talent went to two Disney films. country and live in the country. And these children have to deal with magic. But unlike C.S. From Lewis, Rawlins kids have charmed their world and help fight the people who are doing this and now. No return to the fantasy kingdom like Pevensie's children. charlatan like David Tomlinson. Mrs Lansbury did not become one of the most rewarding performers. She wears her magic brand, which even Disney's special effects boys didn't get. And they won a competition for the Oscar Magic Kingdom for this film department. <br /> <br /> Two performers continued to say goodbye to Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played his last role in this film, he loved many movies in the UK as one of his best-loved music hall performers. And this spectacular actor, Reginald Owen, is a retired man who guides an old home guard in war and song deals to film the audience around the world. <br /> <br /> Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, who wrote Mary Poppins' scores, wrote good and caring here. The incredible time was nominated for the Oscar, but he also lost his victory. Personally, although I like David Tomlinson's respect for this most colorful London street, Portabello Road. <br /> <br /> Bedknobs and Broomsticks are a subtle fantasy movie that will stay well after nearly 40 years. Imagine what computer generated graphics would be like.
