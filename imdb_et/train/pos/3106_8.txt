If the films were not seen before (and could not stand by Matt Damon), I didn't want to see Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see on Film Film AS. <br /> <br /> But I was pleasantly surprised that even Damon's film can be enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Fast fighting scenes, crazy motorcycle races and BIG explosions were the ones that kicked you in the TBU from your seat. Immediately between CIA and Bourne, you will keep you on your toes and quietly entertained. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, many things are really grated with cheese. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the fact that the movie was just Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA series. This sequence was repeated and ultimately boring. Although Damon kept us entertained and always looked one step ahead of the CIA, I was a little annoyed by Bourne's persistent survival. He crashed into the car and found out he'd done it or something! Very unreal. <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - SHAKY CAMERA. It was so trembling that it was quite noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even instructors). The instructors were told that if we ever use it on a film made in the classroom, it would be automatically wrong and we are told that we would use a tripod. Fair enough when Greengrass wanted it to look like we look at Damon and Stiles in a conversation, but certainly our heads would not shake violently! <br /> <br /> But TBU is an enjoyable movie everywhere and it's worth watching. But I didn't think it was the best film of the year, despite being a fun movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
