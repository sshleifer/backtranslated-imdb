What a wonderful, fictional movie "Stardust" is. <br /> <br /> I can easily end this with one statement and say it could be a very strong suggestion to see it. <Br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems to be bent to force reorganization and post-seam, "Stardust" makes us remember why we're going to the movies for the first time - to get to the reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives on other times or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with childish joy we all long for. ghosts and fools. It has a hard cover, a hero, criminals, obstacles, weather, antidote, charms and even light speed to make it almost modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is about a man from Wallis, conveniently located next to a wall that separates his city from the magical kingdom. The only way to pass the wall is through a generation that is carefully guarded by an obsolete predator (played by David Kelly perfectly). One day, Wall maneuvered a young man who maneuvered an old guard and escapes through the floor. He happens to be fascinated by a kingdom called Stormhold, where he meets a chain (and a very sexy) young lady Una. He is a witch in captivity and strapped by an unbreakable chain. When the witch is away, Una Beni seduces and sends her on the road. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later, he is invited to a wall where the old guard gives him what you can expect - boy boy. <br /> <br /> Boy, called Tristan, is growing up as a pretty unhappy young man (Charlie Cox), who he's out of and out of his league. Nevertheless, the young lady (called Victoria and Sienna Miller) once with Tristain and admits her love. After they reach the falling star, he tells him that he can get him if he pulls the star and brings it back. She agrees with her endeavors that lead her to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the king of Stormhold dies an old king (perfectly by Peter O'Toole). He calls his remaining living sons to tell those who follow him on the throne. His sons are called Primus, Secondus, Sextmus, and Septimus. Other sons killed by other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives in the throne. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he throws his ruby ​​magic into heaven and Voila so that what brings the star to the earth <br /> <br /> The star runs on a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and she of course wears a charm . But little does he know that Tristain, the princes, and also the aging so-called Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) persuade her who wants to cut the heart of the stars to restore her youth. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes, yes. But it all comes together when the adventure opens. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Yvaine, but is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria, he doesn't know the growing relationship between him and Yvaine. His original interest lies only in the return of Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But he must first go from the prince and Lamia. The princes are not such big problems because they are trying to kill each other constantly - and just like "Pirates of the Caribbean" - death has never been so funny. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also faces a witch who enslaved her mother (though she doesn't know it's her mother) and a flying pirate band led by Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> He is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays it on the road. He steals the film with his toughness and soon we will learn a secret that leaves the audience laughing on the floor. Although its role is small, DeNiro is extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia - a sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is the most suitable confused and troubled Yvaine. She does a perfect stables. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett, and Mark Strong add a perfect dose of relief to the princes who, when they die as smiles like "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> <br /> Director Matthew Vaughn, whose only management experience was "Layer Cake", worships the enchanting story that everyone enjoys. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" may be too complicated for babies, but anyone over the age of 13 wants to see this movie several times. It's so good. "Stardust" is what movies should be. Perfectly written, completely cast, completely guided and fully functional. In other words ... perfect.
