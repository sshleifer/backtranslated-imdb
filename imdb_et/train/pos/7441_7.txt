Personally, I find Jerry Springer's exhibition bad, but I found Ringmaster the most funny film I saw this year. The endless satire of Jerry Springer's "guests", starting from the opening, keeps you laughing at the whole movie. Despite the short scenes in which Jerry Springer attempts his existence unreasonably, I definitely recommend this for the entertainment value of the movie.
