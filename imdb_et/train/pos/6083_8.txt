Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and best of all Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I think about it. These are the four most underrated participants and they work beautifully together. It's like a poem about how they play each other and their natural ability to feel like they were the best buddies for even taking pictures. <br /> <br /> The film itself is good, and it can be quite intense to see for the first time, and these four stars will greatly revisit. I can't describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey on the screen, the biggest moment when they looked at the pair from afar and filled the vocals themselves, it brought me almost tears. <br /> Good movie, big cast, look. Why? Four words: Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
