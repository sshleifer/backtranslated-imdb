Land is essential for children and adults. My son was very fun to watch these funny birds and polar bears. We can learn a lot about this movie and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some animals at risk of disappearing. It is this problem that should prevent all the authorities on our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many extraordinary images I've never seen before. Then it's well accompanied by celestial music. The director did a great job here. Nothing prevents me and my family from reaching the highest rate. I hope so much that things create a stage.
