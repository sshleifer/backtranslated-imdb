If the average of the votes was fairly low, and the fact that the video store secretary thought it was "just OK", I didn't have much expectations for renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But contrary to the above, I enjoyed it a lot. It's a charming film. It didn't have to grow from me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks delivers excellent performance as a leader, I think it is different from his usual personality in his films. <br /> <br /> There aren't many funny jokes or things like that, but there are some pretty fun scenes and it's generally very enjoyable and very easy to watch. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
