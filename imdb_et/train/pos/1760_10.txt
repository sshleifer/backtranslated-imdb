He learned of his secret identity, when a trio with good meaning is completely helpless with friends of female workers (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each of them more fun than the next), decided that their friend would start regardless of the price. The following is an unlikely but very warm-hearted romance with a living mother (a wonderful Keener who is very fun here), giving Andy more fuel for fires. Surprisingly good-natured and unapologically dirty romantic comedy; most funny because director Judd Apatow and Carell have a very attentive scenario "There's something about Mary" that has some amazingly intestinal interrupting sequences, including a nicely accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic breaking, "date-a-paloozas" sending, and a real war winner and an instant class;
