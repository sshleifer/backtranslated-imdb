I've only seen this movie about 25 years ago, and so far I've always told people it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Given that there was no verbal dialogue and only a discussion, I found this film to be tempting and I even found myself breathless to make any sound. I want to recommend this movie, I want it available on DVD.
