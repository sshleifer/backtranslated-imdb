I think this is what this film wants us to say at the end of the movie! or fuck Australia? I still don't know, but what I know is that I really liked this movie, but it couldn't be my favorite movie! <br /> <br /> A great story with big actors, but with a terrible tip ... shout and say, "Oh, he's so good" ... But who did it? What really happened? Who is this guy? No answer to these questions ... <br /> <br /> A mysterious movie with a good overall character ... I'll give him 8/10 what's going on at 8.5!
