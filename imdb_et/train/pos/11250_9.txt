Having just seen the A Perfect Spy mini series, nothing can be done, but to make a hat - a pure masterpiece that is quite different from other Le Carré minis. <br /> <br /> Minis about Smiley, this is Alex Guiness, like Smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the participants just support him, can be said. <br /> <br /> Here is an ensemble and a story that is important, as the main actor Peter Egan played great in recent episodes is not charismatic at all. <br /> <br /> Egan is just a boy called Magnus Pym, who is lying, being devious and telling the people they want to hear is all very big and big. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is his Czech handler Alex. <br /> <br /> The spy machine and / or the betrayer has never talked for the better! After watching your life at a very young age, we fully understand what makes it a traitor. His ability to lie and falsify all puts his "perfect spy" as his Czech artist calls him. <br /> <br /> By observing your life, we fully understand how difficult it is to go back straight and narrow when you have avoided it. He is losing even if he does not get any economic out of this, except for the promotion of his MI5 spy masters. Everyone is happy when the flow of counterfeit information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father, who played excellently with Ray McAnally, is a non-good man who always dreams of bringing out people's money. In later years he must rescue her son again and again. But on the model of his father and uncle, who takes his father to prison, and his mother is sent to shelter, Magnus quickly learns that lying is a way of survival, not to tell the truth. At first, he crossed a bit, but quickly learned to speak the right lies and be constant, not to change the stories from time to time, that he tells those who want to listen to himself and his father. <br /> <br /> His Czech handler Alex, who has expertly played Rüdiger Weigang,, with the help of Magnus, creates a network of informal informants that provide British MI5 with counterfeit data for years and years as Britain did spies in Germany, who acted before During the war and war in the UK, Das Waterland sent counterfeit information long after agents themselves had turned, liquidated or just replaced MI5 men. <br /> <br /> Young boys who play Magnus in the younger years do it perfectly and most of them are more charismatic than the older, little cynical and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But you buy the difference simply because it is often as we change through life, from enthusiasm to sadness or indifference. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it's worth the money!
