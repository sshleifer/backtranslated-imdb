It surprises me how much I love this movie despite the fact that I really don't like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche do a fantastic job with Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and animal behavior is just amazing. <br /> <br /> I've already seen this movie 72 times (I know it sounds scary, but it's true!) and every time the end scenes still get me. I recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. It's really my favorite movie of all time!
