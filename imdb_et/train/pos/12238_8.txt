I have always liked this comedy as one of the few who are seriously trying to deal with the US government's annual tax application. Ever read the tax law? Despite allegations that this is fair, the Tax Code has always made the lion's share of the middle and working class, not rich and influential. Most special settings are for their use - pass the average 1040 or 1040A form and look at the different investment and business activities that have different rules. Most people can never use them. <br /> <br /> Here's a story that a wealthy landlord (Philip Ober) is using his leverage to break the IRS that his neighbors (Paul Douglas and Una Merkle) have not paid for 20 years. The IRS Baltimore office is located under Fred Clarke and he is paying attention to Ober. He sends Tony Randall to check the situation. <br /> <br /> Randall believes that Douglas, Merkle and their three girls and two boys are quite decent people who rarely need money (they get through their farm). produce and exchange with neighbors). But Randall, who is trained on the clear (IRS) lines of the Tax Code, is trying to put the family on the fundamentals. But gradually, Douglas notes that Reynolds loves Randall and keeps his fingers away from Rand, eventually getting drunk. It is also difficult to leave on the beach if his two sons from his car engine are removed for repair. <br /> <br /> The plot follows the growing attractiveness and friction of the city, the vaguely ambitious Randall and the land, life-loving Reynolds. They're actually doing a lovely pair. Finally, after Ober complains, Randall is sent back to shame and Clarke (tougher cookie) goes to a brass strike. And there will be a huge tax amount that can destroy the Douglas family. <br /> <br /> The film does not end - it ends happily, but it reminds us that the power of power is to destroy power and the government is too often destroyed. The million-turn option saves the family, but it's so rare that we know it's just a dramatic trick. What is more realistic is how Clarke's chief (Charles Lane) cuts down on the nature of Ober's aid, pointing out that his taxes will be reviewed more closely next year. After that, Ober is quite green.
