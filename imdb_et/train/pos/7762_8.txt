In her autobiography, Laureen Bacall indicates that Bogie told her that she should not make such dude films like this or something. And when he wrote in the film "For the Wind", Sirkil had only three films: "faded angels", "time to love and time to die", his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally "Imitation of Life" (1960). Then there was silence. Actually, Bacall and Hudson characters don't care Sirk. They're too straight, too virtual. Dorothy Malone-who was a substitute for her former German star Zarah Leander and her brother Robert Stack gave the plot a main interest. Constantly built, most of the movie has a long-term setback. Brothers and Sister's instability from the wealthy Texas oil owners' family brings out the bright clothes and rutile cars that go on top of the line. landscape. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the film is stunning: a suit and a chignon playing with a small robber: he is ready for life, rebels are tamed. Now alone, because he has lost Hudson (but he was never in love with him). This end is a bit reactive, but melodrama is par excellence reactive, three years later, "life imitation", Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) is accused of not knowing her.
