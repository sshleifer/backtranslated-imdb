It could have been a better movie. It shrinks by points, and the central story shifts from Boyer, fulfilling his mission to Boyer, avenging Wanda Hendrix's death, but Graham Greene is the author who is really hard to spoil. His stories are moral stories resulting from his own catholicism, guilt and innocence considerations (very relative concepts in his worldview) and human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Luis Denard, a renowned concert pianist who is Republican in the Spanish paramilitary. He has been sent to England to try to carry out a arms purchase transaction that is urgently needed. Unfortunately for Denard he is literally in itself - all his contacts turn out to be a semi-finished for the Spanish Falagists. In particular, Katina Paxinou (Mrs Melendez) is the innate steward and Peter Lorre (Mr Contreras) is an "Esperanto" international language teacher. Wanda Hendrix is ​​a girl (Else) who works for Mrs Melendez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken), is already called by Falangists. <br /> <br /> The Britons (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander and the best - if not the worst - George Coulouris) don No hope for Boyer's reason (which he will probably be in the UK before long). Herbert and Mander leave just behind the official neutrality policy commissioned by the governments of Ramsay MacDonalds and Stanley Baldwin. In Coulouri, the typical type of Blimp column here is always impeccable in English, he is sharp to show his foreigners generally uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) is one of the hopes for the game, trying to play her role as well as she can - but she can't really. He is an aristocrat - daughter of a press officer. It was Bacall's second film, and (sad to say) his long career sank almost. He works well, but the spark shown on his first film was due to Humphrey Bogart's lead and Howard Hawks. Boyer is a good actor but he is not Bogie and Herman Shumlin is not a Hawks. His next film returned him to Bogie and Hawks and his star continued to rise. <br /> <br /> This is a gloomy film (like the novel). Boyer's mission never succeeds because he has too many hidden enemies. But the villagers are also losers - often with their lives. <br /> <br /> Dan Seymour is a suspicious foreign tenant Katina Paxinou (and her destroyer). It is worth noting that Warner's many character actors are trying their best, given the weakness.
