Winchester 73 receives credit from many critics to bring them back after World War II. Director Anthony Mann needs to get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart is doing a great job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire are stealing a movie where they are two bad guys who took part in a high-stakes poker game won by Winchester 73. reading. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson on Young Bull. Thanks to God, in a few years, we would begin to let Indians play in Western films. The film is black and white and shot at Tucson in Arizona. I don't put Winchester 73 in Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane, but it gives me an upper middle recommendation. <br /> <br />
