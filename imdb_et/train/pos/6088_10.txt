Was the script more suitable for a 30-minute sitcom? Yeah, but they do it! I thought the actors were doing a fantastic job, otherwise a blessed script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on board really seem to hate this movie. Personally, I don't see how it could be, but Envy is just one of those movies you love or hate. Like Napoleon's dynamite and all the films ever made by Leslie Neilsen. You think this is one of the worst films ever made or one of the most funny. Don't avoid this because of movie reviews. Look at it and see if you are one of those who really like it! If you do, I guarantee that it is worth your money. If you don't ... well, now you know.
