The Perfect Son is the story of two 30-something brothers who are seemingly "perfect" and the other who is basically screwed, often landing in drug rehabs. After the death of his father, two will be reunited after a long absence and the usual sister competition will be restored. Only when the "perfect" brother makes an astonishing revelation that he has AIDS, an irresponsible younger brother will eventually make his life in order and take responsibility. <br /> <br /> Nice job crowning the return of a younger brother, although this may sometimes seem a bit far removed (drug beating is never so easy). What makes the film more urgent is the treatment of AIDS - a topic that has changed in the cinema over the last 5-10 years. Also, the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two former brethren is very credible and well done. The two main players were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> Strong primary effort by director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose own brother died of AIDS. The end is well done. <br /> <br />
