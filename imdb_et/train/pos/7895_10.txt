In the scenes that opened the film, the man shot his room with arrows in the bathroom of another man and blew all the lights. It had to be at a very good level in 1936, but rather a way out and the film had nothing to do with it, Robin Hood didn't look as far as I could see. But Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "August Whales," 87 was very young and attractive, and one of his best roles in the long career in Hollywood. Daisey never graduated from the nightwear and the so-called swimsuit she was hunting with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "Spiral Star", teasing or very sexy. Daisey even offered a marriage to Johnny with Ferris Wheel upside down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a great pair, assuming it was very rich and another very poor reporter. Off, Davis and Brent had a real stormy love, which is a good reason why these two films appeared. If you like Bette Davis and George Brent, this is your movie!
