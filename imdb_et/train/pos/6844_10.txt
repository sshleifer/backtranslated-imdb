"Dressed to Kill" is Brian DePalma's best film, which is an absolute thrill that is unforgettable today. DePalma is upside down in Hollywood because most people say he's out of Alfred Hitchcock. He doesn't. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma shows in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the "Cut to Kill" original uncut version is no longer available on video. The current copy, issued by Goodtimes, is a R-Class approved by Jack Valent. But there are still some copies of the original DePalma. This is a green cardboard box distributed by Warner Home Video, featuring Angie Dickinson on the cover, or a black clip wrapper featuring a silver-lined theater poster. These are what you get when you find a copy. I have green and it is my valuable property. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back the story. Dickinson plays a sexually deceived woman, Kate Miller, treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for her obsessive fantasies. While traveling to the museum (DePalma's real workout in camera work and mid-term review), <br /> <br /> Miller is raised by a stranger. You can pretty much guess what happens to him, because the ads and boxes give the story away. But there are some complications. Whore (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius who has decided to deal with a crime. And Elliott's autoresponder has a message ... with a missing razor ... <br /> <br /> I don't break the movie at all, because what I described above is going to open half an hour and DePalma's biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour during the period. This film, however, is explicit that Valent (MPAA leader) is demanding movie cuts. What surprises me about what he wanted. Several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two splitting scenes, and some of Nancy Allen's dialogue (Valent's "cock" became "nervous"). This is a movie that is very violent and bloody, but the objections are sexual. I would like to hear Valent's explanation of how to see how two women in the delightfully loving scene "Lost and Delirious" are more harmful to the young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger blows people with a chain weapon. It's just not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes "dressed to kill" so good is that not only technical credit is first-rate, but performances are also very good. Michael Caine, who was a lot of nonsense during this period, gives one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, probably because she has a strong role here. Nancy Allen adds it to her performance, which is associated with one of the most underrated and neglected actors in the world. Keith Gordon is great as a genius and I loved all of these inventions. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he earned. The latest joke on the AFI 100 Best Thrillers list showed that very few people really know what a thriller is. If they wanted to open their eyes once, they would see DePalma being in their career thrillers and actually being the best champion. It's even better than Psycho. It's a shame that very few know it. <br /> <br /> **** from the four stars
