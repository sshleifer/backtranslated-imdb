One of my favorite movies. It has everything - kiikheli, Eddie Clark politely, ex Motorhead, activities, laughs, a completely ridiculous plot and the most amazing 80's stereotypes. Eddie, a nice guy who just wants to be alone to be different, Leslie (about as wet as they come), Nuke (stone burning), Eddie's mother (pathetic), Roger (geek) and Ozzy as preacher America?). Then the boys (rich, witch and stupid) and the girls (free, vain and stupid). What more could be asked? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, Sammi Curr, a rock star, every 80s badass-rocker amalgam you mean. But is that a rocket burner? Then there's a scene where Sammi pulls the old ladies off the TV screen and crushes her. And what does Roger do? Why, raise him up like a good geek. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainey gets his long-term reward from Samm through a magic finger. then check it out. It is available on DVD and very cheap (trick or) to treat yourself.
