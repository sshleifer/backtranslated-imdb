For those who say that this film deserves something below the unpleasant grace he showed, I disagree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. I ask you to consider the fact that the documentary has been made. The courage to shoot this movie is the most remarkable. We find the two brothers divide when that moment happened. They continue to document bold courage without knowing their own and each other's security. To judge whether it is more subtle to record this tragedy video or save life, it's not a wonderful, amazing firefighter. I just know that after 30 years, a class full of kids doesn't know one without another. <br /> <br /> I play 10 with all my heart. To capture the real life that real life offers. You can keep your kung-fu spam. Romance is lovely. Action never reaches that level. This movie, September 11, is timeless because it did not praise itself. It didn't look at it. It did not include all the blatant misfortunes that many lions of many films have on many screens. It had a class, peace of mind, content, and it was a day that changed the face of America and even the world today. He talked about things that were inevitable for the camera's eye. Please see this movie as it proclaims itself, to all those who fell due to America's free and beautiful name. <br /> <br /> How you can show less, not beautify, the natural bravery of real people who act in unrealistic times. I love "Godfather," but "9/11" is a different film forever, because it is a different world now. This is art without questions or questions. <br /> <br /> jf
