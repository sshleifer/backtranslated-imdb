This is Belgium's absurd dark comedy. Stylish black-and-white photography, Man Bites Dog, is in a fine form, like Roger, an angry, obsessed little father of a small family, a sullen Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, together with his young daughter Luiseu, is taking pictures of traffic accidents. He is also obsessed with winning a car, entering a competition where a competitor has to break the record - and he decides that his son Michel must try to break the door constantly - he even hires an overweight coach to train him. Michel dresses up as Elvis and is on-site in the radio program called "Cinema Lies", where she describes the mistakes in the movie. Luise is a friendly fan of nearby Felix, a dove. Roger is a harsh figure when he pushes the border over Michel's record-breaking, almost causing his death. Around the film are Magritte-like surreal images. It is undeniably charming and worth your time.
