When I saw this developed DVD box and the terrible red queen figurine, I was sure I was a big disappointment, but a surprise, a surprise, I loved it. Of course, the incomprehensible and unforgivable contradiction that such a complex setback should be rushed to hardly be able to read subtitles, let alone ridiculous explanations. These prisoners are different, but the movie is a dream. Fabulous ladies fabulous outfits wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and comes with a wonderful Bruno Nicolai score. He may not be Morricone, but he may be in those lighter pieces. Really enjoyable with lots of colors, lots of sexuality, some murders and minimal police intervention. Super.
