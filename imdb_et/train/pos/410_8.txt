I borrowed this movie on DVD without knowing anything about it, part of watching a movie every night. After a series of terrible American action films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors hit me perfectly as original textiles. The story is a complete nonsense, but I found the sincerity of the movie, the heartfelt and the complete irony refreshing, and the film seems remarkable. Of course, the special effects are not as flawless as Hollywood produced, but filmmakers are wisely interested in color, composition and movement as realism, and so many pictures are breathtaking. With one shot, two supernatural characters stand on the banks of the rocks of the shore, which is a large moon facing them, perfectly balanced with the three elements. In another, the princess warrior pulls the sky behind her glowing sword, like a rocket looking for heat. And the colors explode from the fire, which is used to express emotions rather than represent reality. <br /> <br /> Characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic books that do not provide a great depth in themselves, but refer to archtypes. that resonate deeper. Physically, many actors are amazingly beautiful. They play their roles straight, without irony or cunning, and so are plausible. <br /> <br /> The strange thing, despite the clumsiness of the plot and the thin testimonials, I found myself very close to the tears at the end, I moved the actor's beautiful simplicity and courageously with the original, heartfelt vision. <br /> <br />
