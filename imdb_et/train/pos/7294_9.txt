After reading a number of comments, I felt I had to add my two cents. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I've ever seen. I was able to see it at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt this film was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complicated - especially in a short time. The story is focused on a young girl who has fallen victim to her abusive father. Soon he will be given the opportunity to "stop" him with the demon played by "Witchblade's Eric Etebari". After watching the show, I was astonishingly impressive how he played such a unique and different character. I didn't know he could do so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very convincing. His actions were absolutely excellent. The girl was okay and the dad was decent. It also has a death that follows a girl until she can escape her future. Impacts and cinematography were completely remembered. I don't know if they had at least one hundred thousand budgets for that. It's rare to see such a high quality short. Opening was absolutely breathtakingly comparable to all the major feature films. This does not mean that it is not without its mistakes - I thought it went a little while and the intro was a bit long. But it was with my head to see it after a day. There are very few pants of this quality level.
