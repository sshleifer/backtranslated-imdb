Yes, Keaton looks like he really enjoyed the movie. With her jump in her tailor's costume, she reminds you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is a young hood who only pays his mother for high quality medical bills and sends his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to school. No one even knows Johnny Kelly dangerously later. Joe Piscopo is a pest and doesn't like Johnny (and I don't like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a beautiful singing / dancing routine, while Johnny rejoices. I love this part when they are in a constantly changing holiday car! The police who "invites all cars" are the jumper on Gilligan Island! Look at this laughing gangster of the 1930s! The gags of this movie are fun, but you have to catch them or stay behind! See the background of each scene.
