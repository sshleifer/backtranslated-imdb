Miike makes a children's adventure movie, unlike the Endless Story. It's actually one of my few favorite films. Even the worst Miike is better than a good movie, but there is a lot we recommend for the Great Yokai War. It is at least as clear and unpleasant as most American childrens. I think the kids themselves find that they like it a lot (DVD contains English), but like all Miike movies, it can move very slowly. This means that you have some strange inequality, sometimes with a loud sequence of action and the next scene dragging forever as characters to chat. The story itself is not very good and Miike's persistent lack of uncertainty brings his ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. It must be Miike's most expensive film and it looks fantastic. "Yokai" is a Japanese spirit and they come in all different, fantastic forms and with costume designers, a special effects team, and all the other design people did a great job. I have seen the 1968 film it is allegedly based on (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), and the cheesy rubber suits found there have become more believable entities using modern makeup and special effects. I especially liked one of the bad guys (or girls in this case), Agi, who are doing dark shadows, dense, white dress, white bee hairstyle and whip. By the way, he has been playing by Chiaki Kuriyama, whom you remember, like Lucy Liu's teenage girl Bill Bill: Vol. 1. The hero of the film is Ryunosuke Kamiki, who casts votes for Miyazaki's enthusiastic competition and hope for a moving castle.
