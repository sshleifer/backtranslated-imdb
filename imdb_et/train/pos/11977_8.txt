OKAY. Who brought the cheese. I love it. During this time it became a phenomenon. Anorexic Twins became popular.Bob Saget started to make a salary (instead of his really funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. This is when life was good and simple. This is one of America's great classics. It was humorous and always brought a good lesson. And this is where I differ from the norm: I liked the recent seasons. Similar to Home Improvement, when children get older, there is much more to the script. That's why I dare say ... It could have gone much later than it was. But still. I gave her 8/10 of her healthy, funny story and Bob Saget!
