One of the heartbreaking films was that dry air fishing was a big part of this scene. I have occasionally made my own dry air catching times, having tied my flies and accompanied my brother and my father, we spend one day on one river or other way, trying to tempt an increasingly difficult brown trout to fly and fly If we had such incidents as it was , then the differences between us disappeared and whatever the pressure of the world was doing to replace the glory of this activity and the place where we were. <br /> <br /> It was one of the amazing things that were portrayed in the film as a minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, who performed the ritual. Because there is something ritual about near-by-catch fishing, because there is something ritual about so many pastimes. You can't just start casting your own fishing line and hoping for the best. You need to fix yourself, the water surface needs to be scanned, taking into account how it flows, and where the placement of your airplane may be the best, and depending on the skill level, you may even get your flight from there long enough to be aware and strike the fish. "Fly Fishing Art" was guided and represented so well that they can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> The movie title could not be wrong anymore because the river actually worked through the life of the father and the two sons. However, this film is spreading more widely than the family and community of Montana, along the Blackfoot River, where the film is played. It has the ability to drive you there, fascinate you, defeat you, as the history of the family, community, and period opens. The story we are talking about is not just family history, but life history. What can be classified as "River of Life"
