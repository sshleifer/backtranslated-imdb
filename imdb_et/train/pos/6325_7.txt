This movie is not only fun, with great comedy, but also politically interesting. It was done at the end of the Soviet Union, but makes the Soviet mentality fun and out. The story has been set in the early years of the Soviet Union and it casts doubt on the rationale behind the revolution in both cultural and practical terms. In the late 1980s and early 90s, of course, the strange constraints of Soviet society have already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality are still alive and well prepared for well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, this deep philosophical commentary is packed in a funny and fun package! <br /> <br /> Jur
