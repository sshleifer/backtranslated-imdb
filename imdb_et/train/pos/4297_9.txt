The filmmaker brings a unique group of people every time and then, and lets you see things inside that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did it again. I always felt that Bg Cill was the anthem of that age and he was able to do it again in Grand Canyon. So often we find ourselves in a place where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we hit it. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of this choice. Comparing small and big events that allows us to see how the trivial majority of the things we worry about are truly genius. I've been watching this movie many times and I'm surprised how deep the emotions go through this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline perform their duties with great care, and depicting Stever Martin's film art is invaluable. Thank you again, Mr Kasden
