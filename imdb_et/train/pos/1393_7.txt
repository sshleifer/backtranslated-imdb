Probably the first time in the first season "Shore Leave" is the most special order with its ups and downs; some parts are dragging too long and others are inevitably short, but you can't deny that they threw everything, but the vocabulary to make it a fun episode. Kirk and his team seem to have found the perfect planet to leave the shore after a long workout has left everyone on board who needs to rest, relax and so on. For all intentions and goals, it is obvious that it is an uninhabited Earth with a beautiful landscape and an ideal climate. The first sign that things can go a little frightening is when McCoy, who heads the team, takes Alice (from Wonderland) after a big white rabbit with a vest. Kirk tolerates and finds others to report odd events and meetings. One thing they all have is that every team member thought about the person / place / thing they discovered before they discovered it. It won't hit Kirk or anyone else right now. Even more strange, including Don Juan, Siberian tiger, WW2 fighter aircraft, etc. Kirk meets Ruth, a proud old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from her academic days, Finnegan. Finnegan's driving / fighting scene goes too long, but at the same time McCoy runs a knight's horse wheel and is probably killed. Finally an elderly man appears and explains what happens. This planet is a futuristic "amusement park" where visitors only have to imagine what it appears. Nothing is permanent; McCoy is not really dead. Once this is explained, Kirk decides to order shore stay for everyone. Despite being a dream, Shore Leave ends first in Star Trek's first season.
