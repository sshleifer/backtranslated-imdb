In 1979, I was a young film student when the Soviet Filmmakers' Union came to Sofia in Bulgaria and premiere in Konchalovsky's "Siberia"; Tarkosvky "Stalker" and Danelia "Autumn Marathon". I was in the cosmopolitan dimension of the form of shocked art. Then and only then I saw "Siberia" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless. Better than Bertolucci "1900". Next! <br /> <br /> Andron Hope is somehow negative and makes "the director's full-length version" one day! Of course on DVD! I also fought in the cinema to protect this cinema against most of my colleagues who equated the Soviet film with a bad taste! Time is on my side.
