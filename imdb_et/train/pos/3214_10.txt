I fell in love with this silent drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could play it so well. Todd (Kurt Russell), raised from childhood to war and fighting, is destroyed on the planet after they have become obsolete by genetically modified soldiers. </p> born - SOLDIER. This role is not played by Rambo, not by Schwarzenegger, not by Bruce Willis, not by Mel Gibson, not by Jason Statham - Kurt Russell, who made it completely original, bold and too human. I miss that aftertaste was never done. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> _________ <br /> <br /> my belief: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33 /
