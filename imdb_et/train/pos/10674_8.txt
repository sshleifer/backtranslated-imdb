I disagree with one appraiser who compared this film with American international pictures. Basil Deardon has been brutally staging a realistic film, honestly trying to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post-war England (but without the "Blackboard Jungle" sentimentality). Cinematic art was excellent because it really pulled away the enormous fear and isolation of housing. The legacy looked like an old prison. Stanley Baker was excellent for the toughened detective by assigning to the juvenile division - "Urgent, Urgent - Larkeny - Five Ice Cold" !!!! He thinks he is the butt of many jokes. David McCallum showed that he was one of Britain's youngest fifties talents. (He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker movie "Hell Drivers"). His image of Johnny and his inspired fanatic adherence was very scary. Ann Heywood was also a very cynical Cathie. I wouldn't say there was a romantic sub-block. <br /> <br /> Detective Jack Truman explores firing attacks by someone called Firefly. Just as he finds evidence that can lead to breakthroughs, he is assigned to the juvenile department - he's quite disgusting what he feels is not the right police job. In the middle of the whole heckling, his first challenge - 6-year-old Murphy twins working at the local lolly stores of scam !!! <br /> <br /> In his twin home, he meets his brother, charismatic Johnny, and their bitter sister Cathie. He starts to evaluate how young children can turn criminals into life in residential areas. When he deals more with the family, he understands that there is a strong connection between fires, Johnny and the terrifying Chinese young man who works for the laundry. The local priest (Peter Cushing in an unusual role, Hammer out of horrors) explains that when Johnny was younger he had saved some people from the burning building and had become a hero. He wanted to regain a sense of importance and be useful and felt that he could be illuminated by the fire. The school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the fear of the children - the teacher (just thinking about my safety) runs down and locks them with a terrified gun !!!! <br /> <br /> I thought it was really a great movie that tried to show some British experienced social problems after the war. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
