Wow! Wow! Wow! I've never seen a non-preaching documentary about globalization before I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has a zero story narrative and combines blood film material with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China who live in a factory association. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. But most of their days and nights consist of work, work, and work, but their work material is enlightening and observable. The owner of a factory in China is amazingly open, so he hits the effects of globalization at home when he "punishes workers". After Mardi Gras's beads followed the film from China to Carnival, the film shows how the local is connected with global humor and interesting, convincing film material from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the introduction of plant and intercultural presentations to Mardi Gras through pictures. Here is a movie full circle and shows how images can be a communication and transformation point. The film is never preaching, not guilty and allows everyone to be present. Finally, we - our viewers - make our own conclusions about the complexity and globalization of the film.
