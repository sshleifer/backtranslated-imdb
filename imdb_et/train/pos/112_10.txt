EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must come from the birth of a narrative film almost a century ago. This film is truly unique and genius. Camera work and editing are brilliant and, combined with the alienation narrative used in the film, creates a terrifying and unforgettable movie experience. <br /> <br /> The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in casting is two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow has a great voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> One kind of movie! Four stars (highest rating).
