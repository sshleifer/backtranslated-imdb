I'm obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I love it. I'm in season 2, on disc 5, and I'm telling you I'm too much of a character. To make them feel bad would seriously affect my voice for the show. And Michael is on my list. Kidding ... I'm so happy to see that there is a 3rd season because I was too scared to go to the album 6, I thought it would end. I can't wait to see the rest. Thanks to the directors / producers / actors ... I enjoy watching TV again. Before I disappeared, I surfed through every channel that is sad because I'm disappointed on TV, but I have to say that Lost is my entertainment!
