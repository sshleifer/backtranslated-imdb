This is a strange, brain, surreal, esoteric film. If there is such a concept as "intellectual horror", this is the film. I was afraid to go and I would like someone else to look at me and he has barely a lot! I have to see this movie several times before I feel I really understand it. If you are a person who likes "My Dinner with Andre" and movies by Godard, or if you do a lot of spiritual medication, you probably enjoy this movie. Wow.
