"October Heaven" is a movie that steals your heart, fills your mind with vivid images and lift the spirit. Homer Hickham's story and his dream of rocket creation seem so simple first, especially when the film is placed in a mining town where the future is as clear as mining coal mines. But Homer can't follow his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley (friendly teacher), her father's staff members and her friends, Homer is trying to make her dream come true. There are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us in coal mines, where we feel that the cooling of the miners is under the stones. With lighted helmet and bent position, they were more reminiscent of blind insects in the dark. The hacking cough of miners and black faces was a constant reminder of the danger that miners had to face in their work. <br /> <br /> Heavy-duty mining shaft contrast images are images of Homer and his friend's missile shots. Under the sky's blue bowl, rockets are placed on the pillow and placed in the stratosphere ... And nothing matches the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br /> But what makes a movie so love is the relationship between characters. Homer's father is a classic tempered man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support is also obvious. Best of all, the movie is inconvenient. It doesn't tie everything in a nice bow. It tears you, raises you up. It keeps the reality of the air that is important in such a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film didn't continue with Homer's life. I didn't want to finish it. Then I realized ... this is what a good movie does for a person. When he's done his job, you don't want to stop it. And the "sky of October" will do just that.
