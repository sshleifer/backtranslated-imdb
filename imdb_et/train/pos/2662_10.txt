* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I begin, let me say that I have seen this film on the big screen and that I saw the "Authorized Version" of this film, which was re-invented by Stephen King himself in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both of these benefits helped me to further evaluate this version of The Shining. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I have read Mr King's book "The Shining" over the years on many occasions, and although I love this book and am a big fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's story is revitalizing this story. .. and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows psychic fear straight from the movie. In the direction of the film and during the writing of the scenario, he acquired the title "Sweet" outside the question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. In 1999, the film world lost an excellent director from the deaths. His other outstanding credits include: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: The Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960s and more. <br /> <br /> Torrents (Jack, Wendy, his wife, and Danny, their son) live in the Overlook Hotel in the winter; Jack is employed as a caregiver. His job is to keep the hotel under control for several months of hard snow, until spring when Overlook reopens its doors. It seems that there are many rich and jaded tourists who scream into the Colorado Mountains for a summer holiday filled with snow. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an impressive architecture and staging. It borrowed into the atmosphere, being in the dark but at the same time in a "friendly" atmosphere. Furniture and furniture were all the time (late 70s - early 80s) and the filmography of the approaching scene of the hotel opening is excellent. Not only does it allow you to enjoy the views, but also in your mind when an abandoned and isolated hotel is from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Introducing Wendy and Danny characters was a stroke genius. You get the whole story of your past, Danny's 'imaginary friend', Tony and the story of Jack's alcoholism fluctuating in this nice, clean introductory scene. The history of the past did not need to stretch the film in two hours; probably Kubrick saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> End Day. Again, the scenic ride in the mountains of the Hotel (this time with the family being towed), the interaction between Jack and Danny was fun and also portraying a very disturbing shift. <br /> <br /> The primary tour through the View is quite breathtaking, even if the "employees" move things out, you get the chance to see majestic fire places, high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, Dorman and Crown profiles. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even the "staff wing" is well designed and beautifully built. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> When Jack Nicholson stands in a maze scaled-up model and reaches the center, looking at Wendy and Danny's entry, this is a magical moment; one who tells you right now is a heavy energy in this house; there's something serious wrong, already started. "I wouldn't want to go there if I didn't have at least an hour to find a way out." (Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was genuine and frank. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. You could actually believe you're in a hotel, taking Wendy and "Doc." His explanation of "brilliant" on Danny was very good as well as his conversation with the child Tony and the hotel. It was credible and sincere. <br /> <br /> Cutting and panning the hotel itself, when the mountains rise, rotating the cold air, fog from the warm roof of the hotel surrounding the snow. so much movie atmosphere. It also marks the "half-hell" point; movie turning point. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duvall's Wendy Torrence was a masterpiece. (So, if she was playing olive oil!!! It just shows her wonderful diversity!) Frankly, before I saw a movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oil * * lol * (also Popeye was released in 1980). But I took it back as soon as the movie started. That's brilliant. That Fiendi thinks it's his best performance so far! (Although I loved him in Steve Martin's "Roxanne", 1987.) <When Kubrick has created those pearls for which you , viewer, you have to master: Torrence's past, Danny's broken hand, Tony, hotel history, the fact that Danny is not a "spiritual", but rather a psychic and hotel overall layout, all of them open up in 3 sequences, the film never ends up scaring you . <br /> <br /> Two polished daughters previous custodian Delbert Grady (girls appeared several times in Danny, first in Tony's apartment before the family ever left the barn) were icons that Danny could identify and fear about. haunting (and rubber themselves) and showed Danny how and where they were killed, quite graphically and materially. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's Tony was written as an inclusive spirit, such as the guide of the spirits he had acquired from his body almost by his father. He was ... "a little boy who lives in his mouth." He published Danny's finger at the end and talked to Danny to talk to Danny. Not like in the book, I know where Stephen King was going to be Tony's projection of Danny's boyfriend, trying to save his father. Kubrick left this small twist and made it more frightening when Tony "took ... Danny ... over." The idea that Danny himself wouldn't come back to my younger age is not ... scary. <br /> <br /> Lia Beldan's "Woman's Shower" scene (for which no other credit is found) than the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO seems to have suffered from a lack of work credits before or after) was something earlier or So far it has been seductively unpleasant and thoroughly disgusting. It was dramatic and scary. Dreadful and scary. When Nicholson looks in the mirror and sees his decaying flesh under his hands; The beautiful blade face on her face was so complete and REAL. <br /> <br /> Jack quickly starts his track "jonesing" for a crazy person to be certified. Kubrick carefully and thoroughly documented the deterioration of his mental state. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (just like alcoholics, potential mental patients and drug addicts) depicts his deepening NEED for the atmosphere Lloyd uses him; namely alcohol ... "dog hair that beat me." (Jack Torrence) Jack's on bourbon rocks, Jack's free. "Orders from the house." (Lloyd the Bartender) Nice to play words. <br /> <br /> When Wendy finds Jack's "scenario", there is nothing but a page after the same line of pages is written over and over, though in 8 or 9 different creative styles. .. when he asks from the shadows, "How do you like it?" and Wendy spins and screams with a baseball bat. This is the point where he understands how the whole situation is confusing ... how confused Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and provides a strong presence. This, along with Danny's vision in the hotel lobby that fills the blood, was placed on the scene between Jack and Wendy and the opposite ending with this scene, making it the scene of the strongest possible film. <br /> <br /> "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What am I saying? What mom wouldn't be completely awakened when she woke up to find her young, anxious son standing with those who had a big knife, talking in such a nice little voice, shouting "REDRUM" over and over again? Even if it didn't mean it would be as scary as HELL level 7. It was something that everyone could (and should) remember. Talking about memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's latest attack on his family's ax was probably one of the most scary scenes in the film's history. His ad-libbed line, "Heeeeere's Johnny!" was a brilliant hit and is one of the most memorable scenes in fear history. It also falls into horror film history. <br /> <br /> End ..? The end of Kubrick was perfection. I felt that it ended beautifully. There is no smell for this film, no platinum twitching or no tearful idiotic end. Just filled with perfection. That's all I say about the end topic. <br /> <br /> Who cares about what was taken out! See what Kubrick did. Rent it, check it out, BUY. This is a classic fear in the genre and a good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * I am * ... Take this movie and take it to your Stephen King collection and take the King's 1997 "Authorized" version and endorse it. There it belongs. .: This movie is rated 9.98 by Fiend :.
