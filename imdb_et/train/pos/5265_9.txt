I remember it the first time I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This movie is still great. One original aspect was that the fighting scenes were very short. This means that the "barbarian brothers" are so good that they quickly stopped the enemies! Plus, you have a chase, a cage fight, a dragon, and yes, even a bar! Yes, acting is bad, so it's not ten, but the story has got a lot of criticism. I think it's quite original. Not many movies in this genre have the same original story or colorful dialogue. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
