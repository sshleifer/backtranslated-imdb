WOW! <br /> <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is the best testimony of what happened in NYC 9-11-01 compared to larger media. <br /> <br /> These outlets only show you what's going on outside. This movie shows what happened in INSIDE. <br /> <br /> It begins with a focus on a newcomer to the New York firefighter, waiting for weeks for the first big fire he is called to fight. The subject turns sharply when the first ride is displayed for the first time. Then you will be provided with a front line in front of the firefighters in front of the firefighters, where the fire-fighters will hurry. In the protocols that preceded the crash of the second plane and the next fall of Tower Two, you can see the firefighters who react to the embarrassment of people landing from the lobby. It's a vision you won't forget soon. <br /> <br /> Heart-shaped, tear-like and very weighty from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to go past the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
