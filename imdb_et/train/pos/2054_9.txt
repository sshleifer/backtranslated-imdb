When I first heard about the title, I thought of the "Simpsons", like many other reviewers, but when I saw it, I was absolutely amazed that so many great characters would be in it! First, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction) who plays the title character of McBain. He saved some of his friends at the POW camp in Vietnam, one of whom is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who shares NORTHERN DOLLARBILL with McBain (Vietnamese soldiers are apparently loaded with cash) and tells him that if he ever gets into difficulties he can benefit him give. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, Running Man, Predator 2) join in the rebels in Colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, taxi driver, New The King of York) and if Santos does not fulfill the mission, Christina goes to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks his good Olympic players to help him. First of all, you are familiar with the harsh black man, Eastland, played by "American Ninja" Steve James, who was also the director of James Glickenhaus's previous "The Exterminator", where the real name of the destroyer was Eastland, coincidence? I don't think so. There are also many other references to Exterminator, the most important of which is that McBain itself carries the welding mask when Christina sees her for the first time when she works on the bridge! <br /> <br /> Other men in the Vietnamese package are: A rich man who can afford all kinds of equipment to his team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers) and then there is a document, Dalton (played by Jay Patterson, who doesn't look like a man with whom IMDb is involved, and I haven't seen him from other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, the policeman, Gill, who has had enough of his dissatisfied work, he plays Thomas G. Waites, some of whom perhaps remember The Warriors and The Thing. <br /> <br /> In other big roles, we find Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), a small-time drug dealer who doesn't get a decent job. Also, Dick Boccelli, as a drug-kingpin who hangs on a crane at the McBain gang roof, is almost exactly the same as he hung over John Eastland's meat pipe. EXTERMINATOR movie! Now I have not seen Glickenhaus's "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop" yet, but I am almost ready to make a half-bill bill that Boccelli hangs in with this movie! <br /> <br /> Well, back to the plot of the movie .. they'll go to Colombia and save the day, yay! But who cares about the plot anyway, is great, and action scenes are very well done and you will never see this movie forever! Recommended for all Action Winners!
