Welcome to Collinwood There are many things to do, but this is not one of the following: <br /> <br /> George Clooney Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's based on a movie film. But for Hollywood, this may be the most authentic decade - and that's for me. <br /> <br /> Film is an absolute gas from start to finish. Here's why. <br /> <br /> The movie has no bad results. Funny parts are funny. Extreme parts are sharp. The script contains no boring dialogue moments The cinema is fresh and yes beautiful. And it doesn't match the Hollywood norm (you see what I mean when you see a movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember seeing movie ads. This movie went under the radar after it wasn't much larger in the box, and not even a cult classic. The reason why Transformers 2 is acceptable to visitors to the middle film is that they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If the film is original and funny, because it was pumped out as often as several million pieces of **, the film experience would be a much fresher place - <br /> <br /> When they say they don't practice as they used to be, they didn't see greeting from Collinwood. <br /> <br /> A fun, mini-masterpiece of Capric comedy that refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
