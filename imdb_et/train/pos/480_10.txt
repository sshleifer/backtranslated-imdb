The main aspect of this film that most people don't let is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game. So many people have seen this movie and just don't get it and I don't understand why. As I watched this movie, I was a personal journey that put me up. I'm trying to explain it without spoilers, but warn me, I'm talking about things in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible spoilers **** Be careful! **** <br /> <br /> He is the life of "big moves" and "small moves". She chooses Natalia as her queen and acts like aunt for the first time as a king and queen and for their moves as she introduced her as a boy. Listen carefully to this description. <br /> <br /> If someone asks him a question, he will recall the past as if past moves were reviewed. (By the way, there are beautiful lights). The setbacks are also quite interesting because they not only give their views as a child but also as a point of view of another character. It's stunning. <br /> <br /> Different characters become either her assistants or enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their activities that will enlighten you on who is on their side. Even placing them in the scene is central to understanding what is happening. Beautifully done. <br /> <br /> I do not comment more on what is happening to Luhzin, but I hope it will enlighten what is really happening. <br /> <br /> This movie works on multiple levels, so I support it. It was a gentle and joy to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these movies are similar is the use of chess and characters in handling. <br /> <br />
