One of the most satisfying Western all'italiana is Johnny Yuma's WAI freshness made by many genres of prosperity, and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or competing intelligent cinema. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is in most cases not terribly original, but it is not really taken into account. The success of genre films depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations and offers surprising variations in their expected elements. In the past, a pleasant experience was created, but with fine (or large) twists that continue to be of interest. The quality of performance is obviously important. Tired reproduction is less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience. <br /> <br /> Following these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. There are many elements of earlier films. It is a brutal, twisted world of semi-feudal twilight, shared by many of the best "Gothic families", 1964-1968, such as the Tempo di Massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the main dollar (1964) and Ringo films, which is not surprising when both were screenwriter Fendiando di Leo. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters of the popular cinema that came out of Cinecitt in the 1960s and 70s, and his work contributed to providing more actors, directors and screenwriters with a range of thematic continuity and unity with the genre (with a few other people in different circles). The main character arrives on the FOD plot, creates a tense situation, then dies, followed by resurrection (in some films such as Quella sporca storia nel in the west (1968) it is literally a crucifixion). Catholic narrative and symbolism are intriguing, especially considering the indirect populist / explicit socialist tendency of filmmakers and their films. The Ringo plot, developed more fully by the screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a film that is an egoistic protagonist starring Guliano Gemma, chooses a community with a member (a healthy dash) of his community for his own interest. uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on Manco / Mortimer's relationship with the Fistful of Dollar (1965). The two scenes for changing gun belts provide a smart dialogue and understanding between the two. Many movies, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, qui√©n sabe? (1967), use this relationship between the parent and the younger man (father / son, parent / younger brother, Anglo adviser / opponent and peasant revolutionary) as the central dynamics of the plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, the focus is on fraud and malformation, labyrinths and mirrors, which are repeated in the best early WAI. The Almeria canons and pueblos become written labyrinths through which the main character and antagonist play cat and mouse shift games. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is the quality of the visual / psychological space of director Romolo Guerrir, along with the intelligent mechanisms of the script to deliver the plot. The dialogue was never very important for WAI and often absurdly understood (there were exceptions, such as cynical comments from Djangos (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967).) The psychological depth of the story was created almost completely through the description of the symbolic image, its deviations and the general narrative situation: see how the deadly Samantha's presence is known during the beating scene, looking at the roof or the background of action, or how Johnny strips Samantha and Pedro of their security and trust in their power due to their secret invasions of their ranch, hotel, even bedroom (this is again a FOD theme). Finally, note how the focus is on searching for information. Many elements, borrowed from the FOD, were eventually based on the hard-cooked mystery of the Red Harvest novel by random contacts, deliberate posters, audible chats, and watches from windows. t or mistaken identities and movements through the activities of Pedro and Samantha that have emerged from this surreal and absurd reality promoted by the narrative to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film was remarkable when it was time for them to be considered excessive. Of course, these films were hardly more violent than many American Westerners. The difference was the psychological intensity of violence and the reasons for it, which meant that it was not violence, it was a meaning that had changed. Johnny Yuma is special and interesting in using it and portraying violence, and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What I find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it gives to anonymous, unnamed audiences in Italy and Spain, to whom these recurring stories were of no interest and interest. The artifact may not have its intrinsic value? some legacy of flint from prehistoric place, fine ceramic filament or leather and rusty metal coarse piece? but it is a reference to some unnamed presence, a life that was significant just because they existed. Although Johnny Yuma has an intrinsic value, much of my interest in this relationship and mystery arises. <br /> <br /> Top Spaghetti West List http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> Only for fanatics (bottom of the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list = l = 21849890
