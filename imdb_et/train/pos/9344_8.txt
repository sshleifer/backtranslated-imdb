I have to admit that this movie moved me so much that I was tearing off. But I always think twice about things, and instead of writing eulogy that defines a movie as flawless and impeccable, I prefer to look closely. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts and continues as a slow-paced movie that doesn't try to let you down with the actual scenes of September 9th. Escape from this genius strike, because unlike the Stone World Trade Center, this film is not fortunate to attack, but to fall, which, like a nuclear explosion, is hardly visible, but still dangerous and devastating. The psychological impact, the 9/11 destruction alone, and the destruction of the American people are almost sensitive in this film. I think Binder was able to keep an eye on the average comedy actor for the true talent who offers the Oscar value of the American comedy on September 11 and Sandler. <br /> <br /> But: In BLOOD DIAMOND says Di Caprio's character and quote "Ah, those Americans. You always want your feelings". Now I do not want to bring down my suffering, but I would definitely like to compare it. From September 11, the world is facing memories, memorials and memories on September 9th. Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer show more than September 11 in their works. Now, this large number of cultural products related to September 11 will make the 3000 deaths the biggest tragedy of this new century. The number of books on this subject and the number of films directed to this topic, and I say it with all due respect, will somewhat proportionate the importance of this terrible crime. <br /> <br /> The fact is: People are dying every day because of unjust actions and terrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people. We have war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and many other countries. Every day, we forget the poverty people in Africa are suffering from, and we tend to feel less familiar with them than with the victims of September 11, just because they are black and because their lives are not much of our Western lives. Africa does not have the money or the potential to commemorate its national tragedies in an American way. So what I say is this: the reason we feel more about the 9,000 victims of September 9th and their families because we are constantly reminded of September 11th. No day goes without a newspaper article, a movie or a book about 9/11. <br /> <br /> To sum up: I went to Charlie Fineman, but I wasn't sure if I was right to know him more than a Hutu who lost all his family in the civil war in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> Are you my economy?
