I went to watch this movie twice a week and I can put together one word (which I usually don't use lightly): wonderful! I think the best movie ever made. Who deserves Oscars and other awards, not the Swedish team that has created cinematic perfection in the latest scenes of the film, when all that has been told (and left without saying) throughout the story is summed up? Just as Daniel Dareus's character awakens so many feelings and long repressed feelings in the surrounding people, the film does the same for its viewers: You walk with your head and your heart is full. Good stuff! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life", perhaps, think about how you feel after a rich experience, as the sky is: happy, content, fulfilled. Say this with Virginia Woolf's Dalloway: "Such moments are enough".
