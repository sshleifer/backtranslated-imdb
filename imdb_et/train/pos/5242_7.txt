I enjoyed this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives an overview of the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which is rarely dealt with in films, most of which speak of the Republican struggle. Another reason is the performance of the actors. I thought they gave very honest and convincing images of the very poor underworld that many people don't hear outside my home country. Actors from Northern Ireland. It does not move the land, although the eyes of some people can easily open up to the dim world of loyal paramilitaries.
