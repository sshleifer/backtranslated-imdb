Vanilla Sky is the new film of "Abre Los Ojos" (Open Your Eyes). And I think there is a lot of human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays a master of egomania who takes other people's emotions for granted and only thinks for himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best and in many ways only a friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, the girlfriend of Brian, with whom she accompanies David's birthday. Cameron Diaz plays David's occasional bed friend Julie Gianni. Kurt Russell plays dr. Curtis McCabet, a psychologist who interviewed David. All of their interactions and their consequences make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and sophisticated thrillers ever made. I no longer explain the plot because it is more convincing, the less you know. Ignore all the people who call this movie too confused. If we pay attention, it will not be confused. The film is very complicated but not confusing. And I think one of the best movies ever made.
