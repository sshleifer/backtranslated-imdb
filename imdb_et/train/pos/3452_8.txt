I thought it was a pretty good movie and it should have appeared in theaters for the first time. It wouldn't have been a big blockbuster, but it would have made quite a lot of money. The film has a relationship and makes you think about how much of it is happening in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I don't expect Justin Timberlake to do that good job. Given his first film, he did a good job. This is a movie that is good to take and watch if you just don't know what you want to rent at night. It should go pretty well. The cast was great. So I recommend everyone to check out this movie!
