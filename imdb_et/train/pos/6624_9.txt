I highly recommend this movie. Located in Bladerunner-esquire in the future in 2054 Paris, this is the most respectful classic film noir script: lady dangerous, sister trying to find her, honest cop fight for everyone. Fortunately, it avoids stereotyping and combines a pretty good story with interesting, innovative images. The movie can remind you of Sin City, but it has a more sharp, even more graphical novel look, which I found really weighty. Every frame, every sequence seems like it could have been pulled on a qualified graphic designer table. As for the story and art, you can find notes dating back to the nineteenth forty (or even earlier, the classical views of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca, and look for a gloomy future where our destinations are governments. Excuse me for watching this movie.
