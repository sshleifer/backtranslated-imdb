I am a C&C fan, return to my documents and liked this film, but at one point in the mid-1980s in San Jose California cable TV it was equipped with an alternative plot line that destroyed the entire movie. All references to marijuana were replaced by "diamonds". The bag "Red" falls on Chong is diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation remains the same ("... it's worth $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a sub-block where the alien staples attached to the ships were added to C&C and talked to each other for diamonds. Finally, "space cosmos" is something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was terrible and obvious that they tried to make it family / child friendly. It would have been better if this network hadn't given it at all.
