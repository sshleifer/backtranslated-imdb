I agree with all the accolades, I went through a box that looks at this movie. It was harsh authentic and called in every sense. <br /> <br /> The question I am about to raise is the current sensitivity to animal treatment. I had a very hard time killing sheep and goat meat and dead deer with this pulsating neck and blood accumulation because his life was empty. <br /> <br /> had been hurt to make this move. "Iphigenia was made in the late 70s before the computer simulation. Could these fatalities be forged? Or were these animals killed?"
