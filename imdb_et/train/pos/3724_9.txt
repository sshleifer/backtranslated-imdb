Tigerland follows the lives of a recently created group of men in an army called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> Here, America knows that they are fighting a losing battle and the director takes us through a 16 mm handheld documentary film about the lives of many recruits in the Tigerland Training Camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> Film is more of a character study that has no real plot but focuses on the key character Roland Boz, an insecure but intelligent person who wants to escape from the camp. We take several characters through this unit, waiting for the story to open. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is a great story from Vietnam and more importantly about the military in general. and very memorable. Film and style leaders also use it well as it looks like old film material that you always see in relation to Vietnam. It is great to see how the film shows that all the struggle and problems were so important to combat the fighting. A specific scene where Boz walks out of a training mission where the teacher shows how to use the radio as a torture device almost in a nutshell, all in brief about everything in the war ... and that is trivial. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not only Namis, but who has to decide for individuals what is morally right, being "in the army". <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
