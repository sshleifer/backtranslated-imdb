The young man named court has liked everyone. His painful bloody death brings everything closer. You can find other symbols and clues throughout the movie. Whether it is predictable or not, and regardless of church beliefs, it is a moving story full of milieu and sensuality. Another thing someone mentioned was that his fate was so fast that it didn't seem plausible. But its elements have been created finely. Notice what her mother says to bring her south out. Note how he keeps the steering wheel and his gloves. He's sweaty and working on dangerous equipment. Today, tractors are quite dangerous.
