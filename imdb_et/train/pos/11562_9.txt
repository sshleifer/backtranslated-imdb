I just can't overcome the brilliance of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. It's like a movie doesn't even need extra symbols, because there is never tired between these two dialogues. <br /> <br /> Lemmon was already in several well-known films like Mr Roberts and the apartment and Matthau was fresh out for the Oscar victory over Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder movie with Lemmon). This particular film was not as big as the story could not work for so long (I think it was almost 2 hours). Nonetheless, it is one and a half times as fast as the introduction of Lemmon's leading events into Matthau's apartment is long (it was also the sentence). Although it is small, and for the rest of the time you have a great time. <br /> <br /> I've already written a comment on how the follow-up of this movie is sucking and I'm not going deeper into it. The reason for this joy is probably that the film was made just as the American innocence was quickly forgotten. There are some sexual references, but they are treated so innocently that you don't even get "Well, I'm never ..." out of the most proud person. It's fun to see the movie for a long time lost and this was probably the reason why the sequel didn't work because you had Matthau and Lemmon saying quite a few f-words and it just didn't fit them. <Br / Of course, now they're both gone and you can just be happy that you can still enjoy them in such a great movie. I think the only male actor in this movie who is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman recently died. So you have it. Just one of the best comedies and movies ever. <br /> <br /> Lisa: I've recently learned that John Fiedler is dead so all his fans are very sad. I didn't want any disrespect and I try to be more careful about what I blah blah next time burns.
