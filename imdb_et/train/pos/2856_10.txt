This is one of the films that will improve every time you see them. It is packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that are always a new detail. Like Saba in later films (I didn't see "Unlucky monkey" yet, but others are so big), failure, opportunity, and humanism play a big role. Cutting and Montage is inventive and artistic, without the film being an "art" image, but a lot of fun. Compared to "Run, Lola, Run", you have to remember that "Dangan Beach" has been made a few years earlier and was shown on German television as early as 1997 ... so it's more likely that it was inspired by Tom Tykwer's film, not on the contrary. In addition to other reviews, I have to add that I like to act and finish very much. This movie is fun in many ways, and we can deliver the message without annoying or pretentious.
