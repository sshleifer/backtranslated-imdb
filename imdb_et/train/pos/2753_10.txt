My favorite movie of all time! I've seen a lot of movies, but it strikes them all! Great action, wonderful story. You, like a "normal" caring person, will love George. Although he is an actor, he is himself and a very cute person. And maby's most important thing: you learn to respect and see people different from Down's syndrome.
