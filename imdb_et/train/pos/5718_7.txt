I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought the tickets and then checked the IMDb comments. I'm worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some of the parts that were supposed to be scary were actually quite humorous, almost like Buffy Vampire on Slayer. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's a bad movie. It's not a great movie either. Just a pretty well done horror movie. It does not depend heavily on special effects, but on camera corners, operation, music. In my opinion, it worked well. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. Other participants were certainly not bad either, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> Sets are nice (and I don't care that the kits are exactly the same as those used on the Japanese original). <br /> <br /> Frightening moments were often predictable. But not always. I've seen quite a bit of fear and don't expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> There were some nice scenes in the movie that were almost original, like trash traces, simple special effects for his ghosts, boy's eyes, a cat who made a noise yesterday, a gurging dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode because it's very different from her Buffy job, which is much more serious. Don't go if you only want to see movies that collect Oscar candidates. That's a good horror movie, enough intercourse. I gave her 7.
