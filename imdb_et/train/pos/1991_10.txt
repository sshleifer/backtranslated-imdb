Yes, as incredible as possible, in 1968 the Academy won the Best Picture for Best Picture - and it was the third music that won this award in five years, the first was My Fair Lady in 1964, and then The Sound Difference My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! but it is that Oliver! is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two films are the weak wet noodles compared to the significantly vigorous Oliver. Operation is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dance is great. This movie is dynamic, topical, fit for human experience, and unlike New York's superfluous gangs, Oliver! offers an image of poverty in the 19th century in London, England, which brings compassion without it being bad. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! Other actors and actors, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful images of characters who bring compassion and warmth without the caricature.
