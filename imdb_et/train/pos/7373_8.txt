Prior to regular reviews, my main curiosity is that it is not LOVE SONG, although the IMDbis has 94 minutes, Wellspring Media on the United States is 88 minutes. Any input on this is welcome! <br /> <br /> Two friends with a very tough life are adventurous. What they stop is exactly where one accidentally shot the girl and two fleeing to the ground. Instead of just a big chase, the film is a complex and rather childish Spike, who behaves incorrectly and clips his boom like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not have a story based solely on Spike, but that hasn't been a bit disappointing, the movie would have been too easy. You will notice how a more stable sign, Heaton, refers to Spike as a "big person", contrary to Spike's "boy control" attitude and behavior. To be honest, I also spoiled the ridiculous deeds of Spike, especially spraying can smell, but in desperate situations, his way of thinking is a temporary escape. But Heaton was there to keep things under control until things got to his head. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan, when Heaton is admiring, and after a while I finished I was wondering why she wanted to choose Spike prison in hell and continue her friendship because of Glenan's excellent performance. After all, there are many reasons during their management that Heaton would have a good idea of ​​trapping Spike and trying to save himself. I think Heaton felt Spike's defending parent's brother and the loyalty between the two is hard to break - until things are too desperate. <br /> <br /> Although some cinematic art is indeed artistic, it offers more of a taste story than just a shoot of men running through the desert. Beautiful landscapes, rain and big bad plants provide a pleasant tone that enhances the feeling of tragic circumstances. Also, the score is unusual and the use of the song "This is not a Love Song" by Public Image Ltd and the title of the movie is quite intelligent. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, this is understandable if you do not care that it is not a love song, because it is focused on two contrasting individuals who flee from another person who has decided to hunt them down (played by the cool, quiet) David Bradley). It is not a big budget entertainment. For the rest of us, who are looking for something minimal and dramatic, it makes sense to spend, and it offers some extremely tense moments that hold your breath. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy movies coming out of Scotland recently, like the dog soldiers and the fucking tattoo. I'm also a bit thankful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, because the accents are sometimes somewhat quick and difficult for some viewers, like me. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark and often tense, this is not a love song that is a very tragic but enticing storyline. <br /> <br />
