This is the best film I've ever met. It's not just the best kind of movie (school study). How Ben Coccio (director) decided to film, was great. He filmed it using teenage actors who were still in high school. He filmed it on the actors' own premises and used the real parents as his parents in the film. Also, the actors were filming using camcorders, making it a great video diary. It's almost skillful. (If it is really a word) However, some sliding blocks, for example, when Cal calls brads (?) To Earth's rover (or vice versa, this has been some time since I've seen it)
