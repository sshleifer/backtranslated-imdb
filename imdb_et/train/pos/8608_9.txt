It was a good movie with good pain, they all hit all the cylinders. And if Dianne Keaton is his best, it just doesn't improve. But Tom Everett Scott, always underestimated, was even better. He should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with one aspect of the scenario. No character admitted that the dead daughter was not always a good person. Keaton didn't play his mother either. At one point he breaks the promise he made to one character not to reveal that he was asleep. One of the other commentators said the film had a "political agenda". It's an amazing thing to say. There was no policy in this film.
