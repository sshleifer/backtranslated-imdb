Earlier I wrote that I loved "Titanic", cried at the end (many times), and I'm his 60's man. I also wondered why this great movie, which won so many awards and was praised by so many critics, received only 7.0 ratings from imdb.com users. Well, I looked at the user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave him 10 ratings, 10.7% gave it 1 rating. These 10.7% of these irrational users pulled the overall rating to 7.0. In my earlier remarks, I blamed this very unusual voting model (a sharp increase in 1 rating, a high rating of 10, falling only gradually and then suddenly reversing and jumping at one rating level) only: hatred of Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I'm tuned in enough to talk to young people (mostly young men) who accuse him of left and right. They hate the man completely and have no role in giving him any credit for "Titanic". (To answer another user: I am not talking to someone who just doesn't like the movie so much and gave him 5 or 6, etc. Everyone has and has the right to his own taste. But no one can convince me that the Titanic that pulls to this level with an unspecified number of ridiculous 1 ratings, only 7.0 is a rating that accurately reflects the whole movie.) <br /> <br /> Let me show my point by comparing the Titanic user voting model with 5 randomly selected offices and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 prove my point). After showing a very bad mailbox, "Heaven's Gate" was quickly pulled out of theaters (1980) and voter ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 rating (overall rating 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) received 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 rating (overall rating 5.8). "Blind date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 rating (overall rating 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating 5.2). WHAT ARE ALL THEIR MOVIES THROUGH "TITANIKA"? ALL THESE BUILDINGS ARE LESS !!!! IF YOU ARE "TITANIC" AND NOT THEIR THOUGHT THEM. Again, Titanic got 10.7% 1 rating! Compare it to the other 5 films mentioned. <br /> <br /> Can the Leo factor hate other than <br /> <br />
