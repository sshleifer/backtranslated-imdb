The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, the two other Jafar Panah films I've seen, are mined by the director in surprising quantities of depths that seem small on the surface. Offside, Panah's serocomial respect for Iranian women who stand for their rights, I don't think he's so successful. Not that what he says is of course not important (and it's too bad that, like many other Panah films, the Iranians don't see it). But after a while, the film will feel like a film, and it looks like 90 minutes. Not to say that I don't like it. The actors are all fantastic and at the end of the movie the celebration is infectious. But this is not, in my opinion, an important job.
