The dehumanizing influence of war is a much-studied topic in films; as well as dehumanizing but potentially dehumanizing effects of military training. Joel Schumacher's "Tigerland" follows a standard template, we see men treated as dirt but becoming soldiers, with their mutual respect for their leaders, and the decision is reserved for whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as well as evaluating the war's advantages for which they are being trained (usually like here in Vietnam). But Tigerland has an interesting factor focusing on the account of the devil's dissident Bozz (which Colin Farrell played very well), who realizes that all power ultimately regulates consent and the lack of ignorance among his inability to compete. A trained, engaging plot has been built around this character and it is also a plus that the action does not leave America (Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" to name just another similar type of film, lost in Asia). Although it is not a movie that is an amazing originality, it is a very well done and enchanting look all over the world: the best film I have ever seen, and one of the best genres.
