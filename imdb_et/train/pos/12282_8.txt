At first, it didn't like that much though I did. They didn't include the third generation of Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro was not well explained and some participants were too different from what I had imagined. <br /> <br /> Later I realized that if the film had been, it would be loyal to the book, it would have been five hours long and would be annoying. Now I really like it because my favorite characters are there when I portrayed them. Clara looks like an angel in life and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the movie was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I imagined him just like that, not all the grief. Esteban is enough. I never liked his character, and although I was interested in him, I hated him a lot, more specifically when he hit Clarale. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting and has a real history. <br /> <br /> The film is really good, especially since it was a gringo film based on a Latin-American book. Its amazing how many famous stars exist, don't you think so?
