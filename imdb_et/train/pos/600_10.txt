Michael Bowen plays innocent young men grabbing thousands of miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (jube Ray Wise) on a sprawling wind farm and getting confused by his young, blissful and seductive girl's dangerous web. (Nami Clare Wren), thereby disturbing the already precarious family. A strong, stylish and exciting drama that didn't get any promotion and sent directly to VHS and Cable TV - where I first saw it. It's nicely written, smartly behaved and tightly focused on a script that keeps you nail biting. I can't believe that reviewers who never wanted to see it. This is an undiscovered classic.
