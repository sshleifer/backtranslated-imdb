I'm overwhelmed by Jim Carrey's work. I'm holding this movie with my head. Grinch likes Marta May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying; her sweet innocence) trying to get Grinch in Christmas gift, Grinch's childhood (very funny!) T all the gifts. I have to say that I felt stupid about walking with the little babies and toddlers who laughed and so on, but this film was a complete perfect adaptation of Dr.Seuss's short film and IS for all ages.
