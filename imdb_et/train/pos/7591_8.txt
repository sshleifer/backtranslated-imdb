The confusion of genres, but it is mainly based on the mash-ups of the genre of Stephen Chow's inspiration. There's magical kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster activities and some crazy melodrames. Production is great and it's fast, so it's easy to get many of the mistakes in this movie. <br /> <br /> The child is left out of the basketball field. A homeless man brings him to the Shaolin monastery, which is in the middle of the city, with a special kung fu manual that a homeless man somehow can not read. The old monk teaches the boy but ends when he tries to manage the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a fake kung fu captain, assisted by four unpleasant monks. The new captain is going crazy for a 20-year-old boy, because he doesn't pretend the captain has injured his weak shots and throws him at night. The boy is found throwing the garbage at an incredible distance to the basket that the man who brings him to the gangster club to play darts. This leads to a great fight, a boy's expulsion from the monastery and a man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball feeling. <br /> <br /> Al this happens in the first 20 minutes when most of it happens in the first 10 minutes. In addition to extreme shorthanding, the first problem is how little we can get to know the main character of the movie. The person who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over. The plot does not have a new base, except for the madness of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how nervous monks will appear to the end. Effects, photography, and stunt work are first and foremost prominent and compensate for the forced plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better command of writing a plot and comedy, and this movie lives in its shade, but it's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite fun even at the end of the scatter. Recommended.
