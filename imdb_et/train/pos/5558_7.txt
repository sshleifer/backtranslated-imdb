This story is familiar to the long-lasting Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s. The only difference is that two cats instead of one are threatened to get out of the way if they don't try to catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has a friend ("Butch?") Who has not lived with him, so it really disturbs "Mammy Two Shoes" who can't believe they have two mice inside the house. <br /> <br Anyway, one who tries to get Jerry can stay while the other gets started, so the competition is on! <br /> <br /> Even though it is a familiar territory, I still enjoyed it because the comic was an original sight to make entertainment. You not only had a race for cats, but also against Jerry, so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend when you're a Tom & Jerry fan.
