Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves to Manchester near his father. Along, he falls to Anna, the wife of a 20-year-old woman, and who happens to be her husband's new boss, Richard Crane. Despite warnings from her new colleagues, Owen continues to give Anna, going so far as to sabotage Anna and cheat on Richard's marriage. It's a romantic drama that has a lot of humorous bases and a quick mind. The actors are excellent: The Student Prince and Touching Evil squares on the screen like the cunning but warm-hearted Owen; Annis "Dune" fame is lively and proves that it fits well with Green; The kitchen, from "King's Playing" is the right threat, as Richard, whose comic missteps and snobbery emphasize his masterful, hate Owen. It is the perfect love triangle and, despite our three-character fixation and rogue, you will be better at knowing and watching them.
