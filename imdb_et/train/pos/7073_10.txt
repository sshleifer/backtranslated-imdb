Jose will be sent back to meet future scientists again with James. If he tells him that scientists have already received their message and know someone else is spreading the virus. And they two meet Kathryn when Kathryn tells James that the real man is DR. Goines Assistant. So it is clear that Jose also has real information about the virus (James keeps an eye on him) and has teeth. So why is everything still happening? Why do future scientists do nothing after the truth? My biggest question after the movie ...
