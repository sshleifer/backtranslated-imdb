Well, when I saw this movie, I wasn't really sure it would be my cup ... how wrong I was! I thought it was one of the best films I've been watching for a very long time, a real family classic. The story of the young evacuator and his new "child" father, this movie captures all the boxes. I haven't read the book (maybe it's a good thing and I meant to enjoy the movie more), but when I touch the story I can't really think about bad points, so out of 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think anything justifies top marks!). By the time William proclaimed, "I can COUNTRY, DAD!". I'll cut my heart out (anyone who's seen it, I'm sure). Really warm-hearted and certainly recommended.
