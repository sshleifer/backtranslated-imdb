I love Claire's Danes and Kate Beckinsale sees her role as amazingly immature. The film is only flawed because it seems that the two defendants seem to be in a monastery working like monks in the grass and strictly under a martial arts-like discipline. Such a situation and filmography and amazing colors are eye-catching, but Claire Daines steals the whole film and is unexpectedly deep to learn the end of a difficult life lesson, an amazing selfishness in the law that is unknown in the real world and completely unexpected. Disadvantages are minutes and I recommend a movie that seems to have been buried for rare TV shows forever. I want my collection to film - only a collection of 10 films. Look at it, you're very touched.
