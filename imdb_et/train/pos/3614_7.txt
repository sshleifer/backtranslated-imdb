Girlfight is like grandmother's cooking: the same old recipe you have tried a million times before, but somehow has become something fresh and new. Try and explain the story to people who have never seen it before: young women who are on the wrong side of the track are trying to improve their situation when they start boxing when dealing with a bitter, obstructive father and his growing attraction with a male rival. See how they look at the keyboards, and they are right: it * is * a clich√©. However, it was hypnotized how well this film works, often thanks to excellent action and dialogue and a sensitive direction that makes it "new". I avoided it in the cinema because it looked like a complete mess but didn't make the same mistake. Definitely worth a look.
