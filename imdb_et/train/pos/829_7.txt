I admit that I thought this movie was not good, but I soon changed my mind. The film was a guess at which direction it was going. Pierce Broson is astonishing at his striker who suddenly burns out and asks the man he met at the Mexican bar. Greg Kinnear is a fantastic straight person who is a Denver lightweight man who starts an innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar. We laugh at the movie because Pierce offers fun liners (mostly sex). <br /> <br /> The imaginary of this movie is very well done, especially in bullfighting and when Pierce sees herself as her last job.
