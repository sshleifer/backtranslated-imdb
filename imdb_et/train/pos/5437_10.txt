Pandro S. Berman was "paid for production" but made him a so-called line producer. But who in this epic, not in Arizona, but in the California Mohave desert, where the fishermen have left behind all the "golden temple" remnants, the Thuggee Huts, the British outpost in the village of Muri, the village of Tantrapur, and so on. small technical errors can and must be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar, although perhaps the Academy did not offer such time. One theme was played at several speeds, including waltz, march and sweet, mood setting. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of production was the demands of widow Kipling. An actor who plays Kipling will briefly appear before and after the battle scenes. At the first release, his scenes were cut according to the requirements of Mrs Kipling. Later, they were involved and given a link to the Kipling immortal poem in the Ben Hecht scenario. Interestingly, this very typical and British story was a great scriptwriter who hated the British himself.
