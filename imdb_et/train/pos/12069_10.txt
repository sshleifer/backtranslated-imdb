Yes, it is faulty - especially if you are in Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot, and you can't think of yourself. <br /> <br /> Roegi's films are an insignificant and perfect example for an Intelligent Film Visitor. <br /> <br /> Testimonials are great, the story is great, but like all Nic Roegi movies, you have to think of reality at every level for every aspect you never would have. His films always make you think and enjoy yourself in the movie. <br /> <br /> So don't wait to watch this movie and feel happy because it's probably frustrated. <br /> <br /> But I think it's great.
