I'm glad that other people enjoyed this movie because I know it doesn't have the greatest reputation and it didn't make money at the checkout. I thought it was terrible and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich directs lighter touches, cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect, and Big Bad Apple is never better than film. You've seen worse movies!
