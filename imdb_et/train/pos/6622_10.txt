I went to screen for the film at the Expresion en Corto, short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One manufacturer was there and gave a brief introduction. The film in roll and the first shot was surprised: one long continuous futuristic Paris shot a brilliant black and white. <br /> <br /> I should not continue with the details, because I think it's a movie worth seeing. The Sci-fi story can be found for many on average ... for me it was really good. The action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and I mean everywhere. Things that you can't do or see are done beautifully. The cast presentation is good, I don't think anyone hit the wrong note. <br /> <br /> Now, the thing I found fantastic is animation. 3D Graphics See 2D. The BW comic book came to life. Background details give more texture than it would have been done by hand (I'm sure it was only when the angles change in depth). <br /> <br /> The screening manufacturer talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! He said the director was great, but maybe he was quite inexperienced because he had only one short film in his CV. So many people had a true faith for them. They started their studio from scratch and since they were facing the challenges they brought to them. I think you will not regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater for the final look of this movie is better than I think.
