Perhaps it is hard to believe, but more of this film was condemned to be more immoral than any other film produced before the introduction of the Blues Hayes code. Yes, indeed, the priests said to their flocks that anyone who went to this film thereby made a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I don't. They had several reasons: <br /> <br /> Unit: Jane loves sex. She and Tarzan are shown to wake up one morning in their usual shelter. She stretches sensuously, and with a comic look she says, "Tarzan, you've been a bad guy!" So they have not only sexed, they have been sexy! A few years later, under the Hays Code, people (especially women) were not supposed to represent sex. <br /> <br /> Unit: Jane prefers innocent, as smart and inventive, savage (Tarzan) civilized, respected nine to five (Holt). When Holt first hears her with a real dress in London, she's a little surprised; when Holt tries to kill Tarzan and Holt and Jane believes he's dead. But when he realizes that his man is very alive, the sights of civilization will disappear for him. And why not? The relationship between Tarzan and Jane is egalitarian: he has no "civilized" insecurity that would force him to affirm himself as "his wife's leader." To get started, he lacks many more civilized hangups, such as jealousy. When Holt and his friend arrive, Tarzan welcomes them both heartily, knowing perfectly well that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt slides the London dress up and dances slowly with his portable phonograph, Tarzan falls out of the tree and pulls his knife. Jealous? No. He's just cautious about a strange music machine because he's never seen before. Once it's explained, it's cool. <br /> <br /> Unit: The civilized Death is dirty. Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. When Jane slips from Holt's lamellas, Holt looks at her silhouette to see if she becomes a costume. On the other hand, after Tarzan's playfully dressing, he hits the swimsuit and dives after him, followed by the most deliciously erotic naked scene in the entire cinema: the couple spends five minutes in beautiful water ballet. filmed in three versions - dressed, topless, and naked - the scene was cut before the movie was released, but the nude version is restored to the available video.) the proximity of men and their hangups. Where is "universal prurience" so precious for the hearts of seminars? Somewhere, there is. Another reason why this movie was considered to be sinful by a hung hand. <br /> <br /> Unit: Understanding that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for human use and comfort, takes a serious beating. Holt and his friend want to be led to an "elephant tomb" so that they can shovel and take the ivory. They want to drive Tarzan to the graveyard. You, reader, mean "fat opportunity!" and you're right. He's shocked. He cries, "Elephants are sleeping!" which explains to him. Jane explains Tarzan's feelings that two "gentlemen" are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Unit: A former civilized woman, Jane, is much more inventive than two civilized men. Holt and a friend blow it and find themselves bounded by hostile tribes and wild animals. This is Jane, who keeps her cool. Although the boy's panic, he takes responsibility, orders them to order and passes through rifles. <br /> <br /> Point: Jane's costume is a subtle punch. (The original idea was that he would be topless, the foliage artificially blocking his nipples, which is really one short scene.) Finally, several men complained about the fabric because the film was called "Tarzan and his companion" , not "Tarzan and his wife". There is no comment! <br /> <br /> Of course Tarzan, who has brought his ape friends back to health, will save, direct the white hunters and induce the elephants in the pack and African bearers back into the ivory. they stole the holy place from which it came. End. <br /> <br /> So you have it. Completely subversive film. Like all the movies of sophisticated and interesting women (see, for example, Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey), which formed such a flowing genre at the beginning of the 1930s and ended with the adoption of the Hays Code for such a steep. <br /> <br /> Joie de vivre of this film is best expressed in the famous version of Tarzan's Jane's soprano. A nice touch that was left to future productions. <br /> <br /> We hear about artistic freedom, feminist Jane and gender.
