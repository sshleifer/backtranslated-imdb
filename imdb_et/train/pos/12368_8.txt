I had a TV with white noise companion and heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment". So I ran into the TV room, waiting for another 70's flick and got a lot more. Fortunately, I can roll back (DVR buffer) and looked at this full view button (Cinemax uncut and not less in HD!) In addition to some story and alternating unlikely dialogue / events, this is an effective thriller that deserves your time. Pretty creepy and progressive: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played by the admirer Cristina Raines, Parker picks up very gently, Dad, in an explicit triosion. movie) The film is TOTALLY's 70s full of bad clothes (polyester suits and sticky ascots) and interior design, bad hair, fluffy music scores and familiar cinematography. Cast is great, take a second look at this movie home page to check it out. It was a surprise that Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum were so young. Sylvia Miles - Always Wonderfully Creepy! Enjoy!
