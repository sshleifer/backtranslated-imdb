No, it's not Alice's fairy tale my friends! This "Wonderland" fable is based on a real story of the terrible bloody Wonderland murders in the 1980s. There was nothing other than "Johnny Wad" in the middle of this blood region. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong used other shotguns as his notorious 13-inch milking machine. In addition to the legendary adult film actor, Holmes was also a serious drug addict who was friendly to various Hollywood junkies. Val Kilmer was sometimes majestic as Holmes, but at one time, this Holmes character is not full of milk. "Who's" with supporters: Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as women in Holmes and Eric Bogosian as a threatening Tinsletown entrepreneur. These characters directly or indirectly play an integral part in the murder of "Wonderland". This support group was Josh Lucas, who was the toughest and most impressive than the terrible Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually expanding into a great Hollywood player with such a charismatic turn of "A Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home Alabama". Director James Cox was sometimes a bit poisonous, showing an enormous amount of overwhelmed scenes like Holmes' famous organ. Holmes was finally convicted of "Wonderland" murders. He died from the complications of AIDS virus. "Wonderland" keeps you wondering what really happened to the bloody night, and when Holmes really put his weapon down. Sorry! Wrong Holmes movie! Okay! This is enough before I get "penislized" what I punish. Bye Holmies! *** Middle
