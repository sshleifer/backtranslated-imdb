Meek, little, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes it huge. In front of and behind the camera, he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces that I had the pleasure of seeing and seeing again. It will never let me down. People, even people who know me quite well, thought / thought there was something wrong with me, based on my entertainment or I have to say, commitment to "Le Locataire" They may be right, I don't know, but I don't I know, but there is something irresistible in Polanski's darkness and I haven't even mentioned humor. The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, his takeover and of course we myself. This building was set up with the grand old Academy Award winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For everyone who loves movies, it's a must. One, two, three, many, many views.
