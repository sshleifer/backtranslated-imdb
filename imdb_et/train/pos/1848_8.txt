Several years ago, the Navy kept the investigated distance from doing "Men's Glory", a film based on the struggle of the first black head of the service to overcome virulent racism. Have you ever been prepared to support films that show the best of our navy in the US. Nimitz and two helicopter attackers, supported by shore platforms, offered this additional story of a young seaman's fight against uncontrollable rage. Some of the movies were shot in the US. Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote Denzel Washington's director debut script, in which he celebrates Derek Luke's effective and deeply played fleet psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> Fisher is an obviously brightly colored man assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a front-line helicopter attack platform. Fisher cannot avoid starting his attacks with minimal provocation from his fellow men. Sent to MD as part of a possible separation procedure, Fisher slowly opens a black psychiatrist, revealing a terrible gross negligence and trembling in a cruel childhood. <br /> <br /> The story develops cautiously with Fisher, but he increasingly trusts his doctor and has the courage to continue with the love of the recruited sailor, called Cherylik, who plays stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher is reluctant to ask the doctor for long questions about simmering, but he will soon realize that he has to look for answers that are painful to grow and leave the destructive behavior of conflict. <br /> <br /> Although all the main characters are black, this story goes beyond the race, at the same time unreasonably showing the evil of the arrogant religiosity and the simultaneous hypocrisy in the settings of the foster family. Viola Davis, seen in a number of recent films, has a picture of strange immorality, but nothing compared to her mother, Mrs Tate (Novella Nelson), who, briefly, but faced with scenes, would serve - if it existed - for Oscar brutality. <br /> <br /> Films about patient-to-patient communication follow a certain degree of predictability (all of these transmissions and transmissions), but the seriousness of Fisher and his doctor / mentor is realistic. That's a good story, well-said. Period. <br /> <br /> When it is set in the Navy, "Antwone Fisher" is in no way a service story, like "Men's Glory", an excellent film about breaking a racist against a real person. . Nor is it really a movie of black. It is a terrible experience in childhood and, as Fisher says, it is possible to declare in adulthood that the victim is still "upright". The persecution decreases in size and meaning because a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the help of a doctor. <br /> <br /> My only mistake is that Washington is the commander-in-chief, but is addressed as a commander. With the support of all the navy people listed on the final credit, someone would have had to tell the director to Washington that his character, like all the naval officers below the Chief of Staff, was addressed as "Mister". Isn't it a big criticism? :) <br /> <br /> I don't know why this movie plays in such a small theater. It deserves a wide spread. Derek Luke can get an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
