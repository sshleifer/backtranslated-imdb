This movie is just funny. pointless, but funny. to enjoy this movie completely, you cannot have an idea of ​​how such a movie works, and just enjoy all the side jokes and punches associated with the movie. I find it a little funny at first when he says you want a beer ........ cock. funny stuff. But what makes the movie decent is that it doesn't try to create a serious spin on the film, too many comedies are trying to get serious aspects that you just don't believe. But it's different and just focuses on fun. However, I have to say that Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the movie and adds something, but the 3 main guys, co-operation, resurrection and squat are very funny to watch and film the movie
