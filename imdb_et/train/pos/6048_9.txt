Which class is a British movie a bit! It's time. And the lateral splitting comedy that will start! <br /> <br /> Anyone who is looking to get rid of a little free from their enemy youngsters proves this journey on the ticket. <br /> <br /> It's a mix with "Withnail and I" and "Easy Rider." The movie runs at a certain pace and doesn't let you drive too long ... Sometimes there are reflective moments, but I think they are good I was a bit worried about Phil Daniels character, but fortunately it won more than half of the movie's more fun scene! Overall, I found myself laughing through a movie that is likely to irritate some people. /> <br /> I would recommend it thoroughly, it will become a cult of British comedy.
