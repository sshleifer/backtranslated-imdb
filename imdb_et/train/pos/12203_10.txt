Orson Welles "The Lady From Shanghai" has no "Citizen Kane" brilliant scenario, such as Charles Lawton, Jr. Cinematography, unforgettable pieces (such as the aquarium scene, seafaring) amazing, blonde-tressed Rita Hayworth sings "Please do not love me" and the truly amazing mirror image of the climax) and the wonderful lie (Everett Sloane in her biggest performance, Welles beautifully submissive, above-mentioned Miss Hayworth - Welles' wife - her most beautiful) makes a very memorable movie experience. The strange plot of the mystery of the murder is fun and weighty, incomprehensible. The viewer is surprised by the twists and the Welles closure line is unheralded classic. "Lady From Shanghai" receives four letters from this impartial arbitrator.
