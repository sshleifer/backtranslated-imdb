So often the band sends a reunion concert to find that they just can't get it together. Not so here. This concert is just a shift from start to finish. These three musicians obviously got together and drew and planned what was necessary to ensure that it was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego. It's obvious from the beginning before they step on the stage. Many crowd faces were not born even when these boys first appeared. In the first song they took the old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no noise. Clapton said in his own part that he had to stretch for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc., so we saw him as his best. Ginger Baker shows why so many drummers today talk about him as a drummer. Jack Bruce is just great. They really managed to put together a magical piece that will stand the test of time for many years. That's ten for me.
