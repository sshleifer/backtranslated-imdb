Like TALK RADIO, BOOTH is actually predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth about what happened, THE BOOTH because we're faced with genre and basic). In this case, it is not necessarily bad. This basically means that the filmmakers will not end up as if they could say the American version of this story. BOOTH is consistently moving towards its (unsuccessful) conclusion, but it is so beautifully designed on each level that you can enjoy the ride as a familiar traveler along a well-running (very picturesque) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's terrible story, FLOP SWEAT. Clusterophobia is sometimes almost sensitive. Look at the long look.
