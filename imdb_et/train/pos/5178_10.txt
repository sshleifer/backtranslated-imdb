Before Tuscan heaven, I saw Diane Lane's success in this musical life. Campers are invited to their youth camp and experience it as adults. Anyone who comes back seems to be looking for something they lost, which makes it so realistic. Maybe you had to be the one who would really be a prey, but according to one character, all of his clothes were wet "it's in camp!" Practical jokes and fighting boys, a frightening lunch and an early morning at ... it's an amplifier. When exciting activities seem everyday. An amazing ensemble cast makes one-two-dimensional role the best and makes them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs Brad Paisley (apparently when she first fell !!) Beautiful landscapes, bright colors, comic music (including variations of Hello Mudd) and comic actor Sam Raim, a great director, can still make this movie and pull again like looking for an old friend.
