Of the element that does the best, I have to say # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp scene as poisoned and his reaction is really great. I imagine that if one poster suggested, Christine tried to laugh during this scene, but actually she made her much worse by smiling at Shemp's death. <br /> <br /> Another character that helps to stand out is Goon. His appearance was a big cross between a terrifying and comic tomb. I hardly want to meet in a dark alley or anywhere. I would have preferred a little real combined mystery in it, but hey, how short is the good one complaining. Not I.
