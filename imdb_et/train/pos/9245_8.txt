Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were excellent screen teams and this can be their common best film. I love seeing Harlow and Gable together and they're just wonderful in this movie. It is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes such a wonderful movie. Movie. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and every time I watch it, I always notice at least one new detail. For me, this is a great movie sign. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and scripting are better than most of the time (since the early 30s). I adore classic movies, but I admit that most of them are just average and sometimes I don't care. Keep your man one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> It has a lot to do with Hold Your Man being a "precursor" movie. (Hays code was not applied until a year after Hold Your Man.) This movie could not be made under the code. Well, it could have been done, but it would have been a completely different story. Thank you for the goodness that the code was not enforced until 1934. Otherwise we would have missed this jewel.
