Leave it to Braik for a good show. Finally, he and Zorak live their lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I have to say I love both of them, showing a lot. They're completely adult swimming. Brak made it big with the album released in 2000. It may not be platinum, but his show was really popular for a ton of people who love Adult Swims. I have to say that all adult swimming shows that do not have a plot must be one who has never made a plot ever. That's why I like it so much, it's just that classic adult swimming history. I believe it's a big show if you don't like it. Hey there was a ton of hate and a ton of loved it.
