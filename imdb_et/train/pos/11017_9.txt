This film was better than the average action film and in this respect they managed to do it. This film featured remarkable cinematography, featuring outstanding mountain snow and heights, as well as a very suitable Stallone, which gave a good result, an exciting plot and a great idea of ​​this major cable because it truly shocked you with your evil ways. The film is not always considered big because it is a weak screen game. Characters from Rambo or Rocky or Bond. They chose the character of Stallone as human, but taking into account the style of the plot weakens the thrill factor. Also, the dialogue was nice and slowed down. The script should be more realistic and less "talkative". Another weak point was unrealistic scenes. The filmmakers should have been more careful about how they hit the strikes and missed. shooting schemes scenes quality on the plane that was robbed of the film early. Instead, they decided to spend a lot of shooting sequences (area "A-Team" TV series) as soon as the villains set off this movie was a lot of all time great potential. The crisis action sequences, better dialogue and more Rambo / Rocky-style emotions / assignment Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level. I know it wasn't Stallone's fault. I feel that the film's director wanted to stifle Stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his leadership, which doesn't credit had been all that great, if not his operator.
