MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is the fierce 1945 B thriller of Joseph H. Lewis, undoubtedly one of the best leaders in Hollywood Noir films. This 65-minute gothic oddity from Columbia Pictures came after Lewis's long apprentice as a line of poverty west, East Side Kids comedies, horror modems (including incredibly bizarre Bela Lugos shocker POSSIBLE GHOST) and standard B-studio (CO-ED, BOMMIDE, BURMA, FALCONI) , SAN FRANCISCO, etc) --- all of which put the stage quite beautifully on what came from the vastly talented and resourceful Mr. Lewis. MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS (as well as next year's SO DARK NIGHT) introduced a director who had practiced rare and delicate art that speaks quickly and efficiently of the most modest budgets in dark and enjoyable stories. Lewis was later based on productions such as GUN CRAZY (1949) and THE BIG COMBO (1955), despite the expansion of his narrative structure, based on the dirty, clear camera work and effective low-key lighting. And very modest resources. <br /> <br /> MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is probably more indebted to the British mystery tradition (which is placed in the studio in England) than in conventional film modes. A young woman (Nina Foch) agrees to take her home of an older woman (Dame Mae Witty). Two days after his arrival, he was deeply asleep in a completely strange house and with a mysteriously brand new identity - an old woman's girlfriend. He said he was a victim of a nerve breakdown, trying to grasp the full and seemingly hopeless nature of his contradiction. But before he collects the strange and worrying truth behind the dark secret, his "husband" (the ever-threatening George Macready) probably murdered his true wife and had been deceived and involved in an embarrassing plan. Much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest story is the indelible touches that Lewis brings to the production, marking it as the first of its truly serious endeavors as a film director.
