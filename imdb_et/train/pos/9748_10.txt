I saw this movie when it came to age 17 and a classic stone (I am still) ... <br /> <br /> I never liked opera because I hate soprano voices, but he changed it all. He was adorable in the film and had such an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> I heard in CNN that he died today at home in pancreatic cancer, he missed it, and he definitely stayed in this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy it when I find it, watch it and enjoy it. * Smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and look before it is sold out.
