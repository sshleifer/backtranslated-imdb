Child's "Sexploitation" is one of the most serious problems our world faces today, and I was afraid that any theme film will jump directly into sexual scenes to shock and disturb the audience. Having seen both "trade" and "holly", one film led me to actually see changes in international law. Another seemed a bad attempt to make me cry for five minutes of emotional music and weird suicide. <br /> <br /> I don't think turning this problem into a Hollywood teardrop is useful or necessary to adopt a strategy, and I have to praise Holly for doing delicately, but forcefully with terrible conditions they are forced to endure . "Trade" dropped scenes between serious and fools, related to cat death after images representing children who were forced to do some terrible deeds. I found it endless and at times offensive. If I had wanted a cheap laugh, I wouldn't have signed a child trafficking movie. <br /> <br /> For anyone who would like to watch powerful movies, which really means something, I would recommend saving money on a movie ticket to release Holly.
