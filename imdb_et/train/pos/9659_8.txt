'Presque Rien' is a beautiful portrait of young French homosexuals. Both stereotypes and preaching are a wonderfully natural film that has worked excellently and is known in a seaside city where action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. If something is almost too realistic, as a little bit of ordinary plot is just life scenes. But the lack of a conventional dramatic tension is less than it would be so finely drawn in the world. "Presque Rien" may not be the most exciting film ever made; but its simple humanism serves it well compared to the previously prescribed solemn or grandiose views, which often treat this issue. Worth a look.
