A great film full of very underrated work and a sharp and intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the film is that all the sadness is still current. The story has been emphasized about things, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, fear of losing their jobs in a world where it had disastrous consequences. It was mostly placed in a world that no longer exists, hanging at the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is hardly a comedy when comparing the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. However, it's funny - listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and look at her painful expression when she replies that her comments were a remarkable mixture of poetry and meaning. It's funny, sharp and sad at the same time. A remarkable achievement and one of the top ten screen comedies.
