If you want to see something for him and for him, this is the movie you choose. I'm rom coms, but my husband is not always so eager (what a man !!!). Anyway I managed to watch her because I told her that it was a sport, and you know what she loved !!! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and his leading man (sorry, but doesn't remember his name) is just as good. When I watched the movie, it was called a "perfect game", but I think the title was changed in the UK because it is based on the book "Fever Pitch" and there was already a movie about the football (the same movie, but the same movie, but the British version - phew) !), <br /> <br /> Any of the reviews given here will give you more information if you need to buy them for girls, take it from me, get your hubby / boyfriend on Saturday night and you laugh and cry together. A real pearl.
