Boys work outside the recording studios when they hear the "angel voice". That would be Miss Van Doren, listening and under the name of Miss Andrews, because her father does not praise her as a "radio singer". But he hopes that a great wig, Mrs. Bixby, her father's friend will hire her, and then she will have to give her approval. <br /> <br /> He leaves, but after a few minutes, the boys work at the Amok studio, which causes devastation and other musicians to kill after destroying the recording session. Finally, it calms down. "Whew, we missed them," says Moe. "Yes, we missed," Curly replies. <br /> <br /> The boys are stupid in the studio, record Miss Van Doren and Curly dress in women's clothes and pretend she is singing. Ms. Bixby walks, impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For an additional $ 500, he is asked to sing and sing at his high-level party at night. The rest, as they say, is history when Curly pretends to be an opera singer with funny results. By the way, he accompanied "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". <br /> <br /> What happens in a party is just to win the truth, but not before a few slapsticki. All in all, there is a pretty good episode. I enjoyed it, but didn't value it as something special.
