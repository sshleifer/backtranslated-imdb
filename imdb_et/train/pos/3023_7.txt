This enjoyable juvenile noir is a gorgeous and memorable scene. Great distraction is a complete disregard for authentic accents. French characters (Boyer), Belgium (France), Greek (Paxinou) and Hungarian (Lorre) play Spanish characters! And moreover, Bacall should be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are very good - especially Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene where Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet and talk wildly in different accents is a real hoot! And I think that if they were alone, they would actually have to speak Spanish! It seems strange that Brothers Warner did not find any Spanish-speaking actress in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood has often had "any old accent" policy - my second favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutchman) who loves a Russian soldier played by Mexico (Ramon Novarro). Perhaps they would have been Novarro for a "confidential agent" - he would have been in Boyer's role or at least in France (which would have been greatly saved in the dark make-up budget).
