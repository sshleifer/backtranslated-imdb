Every country that has a working film industry has some sense (and perhaps some crazy) artist to make movies that you can fully understand when you are part of that country. I think Hundstage is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, distracted, weird, angry. But they still have enough money to allow them to set up cars and big houses. And they do a lot of strange things here, which may seem "normal" to them because they do it all their life. From a conventional human point of view, you can now easily watch the movie and be nasty or fascinated and watch Austrian art elements. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know the people you see as the worship of society. A society that gets more crazy from day to day by creating its own rules that no one else understands from within the cave of the social system. And you see people. Sitting in the park, standing in the opposite street corner, in the same order. You may find yourself in a bar or disc you can visit. You may be working with them in your work or living next to your house. You will hate them without knowing exactly why. You're trying to get away - but you can't. Maybe they'll like them. But it seems "normal" to you because you are doing it all your life ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so bright that Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It has beautiful people ... but some are ugly. There are many hard-working people who are trying their best ... but there are also some rides at the back and destroying everything that the Austrian people have built up to now. <br /> <br /> Very Pessimistic Movie.
