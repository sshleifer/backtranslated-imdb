This 1947 film star and director and wrote Orson Welles (funky Irish accent) and also celebrates the magnificent Rita Hayworth, with less attractive short blondes. So, I've hung up with Orson before the bad and the citizen Kane and the third person, etc., but that was my first communication with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting went well, he does an excellent job with the scared / drilled Elsa, who is married to a striking millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall against each other. He wants to drive with him, he doesn't know if he can live without buying money. Elsa, his wife, and his partner bite and bite, as sharks Mike describe attacking each other and his prediction turns out to be too true. In this mystery of murder, many spins follow when we arrived at the amusement. (Think of the final shootout Man with a golden weapon that borrowed this scene heavily). I wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is like garlic and lemon. The dish focuses on the sea, it is fine, sour and sharp, everything is great. They may not be the best, fresh shrimp but good quality frozen shrimp. In the tasty sauce, the naturalness of the pink shrimp is added when you are healthy, but you are filling an alternative to the usual daily price. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
