I find it difficult to calculate a "fair" star for this film, but I went to 8 because of its high production values ​​and an innovative approach to warfare in 1968. Remember that I haven't seen it since 1969. But it made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> Long day death must be one of the most lively antiwar films. This is accomplished simply by portraying extremely realistically some soldiers in 1944 - 45 in Northwest Europe. Before that, no film had shown so much brutal detail at the level of the infantry attack and everything that had left the cold in a way that allowed actions to speak for themselves. There is no preaching, sentimentality, comic, complex scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no nuance. Partly due to their situation - trying to survive - the characters are misguided as familiar clichés. Like "entertainment", the film does not do it, although it was not meant to be "entertainment". It was with the misery and horror of the Second World War and the modern war that you were going to be defeated. It was twenty years before the attack and thirty before the rescue of a private Ryan, both of which are "traceable" films. Here are flat and generally unpleasant characters, the absence of a real plot and realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first vomiting in theater history) make the movie difficult, even though it is only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feelings you have when it is over, a bonus star whose heart is in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like Carl Foreman's undervalued "The Victors", an equally shrinking but more interesting and thought-provoking film, Long Day's Dying doesn't seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both films have been cable several times.
