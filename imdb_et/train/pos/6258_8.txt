They might have missed some of the start - I'm not sure why it starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If this is due to the beginning of the Mediterranean, they would have become closer to modern Lebanon. <br /> <br /> One of the cameras and teams gets to the Bakhtyar tribe, this is the start of an amazing 48-day trip. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this amazing track that seems to be a very fast moving Karun River. They use a raft, which is kept with the goat's goat skin - you can see where the head and feet were removed. The river's second "bank" was very steep - I think about 60 degrees. <br /> <br /> Just looking at it was incredible, there was much more. To get to the pasture, they also had to go through a large hill with about 4 feet of snow, if not more. The chance to climb this mountain was quite amazing and by itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed on this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> One of the drawbacks of this documentary was some of the inter-trial titles with bad humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a silent documentary or incredible challenges that this tribe not only sees but captures. It's just an incredible document of the few well-known groups that face all kinds of challenges.
