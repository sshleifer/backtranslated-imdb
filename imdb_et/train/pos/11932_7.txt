I saw this movie on television years ago and I saw this movie when I got it on tape. I thought it was pretty well done. It wasn't the best of all the movies, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. Action was good, Danny Glover led the lie. The plot line was not very plausible, but the script was well written. This film may also be in the interest of attractive baseball fans. It does not apply directly to a sports film. This applies directly to a nice movie you can watch with your family and learn some of the hidden messages in this movie. Overall, the film was good but not great. I'll give this movie 7/10.
