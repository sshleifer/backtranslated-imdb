It's really a good movie and that's what I've seen many times. Michael Caine is fantastic as always. Michael Caine has gained some reputation to play any role in any film, regardless of quality or lack of quality, but he is making a good move when playing Sidney. It has been so well written from the beginning. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such horrible things as the Brazilian boys and the Rosemary baby, could write something like this witty. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... what's wrong with what Sidney Lum was doing? <br /> <br /> Because if someone gives you that movie, it would be a crime. Look at it and adore it.
