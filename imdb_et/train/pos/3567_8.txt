This musical foundation is based on Damon Runyon's Times Square world in New York. The film-conscious man Joseph L. Mankiewicz led this nostalgic tribute to the "crossroads of the world" that show us that the past of New York was below. Frank Loesser's music sounds good. We're looking at great local characters. People in the society were inclined towards this region because of the illumination, the action, the possibilities of this district. This lower part of the city lived on the streets that were so intense. <br /> <br /> Some original songs were not on the film. We do not know if it makes sense, but it is not unusual for Hollywood's music to change and act on the stage. This original cast was excellent Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye and we don't know if Robert Alda, Sam Levene, Isabel Bigley will not allow his original roles. These were prominent actors who could make an amazing contribution. <br /> <br /> The movie is visually amazing. The look follows the fashion of time. As for the casting of Marlon Brando, which is otherwise not well known for his singing possibilities, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons seem to be working in the film. After all, Sky Masterson is a man's man who would see a sister if he had a different look. Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, like Sarah Brown, does a nice job that depicts a Salvation Army woman who unexpectedly finds she is the same type of guy she is trying to save. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is a joy. She no longer ceases to be amazed at Miss Adelaide, a woman with a golden heart, who is in the interest of Nathan Detroit. Ms. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as a wiser girl who is wiser than she promises to be. Stubby Kaye does an excellent job of Nicely Nicely Johnson's reprising. <br /> <br /> Great production has been owed to the talented Abe Burrows, who customized the screen. Irene Sharaff's costumes set the right tone.
