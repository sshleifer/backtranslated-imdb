Well, I just discovered that the exhibition is more disgusting and shocking than "Little Britain" and I like it! "Gentleman" is a sick British comedy about the most terrible, crazy and disgusting small town in the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island ("The Dibley" and "Father Ted") quite normal! The format of the exhibition is much like LITTLE Britain, except that it all focuses on the urban people of this hellish city. Both shows are the same sketches over and over for every episode and some are probably inspired by "Little Britain" (especially the job search skit). The exhibition is different because, although it is a crude oil like "Little Britain" (thus not a children's show), the exhibition is sick and sadistic, which distinguishes it from all these examples. Above all, the cruelty and killing of animals in the exhibition are recurring themes. <br /> <br /> Now, if you have not guessed it, it is not a show for children, easily offended or for normal people, and this is probably why I liked it. However, you really need very thick skin and love awfully to enjoy it to the maximum. Funny and incredibly unbelievable - you have to believe it.
