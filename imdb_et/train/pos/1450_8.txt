An excellent political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other, higher-tier films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to overcome these amazing career races? A story about friendship, father-to-son relationships, corruption and fraud. The two gels are amazingly well matched and the Aiello and Fonda supports are equally impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers run. Instead of focusing on a complicated corruption scandal, it creates great signs that show the political side of the failure of political bribery. The final scenes of each main character are wonderfully written and acted.
