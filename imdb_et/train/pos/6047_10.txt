The great thing with Withnail & I'd is that it strikes that college and life won't be so much for other purposes. Freebird is something for those who probably didn't like higher education and just went directly to 15/16 year olds. I know some wide sheets stuck the knife into this movie when it came out of the cinemas, but I saw it in a house packed in Hailsham and everything seemed really nice. I grew up in the Dean forest and it took me straight to my fungus and relaxation days (some great mates - I hated thinking about what they are all now - probably a local government council). I watched it a couple of times on a DVD and I already see a movie as an old companion who remains forever part of my collection (how I like this movie and Dambusters - doesn't seem to be in any way right). to the other side of this movie, and I think that the social scenes that deal with the local people are great. I like the combination of these three guides and here are some cute writings with some very quoted lines and I dare say it's a good integrity. I've been trying to get a soundtrack, but it's not released (shame because it's a cork). Someone told me it was originally a stage game, not quite sure how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the small touches / references of Shakespeare that seem to emerge all over the film (as well as Dylan Thomas ref), and like all the small gems, there are always few things to discover, like the last scene that gives Easyrider a cold. they will start their next trip. All in all, a really modest cinematic art (love it!)
