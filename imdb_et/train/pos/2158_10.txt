I don't like "class inflation", but I had to give it. 10. I don't think of something that I didn't like. I saw it last night and woke up today. I am sure that the Hollywood remake that anyone tells me, along with J Lo and Richard Gear, is great, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking that I hardly hardly think in any way to get it to improve or change its setting to a different culture. <br /> <br /> The story I was worth and o Scratching scenes or weapons that were off or something like that! Imagine it! <br /> <br /> All the characters seemed well developed, ... even non-primary characters had good character development and enjoyable action, and casting seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find good movie music from our day and age, and maybe it's not quite qualifying (there's a lot to learn about how to dance but not to sing), but I really think Gene Kelly and others who fought for our dance in our lives would have thought of this film and dance role so much, helping to talk about a medieval man who has been successful with his family in Japan, looking for something ... he doesn't know exactly what. <br /> <br /> For the Japanese people who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it.
