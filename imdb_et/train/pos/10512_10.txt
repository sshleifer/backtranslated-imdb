First of all, I find this movie on VHS when I just had to buy it on a DVD, it's my favorite movies all the time. I've read the book, but I think the film is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow like Emma and Jeremy Northam when Mr. Knightley was a great choice. He was great! <br /> <br /> This is the 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
