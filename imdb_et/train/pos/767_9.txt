As a true product of the hip-hop and electronic dance generation, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite films. Beat Street, though by no means "authentic", is a Wild Style film that is guaranteed to anyone who is proud of the urban sample / DJ-based music and electro-club culture. <br /> <br /> While I admit that sometimes dialogue is somewhat cheesy, you can't help but feel those signs and finally "I wish you were there" at the beginning of hip hop culture in New York City in the early eighties. The B-boy battle scene at Roxy Nightclub (real, real-time competition between legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is just as important for hip-hop fans archives as for some other classical albums. Look at some of the breakers' movements slowly, if possible, to genuinely appreciate the sporty and stylistic expertise of an experienced B-boy / B-girl. All thanks for the Zulu nation !!!
