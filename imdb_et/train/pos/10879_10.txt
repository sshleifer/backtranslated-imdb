I've wanted to cut it from the day I heard it, which was sometimes last year. Anyway I could see today, and when the movie started, I thought it started a week, but after 10 minutes it was better. I thought the movie was pretty good. But the thing I did not like was how the killer was created, just before I rented it, that would probably be a miracle like Urban Legends: Final Cutting, I almost died. for the most part, everything had to be improved in the final section of UL. CUT is 100 times better than UL: Final Cutting. The best part of CUT is killer and death scenes. Killer captures MO F *** ING ASS
