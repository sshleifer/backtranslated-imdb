MATADOR is a hit-man movie lite .... if you can say that about a hit-man movie. Violence is never shown, but often. First of all, I was frightened that I was another gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy that had been retained since the mid-90s. There's nothing terrible about this movie, but every bit of it is hidden from me. The top three chemistry has the best chemistry that has been offered on the big screen in recent years, and they seem to have had a great time to make this movie together. Writing is sharp, although it sometimes seemed that the script was customized due to the phases of the play due to one set of dialog scenes. This is a good movie that I probably don't remember for too long, but at a time when it was a joy. Good movie.
