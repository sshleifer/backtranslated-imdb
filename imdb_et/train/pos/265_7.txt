Miss Lemon is quite irritated by a number of accidental, seemingly insignificant thefts in her sister's retirement home. Ring, lamps, backpack, lighter, stethoscope, shoe? there seems to be no rhyme or reason. Miss Lemon asks her employer, the great Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, to investigate the matter. But what Poirot sees is a lot more exhausting than Miss Lemon could have imagined. And Poirot's fears have been confirmed when one of the students living in a boarding house was murdered. Poirot has the right to bring the killer to justice. <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickory Dock is a solid but not remarkable entry to the long-lasting Poirot series. I appreciate how faithful the original story of the Agatha Christie script is. I understand that some freedoms have to be taken, but I appreciate the effort. The main points of the mystery are all there? small theft, boarding house, students, ripped backpack and of course Poirot can see something blind before it actually happens. With some exceptions, casting students is almost the same as I imagined them. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd are out of the group. Just as I always enjoyed Poirot by David Suchet, I really get out of episodes with Phillip Jackson's inspector Jappi and Pauline Moran's Miss Lemon. This episode is a real cure because Miss Lemon gets more time than usual. Finally, I always enjoyed using an existing mouse as an observer of hostel activities. This is a fun little game in the title of Hickory Dickory Dock. <br /> <br /> When I looked at Hickory Dickory Dock again, I was just looking at what had a tremendous impact on Agatha Christie's work on highly stylized Italian mystery films or Giall. 60s and 70s. Take, for example, the murder of Mrs Nicolet. If you had raised the scene in a graphical way, you would have had something straight from the beginning of the 70s. In fact, the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock could have been used by Giallo. It's just complicated and interesting enough to work.
