I'm tired of people appreciating movies by their "historical accuracy". It's the people of the movie! Writers and directors should put up their story! There are a number of movies that are not entirely accurate with history. Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, New York Gangs, Geronimo: The American Legend, The Last of Mohikast. are historically inaccurate. If you want to see some of the great actors they do best, I suggest you see this movie and don't worry about the truth. Just enjoy the quality of the movie, the story and the greatest actors of our time.
