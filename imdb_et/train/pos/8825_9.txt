In 2004, the Oscar nominee is a very short b / w film in Spanish. A young woman goes to a cafe, gets a coffee and notices a few musicians who are quiet with their instruments. All patrons are immobile, like dummies. One man, however, is quite cheerful and breaks the song that will take place at 7:35 in the morning. There is another surprising moment to the end of the second, which is quite surprising. People, the place, everyone seems quite ordinary. And like the Bolero song, the thing keeps building up to the highest level. It is an 8-minute masterpiece with its structure, theme, movement and spirit.
