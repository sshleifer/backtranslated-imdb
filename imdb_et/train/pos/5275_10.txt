This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film depicting Muslims as human beings has no stereotypes here. This film is driven by story, acting, and above all by its themes, cultural affirmation and discovery. They may seem like clich√©s, but they are not at least in this movie. Mecca's grand mosque view is absolutely amazing and the audience is given a glimpse of the side of the Muslim world, which is rarely ever seen in the West. Here, people are caring, supportive, committed, tolerant and committed to one another. What is a welcome and delayed departure from the Arabic's negative negative images. Outstanding film.
