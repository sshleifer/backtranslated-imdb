Roses gang. "Every rose has thorns." <br /> <br /> The blend of old western and hip-hop blended perfectly. Clothing styles, landscapes and plots fit everything the director wanted. Plot - after five years, they kidnapped twenty-seven banks and then disappeared without traces. Now a small western town is a siege and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. Rose Gang is ready to ride again. And this time it's personal. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko), and Kim (Stacey Dash), Five Gunslinging Women . When Rachel's sister is killed, she ends up with the rounding of her friends and goes back to revenge. <br /> <br /> Well, around the western version. (If you've seen good girls, it's a little better for women). <br /> <br /> I gave this to the 10/10 because the characters, plots and landscapes did it for me.
