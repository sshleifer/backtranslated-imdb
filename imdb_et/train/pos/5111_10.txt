Does anyone know what pickup John T drove? I look like Ford in the mid-1970s. This movie is my favorite and my husband. It was the first memorable film we saw as a couple. Jumping is interesting because it is similar to the first truck I drove and recently found a similar one. I would like to restore what I have in the movie. The music was also fantastic and the actor was great. Where and what is the lady who depicted John's aunt? Did John also have a double stunt on the tower scene when he almost fell? What was going on in Mustang was also Debra W while driving. It looked like a 60th model. Thank you
