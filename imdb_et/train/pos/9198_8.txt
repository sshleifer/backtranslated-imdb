B Film? Yes, yes. DIY? Yes, yes. The first movie? Yes, yes. But Aestheically A +. This movie was definitely a bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. etc. However, this film has many positive things. First the most annoying sign first dies! Secondly, it's made for a parody / funny B Rated Horror movie. The comments our killer makes on his victims left me and my friends laughing on the rolling floor. Take it for what it is, a number of kids who have just left high school, made their first movie. What it is, it is really good.
