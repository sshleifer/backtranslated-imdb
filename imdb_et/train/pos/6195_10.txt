A month ago, after seeing this movie, it jumps back to my consciousness and I feel I have to buy it or at least see it again, though I looked at it at least three times when I gave it to rent. <br /> <br /> I loved Hal Hartley's leadership a number of years ago - I found that these films can make me laugh at a place that is rarely entertaining. This is a strange feeling that has been given, and I assume that most people out there really just don't get it, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - I think I just get it - as if these movies were made for me < br /> <br /> Although I do not remember if I smiled loudly during this movie, it remains one of the more fun films I've seen in many years. If you do not see the humor of humor in the grocery store, Fay from the street to the church, to your brother's publisher's office, to his son's headquarters office may not have the intelligence surprised by this film. The bag itself is a silent nature that is dragged as a maternity icon, which is usually a dirty, buggy Parker Posey, who has to carry the international intrigue before the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Henry Fool "is my least favorite of Hartley movies. Honestly I don't remember it very well - I think the character was so despicable that I found this annoying. Hartley forte seems to be a feminine character <br /> <br /> Beside Posey's glory, my favorite actors Elina Lowensohn was also wonderful to see, and her extravagant naive is ideal for Hartley, and her ability to make outrageous banners helps to define her style as delicious chronic irony all over the world. <br /> <br /> This film is a very important international intrigue story that explains the political situations in Afghanistan - it is not suspected in the beginning. The complexity of the development of this film is unprecedented. <br /> <br /> This is an "independent" sequel. , the more mystery around him, the less you look at his appearance at the end of the movie - as a chain-of-custody complaint machine, which will insult his guardian of Islamic terrorists agi seems to respect him. Finding her like Santa Claus is actually a 12-year-old schoolhouse bullying. <br /> <br /> While I was impressed and pleased with Hartley's latest films "Girl from Monday" and "No such things", "Fay Grim" goes a long way beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality.
