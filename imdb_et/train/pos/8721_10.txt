Disney (and, of course, the wonderful people of PIXAR) offer a nice, humorous story that is combined with the best computer animation. I admit that maybe the "faces" of errors are a bit more static than "Antz" and they only had four feet ("Antz" six ...). But the backgrounds were great and the animation was breathtaking. But be it a lesson: it was not the computer that gave such success: it was the man behind the machine who added the little left to "Antz". Some of the highlights were of course the "bombs" at the end (so look at the end, it's worth it!), Which were very fun and original. The "Filmed in Full Location" line was designed for a more attentive viewer.
