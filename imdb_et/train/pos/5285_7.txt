You think you are in for some serious sight when the film is predominantly made between two characters, as they travel from France to Saudi Arabia for 3,000 miles or more, passing most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour and sightseeing is not a stopover. <br /> <br /> Reda's father is in his dark years and wants to make Hair. But since walking and taking the mule out of the question, he decides to drive to Mecca by car. He can't ride, and that's why Reda's help to his son's protest is to force him into a broken vehicle. <br /> <br /> But Reda doesn't see how she can bypass her if she can choose an airplane. He frustrates the idea of ​​putting his personal life on the pilgrimage he did not understand. And so we went in on this difficult journey with his father and son, not the best guys. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this movie is to see the development of the father and son pair, the face of their challenges, the strange people they come across, being thrown out in a variety of weather conditions and intermittent breaks between motels and sleeping in the car. We see the obvious gap between generations trying to communicate with each other, the father trying to put his son on and the son trying to affirm himself, but what we see shows that Reda is out of the water. Through many meetings, they compete quite well despite their differences. Join other pilgrims in your Haji. The final scene of the mecca is really a vision, and you also feel claustrophobia and fear when Reda tries to cool her father among thousands of people. European sights might not have been deliberately made to create expectations and focus on the final destination. <br /> <br /> I was sure to talk about the idea at home and show loved ones how much you value them. Don't miss this and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that there was still a plenary tonight.
