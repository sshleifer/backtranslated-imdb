Simon Pegg plays part of Sidney Young, a young entertaining writer who has begun writing a career for a grassroots magazine specializing in the loss of rich and famous expertise and superficiality. He makes a career among famous celebrities, although he has a desperate desire to be a celebrity himself. The film is based on Toby Young's very strange career, who also ran a small magazine in the UK called Modern Review, which offered amazing criticism quite a lot of things until he closed the magazine with verbal bullets in peace. editor, and then went into a spectacularly unsuccessful career as a writer at Vanity Fair, which is pretty much in her life that she was talking about in this movie. <br /> <br /> She is first of all glad to go to work on a big edition (called Sharp's Magazine) and despite her active nerves she is positively radiating on her first day. He will meet with editor-in-chief Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) who is hard under the nails, but who is exactly the editor he needs to be, like Young, to keep his job in the magazine. He offers little direct youth admission, but he also has what can only be described as liberal tolerance for Young's peripherals and inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> Much of the comedy in the movie is due to Joungi's misunderstanding or indifference to the generally accepted Code of Public Conduct and a peculiar label related to rich and famous factors. But Sidney's reasons for acting in such a strange way and for outwardly insulting interviews are because she believes she reads all the celebrity culture and she seems to believe in that old old saying? "If you can't win" em "and" then beat "em." <br /> <br /> Complicated questions are two very different women who have a nice, regular girl in Alison. Olsen (Kirsten Dunst), who at first is terrible Sidney's apparently arrogant and na√Øve ways, and a stunning model called Sophie (Megan Fox), who represents the fame culture. Needless to say, Sidney's endless superficial and superficial attack is a superficial lust for Sophie who is the star. <br /> <br /> Sophie is amazingly beautiful, it is true, but also because she has no idea what strikes her head. is not very interesting or attractive, but Dunst's performance makes him a real person. Relationships with him would be all Britney Spears' marriage in reality, and the film still has a certain level of credibility, because despite the obvious, we also feel this Sidney pain when he did not follow him (I felt it anyway). <br /> <br /> H ow to lose friends and alienation People have a pretty interesting premise, and it is full of honest, satisfying performances, and although it becomes a bit of a romantic comedy by the third act, it has many different advanced and interesting characters. For example, Danny Huston has an excellent result as Alison's other love interest who respects Big Lebowski (who is also a bridge) with his former White Russian, one of my personal favorite drinks. Buying Absolute and Kahlua here in China costs about $ 350, but my kitchen is never without them. <br /> <br /> I look forward to a day when Simon Pegg starts to branch out a bit, because I love his movies, but I am absolutely sure of his range. He played a serious character in Hot Fuzz, but only seriously with his surrounding lunacy, and he finally went back to himself, which he has died a lot, ran, fat boy, ran and now How to lose friends. He's a rising star, it's interesting to see what he can do.
