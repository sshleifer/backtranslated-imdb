I liked this movie ... it was cute. I enjoyed it, but if you didn't, it's your fault. Emma Roberts was good at Nancy Drew, although she is not quite like books. Old fashion outfits are strange when you see them today, but they look good on them. For me, the rich girls had no clothes that would be rich. I think they saw they got all the clothes-folded - garage sales and decided to put it all together. All the equipment was sticky, especially when they wore penny oil in the usual equipment. I don't want to watch the movie badly because it wasn't sure! Just go to the theater and watch it !!! You enjoy it!
