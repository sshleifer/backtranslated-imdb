When the movie opens, the two thugs will kill another thug. When the body is discovered and autopsied, the doctor understands that although he was dead, he also suffered from a pneumonia plague - a very disgusting and virulent version of Buboon's plague! So, this is a race with time to find those who came into contact with a dead person and treat them immediately, otherwise the accident could break. Oddly enough, I actually know quite a pneumonic plague when I taught lectures from a series for my history classes. The film did not really do a good job of making the facts about the disease correct, as it seemed just like what people had on the film. The biggest problem is that this disease is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they would not really be allowed to show it. Of course, there is high fever and cough (they got this right), but also a lot of bloodless and blind blood from explosive vomiting - along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes, as you would have been with Bubon's plague - all clean and harsh! I can definitely understand why they didn't go that far. I am also sure that the federal government would have been much more involved in controlling and treating the disease - it was dealt with in the film at a very local level, and all seemed poorly prepared and a bit stupid. No one believed in doctors! As for the actor, the film had great actors. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are public health doctors and police chiefs, respectively. Good actors, but also famous actors in 1950. But in his first movie, Jack Palance (still going with his original moniker, Walter Jack Palance) and the relatively unknown (at that time) Zero Mostel is very dangerous. Palance was great - very scary and very physically adept at her tricks. Mostel played hard with his early work - evil and cowardly evil. and he has a great deal of action - and it's worth seeing.
