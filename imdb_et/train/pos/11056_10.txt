Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed The Baron, a fantasy series with about three supernatural spies, favoring a "six million dollar man". It was my favorite when I was young and I still like to watch it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had exclusive screen chemistry like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the lush Alexandra Bastedo went through her role as Sharron Macready. Late Anthony Nicholls made an excellent suitcase for Tremayne. The best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own "interrogation" compared to "prisoner". I'm sorry that there was never another series; the concept had so much life. Would Craig and Richard have been against Sharron? What if Tremayne knew about the powers of the Masters? Did the masters have other abilities than the ones we saw? Unfortunately, we never found.
