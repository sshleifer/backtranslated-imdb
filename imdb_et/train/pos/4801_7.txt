I watched it with my entire family, who was nine years old with our black and white TV in 1964. I remember that my dad said "it's like it could have happened - Adam and Eve." I remember vividly when Adam finds Eve, his eyes were black. I asked my father why his eyes were black and said he was tired and hungry. When that episode wasn't seen after 45 years, I still remember it alive - the TV transmits back and forth with the home platform, scenes of bombs shaking headquarters, the final scene of the last two walks, Adam, carrying his pack and Eve. . It may not be a theatrical work of art, but it was definitely an impression of all these years.
