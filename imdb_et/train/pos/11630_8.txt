Red Eye is a good little thriller on Saturday night. Intense action, big villain and unexpected action. Some may not be able to see this movie because it goes very short for 85 min and 88% of the film is on the plane and just talks. Don't worry that they will pull out this smart and spiritual dialogue very well. <br /> <br /> The PG-13 film seems to be the director of Wes Craven's new reason. But surely he has as much violence as he may have in this thriller. <br /> <br /> These films are the strongest points. This film needed some good players to engage in dialogue and excitement. If they didn't have these participants, the film would be lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy starts with Batman and 28 days later. Rounding this casting is the X-Men Brian Cox 2. <br /> <br /> The pace of this movie was great. Just when your thinking gets bored, they throw you away. Fortunately, this is not a long film and does not know it. Much better than the second airplane flight plan. <br /> <br /> Here is my flight plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too messy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
