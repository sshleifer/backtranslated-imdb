WWE needs a savior, as Wrestlemania 14 turned around. Leaving Bret Hart and evaporating the later Hart Foundation left Vile the D-generation X in WWE unchallenged. Their despicable leader, Shawn Michaels, had stolen Hart from the title of Vince McMahon's intervention, and his cohort with the help of Triple H and Chyna had systematically removed anyone who challenged his domination. But Royal Rumble had a new candidate. Stone Cold Steve Austin. In the hate of McMahonagement, Austin was worried about DX. So you are worried that they would be involved with the special enforcer "The Worst Man of the Planet" with the help of Mike Tyson. Austin would be firmly opposed to him at the Shawn Michaels title competition. <br /> <br /> First of all, there was a sub-map that started with the Legion of Doom, who won the unforgettable 15-team battle Royal to become a candidate for the titles NO.1. In fact, I forgot this game until I read the PPV again. It is not very good and really proved the lack of depth in the tag sharing during this period. <br /> <br /> The next game featured the Light Heavyweight title, defended by Champion Taka against Michonoku Aguila. WWE had created the Light Heavyweight Title to compete with WCW's strong Cruiserweight Division. It was not successful and it was the only time that the title of Wrestlemania was ever defended. A short meeting that lasts about five minutes and is actually too short to achieve a lot. The little they did was exciting and it was a nice little game that saw Taka retaining his title. <br /> <br /> OK, our next game saw DX member Triple H, who defended WWE's European title, which she won from Shawn Michaels in December for the RAW fictional fashion and did not defend PPV, Owen Hart , a unique survivor. Triple H got a big entrance with the DX band to fill her song. Chyna sent a triple finger with H, but then it was handcuffed by WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a nice little game before Chyna intervenes, causing Hart a small blow leading to a Triple H title. A good match could have been great if it was a little longer. <br /> <br /> But of course we wouldn't want us to take our next game, which saw the real life of husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable win Goldus and Luna Vachon in the first mixed tag game in Wrestleman after 8 years. And to be honest, it was not expected. Although it was not terrible, it was not reminiscent. It was soon to be completed by Mero in WWE only and his main goal was to continue his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Next, we saw Ken Shamrock fold and pay for an inter-continental championship when he destroyed IC Champion The Rock, but refused to keep his ankle locked, which led the judge to quash his decision. It was a short match, but decent for what it was. <br /> <br /> Next saw the first good game when WWE Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws lost their name to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie. A fun trash game. The decision was canceled the next night because Cactus and the chainsaw had thrown the throwers on the back of the trash, not the game that was used in the race, but it was still a fun game. <br /> <br /> NOTE that it was time for the first meeting between Kane and his brother Undertaker. Kane had paid the Undertaker WWE Championship at Royal Rumble and then "killed" him when he helped Shawn Michaels lock the Undertaker in the claw and put him on fire like a revenge for the Undertaker who burned his parents' house and left him terribly hidden years ago. It was a decent meeting and a nice story when Underataker absorbed everything that Kane could throw at him and then hit three tombstones to finish the game. <br /> <br /> It left only the main event that saw WWE's Champion face with Steve Austin along with Mike Tyson as a guest enforcer. Michaels had suffered from a weakening back injury at the Royal Rumble race and was remarkable in this game despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were left behind after the intervention. The meeting ended with Austin sucking Sweet Chin Music and hitting Stone Cold Stunner. Then TYson came round to read three, celebrating victory with Austin and then tapping Michaels after the game. It turned out that Tyson and Austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all the time. <br /> <br /> It was the final PPV game for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. This helped to create Austin as the biggest star of the wrestling company, and the main advertising gathered by Tyson's appearance was a significant turning point in WWE's fight with WCW. Austin begins to become the greatest star in WWE history and, along with Rock, will lead Mick Foley, Undertaker, and Triple H during the period when they will reach their highest level of cultural importance. And it all started here in Wrestleman 14.
