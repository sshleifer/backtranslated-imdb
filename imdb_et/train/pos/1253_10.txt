This well-thought-out and carefully documented documentary describes the terrible case of the Chagos Islands, which show that, between 1969 and 1971, they were violently repatriated from British and American governments. The Anglo-American politicians decided to do so because they believe that the islands would be strategically important bases for controlling the Indian Ocean through the projection of air and navy. During the Cold War, when most of the newly independent postcolonial countries were out of the western orbit, British and American officials seemed to feel that it was not a viable option to determine the fate of the islands on the islands. Instead, they decided to influence the violent removal of the local population. The film shows that there was no provision on the islands at the time of their withdrawal, and that the Mauritian docks, where they left, fell into displaced Chagossian community for three decades, and in these new conditions, after the death of three decades, the homes were tortured after the deaths after the British Public Records Bureau had been released from many harmless documents. rather, it is suspected that it was wrong, and these documents should never have been made public), as a result of which the Chagossian community's legal complaints against refugees have consistently seen British courts against the islanders and the British state. As such, the amazing and worrying conclusions made in the film can be reasonably considered to be proven. Nevertheless, the British and United States governments are not legitimate residents for the return of so far committed islands that the courts have finally concluded. This is a very valuable film for everyone, but it is important for British and American people. The silence of these facts is to be a accomplice in profoundly ugly crime.
