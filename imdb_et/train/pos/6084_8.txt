I was pleased with the pain of prestigious players. Story is one reason that causes it even if you have a personal risk with it. At a time when violence and pain are often at the forefront of the film, this film focuses on a good old policeman. Although similar plots have been made repeatedly, these boys are doing well. Kick back and enjoy. Dennehy is the captain of the movie.
