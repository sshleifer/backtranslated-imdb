I have no idea how Texan (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled it out, but they see it again, reminding you of all Mrs Paltrow's troubles! I had long gone down from a woman and still felt she'd been bored with "Shakespeare In Love" winning her Oscar, but she gets all the wins here - she's almost perfect like Emma Woodhouse. He could win his Oscar for Shakespeare, but he must be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is surrounded by excellent support, including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and others. Jeremy Northam is very interesting as an interest in love, even if the script slips slightly into his declaration of love for Paltrow (a process that allows the entire tension to flow out of his relationship); Several years later, Ewan's hair is slightly easier to take than in the 96's, and I personally find Alan Cumming to be a square nowadays. But it is undoubtedly Sophie Thompson (Emma Thompson's sister, Phyllida's law daughter) as Miss Bates; What this version needs is a situation where Emma agrees with Miss Bates because she is the one we are drawing. The film is worth seeing (even even) for its unique performance. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a completely outdated charm and more than enough fine to solve the British class system. It is worth renting (because it's unlikely that Paltrow will ever have it good again - but we always have Emma).
