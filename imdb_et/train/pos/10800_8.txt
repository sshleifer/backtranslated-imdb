This movie is much better than the original. I would recommend it to anyone who loves peculiar humor. We've added almost as many lines from this movie to our daily conversation as we have Monty Python. Dining table scene and his turtle soup. The original The Jerk was too choreographed ans. Although I like Steve Martin, he seemed to be trying hard. Jerk Too is a scam and everyone can enjoy it. Unlike the original The Jerk, Jerk Too is family-friendly.
