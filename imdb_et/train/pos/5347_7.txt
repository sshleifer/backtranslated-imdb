Another Spanish film about the 1936 Civil War. This time we talk about Carol (nice playing Daisutant Clara Lago), little girls who come to live in a small Spanish village of New York. It is such an initiative trip and soon it will find humanity's injustice, their foolish struggles and conflicts, their contradictions. In 1994), which had such a good momentum, beautiful photography and a nice script. She tries not to participate in the conflict, she just shows us some facts and we decide (ok, the facts are clear enough to decide what band we are) and she takes a huge advantage of presence and starring in the youth starring Clara Lago and Juan Jos√© Ballesta. <br /> <br /> Well maintained production. <br /> <br /> My price: 7/10
