Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers because of his financial problems. He is crazy that he has his own house and his rules, because his brothers always stole their saved money and his parents ignore his wishes. One terrible day, Preston rode his bike; It was the same day that the story, Quigley, tried to record from the police and accidentally rode the Preston. Being far from the police, Quigley must hurry to check for damage to Preston's bicycle. The problem was: it was a blank check! Preston is a smart boy and decides that this check has a high price: $ 1 million! All this money gives Preston such things he always wanted, like a mansion with a pool, lots of toys and even a limousine! Problems begin when FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, making Preston in a difficult situation and facing many problems. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites in my childhood. :)
