Not sure what to expect from this movie. I love watching Brosnan in every movie, he is always good, but it was completely different. He's crap and plays very confused. In fact, he reminded me a few times back to sleep. also :) I don't think you come to the cinema "Wow! I was blown away" but you come smiling, enjoying a good movie. You can't ask for more. ) commercials! Brilliant. Something like looking at Jack Daniels' advertisement, where the drink goes back from glass to American Twin Twin commentary :)
