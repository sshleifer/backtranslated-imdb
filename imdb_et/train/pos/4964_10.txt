I really love this example! I've always liked Space Ghost's 1990s exhibitions! This show was fun and I can't believe why swimming in the Cartoon Network adults would take such a funny exhibition out of the air. I hope they will put this exhibition on DVD or something else. The exhibition is about Brak (Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who live their daily lives with their mother and father and his best friend who wants to fall off a lot, Zorak! My favorite episodes were where Zorak got this really good singing voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that Zorak did for the song. The second episode I like is where Brak and Zorak did not finish their homework, and then they go back from Sunday to Friday and they just went out and then go back to the day when the homework was invented and when they returned to their current homework there! Another episode I like is where Brak's father and their neighbors, Thunderclees, robots get into this agar, and then eat a huge worm. Another episode I liked was where Zorak made the bully, and then the new boy got over his bench. I also like many other episodes! One thing that never makes me laugh is when Zorak is beaten, ruptured and broken!
