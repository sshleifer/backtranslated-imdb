Sammi, the Curr metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, tried to censor his music !! (Like the real life of Dee Snider, Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) In a fire, Sammi Cure was supposed to play Halloween at his old dance school. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan and the only one who knew how the step was and what he felt (or did?) Nuke, dj at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) is Sam's last record on Eddie. And when Eddie tries to play back, he finds Sam talking from the dead and tells him what to do to get back to the bully in his school, who hates him and his music. Everything works until Sammi kills! A big movie and it must see heavy metal hairpins for fans who have a good soundtrack by Fastway, and just when you don't know what songs sound or know about Fastway and don't like them, they made a little bit of voice there and there is style too What sounds like a well-known Cinderella or a Wheel. Is the movie a real horror movie? Well, it depends on what you call a horror movie, I'm a real horror movie with a lot of killing, or just frightening. This movie is not, there is not enough death, but it cannot be called act, comedy, drama, intercourse or thriller, so I think it must be horror. So if you want "Rock N 'Role, Rockin night at night!" Tham Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I mean "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!"
