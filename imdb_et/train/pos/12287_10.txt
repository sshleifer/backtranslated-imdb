Although the story is fictional, it guides not only the history of Latin American countries, but the whole third world. It is the real, clean and raw recent history of these countries that is briefly summarized in this novel / film. Overweight supernatural things ease the intensity of historical events in this movie. After all, supernatural stuff is part of the culture of the third world. Although not critically acclaimed (probably due to supernatural things), this is a great film with a great story and a great actor.
