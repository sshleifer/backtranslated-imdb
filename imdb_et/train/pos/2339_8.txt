I love this example. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction, so if it doesn't look like them, I didn't notice. I like the quality of cinema in cinematography. I even like the story of love, although I enjoy it, I mean behind my thought, how the hell is that some of this story really develops when Ned can't contact Chuck, or else ... well. I even like Chuck, I can't find him annoying at all, and I usually hate too sweet, nice, perfect signs. I even like the narrator's voice, even if it interferes with one of my family members and prevents some similarity with some of Walgreens' ads. I could nip off all the other things that are in Nedi's difficulty and how the writers will deal with it in the future, but I just look and wait and see what the story of the writers tells me.
