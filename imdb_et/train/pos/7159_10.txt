Louis Sachar's powerful children's classes are like Disney like Freddy Krueger. It has murder, racism, face disfigurement and killer lizards. <br /> <br /> Tightly drawn, this is a multi-layered, interconnected story that includes history to unveil Stanley's own legacy and the secret of the holes. It travels to the lush greenery of Latvia to the flagged Camp Green Lake (hint: no lake or green). <br /> <br /> Disney's first success is to rebuild novel environments so convincingly - the design is great and shiny. Another plus is casting. The rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be the fat guy in the book, but her attitude is right and she is far from the usual pure hero. The remainder is filled equally well, from Patricia Arquette to the Frontier school marble banker Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The downside is the pop-soundtrack - the pure marketing department - and the feeling of getting to the end.
