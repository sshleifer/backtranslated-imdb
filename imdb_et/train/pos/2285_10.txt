I haven't read this book, but through the whole movie, I was amazed with just one thought in my head: it's Vonnegut. I've never seen an author, a novel and a life-long novel, translated so well into the film. This movie was just as complicated in the novels: jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a great Vonnegut character, shown perfectly by Nick Nolte. He had all the features of Vonnegut's "hero": anxiety about political boundaries, ironic dark humor that struck a tense reaction to stupidity, and unwillingness to push his reality around him. In general, I was constantly surprised and impressed with watching this movie. It was the same feeling that I read "Cat's Cradle," my first Vonnegut novel, as if it were the most complete thing that could happen, he thought, and he made it real and important. Yes, he has nothing but an army surplus "White Christmas". And so it goes!
