I have no idea what people complain about. I saw this movie yesterday and I liked it. Stone again gave great character. He was as good as he was at the first main press. He still has these intelligent but complicated answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old, she looks amazing! I don't care if he's like Barbie's fake. She looks good and so. The basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence and a big ending that leaves you thinking and talking for a while! Half of the people who comment on this movie haven't even seen it. So don't listen to them.
