As many reviewers have noted, the film version differs from the story. I've never seen a staged version of the story, so I have a better overview of the movie than many other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the film director, but the film is still interesting for a number of dancers who are trying to make a great time during the choreographer Michael Douglas' show. The film is not correct if it does not select any famous actor or performer who would end the final test group. So our focus is on the movement of dancers and individual stories and struggles when they open during the marathon day. Douglas is probably not the best choice for this part. Obviously, some songs were cut out for the benefit of the new, and a cliche-traveling story of romantic communication between the dancer and the choreographer is added. I have to say fairly that this was the weakest part of the film. Cassie repeated invasions during the tests reflect almost desperate claims that often have to be made when participating in artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or happiness. But this aspect of the film has been fatal in the past, and it's curious to see this tired old shoe knocking up its heel again. The dancers' own revelations began to hopefully "I can do it", but then he knelt at slightly different points when the dancers talked about their stories. Frankly, their stories differed somewhat from real people who never get that chance. *** 4 stars.
