It's almost typical of Lynch. But what makes this film a bit unusual for Lynch is that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. But I believe Lynch does this to give a greater sense of reality that helps to increase the intensity of surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are many typical Lynch motifs, such as: floating camera work; haunting of music; long (torturing) breaks; hanging curtains; darker lights (slow to see) grow darker lights; extreme close-ups; women in difficulty; overwhelming, inappropriate, all conscious characters facing the dark, temporarily unforgettable, dark and so on ... <br /> <br /> The performances are big and short is thoughtful. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything to interpretation. Many questions remain unanswered and blame the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another great power for Lynch. I only hope that he will make some shorts more for his Sony playstation 2 ads. They were inspired.
