ScareCrow was the funniest killer I've ever seen in the law! Plus he's really bouncy most of the time he's jumped around, which was awesome! He also had a great voice, which meant it was just perfect for him. The story was also great. I like how ScareCrow, which was cool, went over the soul of the child! The reason was also why everyone kills what I mean after what these people did to him ..... I would be angry! The look of ScareCrows was very good! his appearance gives this person "OMG!" reaction when they see him! What was great, what he was funny! These people were fools who watched it for a long time! They should watch and run their lives ... though it wouldn't have changed!
