If you are used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles like Tom Millers Crossing or Keaton in a regular suspect, I suggest you watch this movie. Even if you are not particularly a fan of Gabriel Byrne, all the actors in this movie will really give you great performances. If you have about $ 11 (it's almost nine times), I'll tell you to order it online or rent it from your favorite movie rental. You're guaranteed to laugh no matter whether you usually like gangster-type movies. Mad Dog Dog / Trigger Happy is one of those movies you will never forget and look at yourself again. You talk about it so much that your friends are going to borrow it.
