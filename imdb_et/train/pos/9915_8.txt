I had nowhere to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I would probably have missed this movie if I hadn't chosen Air Canada. I looked in front of the small screen in front of the seat to find it exciting and mesmerizing. I drove a couple and I had to go back, but I had to look at it. I am now looking forward to seeing Europe in Europe, though I am so perfect when I go outside the door to discover it! <br /> <br /> The photo composition is stunning and the film gives so many insights and "fills" the story the photos say. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time).
