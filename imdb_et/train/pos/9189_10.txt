Let me start by saying that after you have been watching this episode for the first time on the DVD at 10:00. one night I couldn't sleep until about 3:00. <br /> <br /> This brief overview may include a spoiler. can safely say that this is the best example I've seen. I'm not saying everyone should feel that way, but I'll do it. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family, looking over my dad, a commune in the ICU before he passed. the identity is mistaken for Kevin Finnerty's husband. It wasn't like the usual Sopranos and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is fixed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks into the sky with a helicopter light and we can see it through a torch doctor. We only see it for a moment and the sequence plays until we go back to real life in a situation that is just what I just said. His boys take A.J. At home and in Carmellas, which is overcome by stress, the corridor breaks down: the moment the episode is signed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the episode is cut between the real world: a potential-looking family, the negative result of this coma, and Tony's alternative reality, parallel to what's happening both in his thoughts and in the real world around him. <br /> <br /> Then the episode's star point: after AJ he tells his mother he's a butterfly at school, he walks to Meadow sitting on the side of Anthony. In Tony's world, he enters the dark hotel room and turns the light on. She takes off her shoes and goes to the phone. He's trying to call, but he can't - as if trying to get back to Carmella, but he couldn't bring it physically. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits and looks out of his window. The glowing light that has repeatedly appeared throughout the episode seems to call the other side of the city. and helps to create an episode of emotional roller. <br /> <br /> Of the 10 in 10. <br /> <br /> PS: See the next episode. You'll know what the light is. It's wonderful.
