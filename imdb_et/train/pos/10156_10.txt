This big movie has failed to record higher ratings than 5! Why not! This is a great image of Christ's life without Christ's passionate merciless sensation.Johnny Cash did great things for God, which is astonishingly astonished and neglected in areas where they should be most important, like our churches. The film itself took the film for less than a month because Johnny felt the strong presence of God that led him through. Great credit for anyone who participates in this extremely sincere movie, always appreciated by its fans. At least Billy Graham's Crusade has done enough to use it as a source of new Christian education. Thanks to Fox for its production. If Walk the Line proved it was amazing that this man lived alone. Underestimated masterpiece. The last voices do not carry canons because this production proves! All in all, I believe this film is one of the world's largest documentaries, as it is a straightforward, fairly illustrated and great testimony of Christian faith!
