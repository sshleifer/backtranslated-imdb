Because of the invention of "domestication collar", the meat is controlled by zombies and becomes a productive member of society; however, they do the usual tasks. Dead Servile take care of people living in fenced small towns of the United States in the 1950s, while in the "wild zone" they are stationary zombies. In Willard City, pre-teen K'Sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) lives with his parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, Robinson is the only family on his street without a zombie; their new neighbors, the north, have six. So Robinsons gets a zombie Billy Connolly (like Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the old woman's walker has damaged Mr Connolly's "Domestication Collar" and he eats him; then infect the city with new and hungry zombies. Meanwhile, the young Ray has grown up with Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like TV "Timmy and Lassie") and it is difficult for Robinson's family to work with controlling Zomcom authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" doesn't go into enough intriguing "Wild Zone"; but it is colorful, stylish and fun to satire in addition to the zombie movie. Ray and cast perform well, individually; with the amazing zombie Sonja Bennett (like Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (Theopolis) is the most memorable couple. Prizes were awarded to Director Andrew Currie and the team including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design). <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
