Having seen the marathon of horror films for a short time, I believe it is a humorous parody that refers to the main point of this five. <br /> <br /> Although the themes are dirty and old for today's viewers, it is by no means a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although this is a student film, it does not give a little excuse for excuse. br /> <br /> As another reviewer has pointed out, there are less than ten minutes, which is enough time to clean up with toast, sit back and candle through the film. <br /> <br /> I think the movie's short bread should be enjoyed as headlines, and the viewer should relax and roll with it.
