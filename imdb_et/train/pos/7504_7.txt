Hey guys i'm actually in this movie! I didn't even know it was on this site until I looked a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Peti, the main son of the characters. It was a great experience and I loved it every minute. During filming, they needed to be in two places at the same time, so they used their twin sister's double! The finger that pushes the car button is not mine. I still work and made a TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want evidence, my name is the first to be at the top of the scroll. <br /> <br /> See: I thought the movie was okay, but if I didn't, it wouldn't be one of my favorites. I thought it was very good, but the story was just that.
