As a family we were so happy about "The Blond of Bombshells", we bought a copy of our home video library. <br /> <br /> Actors are A1 and many favorite actresses and singers are cast. The theme is unusual and the script is well written. Music / songs are timeless and lead us back to our young days as we sing songs at the top of our voices. To describe the story would be a "plot" because it is really nice to sit and enjoy the story when it comes up. <br /> <br /> Complete signs for its most enjoyable and surprising output and we recommend it to anyone looking for belly and lots of music.
