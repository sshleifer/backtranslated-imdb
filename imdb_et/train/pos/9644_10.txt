I'll give it right now ... this movie is amazing. foreign gay movies are so fast crossing the quality and story of American gay production. Although so many American Indie gay movies are grains, bad sound, amateur actors, a loyal story, and a surprising lack of nudity or eroticism, top-quality foreign gay movies are similar to France. cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful and meaningful. The story is adult and complicated (but not for anyone it is difficult to follow), acting intense and professional. both drivers are both fantastic and all cast. boys are more than just beautiful and there is a lot of nudity ahead. you follow their boys throughout the years, from their meeting to the end. all the small nuances in the relationship, the details of the fall and the exit of love have been nicely performed. it left me more. Look!
