First of all, I would like to say, "Thank you, Disney, for the final release of the movie" Cinderella "! Now you have all the Disney animated movies (including limited editions of 1999) that contain the DVD! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Anyway, Disney will remain magical in his 1950s animated classic" Cinderella ", a movie that put a fairytale movie on the map. We are all familiar with Cinderella, her graduate, her date, a glass ash, a pumpkin that will be shipped to say "Bippity-boppity-boo!" And, of course, trying to go home for the night! <br /> <br /> I like this movie: this is an old fairy tale that kids like, now in film format (also on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> Cinderella - Thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
