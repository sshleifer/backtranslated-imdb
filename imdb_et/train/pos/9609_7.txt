It was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it is not related to dieting, it's so deep a pain that they have to find a way to deal with it and choose it. Beth was a very well-drawn character and in the scene where he stands around his mother for eating disorders, you see the pain inside him and you hear it with his voice and you know how deep it is that he is feeling. I also think one of the best features of the film is where Beth hugs the words: "It's not about you." to Mother. These words were so real and added so much to the scene. I think this scene was definitely the most important scene in this movie.
