The "Men's White" is definitely one of the funniest, if not funny, comedy movies I've ever watched! (And I looked quite a lot!) It's about two garbagemen who get "men in white" and then stop invading space. It is also a parody of classic films like "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says this movie is dirty has something wrong with his head. Here are tons of funny jokes and jokes, and you can actually injure your mouth because of a laughing laugh (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie, check it out now - you definitely won't regret it!
