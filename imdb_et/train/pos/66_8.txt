"Home Room" came as a surprise. There is no clue as to what it was all about, it cost a lot of time because it does not contain any strokes and what we see as life has changed by a satisfied young man who decided to fall victim to his classmates. who are the innocent victims of his rash acts. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, a director who works and edits his material, is a talented man, rewarded by some amazing actors. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to finish high school. He has been a few years away and does not seem to have the same wavelength of other students. First, he has a rebellious punk-like look, a lot of makeup and a mouth that cuts anyone who dares to come close to his orbit. Alicia was in a cozy room among students who had died nine students allegedly killed by her boyfriend. We understand that Alicia is a wounded girl who has been through a terrible challenge in her life, but we have not been given any clues. <br /> <br /> The following is the result of a tragedy because it focuses on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teenager who wouldn't have been at school at all. When a knock-knife ball hit him, he is in hospital more than a wound. He tries to overcome his mind during this dark time, but nightmares don't let him forget. <br /> <br /> Alicia has been taken to the hospital headquarters to go to hospital. Because she doesn't work with the police, the head of the school wants Dean to see her in a terrible country and maybe she softens and tells the authorities what she knows. Alicia does not like Deanna, but after a few days both girls will make peace. We don't understand before the last sequence that actually happened to be a terrible day at school. <br /> <br /> The busy Phillips makes excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest play as an ensemble. <br /> <br /> The film has an intensity because it is not explicitly shown how the shootings took place, which helps the tone that Mr. Ryan wanted to give to the movie.
