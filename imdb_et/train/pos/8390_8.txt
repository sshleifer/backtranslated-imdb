My first Fassbinder was a great experience. The film and the alternative market (small halls with uncomfortable seats; the public had to wait for the films to change) were ideal. <br /> <br /> A lot of clich√©s were used in the film, but Fassbinder gave them so wisely that I found them really fun. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes it was harder than dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I loved how post-war time was played. Real fun! <br /> <br />
