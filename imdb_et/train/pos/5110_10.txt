I was about 11 years old when I found out I was living 0.48 miles from an uncle's house. uncle's house is Westway Dr, deer park, TX. they have added homes since the movie. I don't know the house number, but you can watch it. I'm now 21 and I enjoy watching this movie. The Spencer bar is no longer their name. Pasadena ISD wants to build her school. I drove from the house last week, the house still looks good. My father and uncle would go to the street where the house is, and watch the actors come out of the house and try to make a movie. where john crosses the rail cracks that they have made 225 higher. When I hear John loesing his son I start thinking when he made a city cowboy he was 26 or 25 at that time.
