This movie is a fantastic non-stop laughter that includes all the usual ingredients of Dawid Dhawan's comedy - heroes heroes, buffoon supporters, made dolls for the heroine, nasty roses, wisecracks, rocking + choreography and a small dose of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are both in the two roles of police and conmenide. Amitabhi's policeman is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is the policeman against Govinda. Heroes are usually only rust-strangled props. Conmen has no heroes. Paresh Rawal carries DAUD's merciless act (he also played in Don KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines in a short role. He is back in his famous "Angrezon ke zamaae ke Jailer" in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is incredibly impeccable - as wise and good-natured policeman Pyaare Mohan and conman Chhote Miyana. She imitates a Bihar-style Hindi who speaks with fun results. Believe it or not, Amitabh Bachchan, compared to him. But still AB is good. Madhuri Dixit makes himself in the song "Makhna". She dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is fantastic. See "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and title track. <br /> <br /> Don't look for any LOGIC because it is comedy and the scenario is convenient. Just enjoy yourself.
