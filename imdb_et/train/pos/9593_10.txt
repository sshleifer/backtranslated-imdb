First of all I am a plump, straight white man. But even with this disability I love this movie. It's about real people. Real time and place. And, of course, New York City in the 80s. In the eighties I had grown up with many gay friends in New York, and one of the things I always admired was their courage to live their life the way they wanted to live. Whatever the consequences. It's bold. You have to admire it. This is a great movie, look at it and receive what was a terrible African-American or Hispanic in the eighties of New York. It's a real life. It's a real life.
