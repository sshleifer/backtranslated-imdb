*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, when I'm a big H: LOTS fan, maybe I liked the movie more than ordinary people. However, this movie is great. It had tons of surprises and it gave the series more closures. Although I was sad that Bayliss became a murderer, the general feeling I felt was satisfied.
