When I first saw it, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. Through all the story spectators can assume that Richard really kills Thomas or he does it first.But .. the main point was no conflict but .. FRIENDSHIP! Parents and mature prayed to save the younger one who has the whole life it's amazing. Every time I watch it, I enjoy it! Of course, it is quite violent, like any action film, but I think it is acceptable. Many thanks to Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing movie! I recommend everyone to see it. I am sure people will not regret and have a really good time.
