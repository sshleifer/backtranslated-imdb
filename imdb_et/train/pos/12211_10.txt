Hook or By Crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of extremely smart and talented filmmakers, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to talk about the original cinematic style of the original story, adorned by Ann T. Rosetti, and wonderfully written - truly poetic. <br /> <br /> Widgets are real heroes and rarely serve as an example / inspiration for meat ditches and trannies everywhere. This film has so much energy, so much irritating passion and shameful heart in San Francisco. I can't recommend it enough! <br /> <br /> The best butch friend of the movie all the time!
