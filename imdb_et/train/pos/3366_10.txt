Ettore Scola, one of the world's most sophisticated and major directors, is not yet available on DVD ... (it's summer 2001 now ....) Mysteries that attract your mind. <br /> <br /> This big class returned my home theater to theaters thanks to Sophia Loren - the summer retrospective and seeing it again on the big screen after all those years of watching video ... this is a real gift. To avoid criticism, however, try to prove the point: I took my reluctant younger brother to watch my movie. He never saw this movie before, and "I don't like those Italian old age ..." Like everyone else in the theater, it was a wonder. Even during the final stages, the theater was completely silent. <br /> <br /> This special day is truly special. The miracle of perfection. And great damage if you haven't seen it yet ...
