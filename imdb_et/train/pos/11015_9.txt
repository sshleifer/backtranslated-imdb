This film is directed by the Finnish miracle Renny Harlin. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and mouse in mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to act. Stallone needed this role to get back again. The snowy mountain is a very good place for the film and it is better to run a movie with snow, ice, cold and bad weather than a Finnish man. Action is good! The music in the movie is remarkable. The bad guy is John Litghow, the other stars are Micheal Rooker (the portrait of a serial scooter), Janine Turner (strong medicine). It's placed in a beautiful place and it's a very exciting movie. General good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember Extreme voices: special collections, good appendixes. Comig will soon be on video in Finland.
