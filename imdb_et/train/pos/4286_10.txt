I saw this movie at the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival (this is the English title "Who's There?"). Then he won the rake ... and disappeared. Terrible shame. That's great. Sublime, ridiculous, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. It has been 19 years and I've only seen a handful of comedies (or some other genre) that fit this originality.
