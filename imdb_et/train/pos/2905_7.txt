This is a very funny movie that is easy to watch which attracts you almost all the time. The director's job is recognizable and humor is his trademark. The film is a typical history of police partners like a deadly weapon, but jokes and comedy are Argentine. This is that one of them is a psychologist who plays with Peretti and who, with his help, has to watch him with Diaz (played by Luque). Some dialogues are fun all over the world: everywhere is understandable and ridiculous. Overall, it is very good, it would have deserved 8, but I rated 7 because it ends up a little. I must add to the personal note that this is "bravo" for the Argentinians, given that there has been little good lately.
