Man man ... I've been silently postponed (not the right term, there's a long list!) To watch this movie and finally it was a chance. And "news" is: wonderful labyrinth sight! <br /> <br /> For any Von Trier "follower", both Rigets, Crime Element, Dogville, Dancer Dark, Five Obstacles, and so on. probably the visual difference of this visual difference. Everything is beautifully tough and claustrophobic! You really feel within the timeframe of this "imaginary" horror. The artistic filmmaker is the contemporary "well-designed totalitarian" filmmaker coming from the surreal cinema masters, such as Bunuel, Bergman, up to the 40's film-opening protection of Von Trier with acidic drops. His authoritarian way of dealing with very complex issues, without being irrational, hits the viewer with a nerve to cure some of the deeper wounds we feed in our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> As utopian as it seems, I believe people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broad sense. Film-makers and filmmakers with such strength are no longer needed as a means of reflection, perhaps as the beginning of a new era: "The age of emotional control over our fears". It constantly offers it through its work over and over. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
