I'm surprised that no one has mentioned that there are two versions of the same movie. The lion's share of both materials is identical, but here's where they differ: in one version (the version I've most often seen on Broadcasting), there is a gatekeeper group that watches the gateway. a cleavage group of priests and brothers (fictional) exhibited by the church. In the second version, which I saw only once on television, the gatekeepers are depicted as priests of the official church, meaning the Archbishop of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). In the first version, in most relevant scenes, clerics are called "brothers" (and in some scenes you can see where lips say "Father" so and so, but the dubbed voice says "Brother" so and so. In the final version, I think everyone is referred to as "father". br /> <br /> In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a part of another shooting - all "Protector Brotherhood" scenes are shot again as "archive" scenes or vice versa (sometimes reminds me of Raymond Burr "Godzilla "dropped scenes." TV-off versions, so no, I can't imagine anyone being able to beat the two versions of the movie?
