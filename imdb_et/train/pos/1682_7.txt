After dropping the toes in the giallo basin after the masterful movie "The Strange Wardh vice-president" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed the same year, which turns out to be another complicated thriller, "Scorpion's case of Saba." who will continue next year with the letter "All the colors of darkness" of the satanic / giallo hybrid of Martino. "Scorpion's Tail" also includes actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, presenting Martino's "Your Vice President is locked room and only I have the key" (1972). (I just love this title!) I think Edwige Fenech was busy this month when they did it! Anyway, this film has a stylish trend that the fans of Martino are waiting for, as well as the complicated plot, some pieces of finely made murders and a beautiful Athens location. This time, it concerns an insurer (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here looking at the more beautiful, wiser sister of Farrah Fawcett) who got into several murderous murders after a plane crash and a $ 1 million legacy by a beautiful widow. . I really thought I had this picture halfway, but I was dead wrong. Although the plot has the perfect idea in this sense, maybe I should watch the movie again to fully appreciate all its nuances. The highlighting of the picture for me was that Anita's cat and mouse fight at the end of the killer, especially a halt to the house invasion and a nice fight on the tiled roof; There are many good activities in this movie! No Shame's fine people are thanked for another great DVD, nice subtitles and interesting additions. Whotta's great outfit has proven to be a constant effort to bring these lost Italian gems back to oblivion.
