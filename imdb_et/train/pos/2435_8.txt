I've never thought that old cartoon would bring my eyes! When I bought Casper and my friends for the first time, I wanted to see Africa seeing so much the first Casper movie "The Friendly Ghost" (1945), but when I saw the next comic, there is a good night out there (1948). made me break! I couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after killing Casper fox! I never saw anything like that in Casper's cartoon! That's the saddest! It was so depressing, I just couldn't see it again. It's like seeing Lassie at the end of the movie. I know it's classic. If I wanted to look at something older and classics, I'd rather look something happy and funny! But when I think of this Casper comic, I mean my cats!
