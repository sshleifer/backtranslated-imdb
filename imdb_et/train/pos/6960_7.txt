The man who is desperate is trying to catch the proud girl on the bus. He refuses him, but when he runs after someone trying to steal his wallet, they get together. And it begins - a relationship that is a bit corrupted by the fact that he is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It cannot be a secret that things between them are problematic. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that can allow you to grow into a cool movie. And IMO, it manages to be a nice movie. It's not a masterpiece, but I had tears laughing more than once - two guides twisted around each other in a madness love festival that is even an incredible superhero thing. <br /> <br /> So. Thin story but developed for a really funny and so worth the cinema time. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
