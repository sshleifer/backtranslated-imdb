It's not easy to make 18 different stories in the movie. Although 18 different international directors were challenging, not all of them are good, some of them even boring. But in his unit, "Paris, je t'aime" is breathtaking, showing that "love really" means "love is all around", especially in the city of love. Here is an update for 18 different stories (I will try to make it as spoiler as possible). <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE is a boring opening sequence that is nothing special. The man finds a parking spot and sees a lot of odd couples walking, thinking why he can't find a girl. And suddenly laughing next to his car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE - another dumb queue, about three teenage boys looking for some "ass" when suddenly a Muslim girl travels right before them, getting help from one boy. Really simple but sweet heart. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - it was a big disappointment! Although the great van Sant could have an interesting love story between boys with two artistic backgrounds. Finally, everything that comes after Ullii's monologue is good, everything before it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence by Coen's brothers. Buscemi - even without saying one word - is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is just fun. It held me up until the end and it gives you a movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - A beautiful story, even if the execution is bad, is the heart there. This is the story of a Spanish woman who falls early in the morning to take care of a child in another suburb. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - This segment must be strange and weird for the whole movie. Some shampoo salesman arrives in Chinatown lookalike in Paris. When I got it right, it is a story of inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - a really great sequence. The man meets his wife in a restaurant to break with him so he can get away with his lover. But the woman has some devastating news. Pretty simple, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - also a sad sequence. Juliette Binoche plays a debilitating mother. One night he wakes up a dead child. When he arrives, the cowboy tells him he can give his child one last goodbye. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - Two mime who was in love could have been big, but although they have nice cinema tricks, this story isn't intriguing or funny. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - A truly original and great sequence, one of the best movies! Young girl and senior man discuss their future and fear for a certain person ... Cuaron is doing a great lead and the actors are amazing! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. again, the beautiful segment where the sad ending of PLACE DES FETES - the woman comes to the homeless man, she starts to talk to her romanticly ... because she is the love of her life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes makes everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - A boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins who are looking for new thrills in their relationship ... very uneven and unreasonable, Pigalle is let-down. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELINE - With some diversity in the movie, QdlM is a relief. Young boy (Wood) finds a vampire that kills the victim ... Tourism and vampire ... fall in love! Dark, scary and strange romantic, Madeleine is great. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - Another Rise. Director Wes Craven and stars like Mortimer and Sewell could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is just plain, not original. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - Rumors are TRUE, Twyker's short film is beautiful, stunning and well done. The blind man picks up the phone and hears his girlfriend (Portman - really stunning) that he is breaking with him. It reflects their relationships. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this segment has been directed by Depardieu and has characters like Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also behind. Nothing happens, the lack of chemical substances between the participants. <br /> <br /> 14. ARRONDISSEMENT - The last sequence is fun and sad at the same time. America says about its French class trip to Paris. His French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment he realizes that Paris is so much more than an eye. <br /> <br /> In the background of "Feist", "Paris, je t'aime" ends in a sweet tone, let me not let it out, although some segments missed my hell, the movie unit is great! A true film experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime!
