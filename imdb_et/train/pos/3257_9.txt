I saw this movie for the second time on television. It's cute, warm, sentimental, very romantic. I have rarely seen that actors can better show others through their movements and gestures -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson just surprises herself. Masterson probably has the hardest role and it's just divine. <br /> <br /> The film is in the veil of both romantic films, for example, when you slept when Harry met Sally, sleepiness in Seattle and "high tricks" films like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got married. I hate to say this because it was a great cast and I never changed any of them - but I think it didn't work well with the above films and the above-mentioned movies, because the box office complaint was not as big as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect - for example, characters aren't particularly memorable. But that's perfect. <br /> <br /> Romantic longing is truly understandable, the "feeling" of the people in love is highly communicated, the timelessness of love and the comprehensive sweeping, the feeling of losing, and the desire to get that connection back in touch, so touching. Again and again you'll find yourself moving. In fact, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven - the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> See it - it's cute.
