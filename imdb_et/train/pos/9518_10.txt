An excellent example of this unreasonable aspect of this era. I loved visuals - a very good story about a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was very big in it, he came out very well as someone he's tightened up. which he himself did not choose) but still wants a normal life for his family. He does the best to happen. Don't want to ruin the plot - but you need to see this movie if you are a person who wants more movies than a regular shooting game / gangster. (It is, however, violent.)
