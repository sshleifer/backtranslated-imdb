After three spectators with very different episodes, Serling hit the Twilight Zone with the introduction of observers in a very strange way, planning one of the largest manufacturers of the series as the fourth episode. The "sixteen millimeter shrine" is one of the least underestimated episodes, focusing on the inability of an aging filmmaker to cope with changing times and to introduce a supernatural element only in the closing process. Because of this approach, the episode is first of all enthusiastic, but subsequent views show that it is a thoroughly stylish and beautifully written story. his frustrated but caring agent shines in his performances. The main problem with the episode is that the actor's 25-year-old video is not convincing. Lupino sees young Trent playing the same way as he plays medieval Trent, and this greatly reduces the tragedy of the situation. Fortunately, Lupino works with his socks to persuade us to return to his desperate past. This is the situation that can be understood most, but Trent is far from understanding. He is a prime donna who gives little thought to the feelings surrounding them, such as the catastrophically wretched companion he tactlessly belittles, because he reminds him of how long ago his awards were. Then it is somewhat surprising that he is given a happy ending. It is clear what will happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen, and it has cleverly opened in the moments when Trent scares his servant out of the screen. However, it is not clear at first whether sucking on a projector proves a reward or a harsh lesson about what we are living now and now. As it turns out, Trent is allowed to return to the past, showing how strong people's desire is. <br /> <br /> The sixteen millimeter shrine will improve with every view. Top-notch writing and behavior create a short, tremendous power that reflects the nature of people for a long time, even though we can never come back. Except Twilight Zone.
