I'm surprised at how many people are moving in less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they just don't understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is growing in a tough situation. <br /> <br /> It's an old grandmother who really wants her grandchildren the best. <br /> <br /> And so many critics like this movie are good. <br /> <br /> And the reason is that they understand the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the low score given by some people. <br /> <br /> I would just like to write a short summary, but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I have nothing to say.
