Well ... Vivah is a pretty good but typical Sooraj Barjatya movie. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good but not very good. <br /> <br /> The big plus point of this movie is direction, music and Shah and Amrita actors (especially the last scene). The film starts with a common factor in the Indian film - a girl she doesn't like. The story is a movie that is a bit common but it's good enough to block the movie. <br /> <br /> The negative point is the common story of the Bollywood movie. In general, I would say that you have to watch a movie twice if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and, of course, love!
