A highly addictive series. I never had an exact combination between drama, action, temporary and sci-fi. I've impressed every chapter. The scenario is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators create all these amazing stories, every character has a strange past, worries, nice relationships, it gives the human feeling necessary to create intimate characters. <br /> The most striking thing is that all the characters are linked: numbers, they are unknown before, and so on. Others, the mysterious security system and Darma's initiative, are the elements that prevent us from stopping. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what did you think to create this amazing story?
