This Filmfour-funded Sci-Fi movie is definitely visible. Manchur's candidate has a tremendous impact and does not offer anything new or original; it is treated with the utmost skill to be fresh and inventive, even though it is basically a re-launch of an earlier film. It is good to know that such movies are still being made (even if they don't get extensive publications) and Cypher is refreshing for that reason. The plot revolution that gives it a paranoia element and helps keep the audience on the edge of its seat, trying to find out the meaning of Cypher's mystery. The plot follows Morgan Sullivan; a boring suburban man who decides to work with Digicorp, which means he's listening to and recording the calls of several rival companies for reasons unknown. But her work is interrupted when she meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita ... <br /> <br /> This film contains a number of harsh white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and fit well into the future of this apocalyptic image. This gives the film a very strange look that distinguishes it from most other films of the same type, as it is the only true close partner, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. The plot is also very effective and the ditches are shaped to develop a stylish and exciting plot. You never know where you are trying, which makes it even more interesting. Action is largely good if the team of stars is largely unknown; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam sees a lot of silent and puzzled man in the middle of the eye and plays his role well. Lucy Lui is an actress who has a resume that doesn't match her talent, but she looks at her just right for this movie. <br /> <br /> Cypher is far from perfect because some sequences are illogical and sometimes may be inconsistent; but as a whole, if you want an innovative latest Sci-Fi movie; Cypher is the way to go.
