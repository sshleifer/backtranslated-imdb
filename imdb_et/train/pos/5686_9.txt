* Wonderland SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> July 1, 1981: Five People, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) is attacked while sleeping and striking his head at home with his pipes at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. <br /> <br /> The main suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), a former porn king, a 30 cm dick and now a hopeless addict. <br /> <br /> Two investigators Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine) are investigating the case and trying to break it with a witness who claims to know that John was involved in at least murder, David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbara boyfriend and tried to get a witness from Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), a Holmes 19-year-old girlfriend and Susan, who unfortunately does not remember anything more than her night-time husband's head bounced in and her almost fate was the same, and the main drug closet (who is always for women like Barbie (Paris Hilton)), Eddie Nash's name (Eric Bogosian) appears as a suspect planner of the Wonderland massacre. <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? And would Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, know anything about it? 'Wonderland' is a trained, intense thriller, a desperate love story and a story about a man's sorrow in just one; "Rashomoni" technique is used carefully (we see the events of this fateful day and night from David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very briefly) and Sharon), a nice direction and a great script, but is mostly convincing for performances, especially Kilmer, who takes his hopeless , tortured, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas's central stage, Launius is strangely tempting, Kudrow's strong Sharon and Bosworth's innocent Dawn. <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
