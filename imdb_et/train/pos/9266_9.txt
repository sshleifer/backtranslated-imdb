Ah, the best and most fun movie about women's football fans, but a little better than the teenage puzzling saga set in 1982 in North London (qv). By the way, I just watched it on film 4 [2008-12-21] and I destroy my inability to set the PVR). <br /> <br /> This is just my second favorite football movie after Mike Bassett, the English leader, "but this time with a twist that looks like a party movie team that probably continues to be banned in the country where they are made (just think about where the girls are) from the stadium, as the sun has set: a quick reaction everywhere. <br /> <br /> It is rare when a movie makes me laugh aloud, but when a rural soldier sent one from a girl to lavvies, forcing her to wear an inpromptu mask made from Ali Daei's poster, I couldn't stop waking up with others in my house, especially when a young soldier misunderstood her grandfather's request ... <br /> <br /> Speaking of toilets, I just want to talk Farsi I could write on the toilet walls (yes, there were some letters in the Roman letter, but mostly they referred to wanky-american rock bands). <br /> <br /> Also in rural areas and the Farsi theme, don't you think Omid Djalili sounds like farce? Listen to the custody sergeant of this movie and then go to "Yup." <br /> <br /> I'm not going to wear Iranian sexual policy and I'm not going to suspect action; my love for this movie comes from scripting and editing: top notch stuff. <br /> <br /> Here is my favorite list of football films: 1. Mike Bassett, England's leader 2. Offside 3. These Glory Glory Days 4th Glory of the Picture 5. Mystery of the Arsenal Stadium
