This is an exciting overview of the Soviet Union's first known serum killer hunt. I was tuned, just waiting for a semi-decent TV movie, but I found myself thrust by what the story was about. As others have said, there is much to admire here which, unfortunately, is inadequate in many large-scale publications. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit must go to Chris Gerolmo, whose smart scenario and direction will pull the viewer down until it is impossible to feel emotionally connected. The entire cast works also works great, especially for the two leaders Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing images also give their character a lot of credibility and a scene where their first meeting has taken place after a real touch of Perestroika. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your criminals' movies a little deeper and a little less gloss, I suggest you watch "Citizen X". <br /> <br />
