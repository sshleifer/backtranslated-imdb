Why panic has never received a good theater release is easily visible: it is too intelligent, and the audience would probably have had a hard time compared to American Beauty in their mid-life crisis and in Soprano and analyzed it in their study of the illegal intrusion of family life. Although panic may seem like a hereditary material, Brommel's vital characters, together with a cumbersome dialogue and a thoughtful look at the film's realistic look, are retiring from the middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy stands for Alex, who is a father (Sutherland) for contract business. He leads a double life, his wife (Ullman) and his son do not know his real trade. In his midst, he becomes more and more annoyed by what he has done all his life. The fa√ßade gathered under his peaceful building pushes the repressed resentment of his father's life under control. When she meets a young woman (Campbell), she feels enthusiastic and decides that it's time to finish the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that the writer / director Henry Brommel decided to make the profession his main character, tried to break the execution is disposable. He could have easily replaced it with any unwanted profession; His characters are so well-developed and believe that scenes that are so smoothly and realistically addressed and so passionate and naturally conversational have been written to focus on Macy's controversial character rather than his work. The Brommel script seems to be the Shakespeare tragedy, which has a definite destiny theme throughout. wait. Donald Sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive when his overwhelming father and Ullman's dramatic move by Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Pay attention to the bicycle shop, where its darkness darkens and the peaks affect emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> Henry Brommel's first feature, panic, is a film that is well-designed for his sincerity. With a first-rate selection, a credible script, a terse dialogue, and a nice direction, this character study is hopefully only for Brommel's suitability for true characters. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
