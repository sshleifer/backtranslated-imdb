After seeing the terrible, terrible and dreadful BATMAN: DEAD END knew I had to see it as soon as I heard about it. <br /> <br /> By pressing the button to see the trailer I thought I was another dreadful short time ago, what seemed so far as another bad wannabe filmmaker, trying to bring a new depth to the existing character. But instead of a very well-assembled trailer for a film that unfortunately does not exist, I would like to see a finished movie even if it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> WORLD FINEST is a BATMAN: DEAD END and then some. <br /> <br /> Look forward to the next short time!
