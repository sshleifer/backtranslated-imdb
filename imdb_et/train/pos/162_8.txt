For the "no budget" movie, this thing tends to. I don't know if America likes it, but we laughed all the time. Some really funny funny things. Really Non-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The actors and the music shook. Cars and gags and even less of your face crawled us up. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen some actors before, but never in one or two of them, I think I've seen ads or something like that. Basically it's Rocked! Luckily I have to see a copy of one actor friend.
