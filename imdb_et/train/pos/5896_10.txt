Really great movie and real story. Dan Jansen's greatest skater ever. The whole family can enjoy the touching and beautiful movie. The story of Jane Jansens in the fight against cancer and Dan Jansen's love for her sister. The significant promise given by Jansen to win the gold medal to prove that his sister Jane had rightly believed in his talents in speed care was justified. This picture is worth the time. I want them to make more movies of that quality. Thank you for an excellent actor and a great story for a great movie. This is a very touching story about the beautiful family support and faith in their children, and a special dream for their younger son and his sister.
