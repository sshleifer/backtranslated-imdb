I read so many comments that I also shared this movie remembering and wishing to see it again, but I didn't know the name of the movie. Luckily, I read the comments left here to find this site and find the title, and realized that it was the movie I remembered. Then I made a search and found a movie and I was so excited to watch the movie 40 years later. Thanks to this site and your comments, you helped me and I want to thank you all. I want to share how I found this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy. It was in the Disney's Wonderful World VHS version, which included 2 movies, the other was "The Boy and the Suck Legend". It now touched me as much as it was 40 years ago and now I own a copy. I think it's only available in VHS. I found it on eBay and I saw several copies there. Enjoy it, I know I did! <br /> <br /> This is a great story about the love of the boy and the eagle he took care of. When it was time to sacrifice an eagle, the boy made the eagle free because he couldn't kill it. After the boy had been forced to leave the tribe after the eagle was released, the eagle also saved the boy's life and, moreover, taught him how to survive. The closeness that the boy and the eagle shared in the desert were so moving and filming was really remarkable. What a wonderful era it was. I've never seen anything near this movie!
