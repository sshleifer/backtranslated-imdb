I want to add my two cents, and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth remembering the people of Damon Runyon's genius. Without a wonderful street, Damon Runyon's fun writings would never have made this film - nor most of the other great classics that worked with the players, etc. before the 1960s. Damon Runyon worked as a man of the newspaper and was from Colorado, but he certainly made a scene on the east coast. If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend some other clips from Damon Runyan's writings; "Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker", both have Bob Hope, who has always been a funny man despite his politics. (Like the West Coast Liberal, I find his politics quite funny!) Damon Runyon lives !!
