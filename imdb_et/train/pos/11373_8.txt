Here's a strange thing: a contemporary movie about a serum killer who doesn't have a fighting scenes, no one has seen death, no cars, no votes ..... and it's happening in Russia. There are only two short scenes, but they are terrible. The rest of the story is detective work, and how much bureaucracy the poor detective had to deal with. This is a very tough film, and "somber" best describes the character of the hero (Stephen Rea). However, the story is not frustrating and it is very interesting all the time. Jeffrey DeMunn is terrifying as a killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is a suspect, but he plays a unique heat in this film. <br /> <br /> Again, this story is marked with liberal agenda, here and there, not one, but two references to fears, secular psychology, police and public servants general hunger / crude oil / big, yadda, yadda, yadda. Otherwise, it is an intelligent and refreshingly minor criminal film. This is a somewhat unique film that is probably not well known, but it has been seen by people who have seen it. Because it is based on the actual accounts of this killer, it's still chilling. Don't give it just because you have nothing about it.
