Although this cute work of art uses some cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is actually not something like that. This is the political and cultural allegory of post-Colombian post-Colombian odyssey, as even a transient look at Mexican history confirms. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Like chocolate," "Erendira" expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding does little work. (A good starting point is to see grandmother's character in Spain: proud, kind, sad and above all weighted-historical.) <br /> <br /> The ultimate action of the heroine is obscure because the "result" of history (ie current) is always unclear because we are too close to him for a fair assessment. Proper attachment of loose ends to refusal is the only real choice that the director offers given the ambitions of the film. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is proud. The big screen experience would be ideal if you can review it in a local art building or university. But if not, VHS is better than never to see it.
