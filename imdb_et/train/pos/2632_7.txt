7 if you are a child 6 when you claim to be an adult. This Lion King half-order order sets aside the Timone and Pumba characters, guiding the original story through their eyes, including the story of how they met. In Disney's great traditions, lower queues are made, and sometimes TV series that include the adventures of the small characters of their greatest hits. You may be as skeptical as you like, but kids and fans of the series are unlikely to care; for them there are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few average highs. It works thanks to the charm of the highly-loved central symbols, the fast tempo, the jokes involved in the first film and some funny gags for older viewers. Animation is as good as ever, as a little less terrible than the original, but the plot is simple, Hakuna Matata. <br /> <br /> Timone and Pumba decide to watch the first movie, which often stops the average movie joking about its parts, like a real audience. We see Timone being close to the outside, she feels she's not fit and decides to go beyond what she sees to find her perfect home. On the way he meets Pumba, the other is outcast and they become friends. Soon they will meet Simba, Lion cub, natural T and P predator, but they will form a trio. However, when Simba realizes that she must follow her destiny and leave the group, it is up to others to decide whether or not to help, and how. Of course there are common Disney elements and themes, friendship, good versus evil, etc. The plot is simple but works on multiple levels, making it smarter than your average animated movie. As CG movies appear, Disney's traditional form must become smarter, but don't forget the roots that made them popular. The story of the game and everything that has come has been clever, jokes that fit all ages, and it seems like the market is moving. There is always a place for such films and you can't buy it for young people. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
