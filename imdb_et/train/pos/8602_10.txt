Nathaniel Hawthorne had previously said that her failures were more interesting than her successes. I believe that the same note could be suitable for McDonald-Eddy images. And especially that. <br /> <br /> He probably has a lot of failed movie features: it is kitsch, script, censorship, sounds inconsistent? But this movie also has some good points: good Rodgers-Hart music ("I got married angel", "Tira tira tira la"), good actor E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you don't like it, you can't forget it. This strange film actually leaves a very strong, dreamlike impression and you probably need it for days, maybe weeks. Why? At the beginning of the thirties and forties, films did not have the same meaning as today: it was like a dream to direct the public to forget about the difficult reality. Of all the dream films that were made at this time, it is especially strong. <br /> <br /> In short, let's say a better way to evaluate this movie is to watch it without thinking whether it's good or bad. To look at it as you look at the dream.
