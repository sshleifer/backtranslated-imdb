This movie has played back very well in 1932 and probably doesn't work well nowadays because its style is a bit old-fashioned and lively. However, if you are a person like me who loves older Hollywood movies, cut the movie a bit and enjoy it for what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The film is set for the ward of problematic pregnancies. This large room has about half a dozen beds where women are waiting for delivery - but doctors are worried about possible complications (yikes - this room would be really traumatic for mothers!). And like "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island", every mother has a special story. With so many quite extreme and crazy stories, you must stop unbelief. I can enjoy and enjoy the movie quite a bit. <br /> <br /> Here are some stories: one is related to Dad. You don't see a mother, but she's a very nervous father and it comes with a comic. However, he was great here - very touching. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case. Loretta is sent to the prison hospital - she probably killed a terrible man. You don't know exactly what happened, but you think he's trying to force him! Yet he was sentenced to a 20-year sentence - and his wife is committed to him and as much as he can. Glenda Farrell is a terrible person. She has hamster mother-instincts - a really bad and alcoholic hamster! She's pretty funny and worth seeing most of the movie. I loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with gin and became irritated when she learns she can't sell her twins !! Late in the film, he's a typical Hollywood-style change that had to touch - I found it natural. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who has given birth to an unborn baby. Amazingly, they put the woman back in the same congregation as the women waiting for delivery !!! The crazy woman you lost for a while looked down at the psychiatric unit. She insists she has a child. Later he escapes again and actually takes one child! <br /> <br /> There are most stories about this, but the ones I mentioned are the main ones. As I said, it is a soap opera of varieties that is very fun and quite sad for many stories. Especially it ends with heartbeat and exceptionally well done. There were some very good performances - especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as the head. All in all, there is a very good film - and I have no idea why they thought they had to redesign the film a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
