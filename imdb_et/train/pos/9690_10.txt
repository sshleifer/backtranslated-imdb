Paulie was cute, cool, enjoyable and quite satisfying. I went to this movie, waiting to watch a typical "family" movie that in a few minutes would make me subconscious and descend on the floor. My mind map changed as soon as I was fascinated by the health of the film. It is rare to find a comprehensive family film that can be 'healthy'. Most of them are cheap to produce, write and produce for the sole purpose of attracting young family members who then drag the unfortunate parents into mind when they are over 65 minutes of overpriced views and plots. plot. He talked about the story of a young girl (Marie) and her better friend, Paulie, who could unbelievably talk to her and talk quite often. Marie's dorky jerk father found this incredible and thought Paulie was damaging her mental health for her 4-year-old daughter and tore them quickly. We follow Paulie's adventures (and malformations) when he tries to reunite with his beloved owner by meeting along many memorable signs. Oh yes, Paulie could really talk and had a quick New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot kept the thick and entertaining, keeping me luring. Paulie is the best family film I've found and enjoyed with my heart. Never. Seriously. Take a copy and sit back and enjoy a real family movie with the whole family. Don't sleep. I promise.
