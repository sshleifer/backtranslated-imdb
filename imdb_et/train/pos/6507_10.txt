This series, which has probably been produced at the most favorable time since the events of World War II, is on a valuable scale that is much higher than the criticism of any individual. <br /> <br /> The world war in 1974, which formed about three decades after the events of war, allows for a precise association of events in a way that has not remained in propaganda and incline. Thirty years of passage allows us to say that it is supported by impressive and fascinating people, ranging from some of the highest military and political persons to outsiders, civilians and survivors of such death camps. it has remained to admit the unimaginable inhumanity that civilized people are capable of. In the closest or most well-known years, the interviewees have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most cases have had enough time for any propaganda and passion that might affect them in the past, leaving only memories of what they saw and what they did . <br /> <br /> The information that these surviving people are giving, the strikingly reinforced attitudes and expressions they share, give their stories even more. Names such as Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) ... the list is too long. Nowadays, in the amazing lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson, the young people who sing the same militaristic and nationalist advancement of war that led to WW2 are at an amazing price. The DVD series discussed here should be at the heart of the compulsory history of schools, so that the lessons learned at such a terrible cost these days should not have been wasted, but those who do not see the terrible price for the first time. <br /> <br /> I've almost finished a set of 11 discs, having seen most of the series when the local TV channel gave it more than 10 years ago. It has not lost any poisoning to me, indeed it has become even greater than the darkest days of human hours. <br /> <br /> The highest possible rating seems insufficient for this presentation. . I think the value of this series does not depend.
