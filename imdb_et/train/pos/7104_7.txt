Los Debutant has a story of two orphans who have gone south to Santiago after his mother's death. Older brother, confident and streetlight Silvio gets a job that works for a sliding band owner when he took his 17th birthday with naive Victor. <br /> <br /> When Silvio flourishes under the guidance of her boss, both brothers get involved with Gracia's sexual and manipulative mistress. When the film comes up, the characters are redefined when we see the fine and public ways that everyone manipulates the following. <br /> <br /> The film is well done, good cinematography and fast paced. It's also pretty sexy with lots of nudity and some pretty explicit sex scenes. He uses modern techniques to position different scenes from different points of view, in chronological order. Many people hate such movies because they don't understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and many other good movies are using this device. The plot itself is nothing new, there are elements of body, pulp and many other good films. <br /> <br /> With different layers, our understanding of characters and their motivation is developing. Although the plot may be somewhat cliche, it is also smart and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would call it a pleasant movie that you should watch, but nothing memorable. I have not seen many movies in Chile and it is always interesting to see a movie from other countries. In addition, rent it if it is available, but don't forget if it is not.
