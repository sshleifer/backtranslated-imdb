This is not a comedy by Robin Williams, nor is it a recent thriller of spicy / crazy Robin Williams. This is a hybrid of classical drama without excessive dramatization, mixed with Robin's new thriller love. But this is not a thriller in itself. This is a more mystery / temporary vehicle through which Williams tries to find a sick boy and his possessor. Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin are also starring that this holy drama will play quite a lot of news until William's character gets close to his goal. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was very entertaining, although this film does not teach, guide, control or entertain. It seemed more than I was looking at a man (Williams) because he was actually engaged in operations from a third party perspective. In other words, it seemed real, and I was able to order this story as a prerequisite. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is worth checking out, although it is definitely not a Friday / Saturday night price. <Br /> <br /> This sets 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> From Fiend :.
