Colored purple is associated with life struggles and love that helps those people who are severely affected by life attacks. Each sign had a purple element in the color. The film is about love, lost, hope, hatred and triumph. is it Celie lived through hell and lost her sister and Shug came to her life to show her love again, Albert is not the person who tried her mistake with Celie, Shug cried out and finally recognizes her father, Sofia and her stubbornness are good and bad, and even Nettie, they had the emptiness and hardship of the film, but it finally succeeded and it was a good movie sign. Good work for everyone cast and team.
