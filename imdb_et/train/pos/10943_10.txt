I have to vote out of the 10 out of 10 for this rare opportunity to look at this review, take damage to me, beat me in Hollywood and get me into my freaky / funny world. But seriously, it was good. The first episode is obviously to find the legs, but it is that Silverman's wonders run through it. It doesn't laugh out loud comedy, but it's good, too much of a laugh, and it wouldn't be right to laugh when the audience laughs, its all absurdity. I can easily see it as an example of the bizarre Drew Carey, which has strange characters and an incredibly strong central character. Well worth a look, look forward to the following episodes. Very good opportunity for ordinary comedy. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me....
