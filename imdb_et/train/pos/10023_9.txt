After seeing several Villaronga films, I had a pretty clear view of him - he focused too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting the rhythm of the film. That's why, although he has good critics, his films did not hit the public with great attention. In ARo, he follows the same line but really improved the rhythm, especially at the end of the movie. Frankly, I slept through the first part, because although the first part provides the necessary information, it is really slow. Nevertheless, the second part is absolutely wonderful and makes the whole movie the best movie Villaronga has ever done. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
