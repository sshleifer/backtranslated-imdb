I had the pleasure of attending the Pacific and Eddy screening at Santa Barbara International Film Festival last weekend. This film had been a bit of a while ago when I hit it in the magazine Jalouse. At that time it seemed interesting, but nothing was too exciting. Anyway, I saw it in the festival program and decided to review it. I can say that I was speechless when the final credits started to roll. This is one of the most beautiful and fresh films I've seen for a while. Photography, artistic direction, action and especially leadership were smooth and impeccable. There's nothing written for you in this movie and it makes you think. Something that most movies do today is exactly the opposite. The dialogue is carefully designed and although this script does not speak from wall to wall, the words in the characters are very deliberate and meaningful. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of those films that deserves another view and the more you see the more things you notice. This is a very layered and intelligent film. Not sure when or where to play again, but be sure to see the movie enthusiasts.
