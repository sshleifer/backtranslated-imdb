De Grot is a very good movie. A large plot comes from Tim Krabbé's novel, who also adapted this story to the screen. Some really top-notch performers are not only Van Huêt, but especially Marcel Hensema, who mostly did telework before Axel van de Graaf's performance. The film looks like a thriller and creates a great mood. Then we begin to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story appears in a somewhat complex setback that adds a more romantic aspect and characteristic drama to the film. Ultimately, it culminates in an emotional ending that engages the audience in their throat. When you see this movie, make sure you know as little as possible about this plot. You have to see, especially if you liked "Spoonloos" (The Vanishing original screen customization).
