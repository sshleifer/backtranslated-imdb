And I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see and hear how his Moscow phone book was read, which I know he did when he spoke Russian in this movie. <br /> <br /> All four principals are great, but the film itself is a set of good images and better scenes that have not been saved. <br /> <br /> While one is always ready to stop the infidelity while watching a movie, it asks too many viewers. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (it is in parts) or quite scary (what it is in one scene), but the director didn't know what to go.
