The rumor is that ABBA ?? Multiple award-winning Swedish disco stars have reached their zenith, the band grew up in frustrated English songs and longed for their mother tongue. Soon, problems began to arise in a one-time locked waterproof partnership, and the recordings became less frequent. The band disbanded, albeit informally, in 1982 and pop lost to one of the most famous artists. Although they have never admitted that there is truth in these rumors, it is a fact that ABBA would never have been as successful if they had only recorded in their own language. If you want to turn to the world's largest money-generating media marketplace, you need to take care of English-speaking audiences. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to me how such a small island located on the rocky side of the European continent could have created the most well-known, though not the most common, language in the world. Everyone speaks a little English; Whether it's just a "hello" or a common swear word - you'll find an English speaker almost anywhere. Obviously, Pedro Galindo did not agree, because Trampa Infernal has never been subtitled for global consumption until it was recently released on a budget DVD. This is a real shame, because it is actually a decent film that is much better than many of its English-speaking genre compatriots. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a somewhat unknown gun duel territory. For two unidentified characters, a reassembly of the ruptured complex will appear, looking for one for the inevitable final showdown. After a break and a few in the near future one of the pistols will win. Next, we learn that they were only paintball guns and two competitors are actually young people in the local city. Nacho and Mauricio are the toughest rivals and Mauricio always tries to prove he's better than his soft-spoken opponent, but he's not yet successful. <br /> <br /> Later that evening, while the winner celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend Alejandra and his friend Charly, Mauricio enters the bar and says he has one last challenge to his brilliant anger. He says it is a contest that proves once and for all to the city that deserves supreme respect. Nacho is reluctant at first, because Alejandra warns him of the dangers of continuous competitiveness, but eventually he gives up mutual pressure and agrees; much of his morally superior partner is terrible. <br /> <br /> They intend to lead Filo de Caballo to a remote area, as the recent spread of journalism has reported that many people are busy with what the locals believe is. witchcraft. Mauricio suggests that the one who kills the animal can be considered to be the biggest and he also promises that this is the last fight he is fighting against his opponent. <br /> <br /> After visiting weapons for weapons and ignoring warnings from older depositors, the group was separated from the forest land. Hunters can hunt when they learn that the "bear" is actually a killing of a Vietnamese vet who is not yet aware that the war is over, and sees all people as their enemies. As a competitive adventure, the struggle for survival suddenly began as they were abusive and killed by a malicious assassin. door to me. I remember that the track that was tracked was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled, which means I couldn't see the final scenes. Fortunately, I recently came to Amazon's budget DVD and added it to my collection right now. <br /> <br /> Gallindo's slip is a surprisingly good effort that differs from its skilful direction and enthusiastic plot that attempts to cover areas that are not usually seen with films. In fact, it's so good that he reminded me more than once of Arnold Schwarzenegger's classic Predator. This is especially evident in scenes that show the running of a troupe hit by wild banging and panic as they fight the manic playground. <br /> <br /> Despite Gallindo's apparent awareness of genre generations (bogeyman even uses a finger at his finger to kinda a la Freddy Kruegari); Trampa also tries to add something different from the standard model. While most runners play with specific rules in the category, the last third important step in individuality is when the maniac is a machine gun and attracts the hero to his nest for the final showdown. Until now, the movie quickly changes to genres and becomes almost an active film that depends on your taste, whether it's irritation or disappointment. The last slit that was trying to come to terms with each other was that the eighties entry "The Majorettes," which may not be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Like many Latin films (especially Almodovar's Spanish films) and Amenabaril), Trampa has a story with subtle sub-currents that are successfully transmitted without pressing the viewer's throat. Overcome the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner. This is a sugar-coated point, but it is gently processed so that it does not harm the fun of this function. <br /> <br /> Trams can be cheesy, but it's worth seeing and recognizing as one of the best later slashers. The killer looks great on the horrible army of fatigue and the white Valentine-style mask, and almost works on the originals. This may be lacking, which is enjoyed by the most sincere fears of fear, but it is fast enough and at least one to ensure at least one look at creativity.
