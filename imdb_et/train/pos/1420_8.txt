Celebrating Earth, Disney has released "Earth". Staying far away from every darkness and destructive message, we are treated to the excellent film material of our habitats without feeling too badly. <br /> <br /> The stars of the exhibition are the elephant herd, the family of polar bears and the whale and its calf. The narrative begins at the North Pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics, while introducing the members of different climate zones. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned when we look at polar migration routes. cart; It is noted that in recent years sea ice islands have decreased. We never see a bear on the bear, but his father's desperate search for food causes him a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> Karibou's airborne images that migrate across the tundra are one of the most outstanding natural shots I've ever seen in Saag; this and the other migrating bird species are enough to pay a fee for viewing large screens. <br /> <br /> One of the frustrations I felt was that otherwise the scary big shark seals were filmed. slow motion. Never do you feel any sense of wildlife; their incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the high speed of the movie I thought started (or at least what I saw) was the TV show "Kung Fu" in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> An interesting side light is that during the course of credit it turns out that some of the cinematographic techniques used show. In this movie, there are enough dramatic, humorous and educational moments to make it a natural choice for natural buffs. Perhaps due to some selective editing (saving us as it was from the prey-predator) and the fact that this movie was released in 2007 and available on DVD, it is in itself a solid film. And you can take your children! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
