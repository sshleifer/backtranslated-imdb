Yesterday I attended the world premiere of "Descent" at New York Tribeca Film Festival. I spent a great time. It was sold out and on all the major stars, including the spacer Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 7.5 starting with a possible 10 stars. starts at Maya (Rosario Dawson) College. You can imagine a typical college environment with wild parties and flirting. Photography in this film was great. He meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they get dear. It starts like every other relationship at the beginning. A man is looking for a woman's attention and affection, and a woman plays hard. Both played well. Very innocent flirting between the two. She calls her into her apartment and everything breaks down. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very rough and dark. Finally, they reach the basement, which is extremely dark and lighted with many candles. It really reminded me of a cave. Here's where he shows his true colors and promotes him to rape. This is a very dark and sharp rape. This scene is not for the young or the weak. The rape scene is a bit long and difficult to take, but it's necessary for the next movie. <br /> <br /> Maya is now losing her soul to drugs and sex. He gets into his abyss. He starts to go wild and wake up in the morning in a room where he doesn't remember how he got there. He said to go to Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say he is the person who saves everyone who needs saving. He's the one who introduces Maya drugs. They start with addiction relationships that play later in the movie. The movie scenes at this point of the movie have been captured with extreme experience. I thought they were well done and noticed that the photographer's director was approved by the audience at the end of the exhibition at the time of the credit. his class - Jared's rapist !! You may see confusion and emotion in the form of Maya. What should i do? What to do now? His face and emotions are priceless. <br /> <br /> What follows is not really what is happening. He acts against Jared. He seems to be trying to revive relationships and be expensive again. I was sitting there saying if it really happened. It wasn't. Nothing can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> He invites him to his apartment and of course he will appear. Now her apartment is dark and sharp. He's slipping him completely. She thinks she will be "happy". Then tease her like any woman. He hugs him everywhere and he's excited. Note: Anyone who plans to see this movie is a full-featured scene - it may not be right for the younger viewer. <br /> <br /> Then he turns around and gets the beast and gets him rape. Once again, the scene is dark, sharp and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you see a movie and don't want to know what happens next, skip this section and continue with it. This is where Adrian repeats the picture. Maya has Adrian saved (?), Making Jared a very tough male. He thinks it's the last revenge. Adrian still takes all of Jared's masculinity and leaves nothing to dignity. Marcus, like Adrian, plays this scene as credibly as anyone can. He is a strong actor who plays a strong character and strength appears all over the screen. After the movie, Marcus explained during the Q&A session that this scene required great trust between him and Chad. Maya believes this revenge will save her, but I don't think it would be. One last scene has Mays face and you see a tear under your cheek. It was a fabulous closeup scene and creates a constant debate with anyone who is going to see this movie. Did he get revenge for what he wanted? Was it as satisfactory as he expected? In my opinion, this is not the case. It only makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, works well and recommend it to anyone who thinks about it. I would be a little hesitant when I was under 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be praised for their work. Leadership and photography must also be praised. It was the night I enjoyed.
