Soylent Green I found it to be a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's run, it's like that. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is old and there are no special effects, and some actions can be described as "cheesy", but the story is great. <br /> <br /> A story about how the world can be and its impact on society is very amazing. <br /> <br /> Finally, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story unfolded at the right pace. <br /> <br /> This is the closest present day equivalent to the "Dark Angel" of how the US is shown to be a third world country.
