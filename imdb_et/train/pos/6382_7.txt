Definitely a very good idea, the scenario was just OK. It may have been better, the positive is that it didn't carry you when you're an adventurer, a new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. That idea had so much more potential than it did. They should have come out with a better adventure than that. It wasn't at all bad, but it would have been much better than having more running time. say it was boring or was not good .. Good for those people who like adventure animations like Sindbads, like tea el Dorado.This film is also recommended for people who are looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending.
