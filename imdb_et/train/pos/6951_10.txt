I was never a big fan of television until I first looked 24 times. I got into the series very late. Season 5 ended before I saw my first episode. It was the 3rd episode of my older DVR (digital video recorder) box when I was sitting at the house over the weekend. It took one episode to be a Jack Bauer in the world of hook and sinker. And the boy was hooked! I watched the next six episodes without flashing my eyes. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for twenty dollars for an unlimited month and it goes without saying that it has been the biggest money I've ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. This is an 72 forty-minute episode !!! I say it's easier to find out what happens next to a DVD than wait a week. I can only imagine that you wait six weeks a week !! I find it a bit embarrassing and cruel, but I give it a try and look at it like the rest of America! The DVR is set and you can bet to beat me a little!
