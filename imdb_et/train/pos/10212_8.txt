All this movie is worth seeing right up to this great final moment - to finish it in any movie I've ever seen. Ideal, beautiful, funny, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this movie admirable, even though it is too serious for French. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I loved the way Algeria knit - and by the way, the music at the final credit is great. I want a CD!
