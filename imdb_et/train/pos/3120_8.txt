Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne! I've heard that many people complain about how he film this movie, and some have even compared the style of the camera with the Blair witch project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding me? Come on, it wasn't that bad at all. I think this will help you to feel more realistic about what you would prefer in stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the film, you didn't even notice it. <br /> <br /> You can say that Damon is really happy with Jason Bourne's role. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it is really good. He will be part of this Jason Bourne. Damon is also a big supporting cast of Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition because he added more depth to the CIA secret organization. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie is full of big cars and non-stop measures, they managed to achieve a fair amount of character development in all that is happening. This movie is above two other Bourne films and is definitely one of the best movies of the summer season 2007!
