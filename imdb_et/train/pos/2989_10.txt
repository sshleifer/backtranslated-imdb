First of all I would just like to say what a big fan of Bette Midler is. Stella is a very good movie with great pain (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite films. She is dealing with a mother who is raising a child independently, she goes through many things that are not her daughter Jenny, whom Trini Alvarado played perfectly. This movie is very good and I suggest you watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And it deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I'll give it from 4 to 4!
