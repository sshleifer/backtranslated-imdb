This movie is so cheap, it's nice !!! Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn), who offers the most entertaining pictures in film history. I attribute this 2 copies of the movie to the video ... one, Ralph Macchio is actually caught in the backdrop of Earthquake when he is at "Hash". Of course, they forgot to make a mistake about the movie, but it shows when the movie is funny when the actors themselves can't keep a straight face!
