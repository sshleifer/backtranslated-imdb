The word "classic" is thrown away today, but this film deserves an appeal. Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (perhaps the world's best living comic artist) and the late-cast combination of George Burns make a comic book. It is interesting to think about what the film would have been like, as death would not have prevented Jack Benny from playing the part of George Burns as planned. Matthau's apartment reunion scene is unlikely to cross the surface. Definitely one of my desert films. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
