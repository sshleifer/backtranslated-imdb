The Grudge is a remake of Shimizu's own popular Japanese horror film series. Shimizu knows he's not doing anything new, so he does what every intelligent person would have done with him: he forgets the logic and focuses on the fun of the spectators. He uses commonly known clich√©s associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. Nonlinear narrative is not just a trick, but an interesting way to present different perspectives. Finally, when the only purpose of the horror film is to intimidate the audience (just as comedy has to make people laugh), this film succeeded in flying colors. I watched it with the audience in the theater and it was fun to see the viewers go wild. It probably doesn't play in your living room.
