House of Games is a wonderful movie on many levels. This is a good mystery and a shocking thriller. It is blessed with great performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna and with strong and strong supporters and introduces Ricky Jay, the sharp extraordinaire of the card, the prestigitator and the magician of history. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is said to act as a habit and to give the film (where reality is often questionable) an additional dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> On this, the House of Games has a convincing look at an unknown world that is different from The Sting, played only with glamor and yuks. At this level, it succeeds in an amazing way. <br /> <br /> However, you cannot escape from professional competence to incredible strength and self-realization at a deeper level in the woman's odyssey. The only movie I know is that treats a personal woman as a worthy woman as well as an underrated private sector Benjamin. Unfortunately, this thoroughly enjoyable movie spreads its focus by jumping across a number of topics and using Goldie Hawn's fine performance to track light laughs. The House of Games will stay in business. As the Poe once spoke of a good story, he consistently drives it to conclusion. <br /> <br /> There is another movie-female strain expressed by Thelma and Louise, a big budget commercial money maker. a despicable subject that women are doomed to, regardless of whether they understand their inner strength or not. What is this? <br /> <br /> As usual, you should see this movie in the movie. It should be natural for film festivals. Name it close to one close if you get a chance. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23-year-old daughter. Better if he should see it on television, if not at all.
