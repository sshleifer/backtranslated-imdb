First, DO NOT call this '63 movie a new blood. Even if this version is more serious on the stage, it is very long. With some exceptions, the casting was good. Chyna Phillips was not a good election. He was almost 30 years old when he made this film, and it was hard to believe he was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly surpassed her role as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny when Harry McAffee, and showed he could even tune. Like the movie '63, they knew not to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with Birdie's role and it showed. I even have a soundtrack and I love listening to my song. So what made this TV rating a flop? It was long for one. They put new songs and scenes. While some new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Now don't get me wrong, I liked it, but I'd rather watch '63 movie (see my review). It was just a case of some participants that changed roles by making some changes, and again, LENGTH. One more thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. He does a good job with music and role. Give him the lyrics and he could sing them. So here's my advice from someone who has made a few productions by Bye Bye Birdie. If you would like to see a game that is more accurate, see the '95 version. Just take it moderately. Don't be a hero and try to see it all in one session.
