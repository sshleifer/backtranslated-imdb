Henry Fool, a low-key indie drama of 1997, would probably have been a safe choice for movies that no one would have to look back at. Cropped, scattered stripe (Thomas Jay Ryan) walks around the city. His anarchist beads and scams inspire the nerdy garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write poems while Henry is half-heartedly catching a man's sister (Parker Posey). When the poet flourishes, Henry gives up. Nothing special means any sign or story. Harold and Maude's ghost would have been more likely to appear when it ever appeared on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Parker Posey is not a non-official queen in India. So, when the writer / director Hal Hartley came in with a new embodiment, the film was born. Although we arrive with the same characters years ago, they are completely different in dark comedy; it is espionage! Henry can be an international spy - and possibly a double or even triple agent - many years before others meet. He is either dead or obscured by representatives and powers of many countries. Everyone wants their own rambling, an inconsistent magazine that can simply contain encoded secrets that can destabilize countries and economies. Posey's Fay is the woman she went to the sheep or her widow, depending on who says this truth. Fay's endeavors to find Henry and / or hotly challenged magazines include reversible international strikers and henchmen everywhere. He never knows who should believe or trust. We don't. <br /> <br /> While these improbable characters are retained in the quest for Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan's territory, the Hartley script retains the humor of its first appearance, the humor of irony, the untidy mess, to expose them to physical threats. His modern geopolitical paranoia, double and musical-chair attachment scheme will end. However, fans of the first film are pleasantly surprised by the novelty of Hartley's recycling techniques.
