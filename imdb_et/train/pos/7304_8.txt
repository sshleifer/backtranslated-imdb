Every time and then, the film advertises itself as scary or scary, although it is not usually the case. Most modern horror films fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are those films that simply do not cause tension and adrenaline through their veins through the usual pump. They fear you to a level that you have never experienced. "Halloween" is such a movie. It takes so many risks that most movie makers would light up. But almost all of them work. "Halloween" is frightening in its simplicity and in its entirety. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a babysitter at Halloween night, while the madman is brutally murdered 15 years ago after a mental institution escapes. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, is going to kill the local teenagers and finally he will arrive at Laurie. <br /> <br /> Looks familiar, right? Just another pointless teenager, full of stupid youth and gore. I do not belive. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his "Halloween" review. Because of this title, Halloween is often grouped together with all the other spraying materials that populated the entire theater around the world. At the end of the 1970s and early 1980s, while Halloween is rightly considered the father of the modern Slasher genre, it is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> It has some points and for many reasons. while most of the decorations of the genre are foolish gore-fests (it can be said that many of the latter are tongue-in-cheeks, but most of them fail). that violence is not equal to scary and it relies very little on it (in fact, the body number is quite small). It is based on the ideas of the fears and also on the skills, the gorieri and the more sadistic, and thirdly, although some characters may make stupid things (which sometimes close their fate), they do not d because they are fools, the characters are real people, so instead of thinking about the characters dying because they are idiots, we are scared because they make a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why "Halloween" is so scary is that it is so easy to believe that it is real. There is nothing hard to swallow in this movie. There is no supernatural, there are no ridiculously creative plot elements or "inventive" murders or anything. Instead, all the set pieces and the camera's operation (starting sequence of recording) are simple. Carpenter just puts the camera in place and says it works. What we get is the feeling that we are actually seeing a murder in front of us. <br /> <br /> Fear films are probably the most difficult films, because in order to be scary, everything has to be perfect and ideas never work twice. This is a hit or absence game, so if I told you all the good ideas Carpenter has (which I don't have), they seem to be primitive (especially since they have been repeatedly and repeatedly repeated over the years). <br /> <br /> Working here is not a plus, because it doesn't have to be. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, contradictory characters. Actors act like real people, not story characters. Nothing more. The exception is who plays the shape or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary if a person doesn't say anything and just kill it, but it's hard to pull down (and even harder to keep people asking why). But the man pulls it out and the result is terrible. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's movie through and out. He directed it, wrote it, compiled it, and wrote it for cooling. It's a brilliant man and his later film "The Thing" supports this statement, though Thing is not as scary as "Halloween". Unfortunately, his success has dropped dramatically, as it happens when large producers are used to attracting large amounts of money for less freedom, "know your potential." As good as this movie is, it's not without errors. The famous opening scene is annoying but not very scary. And not many scare the work for the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no reason to be afraid of "shape." Fortunately, Carpenter uses that time to create a relationship between characters and the audience. Although there is no intimacy in this relationship, this is the purpose. We know the characters, but not so much that they die. But when the movie comes to Halloween night, when Carpenter starts doing things a great deal and NEVER stops until you reach the end. This is a tremendously frightening movie and must be seen by anyone who loves scary movies. Be warned, however, that this movie scares you of living hell!
