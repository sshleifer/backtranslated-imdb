The daughter's words are poetry: "I can't go for another year. I have to go to the hotel room." "I lost the blue scarf on the sea." "Marble faun moves ... he just gave us a washing machine. It's a thing." "I've powdered this last thing." "..trunks and cats become too boring for too long." "..like a small rat nest, a better mouse hole." And in mother's words there is wisdom: "... yea, all is my joy." "This little book keeps me straight, in color." "Everything must always be done correctly." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me my little radio that I have to have professional music." "I'm your mother. Remember me?" This excellent film draws the mother / daughter relationship. This is Mother's Day movie.
