This is one of Dev Anand's films that gave the Hindi film industry, such as Jewel Thief and Guide, great, but different films. The story is short (if you ask me what is the story), the plot is simple - the brother is looking for his missing sister. The sister has joined hippies who smoke in the pot and sing Hare Rama's hound Krishna. But the film shows some of the important events the world experienced in the 70s. Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom, escape, family, and something new, such as religion (which was white). They are completely processed. Zeenat gave her the best and Dev as usual was remarkable. The songs are best used in this film (unlike their abuse). They are not spoiled. One perfect example is "Dekho o deewano ... Ram also naam badnam na karo". The words of each song are very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but it's not the essence of the movie. In general, Devji, who believes in making different films, has shown what he wants to show here. You must see how to experience Hippie culture and beautiful 70s Nepal.
