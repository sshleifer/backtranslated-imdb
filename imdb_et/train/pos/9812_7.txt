"Great Goodbye" introduces us to the first Holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard, a private investigator Dixon Hill. These episodes create a standard model that is repeated several times in both TNG and DS 9 and Voyager. After entering Holodecki, something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program in different situations than playing the game (represented by the failure of the holodecki safety program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to broaden Star Trek's capabilities and mix some genre. Picard's Dixon Hill stories are examples of the 1940s crime fiction and their portrayal on the screen is called Noir, who often has a leading stereotype (see, for example, Chandler Marlowe's stories or Polanski's all-time classic "Chinatown"). Star Trek never focuses on the story (usually it's just a "how-do-we-get-out-of-scenario"), but allows participants to approach their characters differently. These Holodecki games are usually used for recreation and reflect the private interests of team members. Therefore, the technical aspect has always been neglected and from this point of view, the stories never sound (but did Star Trek ever have a technical, scientific point of view, which I mean by some utopian concepts?). <br /> <br /> "Great Goodbye" shows relaxed Patrick Stewart, McFadden, who hardly saw the Star Trek episode (at least early) better, and Data also has some great scenes (although I find it hard to believe that pulling a lamp the plug on the wall would have really surprised him because he did the investigation of this period and its customs. Wesley continues to turn peaceful tricks into potential murderers (why didn't they bring him to the holodek and let the gangsters stop him?), but all this is fun ...
