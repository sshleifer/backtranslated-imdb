Often laugh out loud, sometimes the sad story of two divorced men - Lemmon is a neurotic clean "house husband" and Matthau, a sliding athlete - who decides to cut costs. <br /> <br /> Very well photographed and targeted. The script is very octave - it means that almost every line is always more than one. Particularly funny scene includes two British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem to be entertained by everything someone says, but if Lemmon strikes his children out of the photos and yes, the former husband-to-be, he's girls before him before Matthau can show up allowed with a drink! <br /> <br /> Very fun.
