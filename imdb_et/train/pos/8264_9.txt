Based on the actual mining disaster, this early German speaker (with English subtitles) is still one of the most effective documents ever filmed. "Kameradschaft" gives many non-professional actors a look at the friendliness that binds mining workers, no matter what side of the French / German border they may be. The deadly accident brings out all the best, losing the orders of the bosses. The team miner who needs is able to get help from the spouses, even in the event of big losses, including a life threat. <br /> <br /> This film resembles the self-sacrificing heroism shown by the NYFD on 9 September. By ignoring the formal rules and rules, these men and women knew only one reason in the common knowledge: saving lives and finding their firefighters. - More than 70 years later, "Kameradschaftil" is still a strong and timeless message: a helpful friend is a friend of a work.
