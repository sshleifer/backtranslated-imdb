my name is Heather and I'm a girl whose story is based on this movie. I want to thank all of you who saw and enjoyed this movie. like crude oil and harsh, like some of the things depicted in this film, it was not even very close to describing how bad things were. not to mention how everything affected my mother and my little sister. Thank you again for the wonderful comments that everyone had, I really appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mother. It is hard to believe that so many years have been made of this film. It is even harder to believe that people look at it a year ago. For someone of you who has gone through the same or similar situation, please know that there are people in cyberspace who fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each other.
