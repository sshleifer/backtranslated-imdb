I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, which I saw about 2 years ago and it really is my head. Never before saw such a sick and twisted thing. The story is good and the actors do their thing very well. I haven't seen the UK or Japanese version, but I have to say I believe the German DVD is a little censored. If you haven't seen the movie and lived in Germany, maybe you're better off watching a DVD from Nederlands or Austria. I-ON DVDs contain many very difficult and unpleasant scenes, but in the showdown I felt something was missing, about one or two very short scenes. crazy characters and a high level of violence that I like Mike!
