This film is mostly lupine, especially Funimation. Other than bad dub, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is similar to a comic (which is what all of Lupin's third things are based on). Lupine is trying to get a huge treasure. Fujiko uses Lupin's weakness in women to try to get something out of it. The last bit is not so bad, he's with another woman, but of course Fujiko is still in front of him. <br /> <br /> Many other Lupine movies are more families where words are in Lupine. Every good Lupin fan, which I think is pleasantly surprised (I know I had heard so many bad things after this movie). It may be a little better if small animations do not move during the credit (they make it small), but in general it is not a bad film. Suffice it to be one of the few I look at Lupine III films again.
