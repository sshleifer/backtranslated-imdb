Having set up the sitcom world with the next work of 'Father Ted' by Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan, the BBC was forgotten a gem called 'Hippies'. Although the couple were created, only six were written by Arthur Matthews. Ray Purbs, a hippie in London in 1969, is an editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his flat mate, very recumbent modest, and cannabis smoker Alex, his "girlfriend" is feminist Jill and none too bright Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was great as Ray, but he's all he has. This sitcom was feeling "Citizen Smith" about it. Ray was very similar to Wolfie Smith, trying to defeat society, but he was unhappy. Finally, this sitcom is released on DVD in March, I can't wait for it. As it was repeated in 1999 and on terrestrial television, my memories of sitcom are not too good, but I remember two episodes really clearly, the first is the opener "Protesting Hippies", which I think was a great start - where Ray goes against the sandpaper and the other The episode was "Hippy Dippy Hippies", which I thought was episode 4, again a pretty clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, the audience received a negative reaction from sitcom (I don't think why). The BBC ordered another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against it because of a negative reaction. Oh, I can't wait for a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies Series 1 Episode 4.
