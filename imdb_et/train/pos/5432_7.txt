.... Rather well done, in fact - attacking evil cables in their camp, stop the Little Big Horn style ambush, save the day through the kid boys buggy, works for me. Stiff Upper British lip and all this. <br /> <br /> So how does it play on DVD 66 years later? I liked being western, submissive to Apaches or Sioux Thugide, and a US cavalry for the British British Army. It's very colonial in the long run, you know? White Man Load and All That? Kipling would certainly have approved. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks, and MacLaglen play it as widely as possible, blending some friends and shocks. (I had no idea Joan Fontaine was a symbolic military woman - did they leave some of their scenes on the floor of a cutting room? Very short) None of them asked for an Oscar - in fact, Grant wasn't his best for some scenes - but it works. And where else would Ben Casey India be buggy? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. Check it out if you like adventure and pseudo-western style. It took a bunch of profiles, well I can add. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
