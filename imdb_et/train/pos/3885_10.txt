For the first time, Eddie was introduced to friends who know that I like intelligent humor. I prefer comedies that can be provocatively entertained, such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In 'Dress to kill', Eddie offers the same type of social humor that stimulates your thoughts on the subject all the time and at the same time causes your side to crack. There are many topics in this stand-up and they are just hysterical. Englebert's decision-making process leaves you stitched! <br /> <br /> Thanks to Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
