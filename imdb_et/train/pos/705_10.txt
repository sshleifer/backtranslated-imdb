I came through Insomniac's nightmare looking for independent independent movies and happily saying it wasn't disappointed. This crazy half-hour ride was amazed all the way and the end was great - one of those NOOOOO moments that really stay with you. I have shown it to many people and everyone seems to have agreed. The little ghostie girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. He hated me, I can say a lot. Nanavati did an excellent job of briefly summarizing it. All the pieces just got into place and you can tell that he is a great writer of what he did with this script. So well written. This is undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. Management was great and the actor was enjoyable, but the most important factor here is the strength of the scenario. Good work for this girl, I can't wait to see more!
