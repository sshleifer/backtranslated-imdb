Depardieu's most famous film is this (1974) Bertrand Blier shredder. It has many very sexual scenes based on the X-rating, including one by Jeanne Moreau, who makes his 1970s version of his Jules and Jim, wearing two furry French hippies (Depardieu and Deware) trois. There is no such thing in the film as the sacred territory; everything is a fair game. <br /> <br /> It is very strange that Americans do not like this movie very much, while many of the French people I meet find it classic. Something like this is contrary to what the Americans have "similarly" programmed. <br /> <br /> Gerard and Late Patrick Deware are two bitches, hippie drifters, who have many sexual insecurities and who laugh at women and commit small crimes. They are beaten and anti-capitalist, Euro-commie, slacker's freedom. Blier gets them from two men to hell while at the same time making civil society more ridiculous. But the best thing is how wonderful Stephane Grappell's score gives the drifting soul of the drifters, the deeper subconscious, or the "higher ideal" that motivates all their actions.
