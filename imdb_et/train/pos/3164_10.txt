I can't believe we don't have this 70th exhibition anymore. I have all 8 seasons of this 70's show !! I absolutely love it! I put in bed every night and look at several episodes before going to bed. At the end of a long busy day, it is a pleasure to let go and laugh. I was so sad that they took a breath ... at least we still have turns! I hope and pray that they will come back at least with reunification ... As maybe when Donna finishes college and we can finally see her and Eric get married !! Isn't that awesome !!! It would be even better if they continued for several years!
