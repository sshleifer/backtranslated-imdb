Val Kilmer ... Love her or sometimes her, sometimes she goes under the character's skin and pulls out a performance that makes you 'Hi! This man is a great actor! He made Jim's leather pants in The Doors and he did it again in John's leather panties. <br /> <br /> During the fall and fall of King Uber's King John Holmes, Kilmer turns his knees to destroy one of the greatest mysteries of murder that Hollywood has been solving for more than twenty years. Holmes is the main suspect in the brutal Manson-style killing. <br /> <br /> What Kilmer does with effortlessness is an amazing celebrity, all who wants it to cross anyone who was and then lost. Look at her, you know what I mean.
