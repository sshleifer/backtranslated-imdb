This movie has got terrible ratings from almost everyone who voted here, but I'm here to tell you if you like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber. If your movies, like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id, have to get a different angle. But I still love this movie and all this, even if it's a kind of "kiddy", it's one of the few movies that I and my freinds have been able to watch over the years and possibly quote. LARGE MOVIE. This movie should be AFI number 1 because it is so high. The only problem with this movie is that you may have difficulty viewing it because it was made for a TV channel that no longer exists. So I don't know how to get this movie, id like to buy it on a DVD, but I can't find it anywhere. I still have it taped when it was the first time you can come over if you want and watch it when I could sleep. this film tends to and it is basically all you need to know.
