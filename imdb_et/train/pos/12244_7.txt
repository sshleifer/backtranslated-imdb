Due to the winter approach, our state-owned broadcaster, ABC, has for some reason decided to take part in a Jane Austen festival on Sunday evening. It started twelve years ago on a twelve-year-old version of Emma's movie; There are three more new versions to come, including Persuasion, Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park. <br /> <br /> The curious thing about A&E television networks about the production of which the manuscript is always Trusted by Andrew Davies is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much larger budget movies, one of which was Gwyneth Paltrow and "Clueless", "Modernized "The version starring Alicia Silverstone, who spent the plot on Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even if Kate Beckinsale is in the lead, this production dropped without trace. <br /> <br /> Generally, much is lost when novels are put together to fit the length of the movie. Adaptations that tend to both enjoy and remember are those that have enough room to develop both the story and the characters. An excellent example is the "Brideshead Revisited", which had 13 50-minute episodes in 1982. In 2005, you only have to compare the "Pride and Prejudice" very ordinary movie-length version with the brilliant six-part 1995 mini-TV series. It is not that the novel should be filmed by page, and some novels (often not very good) adapt perfectly to the film ("reconciliation" is a recent example), but Jane Austen's novels need time and space to express their full charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of customization, this production is OK. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right combination of confidence and vulnerability, and Mark Strong is honest with Mr. Knightly (he reminded me that Jane tends to deal with it? Knightly is more expressive Mood Darcy P&P version). Samantha Morton was pretty limp Harriet, but Prunella Scales got Miss Bates perfectly? Sybil Fawlty at speed. Bernard Hepton as Emma's weak father was also great. We saw a damp countryside, mud and poverty, as well as cozy interiors when someone thought it was an idyllic age. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shortened customization, was it strange slow in places? some conversations were rather harsh, even if they allowed the formalities of the times. I have to look at the film again to make sure it is, but it may be due to the lack of use of the response frames. <br /> <br /> If you like the filmed period, this is a very good example. and compare well with the Paltrow version. Anyway, there's still coming!
