The documentary begins with setting the perspective for several light years. The passenger travels with our dairy to the sounds of our earthly life as a space monument to (potential) extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> The documentary includes films by Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J.B. Lenoir. J.B.i material has never been published before. The narrative comes from the "dark Willie" Dixon. But this is done by the actor. The film shows the work of all those early blues men, followed by the covers and interpretations of musicians such as Nick Cave and other bad seeds. <br /> <br /> J.B. Lenoer's death (John Mayall's song) is a story striking event. Lenoir got political action and is considered a league of Martin Luther King and his peers. His political interests can be found in the topics of his words. <br /> <br /> Blues has been found to be American native. Blues have roots and the rest are fruits. <br /> <br /> The title "The Human Soul" is after Willie Dixon's song.
