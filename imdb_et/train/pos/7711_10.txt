Okay, so Robbie is a bit of a glimpse of today's standards, and some actors are pretty tough and most of the special effects could be dubbed a bright 12-year-old with a decent computer editing program. And don't let me start with the poster. <br /> <br /> It's still a great movie, 40 years after its release. I grew up on Sunday after watching the "fiction" of the local "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater", so I've seen quite a lot of SF movies in the 50s. At a time when most of the films were striking a rubber band, and that he would demolish the miniature city model, Forbidden Planet forbade the bar forever and showed that it was possible to make a sci-fi movie that actually had a plot. I doubt that many of the films made in the 90s are still worth considering in 2030.
