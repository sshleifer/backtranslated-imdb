I've seen this movie in the premiere of the Monaco Imagina Festival. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago and from that moment I was waiting to see the end result. I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is a 3D movie with high contrast black and white. Obviously inspired by some comics, such as F. Miller. In this optic, it goes a step further than the magnificent blue urban change from R. Rodriguez. This time (almost) there is no gray or medium color, but in the realistic animated film you have never seen a graphic style (can't wait for the scanner dark) <br /> <br /> The huge use of Motion Capture gives many lives and credibility to characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect will focus on more classic elements such as direction or plot. The direction remains calm and controllable, despite the endless possibilities of the media, and it is really a good surprise. <br /> <br /> The Futuristic Story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fi movie and keeps the viewer interested until the end. In spite of the classic baseline (research that goes beyond initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain companies ...) are of great interest to this film. this is an animated movie, it is obviously not for kids. You will not find any funny pet here or foolish family morals, just cold reality. This is much closer to the good film of the girl. <br /> <br /> I found the device to be one of the best aspects of the movie: we still know well about Paris, but it's moral because of futurism. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I regret some mistakes. Editing is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very clich√©-slowing effects and some bad dialogues. Although it is excellent, it shows some romantic sequences (a bit like "final fantasy"). These little things make it 7/10. <br /> <br /> This is a successful artistic challenge you have to look at. Director Christian Volckman knows how not to get into potential traps (fortunately, they didn't ask John Woo to do this job!). <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a movie with blasting glasses, a smart story and a wonderful artistic direction. See if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse spelling mistakes.
