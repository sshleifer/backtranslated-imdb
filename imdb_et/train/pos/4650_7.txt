As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the beautiful Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) scenes in this movie. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer pod, in this case the inert Rb 75 (Maverick) rocket, which was painted black, the letters "EWS 39" on the white edge. True jam sticks are certainly not such, at least not what I've seen. <br /> <br /> But besides this, it's a fun movie with a very fun ending (last minute). Anyone who wants to see different Swedish military units, including the legendary SSG movie, should see it. <br /> <br />
