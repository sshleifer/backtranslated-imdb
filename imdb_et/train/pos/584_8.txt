An excellent film that deals with the old man's life when he looks back years. Since 1910 he recalls his boy and adolescents; his family, friends, romans, etc. A very nostalgic piece of the bittersweet final .... "all things come together in life and the river runs through. And this river haunts me." It's worth seeing.
