Tony Scott can make good movies and bad things, personally I think he might be a bit flashy and trash, and his work probably suffers compared to his pretty famous brother, but it's probably his best film. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so big is that Scott gives Denzel (a burning form, better than a training day) and a revelation of Dakota Fanning's time to create a true warmth and affection. Creation is not absolutely boring, although it takes time - it is involved and takes us on a little journey, including the excellent role of Radha Mitchell as mother. It all makes the action as effective as we have invested in such characters, because of all their obvious weaknesses. This movie has you all over the edge and doesn't end the end. <br /> <br /> The film wouldn't be without Washington, of course. I often don't know why he seems to be getting so much victory if he's quite as good as almost any leading man (I can really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more screen power these days). This film should have been huge, considering its status and strength of performance and the quality of the film. It just shows you that if the studio doesn't return to the movie, it will go straight to the video. I wish I could see this opportunity on the big screen.
