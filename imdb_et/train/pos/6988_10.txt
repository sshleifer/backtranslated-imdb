This is one movie that takes off your head when you see it. The dialogues are in perfect proximity, which was expected because it has been adapted from the game. The actors just do their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure bliss! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is completely believable in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still a beautiful blonde (but not so stupid) offering joy to the eyes as much as the ears, Jean-Paul Rouve gives an excellent assessment of the whole jerk (and is proud) over it) and Marina Fois is a dark friend who always looks the least. <br /> <br /> Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and associates to customize this great game and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I want them more today. If you liked it, you'll probably also enjoy "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by a couple of Bacri / Jaoui.
