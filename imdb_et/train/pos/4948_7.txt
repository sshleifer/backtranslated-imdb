It is an excellent, simplified film that explores the subject and gives each viewer something different from what it takes. The premise is simple: the unnamed celebrity actress (Morgan Freeman) decides to explore the future role by visiting the store and watching people. She is particularly interested in the "10" or "Less" lane (Paz Vega), for whom she finds a friendly, strong and curious presence. character of the characters in the character study. There is no ordinary character training; they represent the whole world. The life of a cashier is a harsh and depressing "real world", while the actor is in such a fantasy existence that he cannot do simple tasks, such as remembering phone numbers. He admits that he is face to face with people, and the whole point of a true human being shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only the actor is inspired by real people for his work; we also see the opposite process. Several characters know Him and suggest how he has inspired his film roles. <br /> <br /> A favorite song from Al Pasar la Barca about how a girl refuses to beautify and reflect. instead prefers to pay (ie honest work) for boat trips, it could not have been better to choose. It is parallel to the nature of Vega, the only shop worker with a brain or ambition ready to do a successful job. (This is quite an endeavor, someone who looks like Paz Vega.) This is a strange little film that is probably made for a shoelace. If you don't remember the slow pace and the "conversational" approach, this film attracts. Characters are completely contrasting and effective action makes them loving. Nice time.
