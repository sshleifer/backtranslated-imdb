The prison is often not present during the interviews of the best eighties horror films, and the reason is good because it is not one of the best ... but when you passed the classic films of the decade, it is certainly the least well known / smaller. The film has nothing to do with blockers; in the beginning it is Renny Harlin's early guide; capable director behind several feature films including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly, we have an early role for Viggo Mortensen, the King of Rings. The film is not quite original, but the plot line is interesting. We focus on a prison that has been reopened in a few years. It was a prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to an electric chair after the prison governor had designed it. Of course, the spirit of a dead person does not end in peace; and when the old filling space is reopened, the sentenced spirit of the dead will flee from revenge. <br /> <br /> The film is not exactly the Shawshank Redemption, but it takes care of building its various characters, and at the same time, the main point of the movie is always horror, the drama behind it makes an interesting foundation. It is also a good job because, other than the basic principle, the film does not really have a 'plot' that we would go on, and we rely solely on the interactions of the characters to keep things interesting. The horror of the film is sometimes grotesque, but it is never up, which may actually be the reason why this film is rarely remembered by releasing it in the decade. The murderers themselves are quite good and imaginative and provide some important items. When the film goes on, we begin to get deeper into the ghost convicted of retaliation, and while it is quite interesting, some things don't make sense and drags the film a little. But all causes an exciting climax and generally I have to say that Prison is a movie that is well worth it.
