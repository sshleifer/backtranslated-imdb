This film is undoubtedly the perfect 10/10 for all your people who appreciate this movie as low class because it has no "good plot" or something that is ridiculous, saying that Jackie Chan's movie is bad because his plot is like saying porn movie is bad because he has no plot! you look at Jackie Chan for the THE FIGHT SCENES, because this activity is not so much focused on a good story or something when you look at how he makes movies and compare it to American films of other ages and even later you realize that Jackie Chan's movies were over the most fighting scenes and not really good plots, while American films had good plots, but shitty scenes compared to what Jackie Chan did at that time. Porn is watching porn, Jackie Chan is being watched for ACTION, I think people are bad about it because there's no plot because you think a smart movie critic appreciates a good movie, but how do I see that it's a good movie that's a film that can make me for entertainment. Of course, in the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORN, but put it so that the rest, which are all scenes and stunts, pay a lot for it. This changed the way American action films were created, even the stollen scenes of this movie. If you want a real man, a real entertainer, then watch this movie and much more about Jackie Chan, he's clean everywhere. He literally makes American films in the park and even in TODAYS films. American films rely so much on special effects as on security cables and doubling of stunts. The police story and many other Jackie Chan movies are the work of a real entertainer who just goes out and is very talented about what he can do. masterpiece
