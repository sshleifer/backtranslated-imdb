"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical account, a heroic story and an understanding of the cultural background of an important event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington embody a terrifying work, a determined hero, Steve Biko, but also gives the public a message about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid. The story of Biko, the influential leader and his main "influencer", Donald Woods, is heartbreaking. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" succeeds in communicating the optimistic aspect of a seemingly disturbing plot to its audience. Because such big films have become public in educated terrible events in history, great leaders who wanted to stop them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. Because of its importance, Cry Freedom is an amazing movie that everyone should see.
