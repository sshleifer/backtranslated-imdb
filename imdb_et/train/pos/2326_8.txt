Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they both fall in love with their neighbors (Jason London). But it is not after the terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing can separate them and that their love for each other will never disappear. <br /> <br /> It was a truly heartbreaking story of first love. Probably the most painful story of the young love I've ever seen. All the actors are amazing, and Reese Witherspoon is giving a great result in her first film. I Give The Human Moon 8.5 / 10
