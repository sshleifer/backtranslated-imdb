There are many diseases in the mind of man that have been given modern life. Constant vigilance or accumulated information in the area of ​​Psychosis has kept psychologists, counselors, and psychiatrists busy with the work they have done for decades. Sometimes some of these spiritual phenomena are discovered by those who do not know their remedy or even their existence. This is a movie titled "Night Listner". It speaks of a popular radio host, called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends his evenings with memorable events about gay lifestyle. Perhaps this is because his exhibition loses his authentic veneer, which makes Noon admit he is no longer himself. Feeling that both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannava) and his best friend (Joe Morton) gave up, he is seeking shelter for his deeper despair and isolation. It's here, a mysterious voice at night asking for help. Noon must feel useful and reach out to the desperate voice of a 14-year-old son named Peter (Rory Culkin). Reading a boy's compelling manuscript, which depicts early life and sexual abuse in the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is exciting and wants to help. But things are not what they look like, and Noon will soon find himself in a complex and bizarre story that is broken by a medical nightmare. This film is pure Robin Williams and it wouldn't be comic for Toni Collette, who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Ohit like Anna and John Cullum. Instead, it can be more serious for William's performances. ***
