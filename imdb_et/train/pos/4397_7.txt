Ordinary historical drama with some fine battle scene. Tobey Maguire delivers excellent performance and provides a pretty good backup. The script is literate and quite original, and the film is held freely by the hero. This means that it drags a bit and the last roll is too much like a TV mini-series. At the same time, Frederick Elmes keeps the camera work alone from the eternal bits (and every time you see what he worked for you, David Lynch). It's worth seeing.
