Returning to the 36th chamber is one of the classic Kung-Fu films that Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the western countries of Hollywood spaghetti and the main character Gordon Liu, a colleague of West Clint Eastwood. The digitally remastered and new edition made for Fantastic Film Fest is "Performed in Shaw Scope" as the good old days. <br /> <br /> This movie is a simple story of good and evil. 3 actions that more or less summarize the explanatory letter of martial arts about this era. <br /> <br /> Law One creates the premise. The employees of the VÃ¤ike village painting mill are not satisfied with their lot, incoming manchu gangsters reduce the salary by 20%. They can't do much about exploiting them, because none of them are martial arts skillful gangsters and their bosses. First of all, they had little success in getting Liu to embody a highly qualified Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse appeared when they brought too much credibility to each other. <br /> <Br /> Act Two shows the main character who wants to come back on the mobile. But without true martial arts, he begins his journey to the temple of Shaolin to try and learn about martial arts. After some tiny moments he finally gets to the abot (whom he has called!), But is disappointed with the teaching methods - like Mr Miyagi's style Karate Kid, but instead of fencing he is confined to constructing structures throughout the temple. Nothing can hold a good man down and inadvertently builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu in an unusual way. <br /> <br /> Law Three is where the fighting festival begins. Cheesy sound effects maximize the impact of any obvious contact. But it is quite refreshing, looking at the fighting scenes here, its wide-angle shots to highlight the clarity and detail between sparring partners and the use of deceleration to only show stunts at different corners. You may find that the fighting speed is too slow, some pauses between movements, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style used for flocking Hollywood, they certainly do not make fighting scenes as they were before! The 36th return to the chamber will be repeated on Monday, so if you play a nostalgic trip on a memory card, what are you waiting for?
