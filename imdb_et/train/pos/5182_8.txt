Quiet, sweet and pleasantly nostalgic movie about how it has to come from old friends and young people around you with all the memories and the problem and sadness of today. A film that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here: old jelly, competition, friendship and loyalty. Adventures, night fridges and all the other fun things we all remember about our summer camps. All the characters can experience it again during the week, because the old camp leader has now retired and wants to meet the camp's golden children. All of them are now in their thirties and in the midst of their careers.
