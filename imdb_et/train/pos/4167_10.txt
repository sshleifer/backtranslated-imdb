Fucking Dog: Hell Hound is a really good movie. It has a good actor, including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong.Music is horrible and gives it to the devilish cold! I liked this effect on the dog and I think this creature saw its horns, close to the neck and really viscous! have not seen The Devil Dogi: Hell of Hell before and can find and buy this rare movie and do it because it's a good movie and I don't think you're disappointed!
