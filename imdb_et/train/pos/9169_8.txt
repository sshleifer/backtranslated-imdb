I liked Timothy Dalton very much, though he was a little young and too beautiful for R. but I thought Zelah Clarke was too thick and short. However, this version was very true to the novel and well filmed. I've seen 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite R, although George C Scott did it very well and it was Toss Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although they were both too old for that role. Recently I saw Rebecca's brilliant TV version with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would like to see these two Jane Eyre. At a time when I was able to watch Ciarini's version, I thought I was Jane Eyred, but I don't rob them of the first few minutes when I heard Joan Fontaine's voice tell the first version I ever saw. I always want to go back and read the book again.
