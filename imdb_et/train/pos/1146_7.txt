This film is a fictional soap opera. It's very fast and funny. To say something else would destroy the film. The film has several plots and sub-regions. This movie is a band equipped with the hottest stars of modern times. They all hand over top competitions. This movie is my favorite since 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of daily soap opera / main soap opera! If you look at the soap, check out this movie fun !!!
