It's not too bad ab movie, Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald, and even Willie Best, we could be Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint etc. to get the opportunity to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, the usual city, murder and murder - always a joy in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie is heavily cooked to apologize and clear his framed and dead father, the police detective, planning and executing his kindergarten assassination of the underworld. What would have been the opposite! Sanders join the fun just by dancing in the right club at the right place in the right place at the right time with the right lighting that falls on him and the first killer (on time!) And kills him. > <br /> The story and actor OK, the only grip I have, has ended with a quick and almost ridiculous discovery of the wicked genius (Waldeman) - did they almost forget their importance on the plot? That means the series is sure.
