WHITE SUITI MAN, like I ALL JACK, takes the workforce and the capital blind. Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but eccentric (he never acquired a university degree because it is ... err ... accident in a college lab). He succeeds in pushing the textile industry into various industrial laboratories. When the film begins, it is in Michael Gough's company and Gough (for a memorable moment) is trying to impress him (Cecil Parker) by showing him the shape of the ship. Lunching with Parker and Parker's girls (Joan Greenwood), Gough gets a message about some of the problems that the lab has to deal with suddenly big budget problems. He reads enormous expenses (due to Guinness experiments) and his coffee chokes. <br /> <br /> Guinness continues to work at Parker and repeats the tricks he did with Gough - but Parker discovers it. Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on and persuades Parker to continue the trials (but now legally). Result: Guinness and his assistant have apparently identified how to make artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic connections of the molecular structure so that the fibers remain within all the goals and conditions. All the textiles made of it will not disappear, dirt or wear - it will last forever. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a female store manager but not her manager. He sees Guinness selling to the rich. But when he explains to them what he has done, they turn to him. If everyone has clothes that last forever, they don't need new clothes! Soon, Parkers' compatriots are textile industries (run by Gough, Ernest Theisinger - at an excellent stage and Howard Marion-Crawford), who are in the same panic that may end up in their business. They are trying to suppress the invention. Only in Greenwood's own corner (although Parker resembles him), Guinness is trying to get the public news about his discovery. <br /> <br /> Finally, Guinness strikes science and greed. . But he finishes the film with seeing his error in the calculations, and we think that one day he can still pull his discovery. <br /> <br /> This is a great comedy. But is this an argument for suppression? At one point, difficulties in producing textiles are shown (you need to heat the threads at high temperatures to connect the ends of the material. There is nothing to indicate that the fabric stretches when the owner gets fat (or a contract if the owner gets thinner) Do we believe that people What would happen to fashion changes and new styles? And fabrics are made in white only (Guinness looks like white We are told that the color of the color should be added to the process before. Wouldn't it affect the chemical reactions that keep the textile structure? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not a research paper, but a film about the hypocrisy of labor and capital in modern industry. This is brilliant, but the issues I mention interfere with the validity of Guinness's inhibition of the invention.
