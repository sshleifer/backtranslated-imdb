I am a pretty fan of Mitchell Leisen, so it was very expected that I rented this movie, but I was very badly printed so I used it and burned it seemingly repaired. So dark that in some dark cinematic scenes you don't see any thing. That means I think I share the same opinion as the first review of this movie. It starts abnormally and does not make the lines or rhythms of your typical Hollywood 30 movie. Heck, not even your typical Hollywodi movie of any age. Europeans seem to have influenced the director because there is a certain kind of mild realism that begins during the movement and placement of the frame, as Maggie (Carole Lombard) and Skid (Fred Macmurray) meet. You are waiting for the parties to start singing "Make Believe" of the Song. It starts with a few laughs and poor Anthony in the role of one scene, where he doesn't speak English to Freddie. Skids are the dust that doesn't care about being a dust. That's why she enrolls in the army where she hides from the world. He's just released, but the script shenanigans, he leaves his boat in New York. This is when the film starts with a big move and we begin to get these sixties in the French film whole procedure. Scenes work with both Lombard and Cecil Cunningham, so the film gets a pulse. MacMurray is good even when he and Lombard fall against each other when he takes care of his talent for the trumpet. Then the bully comes in the form of Dorothy Lamouri. Enough plot. The film has fantastic sequences of assembly that blinded me. They are very good. And Lombard appreciates this movie at home, but in the second half a little more is called Freddie and he doesn't deliver goods. With a strong melodramatic ending and an actor you don't believe, the movie will be short, but because it is not your typical film structure, set design and direction. Worth a look. What was one of the 37 hits of the 1936-37 season. I don't know its exact rank.
