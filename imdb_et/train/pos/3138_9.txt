Yes, I did when I was sitting here with a red face, remembering that I felt almost guilty when I looked at it a few weeks ago when my wife decided to look at something unequal (compared to "Mommie Dearest"). <br /> <br /> How to explain the "Batman and Robin" complaint - I mean the only ones who ever read Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible exhibition, with terrible plots and terrible acts - and yes, it was terribly funny! The same applies to this "reunion" and "rebound" movie. Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile is sold for charity. But it is stolen and our bales (like yourself) jump into their old characters (if not their costumes) and go out to find out what happened. Along the way they resemble the series, we see how it all came together when Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden played the young Adam and Burt TV series. In fact, it was quite interesting that some behind the scenes reaches the old series, and Adam and Burt just returned perfectly to the character (although they were not really character - well, you should watch it to see what it was nice to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, you hate it. If you - disable heaven - you thought Michael Keaton and George Clooney accepted "Batmans" then you hate it. with Adam and Burt and you are still ready to admit that you have never forgotten the episode, it is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
