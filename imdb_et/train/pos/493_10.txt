I've been a Star Trek fan for as long as I remember. When they announced the fifth series of planning and premiere, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The company's premiere was unexpected. It was well done with the perfect setup and great work done by all the characters. NX-01, Enterprise is the ideal ship to show what many people love. <br /> <br /> Scott Bakula was just better than Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a command to T'Pol. That only two people in this wonderful new team are taking us to the great history of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> The company looks like it's a good series to look at, and I recommend it. Look out.
