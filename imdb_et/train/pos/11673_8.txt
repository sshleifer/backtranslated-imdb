Having seen Charley Boorman with Ewan McGregor in the Long Way Round, I was very interested in seeing Charley at her own show. I thought Charley had come across as a beautiful man who was very grounded and on earth. It's nice to see celebrities fighting for their weight and fitness, but also showing their people! I don't know much about bicycles, but this exhibition took me right from the start. Preparing and organizing this event seems immense. The event itself seems to be very dangerous and I am glad to see why Charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets. I love the pace of the show and fast music. I can't believe he broke his collar bone, I hope it's not the end, I can't wait to see the next episode ...
