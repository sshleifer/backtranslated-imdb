An amazing cult film since 1979, when Vince Lombard high school students face a new dictator, headed by Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music that hates and blames students for their musical tastes for their violations. Fighting against him is a fun loving Riff Randell (PJ Soles), # 1 Ramones fan, who wants more than anything that a rock band would record. <br /> <br /> Now * it's * impossible to resist the movie. First of all, the soundtrack is incredible, in addition to artists such as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena's Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just some of them. Next, it really gives him everything, Soles is the ideal choice for Riff's role; he is a true joy. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are serious when Tom and Kate, Woronov are well received, because it is nervous and despicable Togar, Clint Howard is one of his best parts of the laundrette Eaglebauer and New World, like Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (especially fun music teacher Mr. McGree) and Real Don Steele are fun as always. And, of course, it's a pampering to see The Ramones itself. <br /> <br /> The film has a real spirit. The energy level is high, the creator of co-creation and director Allan Arkush bring a lot of praise to the procedure. There is also a great sense of humor. A paper airplane is a great example. It extends to the "sweeping" style of the scene transitions. There are even fun giant mice created with future make-up effects that are noticeable by Rob Bottin in one of his earliest concerts. <br /> <br /> About as good as a defensive, defensive-one-right-party film received by the authorities. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is just a great cult film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
