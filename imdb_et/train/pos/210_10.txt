Two great comedies in a great Neil Simon movie based on his stroke. <br /> <br /> Great combination, especially if the comedians are Matthau and Burns. Little wonder why Burns won the Oscar for it; She is as sharp and funny as ever. And Matthau is forever your game if it is more familiar. <br /> <br /> This is a familiar Simon Territory: two old Vaudeville partners join a special television, but still can't stand each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see these two choices with each other, their scenes make this movie an absolute joy. I myself enjoyed "knock, knock, knock / insert!" scene. And if you're either a Burns or a Matthau fan, you'll enjoy it too. <br /> <br /> You actually enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little sunshine in your life.
