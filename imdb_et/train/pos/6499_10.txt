After all these years, I still consider this series to be the best example of making World War II documentaries. Interviews with participants from many countries from all countries differ from all other projects. It would be nice to see a modern documentary on this subject (Ken Burns?) And try to gather information about veterans before they're all gone. With the help of modern technology that improves the old archive material and the much information that has emerged since 1974, when The World At War was introduced, the updated version of this series is welcome. The history channel has made some fine exhibitions on many aspects of World War II, but the expansive series, such as the World War, has not been successfully made since the original. If you are interested in this timing, don't miss this series. You need to look at it.
