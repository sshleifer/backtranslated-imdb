The season after the end of the season seems to be the characters or characters of this show you are sure to hate. Does it indicate whether it is the same or selected? Each episode specifically undermines one person and eventually kills. You will enjoy seeing that they are screwed, even though it's totally wrong and ill. You will be happy to see how these others are screwed, turning themselves together, playing dirty, getting it back, escaping and finally getting out of Trump. The number of tears also seems to be increasing by the season. <br /> <br /> Benefits that try to compensate for the downfall and suffering of the past are also greatly reduced. In the newer seasons, it's similar to "You will meet xyx who reads uvwi for you". The characters are so hateful, collectively and individually that you don't know if they are paid actors? The only reasonable one can win. <br /> <br /> Watch out carefully and hold your conscience. These are your fellow humans on the burning line.
