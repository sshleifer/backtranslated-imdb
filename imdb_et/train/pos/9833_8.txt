Terrorist tries to steal the most secret biological weapon and during the escape process he gets infected when the case of a deadly agent is threatened. The soldiers can get the case, but the terrorist goes to the hotel where he tries to hide. Finally, they do where they hide, and "cleanse" the hotel and its inhabitants. Unfortunately, they destroy their bodies by incineration, and if you have seen the return of the living dead, you know what will happen next. the complete mess of the movie. Although this is a fair assessment, it is not without high scores. First, it has many bloody deaths to keep the gore-hounds happy. There are plenty of zombies that seem to have come out everywhere. They are in the water, in the rafters of the houses, they hide the trees, and for some reason they want to hide under the dead brush, but stoop to heroes trying to escape. There's even a flying zombie head that hides in the refrigerator. You have to believe it because this scene alone makes Zomb 3 look like IMO. This can be some terrible editing and some very questionable actions, especially from a doctor who has to be one of the worst spectators, but Zombie 3 is still a very fun movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit and watch a movie that doesn't need anything more than your time and open mind. Zombie 3 is suitable for this account and then for some. It's even more enjoyable if you open a few beers and watch it with similar friends. I'll give him 8/10, just because of the pleasure.
