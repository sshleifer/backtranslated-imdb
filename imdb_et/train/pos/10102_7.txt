I have to say it has been a long time since I've seen it, but I've seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical / comedy pairing of new or fading stars with highlighted music groups. Kay Kamer's mysteries would be a good example. <br /> <br /> The release of Spike Jones is the best part of the show because he and his band play a lot of stories and are part of the action, doing a good job of support. Hugh O'Brien plays face, Buddy Hackett, rumor is what was offered to Lou Costello and thus to Abbott and Costello. Don't know if it was true. <br /> <br /> Everything is a pleasant movie, but it is important to have so much history of Spike Jones and his band on film. I wish it was released as I have not seen it for two decades or heard. I hope it is not gone
