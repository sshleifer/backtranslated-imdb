This is the best film ever made. It deserves more than it was at the Oscar. Candidates for things like his score, artistic direction, supporting role (Newman), could have been easily named for the best picture, director (Mendes), actor (Hanks), supportive actor (Newman and Law) and won !! Hanks gives his best performances and the child playing Michel Jr. was so good that I am surprised that I don't see more movies today. Critics themselves did not give enough credit to this film. But besides incredible performances, the second true meaning of this film is incredible music. That was the best result of the year. It was set but not won. This is a great movie everyone should see. My class A +
