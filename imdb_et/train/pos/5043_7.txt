Bill Paxton was a very promising director for his debut. The very dark thriller recommended by Stephen King and who really did it. It is a strong, well-thought-out story about a committed but demented man in Thurman, Texas, which continues to murder after receiving orders from God to control demons. A couple of plot turns and misfortune in the finale will make your money worthwhile. Most of the violence you don't see, but still enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays a twisted man known as God's killer. Matthew McConaughey is as impressive as the oldest son of a demented man who reaches this story to the Dallas FBI agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is sure and flawless. Exciting white white knocker! Highly recommended.
