Eyeliner had been worn almost 6,000 years ago in Egypt. Really not so much stretch that it would be in the 12th century. I also didn't realize that the series was floped. There's another season of aeration that isn't right now? It is amazing to me that comments are made by those who are either poorly informed or not seeing an exhibition at all. It's a waste of tile space and another time. The first show in the series might have been a bit painful because the cast started to come, but it is expected from any show. The rest of the first season is great. I can't wait for the start of the second season in the United States.
