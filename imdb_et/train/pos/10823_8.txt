I've always liked Johnny Concho and I want this movie to be on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra is one of the most unusual performances in this career. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Frank in the title of the movie, he is the brother of the notorious army who is out of town. Brother fears fear in the heart of the city and Frank is using it to tempt the townspeople safely and safely. Only Phyllis Kirk has the feeling. She is the daughter of Warehouse Warehouse Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other armed forces arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dark, and it turns out that Conrad has killed Sinatra's brother and has come to take over his city. They lower Sinatra and drive him out of town. Kirk follows her. <br /> <br /> Overnight Sinatra turns from punk to coward and becomes a man looking for some backbone. This is a well-performing performance, almost as good as his Oscar's golden-scarred man. For some reason it has not been seen for years. <br /> <br /> Two other remarks are Keenan Wynn, a former armed force who turned a preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs for Conrad and Dark. And then Conrad is what I think was his career role on the screen. He is an incredible malignancy, pure evil embodied in walking and speaking on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> But what I like about Johnny Concho is the main unforgettable place Conrad and Dark are doing. Let's just say I believe Johnny Concho was the MGM's response to High Noon and the plot you are doing when the evil causes you to break all laws and procedures.
