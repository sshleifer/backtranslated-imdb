In my opinion, "good times" must-this CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. I also love the theme song. If you asked me, although I like everyone, it would have been nice if everyone had stayed during the show throughout the show. Everyone always gave good results, production design was remarkable, costumes were well designed and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can now be seen on television, I urge you to catch it when it comes out of the air.
