Steve Carell is at the forefront of his first 40-year-old Virgin, as he had only supporting roles in films such as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his Daily Show, and we were just a little taste of the comedy Carell really does. You can say that Will Ferrell influenced his "comedy air", but Carell takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, lovable and fun. I do not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the greatest comedies of our era. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old old virgin has two hours of non-stop laughs (or 4 hours when you see it twice) as I did), is perfect for supporting cast and big executives across the movie audience. The script was perfect with so many great features that you want to see the movie again to remember them all. The music fits perfectly with the tone of the movie and you can tell the director knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with sex toys, nudity and a lot of language, this movie is not for everyone, but if you liked Wedding Crashers, Anchorman or any movie along these lines, you will love the 40 year old Virgin.
