I and the two sisters looked at Tenko's three series and agreed that it was one of the BBC's best series. All of the cast particles were very convincing, and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower, it was overwhelming, and on my evenings my evenings would be the same without it. No doubt we'll look at it again because it's a series I never see . Great viewing and complete signs for the BBC on such a brilliant series and casting. The first rate in all departments and recommend this series to anyone, although some age restrictions have to be taken into account due to some adult material. So thank the BBC for distributing this series on DVD and video.
