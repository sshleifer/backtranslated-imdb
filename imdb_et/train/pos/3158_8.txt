There are too many new styles here, but what works best is the old fashioned audience and indoor. This 70th exhibition is a great example. When the show came in, no one actually heard much less from Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp who were well played by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both leaving the show for other interests this year). I want Topher to be around because the exhibition started with his character, Eric and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already on our way to John Travolta. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland on his own, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. We never knew what was good for the actors, because a glorious cast member could ruin it. I miss Mo Gaffney, who played Don's friend Joanne. I continue Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the substitute couldn't match her and I'm sorry. I liked designing Tommy Chong as a wasted but beloved father of Steven Hyde. I loved watching Tanya Roberts apart from Charlie's angels. I loved Brooke Shields to play Jackie's mother. He really showed his ability to act before heading to Broadway. This exhibition has been a joy for many surprises. I hope this exhibition will last longer, even though 2 of these cast members will leave, but I hope they will not go too far too far. I wish the creators of the exhibition, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also create their second favorite, The Third Rock of the Sun, are more successful at Fox than they were in NBC, which sabotaged their show. Turners are not dummies and I hope they will create more such shows in the future.
