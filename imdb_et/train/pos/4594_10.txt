The best martial arts film that has ever been made. This one movie is better than something Bruce Lee ever did. A classic, thoroughly fun and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts and kung fu the real king. It is a pity that Bruce Lee was so overrated that Jackie Chan was forever getting popular in Europe and America. Jackie Rules !!!!
