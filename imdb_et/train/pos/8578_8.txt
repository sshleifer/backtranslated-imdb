This film is one of the best American 90's B movies. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some activities, lots of smiles and varied language for policemen who fight with gangsters, it's worth watching. Everyone looks a little landscape, but that's really what the movie is, and it's pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and they have to make another movie.
