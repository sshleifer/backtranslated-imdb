If you want meaningless action, hot chicks and an apocalyptic view of Seattle, this is your play! <br /> <br /> The Dark Angels concept is nothing new (in fact, the contradiction is whether James Cameron stole the idea from the book), but I spend the whole hour watching it every Tuesday from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba smokes and Max's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max must be a bit better (slang sounds forced and it seems like someone in the suburbs is living). <br / / <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a very innocent joy filled with everything that a fan of the action might ask, but if you are looking for a hard hit, an award winning drama, look at "The West Wing" or something.
