Although I agree that this is a good, but not a great movie, there are many other reasons to mention posters. One reason is music: I call attention to the very cool look of Candol's brothers - Conte and Pete - in a well-staged scene in a nightclub. These boys were two of their best jazz trumpeters of the day, and they convincingly convinced Jimmy Stewart to play a hysterical trumpet duet with one trumpet in all of Stewart's ears. Candolis played well, though I suspect that the two scenes of this scene actually duplicated the music later. I don't know much about George Duning, who gets credit for music (except that he seemed to have worked with three Stooges more than once), but choosing Candoli brothers while playing jazz was a real nice touch.
