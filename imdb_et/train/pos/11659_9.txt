This animated feature (co-production by Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is definitely one of the most beautiful themes in the film: the creation of a famous illuminated manuscript in the 9th century, the Kells book. Bringing the story fantastically, Brendan of the prostate, who lives in a monastery under his uncle's leadership, is a stern abbot worried about making abatia's defenses against the upcoming attack of the fated Vikings in a forbidden forest to find the materials needed by the headlight Aidan to finish the book. To accomplish this task, he unexpectedly discovers a friendly fairy with the help of Aisling. Excellent and delicate drawing by hand (some computer animation on some key channels) in a way that reminds me of medieval as well as traditional Celtic art, and the very creative use of color art and all kinds of geometric shapes is a creepy film, but it is a strange, not fancy variety, but eye opening. If anyone wanted to go to nitpick - some anachrones like the African monk in the 9th century Ireland? we should say that the mixture of Catholic mysticism and Celtic paganism in this film never ends. And the comic relief is sometimes a little too wide. That's why I can't give them the highest rating. But these are small problems that are otherwise pleasant and perfectly imaginative.
