This hanging roaring west and I've been watching it many times and it's entertaining on every level. But if your actual facts about legends like Hickcock, Cody, and Calamity Jane are looking elsewhere, as John Ford suggested it was west, when the truth becomes legendary legend . The story is moving at a splitting pace, and there are two big observable stars between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur to help make this movie. An Indian scout, too, there is a very young Anthony Quinn, who made her debut as a Cayenne warrior, and she married a Demilles daughter in real life. Indeed, the character of his Quins, who informs Cooper about the flash-cut back of Custer's bloodshed, is a well-made finale and when the role of credit it protects America's western American history. So please take the time to watch this classic Western.
