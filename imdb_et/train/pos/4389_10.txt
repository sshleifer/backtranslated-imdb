From the super-impressive painful operation to the intelligently written (and highly quoted) script, from ultimate cinematography to Carter Burwell's beautiful music score, Rob Roy offers rare film experiences: one that is almost impossible to find in any area. <br /> <br /> Braveheart has made many comparisons that came out in the same year. Because of all of Mel Gibson's credit, Braveheart hit me too much of a self-conscious and preaching epic to compete with Rob Roy as a film I'd take care of more than once. Braveheart is working hard to be a serious epic, but Rob Roy grabs you and sucks you into his tightly edited storytelling. No scene wastes. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy contains the ideal balance between dramatic tension, action, and even casual humor. The characters are well thought-out, perfectly transmitting the native and manicures that confirm them during the setting of their authentic period. <br /> <br /> In addition, they are not good and evil cartoons, as we often look at even in a modern movie. For example, while we hope that heroic Rob Roy dominates, we realize that his predictions are products of his own pride and respect. Tim Roth plays one of the most disgusting evils in cinema history, but there are moments when we understand how his life's events have shaped him. Rob Roy uses his level of character development that makes this story even more plausible and appealing. Rob Roy is a joyful treasure that has one of the greatest chores ever choreographed and climate change deserves everyone a tight wait.
