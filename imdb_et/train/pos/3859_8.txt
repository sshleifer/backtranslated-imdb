Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (Fourth Person) is one of the most compelling thrillers I've ever seen. It was a really pleasant surprise. The story is related to two sexual writers, Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), because he is attracted to relationships with beautiful hairdressers Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but there may be more stories in Gerard's twisted sense. Verhoeven and operator Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and ill sexual images, it will draw you a story, you don't want to look, but you can't keep yourself away. This is far from Verhoeven's best film (maybe another only for Robocop). True Fourth person is not for everyone, some sexual scenes are quite free (just ignore them, but trust me if you look at least ten minutes, you are hooked. This is one of the movies you need to know about how it ends, a real horse Hitchcock tradition, convincing, controversial, and exciting. I even like spider metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10
