First of all; I am Modesty's dedicated fan and have read comics because I was a child, and I found earlier films about our hero's discontent, but where they fail, it's ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well, here we go: Mrs Blaise works at the casino, the robbers arrive and she starts gambling with her friends. If the robber won one round, he must tell him. If he wins twice in a row, one employee goes for free. (It seems silly, yes, well, I'm not so good at explaining ..);) <br /> <br /> He tells him he's growing up in war, without parents or friends, helping him in the old-fashioned refugee camp and how they flee, living by natural rules. They swell the food and teach him to read and fight. When they approach civilization, they get into the war, and when they are taken against the rebels, they are shot down and the old man dies, leaving him to meet the city. <br /> <br /> Then he will meet the man whose casino he is currently working on and the story will end there. <br /> <br /> What is to follow is that there is an awesome fight and the line is completely cool. Alexandra Staden is TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise! Just modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as a comic. <br /> <br /> It seems inconvenient, too, to hear that Modesty speaks with a slightly broken accent, but it is not appropriate because the comic book can't speak loudly, but there must be a somewhat existing accent. (Not to mention that it's strange that everyone speaks English in the Balkans.) The actor is really good, even a child who personally personalizes Blaise must be commendable! <br /> <br /> My favorite piece must be where she dresses to get the buggy robber fucked! Totally awesome! : D I can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie / <br /> <br /> Look at it, you don't have to be disappointed!
