Probably the best achievements of Bigas Luna will achieve a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. Tasty Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe's Lifeforce, is a pre-earning lust for young Biel Duran. She doesn't get Mayi's breasts out of her mind and wants them to suck badly and breastfeed her mother's breasts. His event is today's movie. As with Luna works like "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings his strange but beautiful story to a slightly distorted sexual sensitivity. Ordinary suspects are being attacked, but open minded women enjoy this foaming erotic poem on the breast of women. The images of Jos√© Luis Alcaine are proud and the score of Nicola Piovan is sweet and rich. Gorgeous anarchic sensitivity, of course, spoken in Spanish.
