35 years old, Groove Tube looks like a real TV today! Special nude sports, TV show stoner drug dealers called resellers (area Weeds and even before 1978 Cheech & Chong Up in Smoke), strange beer advertising (Butz Beer, no less odd than Bud Bowls), dirty - minded child's clown Size (Pee Wee Herman tones), even Chevy Chase, who made slapstick humor (violent hairdresser duo) a year before his 1975 debut on Saturday night. And thanks to the infamous opening order that served Groove Tube's initial X rating, I still can't hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking of naked dance-pop-ups - for movies with similar sketches, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women to the Fashion, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, the Dynamite and the Firesign Theater all you know is wrong.
