This is one of those films that make better trailers than full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and different, humor was unique, I just felt like missed the opportunity to put a "movie" in that movie. So many rows and gags were left too long without a definite ending and didn't leave me laughing. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was too little used in this film and needs more exposure and more opportunities to schedule her character on the screen. 7 out of 10 for me, more DVD rentals. I also searched for a sensitive music video during the end credit that has become a trademark of those romantic comedy films about Mary, meet parents, but again I was feeling a little cheated that it could be a much better movie with a little more music and punching . It seemed like it was in theaters.
