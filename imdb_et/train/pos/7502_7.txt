Although I really didn't know anything about the character of Lance and felt that his wife could do much better for someone else. It could have been a much stronger film if they had spent more time on character, maybe with Lance I would have liked it. "And quoting Glenn Quinn's character Beni:" I'm the star of the star, that's right, I'm talented! "His facial expressions, all in the eyes, will surely know what motivates Beni, exactly how he feels the comments, even if it is behind a quick sign. Great functioning in a fair movie."
