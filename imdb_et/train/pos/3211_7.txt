this movie is ok if you like pointless action, dirty action and a very small plot! The different effects are decent, given the film's "Event Horizon". Costumes are like nothing more than movies. No soldier is talking, so others will tell them what to do. I liked Russell better "tango and money" to "escape la / new york" and "executive decision". It must see this movie, which leaves the door open to no brainer action science fiction movie!
