I honestly think everyone should see this movie at least once. It really put things in perspective when I looked at it. Although this film was fictional, this film is something that could happen to your children. <br /> <br /> This shows how easily two children hide their anger at their school and plans to kill innocent students. This movie would not have worked in any other format. They pulled out the handheld camera perfectly. <br /> <br /> This reminds us of April 20, 1999 when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media format that followed it. Everyone wanted to see Rampart's video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fancy version of our dreams. We see the boy is behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it didn't work well on the market, and few people even know it. If it had one preview of one blocking campaign, everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was, zero day. <br /> <br /> I believe that this is the best movie adaptation of the school for the few who have really tried it. The shooting takes only one and a half hours of an hour and a half, because it mostly focuses on Cal and Andre and what they did until then. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, rent it and watch it. I guarantee that when you are finished you will be speechless.
