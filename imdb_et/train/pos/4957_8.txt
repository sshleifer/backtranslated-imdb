10 POINTS OR LESS THROUGH WRITER / DIRECTOR Brad Silberling wrote within two weeks in the shoe budget, but a little film made in Carson, CA, who feels the whole story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling managed to pair a pair of mates, Morgan Freeman, with a couple of big projects dealing with Vienna, resulting in a dialogue between people who can improve their lives. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - another part of comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been working for four years, exploring a place for a small "fillet" to get back the flow of things. . His "role" is to be the role of a market manager and he falls on the Carson market, where he faces, among other things, one Scarlet, a girl in the disputed 10 or less. Not only is Scarlet tired of his static job, he is also generally angry with his philanthropic spouse (Bobby Cannava), who is currently sleeping with the lazy Scarlet (Anne Dudek) and his poor ability to get a decent job elsewhere. Both couples after a couple of common problems and trips go on a "journey", which results in each character growing up in the second story of life and presence. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story, just said, but it works very well because of the offer between Freeman and Paz. This is one of the few films about interpersonal relationships where the message is vulnerable to change and exchange. It's worth a look, and it's a DVD that has highlighting, informative, and comic - fun to watch. Grady Harp
