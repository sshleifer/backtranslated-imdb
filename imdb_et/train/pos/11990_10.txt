In 1990, the Disney TV cartoon world was definitely the most important. Shows like Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney made another great comic and this comic brought Disney's afternoon. This comic is called TaleSpin. It is related to the old jungle book with the sign Baloo the Bear when it gets to work in aircraft. In the series he meets Kit Cloudkicker, former Air Pirate and a good cloud worker, a business event with Rebecca Cunningham and his hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has tons of punches that you may not understand as a child, but later on in life. It's a cleverly written series and it's nice to add it to your DVD collection. Parents, buy it for your kids rather let them watch all of these terrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
