As far as I know, the real man the main actor plays is seeing his performance and saying it is a great idea, I agree with him. This is a fantastic movie for a pretty talented boy / guy with a special body part helping him. Oscar and BAFTA winning and Golden Globe named Daniel Day-Lewis plays with Christy Browna's crebral man who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carries his family. However, he has a special left leg, he can write, paint and hold things with it. She learns to talk later in the movie, she likes her. Also starring Home Alone 2 is the Oscar victory, and Golden Globe named Brenda Fricker Mrs. Lady and BAFTA winner Ray McAnall as Mr. Brown. Jim Sheridan's best director, best writing, scenario based on material from the other media and the best picture, was named the best film for BAFTA, the best artist and the best custom scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 100 on The Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 in Great Britain, and he was number 15 in the world's biggest actor and the film was 28 of the 50 largest British from the movie. Outstanding!
