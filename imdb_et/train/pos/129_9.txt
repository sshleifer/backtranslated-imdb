With stunning cinematography and the absurdity of Kafkaesque, this film created a simple but exciting openness. The film plays a lot like a dream, and I think it may be the reason people hate it or love it. The characters are sketchy and the story itself is small and maybe a little pointless. But these are the shortcomings of the film, but conscious choices. The film does not seek to work in history, but rather to deconstruct war films from the 1940s. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult for me to say that there was a lot of real content for the film, but the film is such a kinematic wonder that I was completely wiped out. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever, and its style has wild imagination. I fully understand why people hate it, but I give it to 9/10.
