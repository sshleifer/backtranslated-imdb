Cypher is a movie that you should watch because it's not a Sci-Fi rainbow. The artistic approach has been painted with dark scenes and a sort of macros about what is happening. The close-up camera view is how the director's drawing is illusory. The film's sci-fi aspect is secondary to the film's schedule. The technology used in the film is not too impressive, but the director uses it well. The development of characters is deliberately low. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to dive into the world of espionage. Audiences must understand their mysterious character and this is a mystery that keeps the audience interesting for the rest.
