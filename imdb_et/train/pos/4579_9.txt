I think this movie was good. It's strange that now the twins of Olsen are 13 and they have boys and everything. I enjoyed them a lot when they were small children in the House. Anyway, the casting was good and the film was somewhat funny. I got confused between all switching points and their names. It's just a kind of older version.
