I really enjoyed the movie, but I didn't know that Little Richard had so many things in his life. First, I didn't know about Lucille. There is very little (barely) to mention that women are closely associated with little Richard. Even in her life, there has been no mention of women's participation in a romantic way. I do not know why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall, the film was great. I also didn't like Leon playing part of Little Richard, he's a good actor, but I feel that some of it should have gone to another actor. He didn't like visually at Little Richard. I was also fully aware of the violence that Little Richard had. He became a sexual drug addict. Nowadays, reference is made to counseling about sexual inclusion. He was a voyeur. I don't want to destroy a movie for someone who hasn't seen the movie, but there were several things in the movie that I don't think should be part of the final section.
