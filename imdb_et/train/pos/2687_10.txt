No other film has ever known me ... and I don't feel bad. Just as I don't want my money back or the time I was expecting to watch this movie (9 months), and I don't feel bad when I use it for two hours on a sunny summer day to see it ______. The reason I say "_____" is because, no matter how hard I get to imprison my brain, I don't seem to have got a word out of seven languages ​​that the movie was about to summarize. I don't know what's going on all the time and halfway through the movie I needed. No movie has done it for me before. I've never wanted a lot of cauliflower, milk and baguettes in my life. Thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * deletes throat * No words. No thoughts. I do not know. I really do not know. - Cait
