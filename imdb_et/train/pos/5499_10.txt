I didn't know what the facts were about this film. Remembering this situation, I accepted the information presented in the media: confusing about the suspicious personality: Mr Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I do not know if something like this has ever been done. I thought the main character was Mr.Chavez, but everyone who came up with the picture was important and, after all, it was the reality of the entelechy: the people, was overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartle and Donnacha OÂ´Briain. <br /> <br />
