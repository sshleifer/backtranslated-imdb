James Stewart celebrates the classic story of revenge associated with the fate of other Winchester Reef films. Stewart is, of course, excellent in adding a cold hard obsession to your usual modest cowboy. The story follows the fate of Winchester rifles and their owners after our hero has won and stolen by a man-stolen man. <br /> <br /> We will meet with a choice of gamblers, weapon fighters, Indian entrepreneurs and a bank rifle when we follow the rifle route through Indian battles, bankers, etc. Supporting cast is all confident when Dan Durya stands out as Waco Johnny Dean's flourishing army with an itchy trigger finger. Also in Triviana, mark Rock Hudson's early appearance as Indian leader. <br /> <br /> The final showdown is a classic tense rifle that fought long distances on and around the rocky outcrop. Throw in some old old western measures, fist fighting, shootouts and horse races that make the West Coast. 8/10
