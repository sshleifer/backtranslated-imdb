The letters sent by Corbin Bernsen to the four criminals with whom he has previously worked are a real intergenerational combination with Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ and Ruben Blades. They meet him in this shady city of Montana, and he doesn't explain why, because he's taken out of a state office in New York. <br /> <br /> Of all the criminal groups they collect, they all know Bernsen but don't know each other. Many of the comedies involved feel one with another. Like the oldest Gwynne, though he denies it, he takes the others off, but goes by. Especially when they think about what Bernsen meant. He is lucky enough to be picked up by a couple of bumblers Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck. He gets down to O'Neill and flees. <br /> <br /> After that, four criminals are trying to stop what Bernsen started, and Bernsen is going out of the police. In a complexly drawn scenario, it is interesting to see how both lines are intertwined. Hoyt Axton, as a local sheriff, looks at the astonishment of what is emerging in his city. <br /> <br /> Organized crime is a tremendously funny capric film played by a number of players who seem to be mostly on television or soon. . I can't say that somebody was hurting so well that they clicked together so well. Ironically, none of these people are comics by themselves, but they all have a light comic touch. Disorganized crime is one very funny capric film, a movie that would have been written by a well-known pessimist, Mr. Murphy.
