I was lucky enough to see "Oliver!" In 1968 on a big cinema screen in Boston when I was a young teenager. Later, in the summer of 1969, I was delighted to see that this film still plays in the famous cinema of London's Leicester, after winning the Academy Award for last year's best picture. <br /> <br /> "Oliver!" both on stage and on the screen reminded me that not all talents start from Broadway and end in Hollywood. The legendary story of Charles Dickens, a literary legacy of all English-speaking people, is admirably presented at London's Lionel Bart in London. He then received his charming music ball in New York and around the world. The adaptation of the film was made in England in the summer of 1967 and was then released in 1968. Sets and music images are desperate. Song "Who buys?" demanded hundreds of actors and the British film director really deserved the Oscar to smooth it all together. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but most often it is a respect for the fine finish of a British film studio, such as Shepperton. Good show! Other Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing films have given the world many treasures over the years.
