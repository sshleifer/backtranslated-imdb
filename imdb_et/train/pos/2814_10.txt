This is the best film ever made to deal with AIDS. This is a documentary about two men living and dying from the disease. The film is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny and incredibly mobile. Above all, it is an amazing true love story. Before you watch the movie, you will definitely have some tools ready - you need them. Extraordinary.
