I grew up with this all-time favorite movie. Special effects are incredible and awards to the era. I remember the dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It's just a great, timeless adventure. Music is Miklos Rosza, who is the best in cinema history. Sabu is a thief. Conrad Veidt is a great villain. I have an ongoing copy of the memory card for the next drive. Where's there! Rex Ingram wants his genii out of the bottle!
