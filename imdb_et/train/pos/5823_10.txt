Micro Phonies are the best stogs. In it, the trio masters are working in the studio. Finally, they look at Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre), who sings a voice in the spring. The voice is amazing. Curly in drags listens to Mrs Bixby (Symona Boniface). Fashion calls Curly Senior Cucarachat. Three stories arrive at a party where Curly is going to drag. They play in the spring and everything goes well until Moe destroys Curly's head. They use lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and disconnects them. Alice Van Doren tries to scream the boy and hides behind the curtain to help them out. Everything is fine as long as baritone doesn't know how Curly sings without a phonograph, Alice discovers behind the curtain. The three stories have turned out to be fraudulent, but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer. Stooge is put out of the room. Great.
