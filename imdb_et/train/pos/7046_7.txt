In War Inc. we see a logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war-related activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with the overseas countries of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater, you are already halfway home to fully understand Cusack's last piece. Cusack plays Brand Hauser, who finds himself in Turiquistan, organizing his show in a recently released country to gain access to his last target. Although she finds her interested in Marisa Tome's anti-agency reporter, followed by Hilary Duff's over-sexual pop star. We introduce Hauser's past, which contains a tragedy that has been haunted by him forever, and Marsha Dillon, a company assistant, who deals with his entire operation (and Joan Cusack has been playing fun). Although some moments are suitably played over the top, they are not always the moments you expect and small touches often surprise you. All leaders turn to strong performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but otherwise he does a great job and goes a long way to scatter his Disney picture. Tomei is funny but underestimated, while Cusack's almost all scenes are. To be fair, they are given good material. Writers turn enough scripts and visuals in a good script to keep you up to the predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me at a higher level when the story spins and changes it to the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your comedy wide and natural, here's probably not enough to make the whole movie interesting. On the other hand, if you like clever comedy and wide satire, that's for you.
