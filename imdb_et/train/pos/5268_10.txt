Barbarians may not be the best movie anyone has seen, but actually it's so funny ...... I can't say how I smiled when I first saw it. The director really wanted to make a serious adventure movie, but it was also a bad bad .... so bad it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen ...... so my advice is you should see it ..... and if you alredy did, then again it !!!!!!!
