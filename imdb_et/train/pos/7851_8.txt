The cameraman's vengeance is an unusual short not a topic (adultery) or because it is animated (Winsor McCay had introduced Little Nemo to the film by that time), but because it depicts mistakes to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz had originally wanted to film the real mistakes, but could not do them because they came from the hot lights, so he took the dead and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate the movements for his satisfaction. This short will do a good job of putting human qualities on small creatures such as riding motorcycles, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz also does Frogland (1922) and Mascot (1933), but his first significant work would be. If you are interested in this and other mentioned shorts, check your local library for DVD lending.
