Grand Canyon is a very strange city. This is a completely unique piece of town where the whole plot can not pass much. <br /> <br /> This is a central issue that seems to be a natural uncertainty that is present in every race, background, and station. But to declare that the subject of the film would be terribly underestimated. Similarly, making some of the genres of fine-tuning is meaningless. Finally, I can't even define my central message myself. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it works with the accuracy of such a laser; every aspect, a dialogue line and a background music bar that contributes to this widespread mood and powerful message that I'm pleasantly surprised and well thought out after each viewing. But it doesn't feel outraged at all. Sparkling wine with great pain and everything works.
