After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third look. This time, instead of Tudor or Elizabeth's time, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA Rowan Atkinson) lives during the French Revolution. Today's foolish but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) is Blackadder George, "Hugh Laurie", "faithful" butler. Throughout this third series, Blackadder has struggled with everything that he can do to become rich and powerful, with a wonderfully written sitcom. He is trying to lie to the master of a rebellious small town, trying to sell a book, trying to win a bet on Scarlet Pimperel, trying to be a man on the road and finally being a princess. This is a very good contribution to comedy. Including Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. It won BAFTA for the best comedy series and was the best design and best. Rowan Atkinson was number 50 among the largest British actors, he was the 24th comic comedian, and he was number 8 in the UK's favorite comedy, Edmund Blackadder was number 100 on the 100 biggest TVs. The world's largest comedy films and the Blackadder (all four lines) were British Best Sitcom Number 2. Outstanding!
