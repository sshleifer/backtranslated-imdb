No, not really, but it is really a very good film and unfortunately a forgotten pearl. Black and white fit the film. <br /> <br /> Straight form, guy was plague, and authorities have to watch everyone with whom he came before he died. <br /> <br /> Very well targeted and actress is great. Richard Widmark as a male leader is good but is completely overshadowed by Paul Douglas as police captain and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as rogue. Unfortunately, Palance continued to play with similar characters in a gangster or war movie.
