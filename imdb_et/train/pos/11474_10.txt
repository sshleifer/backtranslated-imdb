This movie is one for ages. First of all, I have to say after seeing it once, it became one of my favorite films of all time. Why? Easy; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has made real art. When 99.9% of the films these days are purely entertainment, Director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us a reality, gives us a learning tool to find out why it happened. The mainstream media spins and spins, but Ben Coccio sees shooting at school directly on the face, where they can go, if no other media has ever gone, the thoughts and heart of two young men who are going to kill their classmates. If it is definitely graphic and terrible, how would it be? Gloves come out, the lies of our media masters and the sugar cover are brushed aside and we are taken to the place where we can find the truth about things that have happened. Sometimes not only is the screw loose like everyone who likes to think, not, sometimes hate and isolation are deeper, more humane, we have shown that these guys are us and us. Society left them behind and the consequences are terrible and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your companion. The lesson we should all learn, thank you so much for making this movie Mr. Coccio, I hope with great expectation that you will continue your filmmaking career.
