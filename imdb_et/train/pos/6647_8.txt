My father, Gandhi, is like looking at a book, a chapter by chapter you read (with your eyes) and you can learn more about Harilal Gandhi and about Kasturba Gandhi. So little is known about both, and this film describes them uniquely. The title, however, misleads so much about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son as Haril and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya are full of their rights. <br /> <br /> Such films are like the leap years. Gandhi My Father is also an internal struggle that is sometimes harder than any freedom fight. <br /> <br /> See if you like high quality cinema.
