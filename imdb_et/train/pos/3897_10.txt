This video was my first contact with Eddie Izzard. One night we had several friends and for some reason or another they were entertaining HBO. Someone called "Eddie Izzard" was on top. I tried not to laugh too loudly at the first jokes. I didn't want to be "responsible" for enjoying the rest of the group that probably killed me. After keeping my laughter more than it was healthy, I let go - like others of us (we were not stoned, by the way, nor told about insurance and pensions ...). We had suffocated after that. The story lines, the plot, the odd but brilliant connections between the sketches are not just shine. I have since been dependent on every Eddie-Izzard comedy I get. His work is a thin genius. His comedy seems effortless. It looks like it is more than this hysterically funny friend who hung up on you and about it or ... It's cramping funny. He gives you the impression that the joke is between you ... and yourself, the only true sense of humor. If you are disappointed with this video, you have no sense of the penultimate humor - or humor as they say in the UK.
