I picked this movie based on plot summary and critique bids on the back of the box. I am not big in foreign films and did not know what to expect. I also don't care about subtitles. But I loved it completely! It's a simple, lovable quality that gives you a good life. I found myself repeatedly laughing. I recommend this picture to anyone, even those who scare foreign films with subtitles. It's worth the effort.
