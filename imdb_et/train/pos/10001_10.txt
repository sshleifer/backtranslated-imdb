Lesley Ann Warren's brilliant over-action. The best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and the love scenes in the clothes store are different. Facial corn is classic, as good as anything Blazing in the saddle. Taking lawyers is also great. Pepto Bolt's lawyer speaks after being accused of turncoat selling his boss and being dishonest. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, the favorite of the later Larry Sanders exhibition, is also a fantastic millionaire who wants to break the ghetto. His character is worse than usual. The scene of the hospital and the scene where the homeless invade the demolition site are classic at all times. Look for a foot scene and two big miners (one bleeding). This film improves every time I see it (which is quite common).
