It's just the most amazing movie you'll ever see. I thought it was another documentary, but it's really different. It doesn't try to teach you anything, it shows how life works. <br /> <br /> I am not talking about the quality of the pictures, because of course you know from other comments that this is unbalanced. <br /> <br /> Earth is funny, tense and sad. It may laugh at you, it may cry you. Sometimes they are both at the same time. This is the first film that made me cry, not because you have felt sorry for the animals, but because you understand how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with, but we don't understand it once. /> <br /> This movie should be compulsory in schools. This is the most wonderful movie you will ever see, so go and see it. Who knows, maybe this is the last time we see this planet like that ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I would appreciate it more easily if it were possible.
