Bugs Life is a great movie that is not only for kids but also for adults. The story is surrounded by ants colony and their struggle against evil Grasshopper who come back every year and steal their food (reflection of seven mirrors). There are some wonderful computer animations and the voices are also great. You like it !! 8 out of 10
