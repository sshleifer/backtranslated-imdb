Dan Katzir has created an excellent film that brings us to the skateboarder through a real romance set against the concerns surrounding modern Israel. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has ever been in love, the movie brings back insecurity, insecurity and heartache that love so bitter sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that was during the difficult times of Israel at that time is just a feeling of improvement. You are immediately in the position of Dan and you cannot move it deeply. <br /> <br /> You can't write such a drama and passion - contrast with Dan's desperate, caught relationship with Iris, and the reality of instability will keep you closely monitored. If you have a dream and have ever fallen in love, watch this movie.
