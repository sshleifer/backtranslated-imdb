Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese mafia wars are unlikely to be widespread at film festivals in the West. Why? Can your censors film your stomach, where police officers attack suspects of men and women so they can talk (and the victims enjoy it), or do old ladies see their eyes torn off their skull? These are just a few of the viewers of this ultraviolet police and gangsters story. It turns Clockwork Orange, which was banned in the UK for years, into a Disney comic. <br /> <br /> When you see this movie? YES This is a fantastic and important viewing for Asian cinema fans. These shocking moments are to illustrate what these characters are doing in the world. If you like it, make sure you try Dead or Alive, which is very similar (of course, limiting the end of mad at DOA). It is great for Japan that she has such talents as Miike, who are working with Takeshi Kitano at the same time. The best way to see this movie outside of Takashi Miike's retrospective film festival is on DVD. If I haven't tried you, try hunting for the version of Hong Kong on the web, because I'm sure it will be out of the country.
