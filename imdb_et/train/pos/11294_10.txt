This movie is right. As a former USF aviation cadet, I can tell you that this film has everything. Application process tedium. Waiting for the word. The pleasure of reception. Worry about it through the course. Long to look at your friends (maybe the best of them) to wash. The endless price of torment - the death of student air travel. Honor of Completion. Always flying, flying, flying. Many are called, but few are chosen. We paid for that we would have paid constantly.
