Of course, I have to give this movie out of 10 out of 10 because my uncle was the main scriptwriter who was once after the crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote scripts for over 50 years in Italy. He was a great story and someone suggested that he put his stories in writing. That's what Rodolfo Sonego did. If you look at your biography, you will see the number of films made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor who played his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city in 1968 to look at "A Australian Girl" and created a great movie about proxy brides after World War II. You see your humor in all your movies. I recently found a copy of this movie on DVD. LARGE
