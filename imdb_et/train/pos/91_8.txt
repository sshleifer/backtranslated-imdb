In general, it was a good movie with an ideal ending; the actor was prominent and the characters from their persons were not mistaken. This plot was especially loved, although you knew what was happening, but gave the whole movie a surprise element. At the same time, I think that reaching the end could have been a little longer (perhaps enlarged) - it seemed to me that it was a bit rushed; as if the writer tried to take off the lines before the rain fell. For example - What happened to the Tristan brother Hayden? We know he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one who set the whole thing?! Who knows! Maybe there is a sequel? Could it be? If it is .. I can't wait to see it.
