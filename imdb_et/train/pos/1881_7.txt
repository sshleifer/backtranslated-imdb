Like the drunken Millionaire Playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as a child trapped in childhood. As it turned out, Moore's role was so perfect that it also made her an actor. Soon, many disappointments (including the pale sequence of this movie) followed, but it does not diminish the charm or attractiveness of the image that is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, some of the film is strange, but it is so much joy that it's a tough film that needs to be resisted. It is a very big heart and gives Oscar winner John Gielgud a clever, dry fun, like Arthur's lie, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and has a wonderful rapport. Liza Minnell (with a blue collar for love) is a sassy with a little key and Moore is dirty but dirty and lively; he never shook Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this career list to take care of. *** from ****
