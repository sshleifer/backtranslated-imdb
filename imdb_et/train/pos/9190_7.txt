What a badly injured Tony has created in a coma, two things happen: Tony is leading the life of a salesman involved in a business deal, while his family and friends are hell, trying to cope with the loss of a great man. The sequences of dreams remain out of the old TWILIGHT ZONE episode, as Tony finds himself in the middle of Joe, who tries to deal with missing wallets and mixed identities during cross-country rides. His intonation as a blazer and khaki ride is more American and less than Noo Joisey's Italian drink. Nice touch. Amazingly long-haired, hippie-dippy AJ (who Paulie calls "Van Helsinki" at one point) is a beautiful scene with his comic old man. The best moment is when big boys try to talk about life without Tony, which immediately breaks down into a territorial dispute. Vito goes on a line about a new dead gene, which may have been in a cabinet that is interesting in terms of what we learn about Vito.
