I loved this movie! I'm biased, seeing I'm a big Disney fan, but I really enjoyed myself. The action begins at the beginning of the movie and goes on! It's a bit of a departure for Disney, they don't spend so much time on character development (my husband said it) and there are no musical numbers. This is a strictly adventure of action. I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, be they young or old.
