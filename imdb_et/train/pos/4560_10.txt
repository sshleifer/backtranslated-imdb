I've just returned from "My Left Foot" exhibition in our public library. What is an emotional experience - I feel it is weak and raised. <br /> <br /> This is a story of Christy Brown, an Irish writer and painter, based on the autobiography "My Left Foot". Christy was born with cerebral palsy, so the only part she had good control was her left leg. Doctors suggested to their parents that he had hopelessly slowed down, but his mother did not give up on her and somewhat like Annie Sullivan with Helen Keller, helping her to achieve a breakthrough in learning the alphabet and then reading, writing, and Coloring. <br /> <br /> This movie won Academy Award for Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor) and Best Actress Actress who played her mother; it also received the Oscar nomination for the best picture, best director and best-tailored scenario. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, although many movies may attract me, many of them often neglect fictional or unlikely realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> Not this movie - it was absolutely "on-the-spot" in depicting typical Irish parental roles and behaviors (see, for example, typical Irish families McGoldrick's "Ethnicity & Family Therapy") as well as Christy Brown's uneven emotional maturation - some immature personality reactions , which was further amplified by his father's intrusive features. <br /> <br /> The film presents a greater truth by changing certain sequences of its development (painting and writing) and condensation of several important people into one person, bearing in mind a unified, credible story that would not be burdened by small, distracting, less important realities. (For more details, see Christy Brown on Wikipedia.) The DVD version we had shown had some subtitles in English, which were a great help in understanding Christy's speech (and some Irish speech); the first release of the film may have been missing. (If you see this on the DVD, let this option.) <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest, plausible actions I've seen. Really great, outstanding, superb. <br /> <br /> "My Left Foot" carries more than any similarity to the newer "Diving Clock and Butterfly", where everyone represents the life of a real person. extremely difficult to overcome the imprisonment and isolation of a physical deficiency. <br /> <br /> And it works by resonating with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus", which begins with: "Out, covering me, // black like no pot, // thank every god . // for my incredible soul.
