This is a robbing British comedy movie and one that I could watch again without getting tired. Peter Ustinov has never played a bad role and this is no exception, especially with his dry spirit, but with a very clever general plan. Karl Malden has always been my admirer because he was "on the streets of San Francisco". I believe Maggie Smith is the real star of this movie, but it seems to be so intuitive in everything she is trying to do, but it's really turned on, especially at the end when she tells everyone she's invested so much money she's discovered washing their clothes. One thing, however, concerns me, does anyone please tell me why I can't buy it in DVD or VHS format in the UK, can anyone please help?
