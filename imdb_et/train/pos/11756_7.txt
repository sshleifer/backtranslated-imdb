The film wasn't good at the checkout. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a sneak preview. <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie where past players moved. <br /> <br /> Not the best movie ever shown but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Robin did a good job. <br /> <br /> Best movie line at the beginning, by Robin character Jack: "I was this SOB!" Cleaned up here to offend no one. <br /> <br /> It was a joy when he came to the DVD a couple of years ago in widescreen / mailbox format. <br /> <br /> I am not a football fan or a real sports fan. But this movie doesn't have to be like that.
