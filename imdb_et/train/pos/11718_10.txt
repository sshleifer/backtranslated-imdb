Those who love Elivra, as I did my late night movie hostess, love this movie - she's just cool - her car is great, and she's a bit Transylvanian Dolly Parton - she's both innocent and naive at times - and sexy time - plus, more than one of Mae West - <br /> <br /> The sets are well done and the comics are great, with Edie McClurg on her usual best plus Sally Kellerman when Patty is having fun. Every time I have to stuff something, I mean how Elvira potato chips strike - <br /> <br /> This movie is being reviewed over and over again - just for fun. Now I have to follow it, Elvira Haunted Hills, and see if it lives on it ----
