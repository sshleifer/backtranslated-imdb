This is a great stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is a more fun person I've seen for years. His routine is fun and makes a great conversation with others who saw it. I highly recommend it. The history of European history is a bit slow, but the endless jokes of the French language are pretty good, because you don't have to speak French (although this is still fun). Also, the parts associated with the transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not big, but for the first time funny. Leave them over if you can. It's not nearly worth it. But it is really funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see. "I was dead at that time!"
