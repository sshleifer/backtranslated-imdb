This is probably one of the worst films ever made. It's terrible. But that's so good! This is probably the best if you don't look at the plucking plot and something fantastic and fun because you're frustrated. However, if you want to see it so that you can see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair / bad English, then you are a true treat. The harder it is to think about a movie, the worse it will be if you don't have the competition to see the most plot holes / screw tongues, in which case you have time to entertain. I really would just like this movie for a boring or deadly Smap fan. And even then, the latter should be a little cautious, because Goro's Japanese fans were a little irritated about it, he thought he was selling himself. (He wasn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do it for him.
