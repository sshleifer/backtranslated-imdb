I saw this movie when I was a kid. It blew me away. It was before the television day, so a movie of this size could send the young child to orbit. It impressed me that I went to watch this movie for 12 days in a row. The special effects used at that time were far from their time. Sabu was a real pleasure, as was Rex Ingram as Genie. I found myself singing "I want to be a sailor" several months after leaving the movie. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidti, who was the same evil as you ever wanted. Jun Duprez was never more loving than he was in this picture. The color was outstanding. Give this movie AAA!
