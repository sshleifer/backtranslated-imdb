American boy Jesse took a train to Vienna to fly to the US. On the train he met Celine, a French girl. Although they met for the first time, they spoke like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse asked Celine to go to Vienna. He then created a romantic story. <br /> <br /> At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was listening to the CD music store. They looked at each other, although their eyes were not touched. After a thorough conversation they got into a relationship. Then I saw the most romantic scene they were pretending to call their friend. Their deep love for each other was fully expressed in words. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. If you really want it, it won't come as you wanted. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love won't last long. Spiritual harmony is most important for love. <br /> <br /> A great scenario and performance made the film a great success. <br /> <br /> One of the best novel movies. 9/10
