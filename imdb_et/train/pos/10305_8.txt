If you want a serious laugh, look at this movie and the things Bruce puts on his colleague. Deleted scenes are invaluable. I don't know why they didn't add them to the original movie. It cannot be because of the time, because the film is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who has been ignored for too long. Jim Carrey Needs Meds!
