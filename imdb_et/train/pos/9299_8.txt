Loopy, but terrible and terrifying mob Boss Vic (great result Richard Dreyfuss) released a mental hospital. Several Vic's criminals who contain the "Brass Balls" volatile donuts "Ben London (Gabriel Byrne's gloriously manic and invasive hammy image), the fragrant Jake Parker (the completely insidious Kyle MacLachlan) and the witch-rival" Wacky "Jacky Jackson Reynolds) Vic tries to get out. Meanwhile, the recyclable and confident blowmen find Mickey Holliday (Jeff Goldblum's low confidence) who finds himself in the middle of this deadly middle. Writer / director Larry Bishop brings extremely hip, peculiar and original peculiar sensitivity to his delicate dark and dead-curved black-and-white comedy about treachery, loyalty and ruthless ambitions. Bang-up cast is a day by day in a colorful grotesque gallery of criminals with a beautiful amoral and treacherous hoodlum: Ellen Barkin is a tough, weird minor, Rita Everly, Henry Silva as the right man of Vic, Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as a philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vici cute, perky mistress Grace, Billy Drago as a butterfly Wells and Christopher Jones brutish rub-out artist Nicholas Falco. The bishop uses his juicy second role as a lethal and laconic ace mass of Nick. The tiny bits are Billy Idol, a dark cutter, Michael J. Pollard, a malicious Red, Joey Bishop as a body Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a joyful driver and Richard Pryor Jimmy Gravediggerina. Byrne's delightful crazy duet about singer Paul Anka as "My Way" rates is a definite side-up. A tight and amusing climatic Mexican stand-off as well as funny funny bone with something hysterical. Frank Byers' sliding cinematography, the terribly nutty dialogue, the Earl Rose Jazz Cocktail Bar and the selection of the old-fashioned golden old artists will further enhance the fascinating character of this enormously entertaining entertainment.
