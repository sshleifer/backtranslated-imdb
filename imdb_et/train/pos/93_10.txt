My first child was born in the year when this program came out, and then I played a boys' record label every Christmas. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and only give it to my family and friends ... it always becomes their favorite Christmas card. Recently, I found several DVDs (made from a video tape from DVD-R) for sale on eBay. I bought an excellent copy and it was so big that the exhibition could be seen again after more than 25 years. There are some songs in the exhibition that were not in the album and some of the songs in the album were the studio versions of the same song. But both CDs and DVDs are the best Christmas entertainment in our library.
