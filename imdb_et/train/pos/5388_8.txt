I saw this movie yesterday in Turner and I couldn't see it until it ended, though I could guess what would happen. Farrell was great in his role and everyone else did a super job. Sometimes it seemed like stretching the boundaries, but loved it !! If you have the opportunity to see it, please do! I really cried a few scenes, but then I think if you are a mother you will. Loretta is beautiful and I was just amazed at the idea that they were moms in unintentional moms, it seemed before her time. I say IF NEEDED, and don't listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, shouted! I enjoyed it thoroughly!
