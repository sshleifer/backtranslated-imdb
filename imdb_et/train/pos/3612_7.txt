Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school senior who discovers that she has a powerful punch and starts amateur training at Brooklyn Gym. Santiago Douglas is a beautiful young man who is hardly older than he who is training there. They meet after class so they talk and feel against each other. There is no sex. Santiago has ordered to save it for his next contest. <br /> <br /> Both are participants in the "gender blind" sporting program that doesn't make a difference between men and women, mistaken attempt to equate sporting playgrounds <br /> <br /> Recently, a conservative radio commentator - and I swear that I don't do it - "Let's face it, the president is black." I'm here to make the same remarkable observation - "Men and women are different." Now, in 99 cases out of 100, it doesn't need to change anything in physical performance. One percent - trained athletes who have succeeded in fine-tuning - men generally have an advantage. With these narrow hips they can work faster. And they have greater muscle mass and torso upper strength. These differences in body make it possible for women to give birth and raise children, and for men to feed and kill them. This sexual bifurcation is due to a completely normal natural selection process. Without it, there may not be people at all. And the fact that boys and girls are the reason why they have men's events and women's events at the Olympics. I'm telling you as your anthropologist. It's ten cents, PayPal is preferred. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this gender blind program wrong. Like a talented boxer like Rodrigues, when he approaches the zenith of the game, he eventually loses the man. <br /> <br /> This is a complication in this movie. Rodrigues finally answers his boyfriend Douglas. Nor do they want to lose anger on the other hand, let alone the rights of the round table, but the pride of both is at stake and pride is both personal and gender. Douglas refuses to fight against a woman in a circle. And Rodriguez is offended by what he sees as his patronizing. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from the movie. I thought it would be Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" hanging up until I discovered it had appeared years ago. And I never heard of a director or speakers. Such vagueness generally leads to death on television and so on. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised when it was properly assembled. The complete absence of Bathos left me open. So did minimal use of poksklits - wrinkled ropes, blood, cut eyes, post-impact face, fat and sweaty spectator who cried "kill him!" nose, sweating spray from the head, heroic music that signals the winning long-awaited apotheosis. None of this here - well, almost no. The whole plot can be considered a formula. Tough child finds ring outlet, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling that you are left is that it is probably pretty much what these amateur competitions are. Different from TV and regular movies. For example, bells do not call, but dancing and attentive judge call "Stop!" And "Box!" Competitors wear main gear. The gym is inhabited by not crowded joyful spectators, but only by a handful of people with special interest. This is a pure film, despite the rather gloomy situation and the unhappy family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez can look quite thoughtlessly at what her muscular mass and her eyes glow under her lowered eyebrows, but if you use the idea that it is a girl who can kiss you if she so desires, and when you hear the feminine contours of your super segments, it is not bad. (The scene in which he fights his father on the floor is superfluous.) It was a little difficult to understand Douglas's barrier when Rodriguez climbs all over the bed. Director Karyn Kusama has chosen his talent carefully. <br /> <br /> Shows what you can do with some talent, imagination, and financial resources. There should be more such movies. Take one of these several billion dollar blockers who are full of dinosaurs or spacecraft and scarce generosity.
