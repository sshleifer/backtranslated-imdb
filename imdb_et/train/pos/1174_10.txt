Some people have said that since the 11th season, South Park has begun to set off its politically biting satire for low spoofs; but it may not be beyond the truth. <br /> <br /> Although this episode speaks of the Living Dead series, there are more. It's a satire how people treat homeless people. The characters say things like "They pretend to be like us" or "They want to be human." This episode is attacking the culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just successful. <br /> <br /> So yes, it is still satire and also a wonderful miracle. What more would you like?
