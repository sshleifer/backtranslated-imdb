This is not a movie that John Wayne knows about. He plays a diplomat, a man who gets things through words and persuasion, not physical activity. The film moves silently through a superficial story. <br /> <br /> For an open, patient, and thoughtful film, this film is a rich feature of interesting parts of history. <br /> <br /> There are two intertwined stories. The great story is from the inner, isolating Japan and excluded from expansive America when their interests conflict. The small, human, story is the initial hostility of an external barbarian (Wayne) and a civilized Geisha and does not like to turn to mutual respect and love. The story of man reflects the greater story of the two countries. <br /> <br /> The film is very well done and all participants play their role. The two main roles are filled perfectly. John Wayne is great as Townsend Harris, which hits exactly the right force and a mix of talks with Japan. Eiko Ando is also great as the title geisha, charming and delightful. His character and communication between John Wayne are particularly well illustrated. That would be exactly how the two persons (as they are shown on the film) would have acted. <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. It lacks all the pompos. and represents a realistic image of how events have occurred. Characters are real people, not self-aware "big" historical data. In addition, the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and finesse. Indeed, the traditional and traditionally powerful, isolating Japanese and rising, powerful people across the ocean are very well summarized in one exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that when landing in Japan, seafarers are caught by seafarers and that ships that are going can not even be put in the water. Baron replies that Japan just wants to be alone. Wayne's character is that Japan is at an increasingly important juncture in international maritime transport and that if things continue as before, the people will be considered not only as a brigade band that infects an important road. A very real summary of how these two countries looked right and saw you wrong. The resulting contradiction between the two opposing interests of independent nations reflects the entire history, the continuing theme that reflects the future and the future. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and the mid-nineteenth century imaging of Japan before the accelerated growth of industrialization in the later century. Visual treatment and enlightening understanding of ancient Japanese civilization. <br /> <br /> I recommend someone, or John Wayne fan, to watch this movie if you have the chance. Note that this is not a feature film. It is an interesting place and time in history and a slow-burning love story that (to their surprise) dominates the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this movie for your own benefits, without any excuse, let yourself down the story and enjoy it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie.
