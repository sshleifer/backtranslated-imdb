From this series, I was absolutely reminded of the moment Tom Long shot - the whole "bad boy" thing, it was just addictive. <br /> <br /> The story is caught up in what happens next - Joey gets the girl finally, after five years of imprisonment, and all this time thinking about her lost love, crossing the road again, finding her son. Although he is a violent bad guy, you still want him to find happiness. <br /> <br /> Truly enchanting two parters - please bring it to the video!
