Film is a real example of how superfluous society has become anxious and selfish. It has many signs and each symbol represents a different category. No sign is 100% good and moral, unlike the heroes of all typical Indian films, and no sign is 100% bad, but everything is just different. The film is a perfect blend of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time, I liked a film that has caused some social issues. I recommend that everyone watch the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers the Bollywood hip-shaking sides, but it is a story of how he becomes a criminal of the newspaper. But that's not all, it shows how he couldn't live there and when he helped to save innocent children, how brutally his voice was suppressed. Even he is fired from the job. Then he could not find a criminal reporter's job and must do it again. Not only is the film intertwined with her, but with a very large number of characters, all of which give the film different feelings. I would congratulate the Director on making such an excellent film. Please do not allow it.
