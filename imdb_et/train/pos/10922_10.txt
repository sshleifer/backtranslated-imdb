When I was very young, all kinds of kungfu films were shown on local TV on Saturdays. I saw many Kung Fu movies on weekends. I remember many of them. Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunk Monk, Rage of Master, Tattoe Dragon and ... Five Deadly Venoms. I remember the day clearly. I and my father had just gotten lunch at Burger King. See what movie this Saturday would be. We ran in the house and jumped on the couch, turned the kit on and slid it to 56. The usual introduction to many kung fu movie clips with Kung Fu on Saturday. Then it was the title of the movie. It said that the way to a deadly poison. Then the film started. I got a little bit of my burger amused by the pre-credit sequence. I loved this movie a minute he came. My favorite character was Toad Venom. The plot was difficult to follow at this age, but it wasn't attracted to me ... it was a fight. The struggles were so ... amazin g.I moaned every time the commercial came and soon 2 hours the best movie I've ever seen.
