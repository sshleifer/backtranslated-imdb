There are a couple of spoilers in this comment! <br /> <br /> Contrary to comments I just read about nativetex4u and some others, I really liked the movie and would like to see it as a weekend. <Br /> <br /> I am a fan of Judson Mills, but also a big fan of Chuck Norris, and although I admit that some action scenes may have stretched the line slightly, it fits the scene with another weekly series. At the moment there is an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Opening in fifteen minutes when Deke ran out of bad guys after their rocket blowing was very busy. I don't see how many "specialists" could not move to the target, but this action was definitely there and the hero Deke had to live. <br /> <br /> What a comment needs "getting a movie to fill a time slot after a feature film." This movie was not a CBS originally scheduled for January, and was filmed in May 2001, which was good 4 months before the US terrorist attacks. <br /> <br /> When the commentary turned his attention to the film instead of avoiding it, perhaps they would have understood the plot plot: Rashid, a character similar to Bin Laden, intended to lay down a nuclear facility in the United States. The President's man was called to find and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer should watch the movie before you try to comment on it. <br /> <br />
