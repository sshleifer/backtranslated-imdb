This show is fantastic. I thought the two episodes where Paul died were so sad; I actually cried. But other exhibitions were awesome; Kerry was my favorite sign because he was in the "dark side". I also thought that Bridget was funny because he was all penniless. I also thought that Kyle's playing man was really cute. I loved it when Kerry did all the sarcastic remarks. The man who played Rory was cute and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. The whole TV show is funny and I want them to show it on television. when they showed it on television, I watched it every time it was. The next time I see it again and again.
