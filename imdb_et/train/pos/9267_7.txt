Not a bad movie. Somehow I did for Iran to win the game played in the movie, although I don't know anything about football and I'm not a fan. The bus ended up fun. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the problem of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to go to men's gyms because their swearing is not suitable for women. Despite this law, some women are catching up, but many of them are stuck and detained. It's really amazing that every society still has such obsolete gender concepts. In an interview, Panahi says that his films are records of history and its injustice, and that one day we can watch these films and see how Iran once lived. One hopes that the future will come sooner rather than later.
