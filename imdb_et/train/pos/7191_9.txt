Reed Hadley will do better Don Diego when he makes a terrifying and brave Zorro, but it is near this place, because this series offers the best of any sort of bar, ever - and the best version of Yakima Canutt's famous stagecoach stunt. There are other good tricks and a lot of activities and lots of haircut hangers, but if for some other reason you need to watch this movie on the stagecoach stunt, look at it slowly. It is incredible, and despite the lower budget of this chapter, Yak turns to the right stunt when he made it much more marked on the movie "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart out: this is the real thing!
