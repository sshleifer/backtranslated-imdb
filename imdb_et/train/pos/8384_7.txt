I read somewhere (in a pretty panning review) that this is something of a live mecha anime, and I think they're on the right line. I was watching this movie for the first time at a very young age and I am dead to see it again, and when I finally did, all the memories came back. I don't think it should be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of an old old 80's almost a-TV movie (it's set against a rather dark future, though this point isn't much emphasized). What I most admired about this film was that dialogue did not sound general - no clich√©s, no predictable features - everything is just fun! Maybe it's not time for this little movie, but I can still admit it today. It's not perfect, but it's fun and not trying to be anything else than that. Let jokes and cartoon shops worry about the technical qualities - who cares? See it for yourself and make your decision. No one else thinks.
