It is an amazing film designed to capture the energy of the incredible flamenco dance, and the unique way in which filmmakers combine the story of stage production with the lives of those who are preparing for it. Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe experience. This is not a standard for Bizet Carmen. This is not an ordinary movie according to any standard. Every nuanced look, the shape of each leg, each piece of music is intertwined so you can't take your eyes off the screen. You don't have to love opera or flamenco (which I don't want) to get captured, defiled. Fine and direct; loud and still; One, if not the best, movies, because it's so small.
