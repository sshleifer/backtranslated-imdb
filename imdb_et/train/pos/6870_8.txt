From start to finish, I laughed really hard throughout the movie. It is amazing that "The Groove Tube" is probably the grandfather of all comedy skit movies, but the hardest. 73 minutes, strange, strange humor never ends! Just think about how all this useless smile can help you make life easier! This is the way to better than Comedy Central or any major show! Take advantage of all those soft, flat, romantic comedy movies! Better tell your office manager that you want the "Groove Tube" back to the big screen!
