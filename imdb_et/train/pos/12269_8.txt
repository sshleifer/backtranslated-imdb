Four macho untreated men and three sexy gals come to the far woodland to hunt the bear. The dirty group runs an astonishing Vietnamese veteran, Jesse (with an efficiently horrible imagination by Alberto Mejia Baron), who doesn't surprise anyone who crosses their terrain. Director / co-author Pedro Galindo III associates gripping events at a constant pace, creates a lot of nervous tension, and gives a fair amount of graphical prize (with nasty throat slicing and hand) blown shot speeds with a brutal killer as a fearsome splatter. Anyone capable of pouring will give definite performances, especially praiseworthy work by Pedro Fernandez, like nice, humane Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as hostile to Alejandra, Charly Valentino as a friendly Charly and Tono Mauri as antagonist jerk Mauricio. Better yet, both yummy blonde blonde Marisol Santacruz and cute brunette Adriana Vega supply delicious eye candy wearing skimpy bathing suits. Antonio de Anda's shiny, vibrant cinematography, the breathtaking sylvan landscape, the powerful, shaky, distracting Pedro Plascencia, well-developed characters, and a pleasantly tense 76-minute driving time further increase the overall sound quality of this bang. up to the horror / action hybrid winner.
