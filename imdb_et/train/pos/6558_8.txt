I do not agree with the previous comment on this movie. I think it was lovely and fun and had a good message for young girls like my daughter. You don't have to dress like a cheap whore. You can be smart and beautiful and stylish all at once. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was good for the target audience. All-in-all my wife, daughter (10) and I thought it was a good movie. I definitely recommend it. It has also encouraged her daughter to begin reading Nancy Drew's original mysteries. <br /> <br /> It was a difficulty that he started to sleep today because he wanted to read it right away. I don't think about the better result of this movie than the interest in this classic series.
