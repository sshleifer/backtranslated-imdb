Massive several chills off your back! I'm surprised that people don't like it! I saw it at 10 am and I was still tough! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! Shouting out loud, I'm 22 !!! I mean, OK, with a voice, not very good, probably even a b-movie-ish. But the real look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the very beginning, you will strike you again with relentless, forgiving, terrorizing scenes! So many clich√©s, but no one can surprise / scare! You know it's coming, it's coming, BOO! and you still jump out of the chair. Grasp the pillow and blanket, call your nearest friend and don't look at it at night! Hats for Japanese!
