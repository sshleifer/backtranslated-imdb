I didn't give this film a perfect score to be honest compared to the great classic like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaur". But this movie is so wonderful that it is a real shame that it is so bad for a general IMDb voter. But the IMDb voter tends to geeky and "Paulie" doesn't qualify for it. <br /> <br /> The only acting criticism I can assume is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not portray a perfect beating child. I'm sorry, but asking a 6-year-old Dustin Hoffman as Rainman to make the film impossible. <br /> <br /> After this little complaint, the film has the best of many films: a friend's tee trip, con-games, a hero for a friendly party party (party party?), Disney-style humor for young and old, etc. What's not to like? Tony Shaloub carries his role as comfortable jeans. It looks like it's normal for him. ("I am Russian ... I like long stories.) I don't like mangoes, but he almost wants me to go and buy. Watch the movie and that's worth it. <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin are doing the movie is very suitable for performances that are quite suitable for what we all know, and I have always found that Jay Mohr is a bit slick and his screen role fits well. that works well, put Parrot and Anti-Parrot together as a team and creates their own magic. <br /> <br /> If you try to find you and each child who is not offensive or boring, "Paulie" is the perfect candidate, that a happy moment to paint my "Paulie" review was during the high heat wave while driving and the air conditioner of the car died, half of the restaurants had died of cooling (like our hotel) and I said, "Let's look at the movie where the atmosphere works" So we did. that we were cooled down for 100 minutes, entertained and received heartfelt When I saw it recently in less VCR emotional circumstances, I realized how well this film was made. <br /> <br /> This is a sleeping film that you don't doubt.
