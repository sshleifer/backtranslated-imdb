RUNNING MAN with TOTAL RECALL is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, it's not 2001, but it's not meant to be. And here, the scripts aren't even equal to other Arnie movies like PREDATOR or TERMINATOR. But I argue that the IDEA behind this film is one of the coolest ever hit big screen. Showing a state-sponsored game where criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against all kinds of weapons-armed "heroic" stalkers (runners are not equipped) to satisfy the public's interest in sport and blood. Winner Runner Final Award: Freedom. Or the rules require. <br /> <br /> For such general deaths and exciting single-layer films, it's really a lot to say. Someone else has drawn attention to the culture / government commentary on this film, so I'm not going here. Suffice it to say that if you look beyond the seemingly foolish feeling of the movie, you enjoy it a lot (especially if you're a big SF fan with a lot of imagination). As I said, it doesn't try to be a serious art film, but it is surprisingly layered to capture the upstream of the 80s. The prerequisite is borrowed from Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), but it is quite different from its source material, especially at the end. (The book ends in nihilism rather than saying that this movie is not.) I liked both, but I like the movie better. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Think it's caused by steroids."
