In your video store, this pearl can be found. <br /> <br /> The human condition of LA today. There is no exaggerated drama, but a collapse of events that can happen in any individual's time. <br /> <br /> Helps you understand the joy and despair of city life. <br /> <br /> Direction and cutting are top-notch. Film and music follow a lot of mood and situation. And CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent casting and excellent performance. No one is in place or character. <br /> <br /> And this is not really as much of a downfall as you think. I gave it to 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you didn't see it, DO!
