Baghdad Thief is one of my ten most favorite films. It's exciting without gore, it's nicely filmed and the art direction is flawless. Casting couldn't be better. Rex Ingram made me believe. And Conrad Veight definitely confirms the evil manifestation of Jafarina. He put the bar very high. <br /> <br /> ..I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and never this tire. This movie is an adventure for all ages ... none too old to enjoy it. The Bahgadad Thief pushes my memories to a more innocent time ... I was ten years old when I first saw it, and the US was soon to be World War II. Conrad Easy was such a big actor that he was able to continue "evil" in a few years "Casablanca". And Korda joined, I believe with Justin and Dupree again "The Four Feathers" .... great movie making!
