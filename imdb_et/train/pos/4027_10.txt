A very good adaptation of the Amrita genre. Urmila and manoj bajpai have done their best. <br /> <br /> The film is naturally elegant and I felt it immediately. It seemed that Bollywood finally gave this glamor and some high quality artists were on the screen. <br /> <br /> Intelligent content, the movie was portrayed very much, what happened during the partition, showing the suffering of a particular family, and also showing that confidence in your life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part was that they didn't make it dramatic with lots of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
