What's not to like about this movie? Every year, you know that you get one or two dinner movies at Christmas and most of them are terrible. This movie is definitely a new new idea that was pulled out pretty well. A very funny rich young boy who pays the family to simulate him for true Christmas. What is money in such a way that you can't do fun with it. That was a helping situation. A regular family gets six numbers and a rich man can experience Christmas as he imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was very difficult to cope with and it was just a rebellion to see the family reluctantly follow his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.
