I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is limited. The characters of the company didn't really enjoy their "real" life, but they enjoyed what they were. The film did a good job of making this simple day a good memory. Good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful foreign and beautiful European city, but definitely a deeper discussion of these values. Many movies are like discussing life or love, or relationships or current definitions of life or some problems. Before Sunrise treated it nicely, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjusts his soul and keeps watching the movie. Before Sunrise did not try to bring in a specific idea with his head. It only encouraged you to think about some problems in everyday life and gave you some alternative options. This made the inter-character conversations interesting, not just typical imprisonment or flowing stupid ideas. You would still think about these issues for yourself and the curious story of the next line. After all, the end was not very important. You can get something out of it and feel good or positive after the movie. Movies should be enjoyable. It's a fun movie and worth it to watch it. I'm also traveling. The film somehow pointed to me and answered some of my questions.
