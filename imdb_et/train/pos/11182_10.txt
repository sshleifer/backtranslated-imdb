I'm a pretty big fan of most of Stephen King's books - it's one of the most frightening and memorable. <br /> <br /> I finished it again for about a decade and I still find myself both heartbreaking and frightening. <br /> <br /> The style in which Gage has a solid collision course with a monster truck is what stands out. And "No Fair", which little Miko Hughes was talking about near the end, is alert. <br /> <br />
