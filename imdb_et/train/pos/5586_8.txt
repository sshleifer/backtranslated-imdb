Eva (Hedy Lamarr) is just married to an older man and honeymoon, she realizes that her husband doesn't want her. His disappointment about the absence of marriage and love makes Eva his father at home on the farm, leaving his wife. One afternoon, the lake flees by the lake with his own horse and his young worker brings them back to Eva. They love each other and become lovers. Later, his wife leaves him and tries to get Eva back home. Eva refuses and happiness leads the trio to the same place, ending it tragically. I watched "Extase" for the first time and the first comment I have about the terrible quality of VHS released by Brazilian distributor Video Network in Brazil: the film only has 75 minutes and seems to have been used on different film reels. Some parts are completely damaged and other parts are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the pictures taken by the Brazilian viewer is the opportunity to find this rare VHS rental or sale. The film is a virtually silent film, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are poorly developed. But this film is also very brave, because the beautiful breasts of Hedy Lamar and the body of bare fats are exposed to current beauty standards. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric symbolization of flowers, symbolizing the relationship between Eva and her lover. It is very clear how the director steers Eva's needs and disadvantages. The unconvincing ending is also very unusual for the 1933 film. I liked this movie, but I hope one day it will be possible to see the 87-minute restored version. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "asextase" ("Ecstasy")
