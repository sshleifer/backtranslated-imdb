I got this movie about a month ago and I'm a fanatic fan of Drew Barrymore. I love the happy ending and this movie gives a great one with the Red Sox truths! It is related to a math teacher who takes some promising children on a math trip to a company where successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them some information. This will lead to Ben (teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it's not all easy when he admits he's a huge Red Sox fan. First things are fine, but then his baseball gets the life of Lindseys. Ultimately, that's all right and Drew's outrage took one shot! I got this for two women at Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like such movies, I suggest you see Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and the first 50 or even his new movie Hugh Grant called Music and Lyrics.
