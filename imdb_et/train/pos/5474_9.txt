On 10 July 2005, the National Art Gallery showed the original uncut version of this film, which has long been lost. It restores the vital scenes cut by the censors when it is released. The character of Cobbler, the moral good-natured individual in the original censored release of 1933, has been presented as a follower of philosopher Nietsze, and urges him to use men to reach the top of his path. Also, the original that I expect to be in the current VHS versions will be removed, the bright end and the end will end in the original form. A wonderful movie of seduction and power. Hopefully this movie will be re-released on DVD to evaluate its great features. Find it.
