I took out Freebird for outgoing movies. I bothered through the first third of the movie, wondering if the rest would be waste. Fortunately, it's really warmed up and I loved the movie quite a bit. In the second half of the movie, I was always smiling and smiling. Fortunately, although there were also CGI bits, they were neither superfluous nor widespread. <br /> <br /> However, I have to say that all of them have heavy European accents, so they must be warned if you have trouble understanding their voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie and I have to order myself for a copy of my collection.
