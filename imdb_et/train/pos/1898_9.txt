Who is the alcohol drummer, Keith Moon, was called Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who is usually a OVERVIEW, did a good job in this field and was able to turn Dudley Moore on the cheek every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John absolutely stole every scene. It was a very "different" movie that allowed the viewer to see another life. We often try to restart this movie again on satellites. God is resting with Dudley Moore; it was such an enjoyable movie. Lots of satire and thumbs down rich and snobby / prosperous. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is quite pleasant.
