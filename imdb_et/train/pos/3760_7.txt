It may not be for academic awards, and it's pretty funny, but it's just so much fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Loving, optimistic and fun, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I love great adventures, Bogus Journey is funny to me. Death is funny and Bill and Ted love even more. People love me for the love of this movie, but only a really terrible film reviewer says it's not even a little fun. If you like it, it's probably Wayne's world fan, a guy with my car and Dumb and Dumber. Recognize it, though foolish, they make you stack and change your box. So look at them just for beating and strangling!
