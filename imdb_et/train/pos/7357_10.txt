OK, where do I start? ... This movie changed my life! The plot was seamless. James Cahill has done it himself. At first I was disappointed after seeing it for the first time on a silver screen. However, it was before the DVD's many features explored !!!! Oh my god Jakes Cahill's movie commentary was almost as flawless as his actor. he talked about the industrial secrets used in the film, which you only get with experience. <br /> <br /> Other participants had impressed me so much. The scene where a security guard in a corridor talks to a girl reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) films. I'm sure to be with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment if there is no sequel. <br /> <br /> I am still blown away by looking at every martial arts skill that only matches the location of the library in the school ... and perhaps the boy is slowing down! All in all, it is a timeless classic and the best film coming out of Europe for years! where my Oscars at dawn were !!!!!!!!!!!
