I love this example, but I saw the first episode. After watching the first episode, I could see why people first turned off. The first episode of humor is not the best, and they are fighting for a series of proper launches. However, I like the light and humorous attitude of the exhibition. The characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable. As a first episode, it does not really represent a fairly good exhibition. The episode is not bad in any way, but as the display progresses, it gets better and better, so look for more episodes before you decide on the quality of the show.
