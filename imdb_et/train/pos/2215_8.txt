I have bought "Party of All Saints" and this is not really a terrible movie, but many things could have been better. It had a lot of historical value played by very talented actors / actors, and it is not a daily event that actors can play such a role and be somewhat plausible. There were some parts that were a bit mediocre and confusing, but I wouldn't say the whole movie was terrible. If you have thought about it, capturing and doing something out of the 19th century New Orleans is quite difficult and much harder for those who mark these parts strongly. But the only big problem I had with the film was that most of the actors who played free people were mostly light skinned Africans, not very versatile who poured on others who weren't lightly skinned; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exist. Whilst casting might have chosen a wider range of colors, despite the many creoles, there is color awareness. In some ways, it may have been white, white-colored actors, could have been more thoughtful. The participants did a great job, the script could have been better written, and generally I found the performances very credible.
