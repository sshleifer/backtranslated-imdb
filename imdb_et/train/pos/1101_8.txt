While prices have risen a lot and some details have become dated, every homeowner who has won homeownership problems should fool around this movie. I know I did. <br /> <br /> Mr. New York Advertising Manager Blandings decides to bring his family to the suburbs of Connecticut and build a nice house for himself. He goes to another fun jam, from mortgage to lawsuits to construction problems, as construction costs and schedule increase out of control. I thought the more fun scenes were where Blandings hires a contractor to dig. They dig hundreds of feet but never find water. But just a short distance, a few days later, in the basement of the flood that leads home. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy provide incredible productions like Harried Blandings, a couple of amazing problems they never saw and Melvyn Douglas is even better than Blanding's lawyer and family doctor. <br /> <br /> The only warning is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Ms. Blandings is depicted as a bit naive, who doesn't know how many additional problems she is causing, and there is a black maid (horrors!). So don't look at this movie through the 2003 social lens and enjoy it even more. <br /> <br />
