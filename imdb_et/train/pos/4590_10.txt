Perhaps the film itself is not one of the best Jackie Chan films, but I think everyone agrees with me that shopping mall fighting was one of the best fighting scenes. There were also some memorable tricks that were so impressive that the film's action was classic. This film influenced many other films and I think that today the filmmakers should learn from this film (as they could do the scrambling scene, with modern technologies they could improve). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie didn't win. Althou I think they could fight the film more.
