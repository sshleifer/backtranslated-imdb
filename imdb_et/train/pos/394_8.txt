This is an incredible return to film director Tsui Hark. This is one of the few films that deserves to come to Steven Chow Shaolin Soccer. From the time when the film started, there was an astronizing background on every side, with a great style. If you are a science fictionist or a "geek" of Chinese martial arts, you will love too many 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. There's a great result for Ekin Cheung, who plays Sky King. He is with Louis Koo (red), whom I had a very flexible, flexible "wing" that was capable of incoming attacks. The struggle of these actors was very sensitive. Not only is this activity great, it is somewhat complicated. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of story / topic or simply "steer them randomly" and even describe "Poo legend". But the viewer cannot rely on Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga cartoons to understand this movie. Others who are famed for "Wu Xia" movies are better. Properly. there may be one weakness that could be foreseen. The struggle that was given to the enemy in the most recent struggle can be dramatic and devastiingly done.
