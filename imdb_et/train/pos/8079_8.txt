Not many reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT CHECK OTHER! It was a great movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can actually put together a really good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay gave another great example of acting like bhomics, which was a bit unexpected but a great look. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there is not much leap around the release. <br /> <br /> Or film / other awards nominations given how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> Better than Khake I thought and I thought Khakkee was a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty long movie, but it's definitely worth it and it looks a long time to watch it. <br /> <br /> Don't wait for RKS's next movie and the next AB, Akshay movie, which they always look good together, for example. waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika has also worked very well in the film and should do well if he continues in the same way in the future.
