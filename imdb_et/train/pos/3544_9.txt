Boys and dolls must be one of my favorite music. It's a lot of fun to watch a movie and nothing else. it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals - musicals did not entertain but preach. Nowadays, we have Rent and Chicago, which are great musicals and good movies, but they do not provide us with any kind of entertainment with no string. The only thing that disturbed me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can't sing! It was very annoying to hear him sing and talk when I couldn't understand him. If it weren't for Marlon, I would have given it 10 stars. Boys and dolls offer old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. See that you have a good time!
