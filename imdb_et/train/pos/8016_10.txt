Don't think these movies are just another children's film - the whole family can enjoy it. This is a strange mix of the film because it seems to be inside the movie, but at least it's at the end (unlike today's movies). This will give you all the elements of the movie (a good plot, good signs) - Well, it marks the Muppette, a list of lesser celebrities * that make the movies amazing. What is surprising is that it can be a roller-coaster of emotions, some sad, some hearts, some funny and some serious - all this makes a pleasant family film that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * Movie celebrities are actually the most important stars of the day, but there is only one real star in the movie, and no one dares out of Miss Piggy. !!!!
