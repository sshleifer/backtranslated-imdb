An absolutely enjoyable singing and dance film starring Frank Sinatra and Gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film won the Oscar George E. Stoll score and wore the best pictures, the best actor Kelly and Best Cinematography, as well as the best son named "I Fall in Love Too" by Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a lovely story about Kelly, helping her ball in Sinatra's girlfriend and falling in love with her. Lovely Grayson (New Orleans Toast) dazzled us with a song, and Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the pianist-conductor Jos√© Iturb, had a lot of great songs and dance routines. <br /> <br /> Classic Hollywood music from time to time.
