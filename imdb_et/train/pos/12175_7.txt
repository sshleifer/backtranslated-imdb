What would you say about a man who was getting married and had his bachelor's evening with some of his closest friends at the Hawaiian boy bar? All the smooth sailing until he takes his "bachelor hat" out. What would you say to her when she talks to one of the recommended dancers and then sleeps with her? What would you say if this exact girl was a cousin of her finances? New low, right? Well, Paul Coleman, played by Jason Lee, drives this nasty cloudiness and new low experience. I have to say that this is one of his good leadership roles. But I believe his role in Vanilla Sky worked better. <br /> <br /> His financial name, Karen, is played by up and down actor Selma Blair, while Karen's character Becky is played by cute and talented Julia Stiles. Returning from where we left, Paul now has to deal with one of the emerging problems for the other. He gets sick, has to deal with certain people and he has to play his hidden games hidden, or every member of the family can get P.O'e, including one of his relatives who have not had "bowel movement" "for 14 days. * Vomit * All this leads to the long-awaited weddings with one fun scene before it all hates what Paul and his brother had to go through. <br /> </p> Well, sometimes it seems like the story goes somewhere and you get tired of it and from there scenes, but it's a mixed movie. And if you're a fan of Canada and CTV Brett Butt, Corner Gas, you would feel that Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays the fun of the series, plays a small role. This is the second feather in Lee's hat (quite a blank hat so far). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
