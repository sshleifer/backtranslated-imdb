FREDDY has been frighteningly funny in this six-part Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> It has been 2 years, actually 11, because this movie will be in 2001. And FREDDY has killed every last child's Elmil Street, except one, John Doe (Jacobb from Part 5, even the movie gives a hint of who he is), where he uses Elm Street to go for more children. Not only does FREDDY get its desires, but it also gets her daughter back to Elm Street. If she finds out what's going on, she and the other kids decide to kill FREDDY forever. We also see some FREDDY nervous backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has long been infected with a nightmare series. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. He tried to point out what FREDDY did with his wisecrackes ... COMDEY and make the series more fun than scary So this movie is really hesitant to talk. It's not a series of twists, part 2 keeps it still. <br /> <br />
