I don't think I could have enjoyed it more, even though certain things were upset. I'm not saying what if you haven't seen it ... you need to find out for yourself. Anyway, what movie may be lacking with Robert Downey Jr. puppy dog? All-in-all, the plot was developed enough. Nothing seemed too hasty because such films tend to be. The characters were similar and there were many fun scenes. The general idea is that the story is very well connected, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory ... according to the opinion. But as I said before, it's not hard to film Robert Downey Jr.
