Hopefully, the result has now become a result of its stunning and stunning, which convinces you to watch all the movies and create "8" right now, the real score of the movie. <br /> <br /> mentioned before Chris Rock is king! Previous to see this movie, I wasn't over it, but now I beat Chris Rock's website asking him to take his defense. This movie is really funny, if you don't find this movie funny, you really need treatment and humor that targets all areas of society, including race (predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, up comedy. the list goes on. <br /> <br /> But I was a little disappointed. It was that he didn't know that going to this movie was actually another "Heaven Can Wait" rebuild, which was a pretty good film made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly started to get used to the plot to be clearly similar to the older film I was watching on TV a few weeks ago. Whether this film is, in my opinion, a better version, two of them just because it covers different areas and the fact that Chris Rock is more fun than Warren Beatty any other day of any day of any week ... get picture. <br /> <br /> Well on the real plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not break the experience! Don't read the plot! Just go and watch the movie, because so far IMDb has had two reviews that have robbed it, look at it because it is the most fun thing you would have seen for a long time and see it because it's a cinema experience it won't leave you worship cinema ticket prices. Go see it because it's a good movie!
