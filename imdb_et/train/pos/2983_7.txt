BASEketball is really a funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh at his head again, in a really silly, but many times smart, comedy. <br /> <br /> Two South Park creators, who are the main actors in this movie, are playing very good, surprisingly good, but this is the first time I see them as an actor. The film often reminded me of South Park - one of my fav shows. <br /> <br /> This is a really good and funny movie so don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
