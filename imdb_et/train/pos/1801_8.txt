I saw this movie when it first appeared in 1989. I enjoyed it then, and I still do. But what I understand now is that for a G-rated movie, it's pretty "mature", especially the term "dying and going to heaven". Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work great together and the Reynolds song contest is suitable for spam dogs. There are some good songs ranging from Let's Make Music Together to Emotional ("Home to My Heart"). I found the plot good, though it goes out with one or two tangents. The film's last scene with Charli and Anne-Marie is one of the most sad things I've ever seen in animation. A movie worth experiencing.
