I went to see my mother Fever Pitch and I can say we both loved it. It was not a typical romantic comedy where someone was tortured and blah blah blah ... You didn't expect the first kiss of the climate or they finally came together. It was more real because you saw them in relationships, not the whole movie about them. People could actually associate with the film because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was really funny and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best result. All in all ... I would definitely recommend it!
