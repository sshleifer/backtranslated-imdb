He loved it, but still there are nightmares in front of the hotel manager. The film was well presented by selecting actors who played their role in reality. Many scenes captured the imagination and created a nail. The progress of the situations was wisely written, making me believe that the story was led by one way to find a new twist on what I thought was obvious. Too bad there must be a commercial. I have told many friends that they will look at further exhibitions and I will, of course, look back. I enjoyed the film landscape and felt that it would be added to plots and intrigue. Hot discussions between a man and a woman (or should I say they fight?) Were very realistic. The original situation is general, but fortunately the story is not escalation. I want to thank everyone who participated in this great entertainment film. Thanks! Waiting for the next movie --- when? Whidbey
