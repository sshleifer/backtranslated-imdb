I have to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute. It was all "sex" content that most of Ivan Reitman's comedies are just something lil extra, CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this awkrawrd, but credible chemistry that seems to surpass every scene. Both seem to create this strange, complex and interesting relationship with the strong "sexual" tensions that you laugh until you know your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting pains seem to play each other completely and even the relatively small role of Wanda Sykes keeps you laughing. Although these comedies are not for everyone, but I have to say that I went with a person who usually doesn't enjoy these movies and he laughed like crazy. This movie is definitely not for everyone. especially younger kids because some moments are too small ... well tells adults younger viewers. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at this movie, the harsh things I found were a bit weak for the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * 5 *)
