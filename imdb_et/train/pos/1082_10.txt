Mr. Blandings builds your dream house can be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie that no one has ever done! If you love bringing a child, a story of Philadelpia, a thin man, I was a bride of a man war, or it's a wonderful life - check out movies with spirit, taste and random language. Post-World War II life is simply and idyllically depicted. <br /> <br /> Grant is in the absolute top corner of his form playing a city mouse that reaches the country's tenant. Loy is divine as his NOW-pre-woman. The number of supported characters is comparable to the one you can't and the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art direction and editing is a parameter. <br /> <br /> The film will never leave a lower rent without the hopes of later money.
