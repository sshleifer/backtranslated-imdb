The peaceful runner Robert Sterling has lost half of his warfare with his ruthless neighbors, ie, until the infamous exiled Robert Preston appears out of the blue, for a level playing field. Soon he will go too far, giving Sterling an ever-increasing feeling of restlessness, especially when his son begins to idolize magicians. <br /> <br /> Sundowners is a fast paced, harsh and surprisingly tough little Preston with great performance. Here he arrives at the evil version of Shane, that is, until the realization of the shepherd's actual nature and the relationship of the birds. Most movie guides and video clips break the surprise! <br /> <br /> Rounding casting is a debut by Chill Wills, Jack Elam, and John Drew Barrymore, who became more famous than his actor.
