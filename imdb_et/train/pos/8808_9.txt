First of all, I have to give it to the people who got this thing together. 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a film that dares to be controversial takes a lot of guts. This is a shame, although it is not surprising that the film is banned in the US. <br /> <br /> In saying this, I think the film is great in a few moments of weakness. The film begins with the Iranian segment, which is somewhat reminiscent of Majid Majid's work (absolutely beautiful "heavenly children" and "paradise color"). Like these two films, the clip that happened to the innocent eyes of the Afghan refugee class in Iran shows. Absolutely beautiful clip. The same goes for Sean Penni's clip, which is also great. But as some clips are big, others are totally cruel. Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu makes a Mexican clip and just like his intestinal "Amores perros" does it as brutally as possible. Most clip is a black screen with multiple sounds in the background. These sounds are from the journalists and their shock as the other plane runs, those who called home from the burning towers and left messages to their families, those who were angry .... and he connects this tower with jumping people. . A very tough clip to watch and not forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips may be very difficult for Americans because some clips can be interpreted as not the only ones to suffer. Especially Egyptian and British clips, which speak not only about this, but also turn tables and tell you how much suffering the United States has caused to other people. <br /> <br /> I also pay special attention to the clips of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although this may seem awful, it is not really). <br /> <br /> But not all clips are big and I mention the special attention of the clip from Israel, which I find extremely weak. Although the idea was good (the reporter is in a terrorist attack on Tel Aviv, but his story collides because of what happened in New York, what many of us who live in the war might be involved) is terrible. The clip just comes as an entertainment reporter who is trying to get the air at any cost, a man who says he is a witness and hopes he can go to the TV, and the soldiers and paramedics scream "because". The clip does not capture the drama of such a situation. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see it, it should be if you are not conservative, in which case you are d better off when you can offend. But if you are not, you might want to learn how many of us outside the US lived through 9/11.
