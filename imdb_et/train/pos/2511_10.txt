I was looking for this movie in a typical fan obsession. I just wanted to check it out. I didn't expect much. After all, musician, actor and scriptwriter? It is not possible to live as many talents in one person. Right ?? <br /> <br /> Wrong! Obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! The story line and characters do not disappear with the usual mortgage effects of Hollywood special effects. The story strikes your emotions and pulls you along. As the credit is rolled out, you suddenly realize that you are glued to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it seems the actor is upstairs. However, I believe that this is done with comedy intent and character. Otherwise, I would not have expected a level of action. <br /> <br /> It's worth more than once. I'm laughing hysterically or jumping unexpectedly for something I missed or forgotten for the first time or twice. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie completely. Feel free to go in with your doubts, but I'm sure he'll find the place on the shelf.
