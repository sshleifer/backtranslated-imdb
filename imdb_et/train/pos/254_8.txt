I'm sure not many people outside Australia have ever heard of Ned Kelly's legend. I've ever seen a documentary about a man, but that's the only time I saw or heard something about him. And I think this may be the biggest problem that this film has to face. Nobody knows anything about it and probably not many people care about it. <br /> <br /> The film talks about Ned Kelly's life. The Irish immigrant has lived in Victoria throughout his life, but the authorities are never very welcome. The police always accuse him of everything they think and harass their family. When Kelly is tired of how she is doing, she forms a gang with her brother and two other men. They start bank robbery and even dig the whole city for three days. All this violence leads to a police man and three police officers to kill. Finally, they take over the pub in Glenrowan, where they have parties with all the visitors, waiting for the police full train to track the part of the track they tore up. But the train can stop in time because someone warns them and what follows is a struggle between life and death between the police and the four armed forces ... <br /> <br /> It is very hard to say if all the shows in the movie are true or wrong. I think nobody really knows, because there are always two camps, each of which tells the truth: one camp says he was a hero, some Robin Hood, others say he's a normal criminal, murderer and thief. I really couldn't tell you which one is right, maybe both are, but what I tell you is that the facts in both the film and the documentary were about the same. <br /> <br /> The film was a beautiful addition to the documentary I ever saw, and I really enjoyed the performances of all the actors. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush are all actors who are quite well-known, but even less well-known actors in this production show that they all know what good action should be. I really enjoyed this movie and I'll give it 7.5 / 10
