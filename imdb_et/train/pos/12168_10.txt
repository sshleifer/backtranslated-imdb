"Guy Thing" may not be classic, but it's sure it's a good, funny comedy. At the center of the plot is Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after the commemoration of Bachelor's Day and Becky (Julia Stiles), who is lying in his bed naked. Before she can figure out what happened, she pulls Becky out of her apartment because her groom Karen (Selma Blair) has come. After you could imagine, there will be chaos. <br /> <br /> Almost every "A Guy Thing" scene will laugh. Funniest moments come when Paul depicts what can happen when he says to Karen. Selma Blair is a truly talented comedian and the worst thing about this film is that she is getting too little. Although it turns out to be more fun than Stiles' character, which is not really interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Guy Thing" is not classic, but it's not bad, 7/10.
