Every child who is old enough to sit in front of the screen is absolutely fascinated by beautifully drawn pictures and wonderful music in this heartbreaking and humorous Reim fairy tale. They sing "Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo" before they can even formulate the full sentence and continue singing until their death. It is a classic for all children, especially those who are heart young.
