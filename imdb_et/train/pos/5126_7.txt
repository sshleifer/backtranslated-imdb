Urban Cowboy is played by John Travolta, one of the strongest alpha men ever depicted on the big screen. He is a decent and young boy who leaves his parents' farm and strikes a big city in Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to work for him in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, which began with a boom and Texas was definitely a growing place in the US. <br /> <br /> Travolta is doing a good job, so we can take care of the audience because of their character who is coming down. sexist pig. She meets and marries Debra Winger with the same background, but she has some ideas that women should not be the shadows of these men. And if he wins him on Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, it's him for him. He is a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he just gets Travolta's goat out and moves to Winger. Travolta, in turn, receives a rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, who slides in Gilley. <br /> <br /> In spite of the characters, Urban Cowboy was really one of the most gigantic commercials in the world. Gilley's is no longer a Pasadena community in the suburbs of the Texas community, but the memories are still alive. The best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of songs from the land / west. I'm not sure if some songs were written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason I can think about why Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this movie. I especially liked Johnny Lee's love for being specifically written for this movie, it's a shame that it wasn't nominated for the best song. She does not lose femininity, but she stands for Travolta and does it in style. And this review is dedicated to an unknown woman who is one of the first Bull Riders' first women.
