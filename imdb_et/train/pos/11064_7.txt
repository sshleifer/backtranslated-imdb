"I'll take you there" speaks of a woebegone who loses his wife to another and finds an improbable ally on a dark date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mostly a tongue-in-cheek situation comedy featuring Rogers and Sheedy with little emphasis on romance. Some journey games burn with many amusements, and some enjoyable moments are moving forward, staying fresh and worth watching for indie lovers.
