It's better than the average quiet movie and it's still worth it if you are a silent fan. However, if you are not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest that you try some other movies before you watch it. The reason for this is that the plot seems pretty old-fashioned and unbelievable. However, it is still a good movie and my interests have been preserved. <br /> <br /> A nice lady unfortunately struggled with the wrong man and ran to marry her. The film begins five years later when she realized she was a really cruel thief. Nevertheless, he tries to do it and not to live, how good life was before this jerk came into his life. At the same time, the rent has to be paid and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. He becomes a personal tailor for a rich lady whose husband tries to do business. Unfortunately, a lady who tried to put a potential customer on a dinner party cannot do it and the dressmaker is paid well to be a man's date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is surprised with her! What to do now - given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her! Well, look at the movie yourself to see how it's all solved. I didn't like how they dealt with their husband because it seemed terribly predictable and clich√©. However, when he was away from the road, I admire how the film does not give up the minor figures, and continued with some open ends. <br /> <br /> All in all a very good movie to see, but certainly not great.
