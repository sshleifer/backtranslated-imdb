Oh, the sixties. There were interesting movies. I was then more of a movie moving. I like to rent and relax in my home now, not in the theater. I also saw this short film "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been looking for this movie for years. It was truly inspiring. Surprisingly, I finally got more information from the site. Thank you ........ I'm surprised that this short film was the opening of a Disney picture. I didn't remember the Disney movie either. I didn't even remember that it was a movie that opened Disney. I really want them to show it on television sometime. I don't know if Disey has the rights to this movie? Is it available on DVD? It is mandatory for all generations !!!
