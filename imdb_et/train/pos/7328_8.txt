I liked this movie a lot. I rented it while waiting for something not too bad to spend in the evening. It turned out to be a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were fun and managed to be in a movie that was not just for fools, but for some meanings and moral values. It drives both hopes. Leaders are all good, but especially the one who celebrates, also wrote and wrote I never saw any of these actors, but they were nice and took care of what happens at the end of what says a lot. The script is clever and includes a refreshing feeling. I don't think you see this disappointment.
