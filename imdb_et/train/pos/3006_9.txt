While 9 may seem an unusually high score for such a lightweight film, it is best compared to the detective films of the centuries and hundreds of seventies and forties, and compares favorably to Powell's later "Thin Men's Movies. Now it doesn't mean the film is similar to Thin Man movies, because KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but a traditional mystery-detective film. Now you think that making Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic (something that is found in virtually all series of detective films) would be harmful, but I didn't lose them at all, because it was such an exceptional, well-written film - having a really interesting case and evenly great items for everyone. <br /> <br /> The film begins at a dog show and is called KENNEL's murder case, although this Philo Vance movie actually spends little time in the show and the dogs are not an essential part of the film acne and a thoroughly hated person is left in a completely enclosed space - the idea is repeated in many other detective films (such as CRIME DOCTOR STRANGEST CASE). But how it all explains seems quite plausible and fits very well - keeping my interests in mind. I would definitely want other detective films of the day to be both intelligently written plots and extraordinary. This is definitely the possessor.
