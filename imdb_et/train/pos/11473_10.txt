Zero Day is a movie some people have seen and what a shame it is. <br /> <br /> When I saw an end where two main characters descend into space and ruthlessly kill people, suicide and it made me grab. I shook it, it's so strong this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It's too unbelievable not to get the perfect ten. It is sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film. It's not a budget that makes the movie good, it's a feeling that the creators make it good, which makes it good. <br /> <br /> This leaves you with a lasting impression that you just can't get out. It makes you realize the real horror of shooting - especially if you knew this person and this film makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it. I'm fourteen, and I feel this movie is too amazing to put it in words. Looks like you're looking at something that really happened.
