I sit through movies like "Tiempo de valientes" and want to talk about cinema lessons. The admiration that this film caused me is beyond my own explanation because I look at the scenes of the film and look for ideas of filmmaking and innovation in my thoughts that may come from something bigger than Damian Sipron's mind. br /> <br /> Looking at the environment, so uncompromising, so simple, I mean; this man is a genius. No wonder he probably created the best television show Argentina had ever shown, and then the first element full of elements that some contemporary directors have not yet achieved. "El fondo del mar" is the name and it awoke (a few years ago) my enthusiasm for our daily cinema. <br /> <br /> Starting a journey from people's everyday lives, Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero never is "El Bonaerense"; Life of the Federal Police Board. Trapero's film was a trip to the human mind and experience, not to the places he saw. Yes, there was detailed training and a lot of crime situations, but Szifron "there", his more detective story, like the ones we know and love, with secrets and exciting music. But his writings contain a lot of humanity, and he shows us his research in the eyes of his main characters, Alfredo Díaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many caliber actors in the film, but these two actors are the ones who can't get the movie. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who has just discovered that his wife is deceiving him; and must work on the case. <br /> <br /> Another is a psychiatrist who is being treated for detective treatment. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions, but the sheriff uses his pastime and suggests he joins Díaz in his routines: "It's nothing, the usual thing; but it is bigger than it and opens a part of the doctor he didn't know." /> <br /> The relationship between two drivers cannot be explained if it is not observed, because it is such a complexity that shows how talented some men like Szifron are trying to sign today in our history. points, under high pressure, says Díaz to Silverstein, "How do we continue our treatment?" And Silverstein replies, "No, I'm not your doctor. your friend ": we are laughing because we can't help it. <br /> <br /> And we can't help laugh when Díaz covers the car on the street and doesn't matter to him or if he breaks all red lights on the street or in his police patrol smokes a pot and Silverstein can't believe it (but then smokes as he is twisted), or when Silverstein tries to be friendly with Díaz's predators, the Magic Peret is what we get there. Locas de amor "but impresses with all his choice. On the other hand, Luis Luque has come to the next, which is a great actor that reminds us of a great actor. <br /> <br /> That's why I have a passion, and as I said , I can write for hours, but unfortunately this is not the way it works, and I have to be precise and concise. Although I have to watch and study many old films, I can confirm that "Tiempo de valientes" is a comedy that Argentina has had been waiting and ever received?
