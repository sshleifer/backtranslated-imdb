Here are 21 comments because I add this list and have hardly any criticism. The reason for this is that this movie is terrible entertainment and it has a little bit of it in it. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps a little frightening for younger children, but my 15-year-old son thought it was a fantastic competition, humor and even a beautiful music score in every respect. <br /> <br /> I buy DVDs only when I know they are being monitored regularly and now that it's finally available in the UK, I'll definitely add it to my collection.
