GBS wrote the customization of his own Nobel Prize winner screen, but did not live to show it (he was in 1938 winning an Oscar for his excellent adaptation of his 1914 PYGMALION game). When Otto Preminger installed (produced and managed) this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he noted that British writer Graham Greene made an adjustment and was a sure choice. <br /> <br /> Taking a cue from Shaw according to his scenario, Greene uses the Epilogue material to create a frame device that combines two game functions (one early and one late John's story) into a single and most satisfying whole. If there is a change in tone on the stage with a cached break, it works just as well to return to King Charles Baloise's sleeping chamber (where man Joan throws on the throne of events that led to his current situation), and more material about Shaw's Epilogue - John Gielgudi Warwicki (in English the introduction of the "king maker"). <br /> <br /> Most languages ​​are solid GBS and performers from Shauvia (such as Felix) to Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews 'de Stogumber' to relatively newcomers (the film founded Jean Seberg's career) is first-rate. It may be some, to share only the badges of Richard Widmark's many films, to see that he plays a weak and somewhat foolish Dauphin, but the presentation - a strange top figure - is professional, even if it is undoubtedly inaccurate. The opening credit symbolism and the director's choice to use the black and white visual vocabulary all serve Shawit and the story well. Go wait for quality entertainment and you won't be disappointed.
