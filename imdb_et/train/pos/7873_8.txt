Page 3 is definitely a very attractive and enchanting eye opener that very cleverly reveals the hypocritical lifestyle of the Mumbai elites. Counterfeit kisses to plastered smiles do not leave a stone unexplored by the shocking life of rich and famous people. Rear, rumors, corruption and scandal lurk in every dark corner of the glitz and glam world. Humankind and generosity are analogous to the oasis in the desert of the world where the dominant mentality is social darwinism. Everyone constantly wants more money, more fame, and a higher reputation, forcing them to do the most disgraceful things that are the signing of movie agreements at the funeral until the child is tortured. In this metropolis, where there is such a big difference between social classes, everything is possible. In the eyes of the audience, both classes look ugly. It monitors the smoking atmosphere and the spiritual madness that society is living. Bollywood, business worlds, politicians, and the underworld are intertwined in a completely confused mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice journey, as is the peppy Kuan Main Doob Yong. Amazing movie with great character development!
