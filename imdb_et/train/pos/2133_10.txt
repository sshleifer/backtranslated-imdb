I have lost hope of seeing how many times I have seen this movie - I probably know the whole dialogue upside down - but I've pulled it over and over again. <br /> <br /> In Hungary, young Jimmy Stewart has been awarded the "Kralik" Bachelor's Degree who will become Margaret Sullavan's innocent "Klara" admirer. Kralik becomes a secret to Klara's pencil and, at work, Klara trusts the content of her (Kralik) letters in Kralik. It's clear that Kralik is in front of Klara - but she can't find out her feelings when she's competing with a "pen-friend". Confused? Well you wont be - this story is a sweet, almost sugar-like end - but we all know it's the end we all want. <br /> <br /> Other signs worth mentioning are Frank Morgan, who plays his usual role, this time as the shop owner "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", Kralik Trustee. Joseph Schildkraut as a feminine arrogant "Vadas" - so well that you can't help him but hate right from the start. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy, who manages to live with us all in a super-confident shop at "Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recent "You've Got Us", starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me, is not as good as the original - although I suspect younger audiences <br /> <br /> The movie is turned on in your area during Christmas, so I suggest you pour a nice glass of wine, put on the fire and have a Kleenex box at hand.
