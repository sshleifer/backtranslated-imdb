I thought it was a great movie. It concerns the fiber of every person. Love in the film is very intense. I thought it was still Will's best result. Great leadership. I liked editing. The music was great. Use good rebound. This is a movie everyone should look at. I hope people get something wonderful about it. Generally a great movie. I think Hollywood should do more with movies. Even animated films can have a caring story. I like the fact that Will was very fine in his actions. He had a goal and a commitment that is rarely seen. I would recommend looking at it alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I found the world stopped and my only focus was on film. The rest of the world was paused for a moment. It was a nice feeling for all this chaos in this world. And this generation for me was nice to see something (someone) who cares more than other people.
