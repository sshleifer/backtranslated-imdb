I looked at the recently published Universal Pre-Code set at MURDER AT THE VANITIES and was surprised how much I enjoyed the end of the vehicle. Most of the other comments are stories, in the mystery of musical murder, but I wanted to add a few more comments. The attitude of Brison and Carlisle is relatively happier compared to most of the small players, and no one seems to have the right voice for what they sing (Carlisle is an educated opera singer, Brisson is a bit puzzled by some of his high levels and low notes). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well with each other, with an excellent timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are vanities girls, but don't forget the amazing jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the "Ebony Rhapsody" issue. Gail Patrick makes one of his early performances, sounds like Eve Arden; Patrick would become CEO of Perry Mason's TV series. Then Jessie Ralph is a dressmaker - you can see her in David COPPERFIELD (aunt Peggoty) and BANK DICK. Music is very good - Brisson introduces two different scenes to standard "cocktails for two"; "Sweet Marihuana" with barely hidden peyote girls in the background (blood dripping on one of the white skin of the china was wonderfully cool); "Ebony Rhapsody", with duke Ellington's orchestra and beautiful dancers, both black and white, mixing it. And I believe this is one of the earliest musicals that do not leave any imagination in the costumes of this mix.
