I think this is probably the most fun movie I've ever seen. The Robert Harling script is almost perfect, just look at "quotes"; Another to think about, just rent a DVD because it's a delivery that really changes the lines of the song. <br /> <br /> Sally Field is a comic strip, excellence, as you have never seen elsewhere, and Kevin Kline is effortlessly fun. Robert Downey, Jr. is usually brilliant and with a very small role is Kathy Najimy's rebellion, which is encouraged by the consumer. I was never a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's nice when one * real * person surrounded by a number of comic artists "The Sun also tunes" - what's under you is Hemingway running over her grave. Do it, or he laughs really hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
