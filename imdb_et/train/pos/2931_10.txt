Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the most funny thing I've ever seen in my life. When I first saw it about two years ago, I was sewing in a week. By now I have seen it 17 more times and still laugh my ass every time. For those who don't know, Eddie Murphy was a great collective farm before he was a Hollywood superstar. Unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987 and is slowly moving in the middle, this genius has no dull bullet. If you are not a person who is unable to swear, I would not recommend it because you probably hear some form every 5-10 seconds. I gave it to 10 out of 10 because it shows their greatest comic genius.
