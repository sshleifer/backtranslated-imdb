The "hate of the mines" is undoubtedly one of the best films that has come out of Michigan in recent years. Not to say that this is a brilliant movie in any way, but it is definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> "Hate" crowns the varieties of Eric Seaver (directed by director Kallio), a formerly grown child. and he will listen to his evil. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is visually very nice. The shots are creative and the lighting is suitably moody and interesting to watch. In fact, this film has an element that brings value to production, unlike other recent publications by Michigan, such as "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies." Fine dolly shots and a stylized picture composition show you the good use of the $ 350,000 budget for this movie. . Basically things happen easily. Eric Seaver doesn't change at all. Basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people start to notice. The film is just moving happily and with little development. The end has also ended very suddenly. <br /> <br /> But because it's a horror movie, when do we care about the plot? We just want to see people die and "hate" definitely. When the body is installed, people in the theater started to delight "Kill him! Kill everything!" When people scream back on the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is where "hatred" succeeds. This is fun. And finally, it's all that is really important.
