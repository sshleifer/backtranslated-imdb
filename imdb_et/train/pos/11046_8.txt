Maléfique is a very interesting film. It is the holy melt of triumphs and failures. The central concept is great, the three weird ones with strange personalities are united by the fourth (who is associated with the audience) and they try to escape from their cells using the magic book they find on the cell walls. <br /> The atmosphere is well woven, reminding me that I read Edmond Dantes prison stay in Château d'If (before getting to the Monte Cristo County). The director feels that the characters are related to the cell, especially the character we want to identify (Carrère - white collar, whose crime is not specified, but it is inclined to be fraudulent). Once, Carrère leaves cells when he is practicing the cell, and the cell door is closed; we never leave a cell, claustrophobia is uninterrupted. There are also no prison images outside the cell and the view through the bars is the longing sunset over the general prison wall. So while the film seems to be very modern, it has a very old world imprisonment. <br /> <br /> Characters are interesting. We have a Marcus, a violent transsexual pre-op, who plays a violent mother with Pelaquette (Daisy in French) who has a severely slowed young man. Pâquerette loves to eat everything she is beautiful, and unfortunately it contained her sister, so her current situation (I like this comment on internalization, very primitive). Lasalle has retreated, a conquered elderly man who killed his wife brutally. <br /> <br /> The central message of the movie is that your desires will destroy you and there will be a ritual. I think it will bother me the most, seeing people ritually destroying themselves. It has a real life cycle. Just a simple soundtrack supports it well, a gong dull ring is added every step deeper. I hear the gong now every time I do something suicidal. <br /> <br /> I think one of the plot's problems is that the ends of the characters don't really consistently reinforce the message, especially with Carrère, but the concept of the book seems to change throughout the film, not in the sense of successive revelation. I also think that some of the pictures we see are a bit amateurish, more design than filling, like the famous "vaginal eye" and Lasalle sodomy for me, completely hollow images. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director of the movie seems to be hastily over it, and some things don't seem logical, for example, we have been clumsy about the different things about Carrère's child. It does not change the fact that what we have here is that a rare bird, a "pure" horror movie. There is no comedy dross or genre of mixing, like the Cube (1997 / Natali), an obvious film to compare it with, it's a complete immersion experience where you feel like you are in the cells with signs. The last comment I make about this "pure" experience is, in my opinion, something that others have mentioned, so it is quite unanimous. <br /> <br /> My personal note is my favorite part of the movie when Lamanen talks about her past as a librarian. He describes very clearly the scene in which he goes to work one day and sits in his usual place in the middle of the room, where all the books are arranged around him. Books seem to never talk about their knowledge. It forces Lasal to go crazy. This is a problem associated with obsession with understanding and knowledge. That's something I felt. <br /> <br /> One last comment is that two quite well received comments on the board have interrupted the names of the characters. To convince yourself that Lasalle is an older librarian, just click on Philippe Laudenbach's page and see that he was born in 1936.
