Most people (36) gave this film 10 and those who are not too critical or can expect something else. It's one of my favorite films from the 80's, it grows on you and it has everything. I got it on the DVD and 20 years later it is still not disappointing with many activities, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to it big cars, automatic runners and many things that blow and have fun, your seating experience! You even have the main theme of singing or whistling the day after that. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your spouse / gf and you will enjoy it a lot. The prerequisite is a book hero like Doc. Life, truly existing and helping people to fight evil so that they can write a story, is almost right here for life. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also the director, producer and writer of many films. In this movie Jake Speed ​​(character) is an Indiana Jones adventurer type, she usually uses her head to get out of sticky situations, but sometimes breaks brute firearms (yay! And thin fool too!). Keep an eye out for one of your "James Bond" high-tech equipment, the ultimate warrior's SUV in the sky. <br /> <br /> The heroine is a very beautiful young man's love interest in the early Jim Carey vampire. "Once bitten" and here she is a little older and still dropping even compared to her teenage blonde sister. Bad guys are "real bad" men and you are the worst hostility where you love to hate. The end is just perfect and can be independent or invite a sequel, unfortunately never done - but you can just imagine what will happen next! <br /> <br /> You just have to watch this movie because it attracts and amuses you and it is worth the ticket price.
