This movie offers us an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many busy people to do something. We, as people of African descent, owe it to ourselves that we would change this cycle of "speaking and not acting" and we begin to understand change to talk and act less. This is a powerful statement about the division of our people into small issues and our shortcomings to recognize the bigger picture and the need to unite to make a difference ... Despite the fact that all viewers refer to the black community, they can learn something from the message that this film is trying to portray.
