This is a great movie for female bodybuilder and female women! I think Sue Price did an excellent job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and turned out to be a great winner. It has a very striking appearance and iron power to stand in a powerful fog (Nemesis 2). Although this is not a very valuable film and Sue Price's play has not been the best in my life, the film itself was a fantastic, invaluable gem for fans of the builder's work! Well, some parts of Nemesese 2 have copied other famous sci-fi movies, such as the Terminator or Predator, but that's not the case. The thing is that Puyn was a very talented bodybuilder in this movie who put all his energy and body talent to show us the best he can do. I really enjoyed this movie and watched the same enthusiasm with Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). Sorry it has not yet shown DVDs :-(
