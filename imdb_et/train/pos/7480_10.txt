This movie is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. He hits the audience with the imagination of David Aames. His character may be somehow related to all of us. The story is very smart and keeps the audience around the film. I've never really watched Cruise movies before, but after seeing it, it shows me my true talent. My favorite movie in the end is where it all comes to a great conclusion and it explains the truth. If you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely try. This is one of those films that, after you have seen it, you have to see it until the end or it keeps you thinking and you regret it. My opinion is that you should just buy it and take the risk I did, and it became one of my favorite films. That's A * 10/10 I promise if you look at it, it will stick with you and you will like it forever.
