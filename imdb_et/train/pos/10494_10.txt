Great view of a mature woman who loses everything (even a pruner has a mortgage). How he participates in this special "business", innocence and true love between the people of a small town is completely mixed to give us a fresh, light and funny comedy. I couldn't laugh at the very funny scene of two old women in a pharmacy. <br /> <br /> I love European films and movies like my opinion grow stronger. The film I also recommend closed with my eyes is the same genre, Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Grace's salvation, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as I did. You like it.
