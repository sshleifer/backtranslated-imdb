Ira Levini Deathtrap is one of those mysterious films in the Sleut tradition that would be very easy to ruin if the plot of the film was actually explored. That's why I say briefly that it is a game, a man who is a famous mystery playwright, another man who is a promising writer, a playwright's husband who is much younger and more sexy than a role, and one German psychologist for driving. The film's stranger, the stranger, Sidney Snow, is very good when the film creates tension. Dialogue is fast, fresh and witty. Michael Caine stands out in such roles. Christopher Reeve is fit to use and indeed grows on you, the more you see him in action. Irene Worth stands out as a funny psyche. How about Dyan Cannon? Love how Lumet wrapped up in these real little pants in his back pack and carried a backpack, but he has been terribly unsuccessful in this role - the role that should have been given to the older actor and certainly less appealing. But why blame the obvious attempt to leave bribe bribes? Deathtrap is funny, experienced, witty and stylish. The mystery has some prominent mistakes that somewhat reduce, and I was not completely satisfied with it, but watching Cain and Reeve in the direction of Lumet along with Levin's elevated verbiag was enough to keep my interest and keep the whole length of the film.
