This is an old-fashioned, wonderfully fun children's film that is certainly the most attractive novice witch. Unlike many modern stories that seem to be in dark witchcraft, it's just a charming, light-hearted and charming story of hocus pocus. <br /> <br /> The story is already in 1940 in an English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul Rollins, are evacuated by World War II air strikes. They are mistakenly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying for correspondence to become an apprentice. The Eglantine and children's trio use the magic bed button to travel to London with a flying bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the deceptive leader of Miss Price's Coronation School of Correspondence. Miss Price employs a spell to bring alive objects to life. At the same time, they must also deal with the shady name Bookman and his companion, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is naturally admirable as an eccentric witch on training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr Browne, the director of the lost school of witchcraft, who has now become a street caravan. This actor used to be Mary Poppins, a child cast in the early childhood. In fact, this movie is a story that resembles past Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. Perhaps this movie does not have such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it also has some tempting little songs. Some have been critical, but the film has excellent special effects. All in all, the story is a charming family life. It is a pity that today's children are too complicated for this lovely and fascinating story, which should appeal to all of our children.
