Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturb's "Anchors Aweigh", directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two navy boys leaving Hollywood. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and come home to meet aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for her. He wants to listen to Jose Iturb. They are trying to help, but there is mixing. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic music with great Kelly and Sinatra dancing and singing. Kelly is dancing with Jerry in a peaceful order. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings. None of my favorite voices, but he does it well. Iturb's piano work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra can show its versatility and why girls swam over her, with their big blue eyes and the boy's face. For Kelly, this was a big break for MGM. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie, very fast.
