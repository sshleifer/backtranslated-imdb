Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and I love it so much that I've remembered most of the script (especially the memory of the storage device when Jerry Lee breaks the wind) and even with my script I'd still like to watch it for Jerry Lee, The German Shepherd is hysterical and has really been tested to see who is the smartest. The label is also true. Not to mention acting is great, though Christine Tucci sounds different (see the movie in CSI if you don't know what I mean). It is too bad that this film contained only one problem that Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with, it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks Zeus and Welles had on their sleeves.
