It's a very dark and intriguing horror thriller based on the idea of ​​religious murders. Nature focuses on the man who lives in Texas, USA, who is suddenly killing to smile with his two young sons after God has instructed him to redeem the world of bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton, who heads this film, plays a spoiled Father, known as the killer of God, while Matthew McConaughey plays his best performance until the oldest son of Fenton Makeup. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides he can no longer use his deadly childhood load alone, and uses the setbacks to tell the story of the FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> I can't think of many movies that literally keep viewers hooked up from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop viewing, you won't get it because of the movie's exclusive rights. <br /> <br /> The directors have filmed this film very well and will help to determine the plot through good landscapes. It is a big deal in this film, but in the case of shortcomings, some parts are very powerful and can disturb people. <br /> <br /> Although the concept of this movie is very dark, children can help to convey the idea through brilliant action. It's really a vertebrate movie and it's guaranteed to stay at the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror, disturbing and powerful movies or someone who wants to see something else. <br /> <br /> 8/10
