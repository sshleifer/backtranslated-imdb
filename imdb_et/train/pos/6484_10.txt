I remember watching it in the 1970s - I recently borrowed a few episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With nearly a 30-year break, I've come to another conclusion. Most of the principals interviewed in this series - some in the middle of strength, such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (head of the German Navy) Anthony Eden (UK) - have long gone, but their first hand thinks. Generals, Russian civilians, survivors of the concentration camp, generals and admirals are all here. <br /> <br /> I remember Lord Mountbatten's interview (killed in the 1970s) <br /> <br /> This is really a pearl and I believe that this series was produced by Queen Elizabeth for this job. - Well deserved. <br /> <br /> If you see them in a few library episodes, I want to buy this set. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" I've reviewed, but I've been discovered as a fine wine bottle, it's somewhat appreciated for a while ...
