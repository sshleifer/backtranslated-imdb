Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love all these 80s genre movies, because you no longer see such a movie! I want to ask everyone else who says this movie is just a burst or a fun imitation that mimics it? I've never seen another such movie, well, not horror anyway. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's about a popular group in school who wants everyone to live in hell, so they decided to choose Nerdy's boy named Marty. It will become fatal if it really suffers from one of its small bowels. <br /> <br /> So, 10 years later, a group of friends who broke Marty started a high school reunion. But ... they're the only ones who can get them! So they go back to the old school and they shoot them one by one ....... Yes, you probably know what will happen! <br /> <br /> The only part that deceived me was the end. It could have been left behind or better thought. <br /> <br /> I think you should try and try not to be critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
