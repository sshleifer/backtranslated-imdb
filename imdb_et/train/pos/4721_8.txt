A sad story about the B-17 pilot. Brady is shot into the occupied territory. Local pastors extended her kindness and protection for her life. I had never heard of this movie and it took me two hours. After the end of the movie, I'm glad I took the time. This is a whole story that explained Brady's face at the beginning of the movie.
