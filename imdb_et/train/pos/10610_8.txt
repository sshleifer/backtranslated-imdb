A natural young man with a good past (Henry Thomas) comes to the abandoned baby girl in the woods and falls in love with her immediately. The city's parents generally support him in keeping the child alive, although the local hero (Cara Seymour) thinks little about the new family. A fixed little girl on a long walk and embarrassing travelers (David Strathairn) have parallel stories that are fatal. This is Ozark's charming way of life, just like "Where Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". All three of these were hit over these beautiful hills and simply included the life of a living, but not simple, American nation. This relatively safe viewing of the family is a minimum of strong language and short but sharp violence.
