I've seen Blob several times and is one of the best low budget alien invasion films from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The strange meteor land that is just next to the small town and the older man goes to study it. The strange marmalade substance then attributes one of its own hands and the young couple who saw the meteorites arrive on time and bring it to the local doctor where the old man absorbs the mass completely. The doctor and his sister have the following victims and the mass is increasing. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe in the young couple and do not blame them for doing all this. Finally, they believe them when the mass that is now enormous rises to the cinema of the city and everyone is running into the streets screaming. He then fixes the young couple and another canteen inside. Blob is stopped by spraying on the fire extinguisher load and it freezes, which is its weakness. It is then transported by air to frozen Arctic waste and disposed of there. But it's only frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This movie is typical for your period: teenagers and a small town. Blobil is initially a good rock and roll style theme song and the film is rich in atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Fast, Beware! In 1972, Blob followed in 1988 with a remake, but it is the best of Blob's films. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) is cast, and this is a movie that drew him and Aneta Corsaut is playing his girlfriend. I don't know any other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob is needed for all sci-fi fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
