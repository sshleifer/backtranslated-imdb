Most Stoogephiles find this to be the best Stooges short bar, and they are right. Curly is a drag that is dressed as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are respectively "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto". The beautiful operative voice of Christine McIntyre is full - she was actually a trained opera singer - and that's great. The great Gino Corrado is funny as a pompous Italian singer who is being terrorized by the terrorists in the society of Stooges. Some really funny gags, good direction and very tight editing make this Stooges a fruitful output. What's even more amazing is that Curly had serious health problems at that time and several short periods of time he did during this time you see that he is probably ill; his timing is far away, he speaks very slowly and stagnantly, and has difficulty moving around. Fortunately, her health was on the rise and shows her health. The classic Stooge comedy, even enjoyed by non-Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend who couldn't hold Stooges, but even she laughed at it). Black-black.
