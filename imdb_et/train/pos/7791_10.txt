One more movie you hear about friends (... or read about IMDb). There are not many lies in this. I saw almost everything that is happening here with a young girl who fled from Tennessee to a dead home town in Florida, with all her earthly things in an old beaten car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, makes some wrong start, but learns from them. I found myself wondering why he didn't want a little more on Mike's shoulder, but ... he has his reasons as it turns out. <br /> <br /> Just a fine movie. I think the only thing I don't like is the title.
