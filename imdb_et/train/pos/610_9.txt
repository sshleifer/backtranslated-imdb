Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy movie with a predictable ending and a medium performance, this is definitely not the case. When I saw the movie, I knew it was one of my favorite films. And I was right. Stardust is more of a fairy tale than an adventure movie. It has a magical "aura" movie from start to finish. The story is well written and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like any story, it has morality. Therefore, in our hearts, we know that the evil brothers do not take the throne, but the innocent boy who can overcome all the obstacles and difficulties he faces during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine, not Victoria, the only girl who is low and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to give Claire Danes extra credit. He literally looks like this movie. In her eyes, it has a shine that is perfectly suited to her character. In addition, he has Coxil chemistry that makes the film's romance even more remarkable. The rest are well-known actors and actors, which, of course, make Stardust an interesting and "high-class" movie. was very disappointed that the film no longer received prizes. I have to give at least 9/10 letters for this.
