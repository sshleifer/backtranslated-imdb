I took my 10-year-old daughter, Nancy Drew, at the end of the week and found myself in great entertainment. First of all, it was clean and I mean my standards. Most children's movies today are full of crude humor and fun jokes to highlight the pre-servant crowd. But Nancy Drew is smarter than that, and humor is subtle and wise. Unlike Brady Bunch's film, where anachronistic characters are jeered and ridiculous, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. This is a great moment when girls who know LA style dressed in Paris Hilton streetwalker are pushed back by the boutique owner, while Nancy, in her puppy cylinders and a homemade Butterick pattern dress, embraces. This film blur us with the lighting we need - this healthy girl with so many Hollywood movies. Nancy stays with her and her values ​​all the time. <br /> <br /> Mystery is occasionally tense enough to be interested. There were several pausing moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my hand but had no free events. It is all based on tension and mood and is fun. Supporting cast is good, especially for Marshall Bell as a horrible caregiver. Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis are some great suitcases and many moments that make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves better ratings than some have done. Not only was I delighted that I was not left with another computer film, where the animals talking and shattering the gas all over, but I was also very entertaining. If I were there without a child, I would have enjoyed the movie. This is one DVD that has my daughter's name under a Christmas tree.
