A beautiful and striking British airline pilot, George Taylor (a solid image of Guiseppe Pambier), bounces after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and loves sweet and virgin Dr. Emy Wong (lovely Chai Lee's amazing and charming performance). George restores his health and goes back to work. If Emy doesn't hear from George for a long time, he will give up despair and become a prostitute. Although the director / co-author Bitto Albertini really provides a satisfactory amount of the expected tasty nudity and the evaporating soft core sex, this film is something but not your routine slip. Instead, it is a surprisingly thoughtful, touching and tragic love story between two well-drawn and very appealing characters (Chai, as Emy Wong is especially radiant and loving). The picture starts with a bubble-free and joyful, but the tone shifts to a radical and harsh mood that is about two-thirds on the way. Emy's descent into vice, if he mistakenly assumes that George is abandoned, is grim and disturbing; ditto a very sad and heartbreaking surprise buffer. The memory is that the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too foolish or dirty. Moreover, sex scenes are quite tasty and even truly erotic. Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a nice big supporting role as George's jealous and unimpeded secretary, Helen Miller. Guido Mancor's polished cinematography offers many outstanding images of exotic locations. Nico Fidenco's funky, creepy score hits a terrible spot. Look for those who are looking for something else.
