Still Hull has been compared to the spinal cord, because both are comedies for washing and R groups. In fact, the similarity ends because Crazy is much better written and acted, while the Spinal Tap script slightly worsens after the first 10 minutes of fun that makes Beavis and Butthead more complicated. Still crazy is the formal but characteristic sensitivity and some unexpectedly high quality of musical numbers were able to compensate for the a priori predictability of the film. People waiting for Spinal Tap-type experiments with satire would be disappointed by the mild nature of the movie, but I'd take a successful self-release over Crazy Crazy, but unsuccessful satire that is Spinal Tap.
