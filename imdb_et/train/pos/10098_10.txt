Dominion Tank Police is without a doubt one of the most amazing exhibitions ever produced, but not only in the animation field. If the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists mainly of activity and fun, the second part is more serious and the second part should not be treated exactly as the first part. The faces are really out of this world and the characterization is brilliant. You need to have additional intelligence to assess the complexity of the second part (Acts-3 and 4). However, I have some complaints. In the first part, Tank Bonaparte literally jumps over the tank body and it didn't make sense at all. One might also ask if Bonaparte jumps on the helicopter wing, though it was cool. Buaku rules.
