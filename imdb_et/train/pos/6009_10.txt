Mark Frechette stands for College's radical left Mark. Mark is accused of killing a policeman during a campus rebellion and fleeing into the desert. He does this by stealing a small plane from a local airport and flying it himself. <br /> <br /> When you fly over the desert, Mark marks the air. A young woman named Daria steps out and sees Mark in the plane. Make the swoops of the plane several times low, causing Daria to duck or hit. When he lands, he gets to know Daria, who is attracted by Mark's air. <br /> <br /> After some time of spiritual conversation, Mark and Daria get naked and love the sand. But by ignoring Mark's law it is understood that he must continue running. So Mark and Daria's short touchstone is pretty tough, because it won't develop into a perfect romance. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was Eraserhead in the early 1970s. Both films have complex, vague quality and complex meanings and characters. Frechette was personally so reckless as her character was in this movie. A few years after making Zabriski, Frechette abducted the bank in real life. In his prison sentence, Mark died of deadly death. He was killed by 150 pounds, which fell on him when he was lifting. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was excellent cinematography and special visual effects. The incredible, slow motion scenes of the airborne debris after the explosion were a genius sign. Although Zabriski Point is not as simple as Rover's film, he still resonated in the early 70's. I recommend to those who love the avant-garde films of the young rebels who want the rebellion of young people in the early 70s.
