This scary and quite genius adaptation of Stephen King's novel includes Dale Midfiff, Fred Gwynne (who died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some really bad gore effects. and succeed in making one of the few versions of King's work that is not only worthy, but also truly outrageous. Zombie-child's Gage Imagery (Miko Hughes-later "New Nightmare") is just as remarkable as it can easily be has been a ridiculous character to be intimidating and horrible.If people who think it is not scary-look at it alone in the dark (finally with his shameful girlfriend) and I guarantee you that "Pet Sematary" slips You should not watch some horror films like this or "Texas Chain Saw Massacre".
