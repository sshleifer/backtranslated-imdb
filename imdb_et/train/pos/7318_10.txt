John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is it the biggest horror movie of all time? no .. maybe not for everyone, but for me it is and is always. The film is just a genius and always has a very special place in my heart. It's unfortunate that I couldn't see this movie until twenty years after it was released, but even twenty years later, when so many copy cats came and gone, the film still gave the same effect as it must have done. My dad suggested before I see Halloween H20 whipping and renting Halloween 1 and 2 to get a complete story, and after watching Halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set Slasher's genre. <br /> <br /> The plot plot is simple, in 1963 Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith with cold blood with a big butcher. Fifty years imprisoned when he was treated with Dr. Sam Loom, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, where he starts pursuing three young girls: Laurie Strode is an innocent book form, Annie Brackett is a tough talking sarcastic and Lynda Van Der Klok is a beautiful and sexually strong young girl . Dr. Loomis is watching Michael here, where he supports Sheriff Leigh Bracket, who remains skeptical of his story of a psychotic killer. Michael monitors the girls mercilessly and starts killing them one by one until only the sweet innocent Laurie, who is the main goal in the Michael list, leaves. <br /> <br /> The selection of this movie was excellent and all the actors and actors gave top performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunned in his first film role, as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave an exciting result to their small role in Creation. Nick Castle, who depicts Michael, did a remarkable job like a breathless and evil killer, and his walks and body movements were ideal. who has created one of the most famous horror themes known today. The blue light was horrible and effective, and one of the greatest moments in this movie is when young Laurie is against the wall after seeing her dead friends, and hides behind Michael's face shortly before he hits. Michael's mask was one thing that sent the most tube off, the white emotional face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so big is that it's not an expensive movie unlike the cheesy Friday 13th film, in fact, there's little blood in this movie and it works rather under tension and tension. <br /> <br /> It became so clear that the films that gave birth to Halloween are like on Friday 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, whom he's just out of Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> I suggest you see this movie at least once in your life, as it is a landmark for making a movie and is undoubtedly the biggest movie ever.
