"Party Girl" takes advantage of the enormous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, it seems that the film is from time to time a vehicle in which Mrs Posey promises to play as she usually lives. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is for fans of Mrs. Posey. Von von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild trip to lower Manhattan to show us the purposeful soul whose life is dedicated to having fun in the different clubs he is constantly practicing. This is an era that was still more naive than what this region and the adjacent meat market areas changed. At least there are no complaints in the film, and we see people on earth who live their lives in a normal way, if we can call it so. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes amazing Mary. This is due to Parker Posey, whom we enjoy more than another actress would play Mary. He's the whole picture. The rest is good.
