With the same voice as John Americana drums along Mohawki, John Ford captures American history so that it is fictional, but very plausible. Henry Fonda made three consecutive films with Ford in this era, and all three are about time and place, with an emphasis on the device and the cultural environment. Mohawkis is a pioneer in America full of Americans who defend against their Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us 19th century America; the time when invention and creativity began to flourish, and this people really became great. All of this was a long, harsh, young lawyer from Abino Lincoln, Illinois, and this film fixes his life as a lawyer, being the biggest ever. <br /> <br /> Fonda is great in this movie. The nature of Lincoln's personality, though nobody knows exactly what he was. Sets and supporting pains work well together and provide a unique balance in Ford's scenic dream and its various forms. It is not a film that comes literally, but rather symbolically, showing that Lincoln was really warming up the events of his life that were supposed to create his heritage. We even get scenes between him and young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they came together, but that's not the case. I believe this is just a tribute to Lincoln, which is widely regarded as America's largest president. His quiet and understandable behavior was rarely and today. Indeed, our government certainly needs more men than it does.
