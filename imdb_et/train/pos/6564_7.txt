Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and other adventure films that were popular in the eighties. Wayne Crawford's stars like Jake Speed, an adventurer who always struggles with evil-doers wherever he goes. With their assistant, Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), they are looking for land and looking for some activities (and some decent stories). Duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins) whose sister has been kidnapped by an evil white slave (John Hurt). Can she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her save her sister? I have to give this recommendation. That's when you enjoy movies that you like to have fun and those who don't take everything at their nominal value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
