I was expecting something else: more passion, drama ... Again, another failed attempt of originality. I am sorry to say that the film is one of the old 15-year-old clich√©s of cheesesies. is not a very convincing and common line that lacks any sense. I still can't say that this movie is a complete flop because people watch it, but it didn't meet the public's expectations and Because, conclude that the production keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is a noticeable thing . So, I think it's worth it if you don't mind
