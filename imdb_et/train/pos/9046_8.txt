I just saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a while ago and since then I've been watching each of my films on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, she also has an intensity (and she even resembles Owen somewhat) that just comes out of the screen. I'm sure if he shoots some of his muscles, he will break one day of the Oscar ... <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean that movie is bad at all. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, with very unbelievable people (well, it's based on the author's early rocketry rocks), great cast? Chris Cooper is always good and Laura Dern is always on my watchlist? with a sense of humor, sin, excitement ... and a great soundtrack with so many rock roles to knock on your feet. <br /> <br /> But this movie was very special to me: in 1957 I was as old as Homer Hickham; as he was, I looked up at the night stars to look at Sputnik when it was blinded; like Homer, I tried rocketry in my backyard and even used the same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts to end the explosive catastrophe! What fun it was ... <br /> <br /> I didn't get my high (metaphorical and physical) height. But that's what you explain when you see this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the main film of the family, but it is a breed that is currently dying. Take the time to see it with the kids that you have a lot of good laughs.
