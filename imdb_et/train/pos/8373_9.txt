Note to the previous reviewer: This film is a "Iliad science-fixation" scenario. So, whether the references are painful or not, no excuse, it's the basis of the film. They admit that they stole ... though adapted to P.C. deadline. <br /> <br /> Big flick but too short. Probably neither the author, the director, nor the studio came out, but the really fucking fun. The fact that the studio itself was confusing at the time of doing this only helps to increase its heritage. <br /> <br /> A big budget, a big budget, would not be so much fun, and would probably no longer do justice to the scenario. But it's fun to dream about its potential. There is probably a DVD edition with some small add-ons, but I don't think it would play with NTSC players. I'm not an expert and I'm still trying to figure it out. I currently live with VHS incarnation.
