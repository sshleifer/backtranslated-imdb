I have seen Maslin a couple of times - both are freely on television in Brisbane. I'm not going to be good, bad or otherwise, because others are well and truly covered. <br /> <br /> I say it's Australia. In Australia alone, we can film relationships between people who spend the day as naked as a birthday party and watch it on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a US friend who has been constantly amazed at what we put on our free TV compared to our home country. Sex and CIty and Huff are just too examples. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that our government is trying to make us the 51st US state, it is good to know that at least some things are truly Aussie
