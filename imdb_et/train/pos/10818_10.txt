Why is it so low? I really can't get it ... Is that because of bad behavior? Bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in funny little budget horror movies? Seriously, the act and dialogue in these films is not important. People who hate movies only because of bad behavior and poor dialogue should not be allowed to evaluate cheesy low budget movies. These movies should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I was waiting for a gorefest, but it's not gorefest and gore is pretty bad (mostly it's the guts of the animals that are placed on the actors' bodies and that's flat), but I didn't care about the movie being fun! Characters are fun, the actress is fun (bad action is a good thing with a low budget horror movie), dialogue is fun (bad dialogue is a good thing with a low budget horror movie), a zombie rape big dick is fun, a flying daemon child is fun and I could go on and go ahead but i dont want to say too much ... But i have to mention that there is a scene where the girl masturbates with sex doll like this is alive lol! Oh and zombie rapist fall in love with sex game lol! <br /> <br /> Best Features of the Movie: <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * Sniffs Coke * Detective Sloane: What * Beeps Do you Manners?
