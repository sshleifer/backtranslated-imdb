Somerset Maugham characters are revived in RKO "Human Bondage"; but the film is a too skeletal version of the novel, where the performance of Bette Davis's star sucks all the energy. Otherwise, this is the story of Leslie Howard (Philip Carey); he dreams of becoming a painter, but he is told that he does not have a work of art. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard fights instead of becoming a doctor. His efforts seem to show some bad advice on art; although he succeeded in medicine, his painting seemed to be easier - also mark the symbolism of his disability, the "club seat" (explained in the film). <br /> <br /> Howard (just like this, in this version) will be tempted by Davis (like Mildred Rogers). Davis's "Mildred" characterization is extraordinary, culminating in a remarkable speech when he tells Howard, among other things, that he had to "wipe my mouth!" after him kissed. Howard also works well, but the story doesn't explain his long-standing charm and love for Davis; so, their performances are wasted. <br /> <br /> Still watching a movie, including some good supporters. Bette Davis' characterization was an inspiring campaign for the 1934 Best Actress Academy Award. For the record he put third. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It happened one night" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "The Wimpole Street Barrettes" <br /> <br /> 3. Bette Davis - "Binding People" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "One Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* The Binding of Man (6/28/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
