This is one big movie! I've been playing all Nancy Drew games and reading books and I've never been expecting the movie to be so exciting and funny! If you have never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (the secret of the old clock) so you can get used to Nancy, so you can watch the movie because they don't really introduce the names of the characters in the movie. ;) My family enjoyed it and the plot was very interesting. This is the last return of Nancy Drew's films, which Nancy Drew's actor did not appear to have. This movie is similar to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy Drew's Lovers, You Must See It!
