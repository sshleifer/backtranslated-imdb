Dudley Moore is fantastic in this great unknown classic. This film is a very clever film based on the talents of the very participants. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnell and some others, this film would have been a disaster. It is not always well fired and sometimes it has very funny music that tries to force the mood ("psychological" music in the wedding fight), but acts on it. The character Arthur is fun, his soldered comments. But he develops well more mature, rounded when he learns to live his free will. The end is quite bright. I will not give it away, but it could be improved. It's worth seeing several times.
