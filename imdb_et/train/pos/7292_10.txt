I saw it just last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival in Laemlee's Beverly. This movie managed to make the most films from all films. Given that two first-time music videos, I didn't know what to expect, because they were very quick and grabbed, I wasn't sure I was ready. But to the surprise, I really enjoyed it. I thought the main actor demon boy was really good. I was so impressed that I checked her name. I was surprised that it was a witch man. She's got very good, especially after that! So if he was given a dirty role or the director was really hard for a short time. The girl was working. I think it's hard because it was his first performance and so young. Dad did well. There was a lot of really nice cg work besides the short, so short and short play "Mexican Hat", which was nice too, but I enjoyed it the most because it was the deepest and the emotion and I really care about the characters. The second was a very simple story. The story was quite illustrative and dark! It dealt with the real topics, using more fantasy like an approach to keep such people interested. We're not even talking about the last movie I left. My only complaint is that I just wish I had seen more demons and a little less start, so I gave him 10 out of 10. I also thought that the final credits went a little slow. Otherwise, it was beautifully said, staged and edited. The timing was very nice, changing completely from today's fast MTV editing. This director will become more and more an actor in the future. I mean to him now as Surrows Lost actor, not to Witchblade's man.
