Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film in Entomology in some children's classes and I still remember the excitement of children; they were fascinated! Not only the termites who have built and lived in "Clay's castles", but also in other hills using hills. There is a fantastic scene where the cobra is fighting the monitor lizard, while the Mongoose colony is watching. It is not only for good entomology classes, but also for teaching ecology, as there are so many links between termites and other organisms as well as the entire ecology of all the organisms living on the mound. <br /> <br /> I want it to be available on DVD so I can watch it again and show it to others.
