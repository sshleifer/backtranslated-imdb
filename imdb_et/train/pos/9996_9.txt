I have not read other movie reviews, but on the average rating I see that they are not likely to be very complementary. <br /> <br /> I watched it for the second time with my kids. They loved it completely. True, he hadn't run around the floor in adults, but the joy of the children seemed so. <br /> <br /> This is a real Mel Brooks farce with lots of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not for whom we are and how embarrassing our friends and companions are. There are undoubtedly many other movies with a similar theme, many of which have a greater comic or emotional effect on adults. I find it hard to imagine such an impact on the younger members of the family. <br /> <br /> So, 9/10 of them are children.
