I have to admit that I've never seen "Rhodat" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Even though I don't know anything about the comic talent duo, this movie still enjoyed a lot. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose is trying to be a comedian for luck. Rhoda struggles with photography. And Meredith ... what does he do again? The three stories we follow for over two hours are fun and entertaining. When two long-time friends reunite, it makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how good the writing was. The little jokes thrown by Mary and Rhoda were funny. The script itself was very well assembled. <br /> <br /> I have seen Moore and Harper in other films over the past couple of years and thought they were great. But I had no idea they were working as a team. Although both actors play their part in the title of this film, they never seem to have let me down. (During the film's move.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their role, but nothing big. The rest, like Jonah, Cecile and .... all others, work well together. <br /> <br /> Being reunited, you expect the fan of both shows to enjoy it. I still enjoyed this little reunion from a non-fan. There is a good story for every character and two main characters that makes this movie very good. (Newer version of MTM theme song will not be lost.)
