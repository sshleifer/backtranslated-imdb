Christopher Smith is obviously a spooky fan and it has become clear by sliding the horror of his debut. The "shrinkage", though a bit loose about information, proves itself to be a true classic class. A little less shiny than the last US horrors (Amityville Horror remake, House of Wax remake), this dark and terrible story follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the underground tunnel labyrinth and unused railroads like him, and several others along the way, try and escape from the murderous attacker. Although some bad comments have been dragged by this film, I really believe that, in the case of a tight budget and the UK's first production of Smith's production, "Creep" is truly named. It offers fast-moving action from the start, sometimes too fast, because the story is uneven in some areas, but I've seen the ideal location and the best character-reaction at the end, 'Creep' offers some scenes that are definitely nightmares.
