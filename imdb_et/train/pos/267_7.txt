It all starts with the theft of seemingly unrelated objects on students at Hickory Road in London. As for her sister, a housekeeper, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to investigate. He agrees, but the stakes will soon be higher if a girl who admits that he was responsible for most (not all) thefts is found to be murdered. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a sure-to-use brain without being as meaningless as "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe". The crimes are related to murders, theft and diamond smuggling, and the final twist that binds together is only apparent in the last 2 minutes! Characters are interesting, especially Psychology student Colin McNabb and mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Inspector Japp has her funny moments (perhaps the closest this series has reached "toilet humor") and Miss Lemon becomes an integral part of the story as usual.
