I watched some of the old VHS tapes that I have and that came over the TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together. It made me go to my computer and look for a DVD version of this exhibition. I was disappointed that I couldn't find it on a DVD yet. The exhibition took place in 1979 and was a pleasant exhibition. I have a record and a CD, but I would like to buy the DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the picture quality is pretty good, but fading, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are no other songs on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and Muppet, the DVD of this exhibition would be a very good seller. If you do not have a CD, it is a wonderful collection of critics taken from this exhibition. The album is also good if you can find it and still play it to play it.
