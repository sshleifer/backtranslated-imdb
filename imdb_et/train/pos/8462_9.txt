I've just bought a collection that is one of this awesome series, and even after watching three episodes, I'm still striking animation with a stylish style and a story of time, but with thought. I'm still a fan ..... with some small pains. <br /> <br /> Although this installment is very cool for Gundam's saw and he has what he had in the previous series - a stylish satirical way to talk about the wrong things to war and don't let go of the need to control or overcome everything (familiar?), I have to say that it becomes a little too weak to dramatically explain the lives of the main characters and their unremitting need for abdominal pain, whatever happens and what they need to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding (especially with Wufei ... I mean he creates more than the American character in the soap opera. Advisor, is ya?) <br /> <br /> In addition to the excess drama (I think it comes mainly from the duplication of English speakers), this series is still very exciting and still again me. I mean, it can always be worse. It may be like the last installment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about a mild dramatic .... I'll talk about it later.
