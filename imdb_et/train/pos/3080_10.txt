I have appealed to ABC for a six-degree cancellation. If enough people do the same, it is enough to bring this fabulous exhibition to life! Just go to the official site and the rest is easy enough. I don't understand why this show has been canceled. With a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is catchy! I'm surprised that my favorite exhibition has ended in just one series. Why is it? Six degrees are phenomenal, it's better than many other TV programs out there! Until I heard they stop this friend, it didn't even happen to me that it could happen.
