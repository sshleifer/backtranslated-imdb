I rarely see a movie I have completely caught; it was one of them. It was a good actor, dialogue, plot and landscape was beautiful. I laughed many times loud, especially with a kitchen attack. There was one floor for the handicap comedy of Lunkhead's hand, but I admit that I'm a cracker. The story was about a group of people whose 30-year-olds came back to the summer camp they had 20 years ago. It was a good day for camping because the place is closed permanently at the end of the season. In adults, the camp seemed different and they knew it and each other differently. I recommend this funny, moving movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
