In an attempt to create an audience empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), filmmakers talk to North and Jayhawkers. Missouri never gave up the Union and the Union army was not an invading force. Foreigners fought for the rights of the state: the right to have slavery, the curved legislators and the judges, and used a political system that was corrupted. There's nothing surprising about that. Missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the Confederate Army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the story is not unclear. When Jake leaves Bushwhackers, it is not because he saw a mistake on his way, he certainly does not give up for the cancellation.
