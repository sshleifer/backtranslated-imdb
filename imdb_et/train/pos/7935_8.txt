The life of dead Hood had a lot to live before the recovery credit began. First of all, playing "live dead" games refers to His Holiness Mr. Romero and immediately creates a high standard that many movies cannot afford. And secondly, my film-watching companion doubted that any city horror movie would surpass Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptical, we started to look. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good-hearted zombie movie. Oh, surely the budget is low and of course there are managers of amateurs friends, but lively dead Hood loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes, yes. But if it's cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE keeps it. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in the lab during the day and replaces his younger brother at night. He dreams of moving out of Oakland. But before this scheduled escape, his brother is let down to death. Ricky's keen scientific mind presents an opportunity that is better than CPR or 911: injecting his laboratory into an experimental regenerative formula. Unfortunately a little girl wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty Oakland zombie! Chaos and Chaos! I think it is more economical to eat your enemies when you take revenge, but then again I am a poorer judge of the complexity of city life. (If the judge is poor? In response to the four men who participated in the four men, I decided to "Ah-ha! White t-shirts for everyone to show blood. Economic! I used the same technique in my low budget horror movie" Jordan replied: "No, White T-shirts were banned in New Orleans bars for some time. "Oh.) <br /> <br /> Many movies are set in someone's living room, so there are lots of hanging and waiting zombies. But the characters are sympathetic and the film is sincere - it transcends the spirit of its spirit. Zombie Explanation: When a person plays God, zombies are created! Or maybe: Follow the FDA-approved test rules before testing people! <br /> <br /> A bet on a zombie canon: this is the first zombie movie I've seen while driving. As far as the actual zombies are concerned, the infection spreads in the usual way with bite, but quite unusual head shots do not work - this is the heart shots that kill. Zombies have impulses, the absence of which proves true death. And these zombies make a pretty cool jaguar fracture. <br /> <br /> Free zombie movie jokes: Mercenary named Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Favorite Zombie: Jaguar Noise Little Brother Zombie, of course!
