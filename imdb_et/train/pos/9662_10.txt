Bette Midler's long-time fan, I have to say that his live concerts are my favorites. Bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us tears with her ballads. Bette shows us her strong repertoire, as well as new stories from "Bette of Roses", an emotional and talented emotion and talent. For generations of people it offers something for everyone. One and only Divine Divine here proves that he is the most intense talent.
