The New Orleans doctor and policeman have only 48 hours to find an infected person with pneumonia. <br /> <br /> A powerful and stylish little thriller headed by Elia Kazan, which combines a documentary real-time rush of heartbeat. The panic attacks in and around New Orleans and in the panic are taken from Quarantine, Some Like em. Cold Edna and Edward Anhalt, who won the Oscar for the original story. It is also proud of the ensemble's casting, offering its director's top performances. In turn, Richard Widmark {bringing the method one year ahead of Marlon for Kazan named Desire}, Paul Douglas, Jack Palance (by Walter Jack Palance) and perfectly named Zero Mostel, all gain momentum when the pursuers are pursuing an attempt to halt the start of a possible Black Death epidemic. <br /> <br /> When the film has its main stopping points, Kasanan's intelligent ability to stop the main characters back and forth without affecting the flow and mood of the work. Widmark's public health doctor, holding a hypodermic needle, runs around trying to find bad guys so he can do good; for bad men who are confused about why they have such a wide-ranging hunt; tension collides until fever. Luckily for the last thirty minutes, it has become a cinematic factor. Palance's remarkable as a nasty frog that ironically puts Widmark on Tommy Udo three years ago before Kiss Of Death. <br /> <br /> This is an imaginative and intelligently written story that connects rats and criminals to the carriers of diseases. Damage to society as it was. It is a noirish element, such as paranoia, which fits well with its basic procedural thriller. Although some memorable scenes are reflected by the shrinking atmosphere Kazan has created. Although some early psychologists are threatening to direct the film to a somewhat narrative walkway, it is definitely a movie that is still over. It is not an important film noir and perhaps not even an important Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that reveals the discovery of a new generation of film students and the old guard who may have fallen back a day ago. 7.5 / 10
