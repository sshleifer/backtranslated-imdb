The straight story is a multilevel study of American goodness and beauty. At one level, a slow walk through the heart environment, it is a sure resident and amber, on the second level of aging and remembering, which is important (and forgetting actively nothing). David Lynch gives us the time of this movie and helps me remember that so much can be said. A remarkable film that rests with me for a while.
