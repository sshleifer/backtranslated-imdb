Elephant Walk (1954) Headquarters Peter Finch as a manor lord in a God-abandoned plant where there is always the danger of elephants or crazy people staying in the midday sun and despising. Well in the end they do, after the stomach or cholera outbreak, of course, and a lot of chaos. Taylor replaced Vivien Leighi, who plagued the pot with the pot / adventure clamp. When elephants rush into the house and trap Liz on the big staircase, I still get bumps. Thanks for the goodness of Dana Andrews for saving the day. One of my favorite guilty. Also color!
