It's the best of the Shelley Duvall's "Faerie Tale Theater" series. The ugly levels are extensive comedy reliefs, and Eve Arden is the personification of the godless personality. Jennifer Beals does an excellent job of direct Cinderella, especially in the garden where is Matthew Broderick's Prince Charming. Jean Stapleton plays the fairytale game well, although I'm not sure I liked the "south lady" character with a few lines. Steve Martin's comedy relief, like the conductor of the Royal Orchestra, is more meaningful to Martin, but a little wrong place in the show. <br /> <br /> As usual in the series, older kids have been thrown up with several funny comments. 15 years and older). With a few small bumps, the show will flow well and they will live happily. Children up to the age of 8 will watch it after the parents finally get tired - I found a little too much 3 times a day.
