This interesting documentary speaks of a remarkable expedition to take the blind Tibetan children to trick the Himalayas; but also the collision of personality between two remarkable people. On the one hand, Erik Weihenmeyer, the first to climb Everest, and the team of (visually impaired) mountain climbers who run the children. On the other hand, Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who heads the first school of blind Tibetans, agrees with the expedition, but later has doubts about its progress. At some level, Sabine simply does not understand the philosophy of the climber (with emphasis on summation); he is probably right when he detects a contradiction between the goals of the climbers and the wishes of the children, but his certainty in his rightness makes him a difficult person, especially if he has an effective veto. In the face of this (reasonably well thought out) collision, we get an overview of the lives of children themselves. I liked the film, although it gives a message that is clearly highlighted - although it clarifies the quarrel, the film confirms somewhat relentlessly how amazing it is all those who are in it. However, it is difficult to claim this assessment, even if it is presented somewhat vaguely to the viewer.
