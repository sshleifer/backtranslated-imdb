It's a peculiar little movie, and I have to agree that there is some exotic. <br /> <br /> This is the result of a young man's adventures who decide he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and is partly following his dreams, partly about other dreams and everything about showbys. I thought the film was charming, and it has a moment or two of true magic that makes the whole thing worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is terrible as a magician who had never been, and his mentoring to Max makes a funny and touching relationship. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, probably, but if you like the movie, I think you like it.
