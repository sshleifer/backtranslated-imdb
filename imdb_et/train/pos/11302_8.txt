Oh, they'll hit the Italians. It is not the first time that they made a movie for the source material without the permission of the novelist or unknown. Of course, this is usually not something that is Italian, but it has been pretty much done in the early years of the cinema, mostly because they often thought they could get it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off the American screen until 1976, but the film itself has grown into a somewhat well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The film is not as big as the 1946 American version, but it is still a great movie. This is, of course, not least due to the film, which is a great strong story that is intriguing and gives the film great signs and realism. It follows the novel quite closely, and is therefore mostly the same as its other film versions, of course, with the difference that it is set in an Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Leave it to the Italians for the movie life and for the real people. These early dramas always have a very real feeling and are therefore quite involved. Unfortunately, the film lost to the end of the film when the film began to feel a little longer and split. The movie could have been easily finished 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I really don't have anything to say about this movie. It is simply made based on some equally large and strong source material. Pretty impressive director of his debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to lead many much larger and more memorable Italian drama films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
