When I really started to get interested in movies, I had a big list of "black-this" films at the age of eleven, and I'm going to Blockbuster and rent two or three weekends; some of them were not for everyone, and my mother went to the nuts. I remember one of the movies on this list was "Chorus Line" and could never get it; so now to see that this is a dream. <br /> <br /> Of course I lost the list and I did something to return it because I think there were really interesting things. I mean, take the "A Chorus Line," the performance in the movie. I know this is something we see a lot today, but then it was a little different, probably; There's something special about this movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the music that made movies today will allow the camera to give them free, create different landscapes and take characters to different places; "Chorus Line" was born at the theater stage as a game and it dies in the same place as the movie. Following a major performance by a renowned choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough organizes a large number of dancers to work. , the emphasis that figures have to learn, dancers quiet competition? And all this is happening on stage where Douglas puts every dancer in the spotlight and tells them about their personal life and the most terrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they are listed for short hours. <br /> <br /> Like the movie I recently saw, "A Prairie Home" at Atenborough deals with the problem of continuity. Things are going on the stage or behind it and the time is not shining. Again, I don't do it when Atenborough cut it a lot, but it's not sure; and still it is a great job of managing and editing (John Bloom). But at this small stage, what do you know what to do with the camera? With only one setting, Ronnie Taylor's cinematographic path finds a close-up of certain characters, increasing and decreasing, showing the stage from a different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of New York. <br /> <br /> In an important moment, Douglas tells those who are left behind: "Before we begin to eliminate: you are all terrible and I would like to hire you all, but I can't. It made me think of today's reality where the only thing is that reads is singing or dancing, and where the jury always says that the competitors have exactly the words before some of them leave (even if they are not good) .It is hard, you have to imagine, at least here where they all really are terrible. <br /> <br /> To tell some of the stories, the characters use the songs, and in one second a new life is on stage, and it is literally a dream come true. ‚ÄùMarvin Hamlisch's music and Edward Kleban's words make the movie go without mistakes, showing them dancers' feelings and letting them make these wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett. The theater theater will also give Arnold Schulman a flawless and very short scenario; from time to time it is very touching. with a song, it's a word, but "A Chorus Line," it's impossible not to move. <br /> <br /> During a test break that takes place in Alyson Reed's special dancer, Cassie will step in to persuade Douglas to be able to do so. The words "let me dance for you" never heard more honest and beautiful music and lyrics.
