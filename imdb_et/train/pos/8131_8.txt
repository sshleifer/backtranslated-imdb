<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, even though it's funny if you don't get references to straight comedy. <br /> <br /> You haven't seen a lot of mortgages from CB4, but what I saw wasn't the heart of this little depositor. <br /> <br /> You have not heard of these people as a surprise. The film is very similar to the Spinal Tap, which is not bad, and I think a lot of dialogue, while the invaluable Tap is funny here, probably because I am more crumbling than rock theses, so I think cloud this point. <br /> <br /> Rap songs are funny as hell, and this is basically a reference to most movies, not all of them in their faces, which means physical comedy and lump liners will be a priority for the start-ups. <br /> <br /> Great fun, one look twice when the movie was ever.
