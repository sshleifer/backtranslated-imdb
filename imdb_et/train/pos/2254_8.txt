Fox's epic talks about one of America's greatest pioneering efforts on a DVD that has some truly outstanding "extras". BRIGHAM YOUNG ("Frontiersman" added for the liberation of Europe), telling the story of a great pioneer leader who, inspired by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), in 1847, after mobs were murdered by his prophet / leader , moved to Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price) in 1940, just as America was entering World War II. It was a bold move for Fox leader Darryl F. Zanuck, and it was a breath of fresh air for the people of Mormon, as it was the first film that tried to show his faith on the screen. Now Fox, working with James D'Arc, Brigham Young University's curator of the excellent film archives in Provos, Utah, has brought this film into a DVD release release. Mr. D'Arc, who made his doctoral thesis on film a few years ago, has offered one of the most comprehensive commentary on DVD. He separates it from fiction and lets listeners understand why churches have appreciated this movie so much, even though the whole movie is decorated with truth. One of the fun bits is Dean Jagger, an actor who plays the role of a title. Many years after the film, he married a later-holy woman and eventually became LDS. There is much to learn from D'Arc's knowledge and it's great if it's part of the DVD! The album has over 100 images of Fox & BYU archives, plus newsletters from the amazing premiere in seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks to FOX for another outstanding DVD - and thank you, James D'Arc for his great comment!
