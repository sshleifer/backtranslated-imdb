The management of this film was fantastic for comedy. Many scenes seem to be out of the comic book and much darker (visually - not the story of wisdom) than what I expected. In this case, it may not be the most fun movie ever made, especially if you have very rough sexist jokes because it has very little (compared to anything like Mary or American Pie). When you collect it again, there are several jokes and fun. If you've ever read a comic book or looked at a comic book movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and liked them, you'll probably enjoy all the fine humor that lasts the movie. If you didn't like them, you might like this respectful ridiculous that this movie is for them. If you like this movie, there are some cool extras on the DVD. (8/10)
