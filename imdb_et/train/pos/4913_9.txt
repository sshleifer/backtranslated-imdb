The title somewhat goes beyond the content of this film, which can lead to some unrealized expectations. Frankly speaking, there is very little "panic in the streets". In fact, very few people throughout the film know that there is a murderer who can spread the plague to everyone and everyone he meets. Having said that what we have here is a very well done story, the relationship of which starts anyway relatively high (because, unlike people on the "streets", the viewer knows what is going on) and that director Elia Kazan is deliberately building. As an attempt to kill an infected killer, one of the most interesting sidebands was the relationship between Dr Reed (Richard Widmark) and police captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, these two do not like each other, although they have to work together. Finally, they have created real respect for each other. He did a good job with it. <br /> <br /> Pretty much all the performances here were great. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I had looked pretty early at Jack Palance, which would become his typical "hard" role. I found very little criticism here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes was as flat as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role was not at the heart of the story. All in all, this is a great job. 9/10
