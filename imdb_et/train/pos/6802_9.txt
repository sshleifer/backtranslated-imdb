You see this episode better from the beginning, because when you start to look at it later, you will be confused with the way that Clark lives. <br /> <br /> But it's twisting; Clark has remained in an alternating reality. Lana is dedicated to her. Lex lost most of his legs and was in a wheelchair accident when he tried to leave a series of pilots out of Clark. Martha is married to Lionel. The only constant is his most loyal friend Chloe, who still believes he is. And, yes, he is not superpower. He is in a spiritual institution to put himself in a fantasy world where he has authority, and he is ridiculous to believe. Alongside Chloe, there is one mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who, in an alternative reality, is a resident of the institution who believes he is from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must stay true to everything he believes is a real reality, not an institution psychiatrist who is actually the fourth Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode is absolutely delightful and shocking. In addition, it offers a fresh twist of the usual "Smallville" episode type.
