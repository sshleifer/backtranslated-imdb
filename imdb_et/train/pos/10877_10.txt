I saw this movie with a bunch of friends, and although only two of us walked out of the cinema, we wondered how cool it was, others just laughed and commented how stupid it was. Well, it was because it shouldn't be taken so seriously, basically it's a movie that strikes horror and makes a damn good job .. There seems to be another movie that comes out too ... Scary Movie? Well this is Aussie and original !!! Jessica Napier makes the surperb and Sarah Kants has a solid bright future acting! Hope to see them more. Molly Ringwald had a good move and Kylie was even better off. The Impossible Princess was Queen of the Screen !! I suggest you see this flick because you have completely guessed the connection between Raffy, Hilary and the movie that never got 20 years ago.
