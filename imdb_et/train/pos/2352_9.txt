I have to say that when the Pushing Daisies came out, I immediately got a fairy tale like setting up such an event. The narrator made the cake all the way, doing the routine, well, Ned (Lee Pace) baking pies. And to bring them back to life was the same routine. <br /> <br /> The trio of Nedi, Emerson Codi (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), and sometimes of the Olek Snook (Kristin Chenoweth, who made such music for Wicked, made some fantastic dialogues and stupidities) It definitely deserves the title of (romantic) comedy / drama. <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck made a shy and non-realistic love couple who are still exploring their feelings, even though they don't touch - an obstacle that seems like But, despite the inconvenience they put in when they were working around their strange mystery, which only a few know, they can still show chemistry on their screen when it comes to scenes when Ned But the existence of the olive, however, makes some play moments in the pie shop and unexpected complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season fell sharply, pushing s an exhibition that had real potential. Some episodes had a lot of speed and inconvenience that made you ask what happened? both in the land of the general dead person and in the predominant plot line. The addition of Chuck's father and Ned's two half-brothers did not help, and at least one of the land lines felt almost recycled (did the "Comfort Food" episode not be seen as a "Bitter Sweets" episode because the dead person of the week died in food?). Some touching moments (beehives) contributed to the promotion of the relationship between Chuck and Nedi, but every time they approached, the writers decided to throw away the second keychain, not to let the link go (Oliver comes back from the monastery, Chuck's dead father comes back to life and doesn't go back, you get the picture). <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it didn't work, but the concept was good and it seemed surreal, just enough Pleasantvillesque color / happy-smiley going on and unlikely scenarios that remind you that it's not "dead like me." " And again, it's "Pushing Daisies", "according to Creator Bryan Fuller's data, so it's credible again. <br /> <br /> It should have lasted longer, but it's just witty thinking. For any new examples of tissue, this is a short-lived pearl.
