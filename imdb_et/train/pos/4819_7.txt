In general, I thought it was a very nice movie - I don't want to use the word "nice" because it is pretty dry, but it was very nice to look at and Rupert SÃµbra and Emily Blunt's central performance was very strong. What I liked most is that, despite the luminous aesthetics of costumes and settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart of a movie that was good, strong in writing (thank you Julian Fellowes: D); nothing is too terrible or bumpy, i.e. not very sensational (if Victoria is pulled out of bed to inform her, she is now a queen, well you didn't get a less glamorous hand from the crown). It was a temple gently and every line in the movie kept its value. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the portrayal of love between Victoria and Albert, although it was somewhat of a fairy tale, actually faced a slow burning candle, Friend and Blunt showed well how these two people would bother together despite joining together (my dragon was then when they came home after hunting and Victoria just hugged her new husband, so much was said without words), that's what the movie is). Blunt also kept her beautiful, her face demands your attention, and I can't mention the costumes she's wearing - everyone is just proud. If I were blunt, I would have trouble leaving with them! The rest of the band played well, Harriet Walter as Queen of Adelaide has been highlighted. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have is that he didn't have the urgency or the event that might have made the movie a little more exciting? (It was quite annoying) I don't know, I wanted something to happen that would pull Victoria into some force and prove her value a little more. When he and Albert claimed, I loved it, I could have done some of the most important dramatic moments, though it may be me. <br /> <br /> Finally, if the risks are all patriotic, he renewed a kind of pride and awe in the crown and what he must be in such a situation, especially in one young man. This may be partly due to the fact that the snap shot of this movie called "The Life of Victoria Youth" is immediately capable of what I have written for my symbol "The Sword & The Scion", but still noted these feelings (those who follow my book Maybe it was part of the movie that shows how ridiculous the government is at these times because they didn't feel like giving the poor and the lost people a nation that only repeatedly renews recognition that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were very active in this country. It made the government quite useless - nothing has changed, I think. <br /> <br /> BLOG about movies and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com
