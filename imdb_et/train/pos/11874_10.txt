The best role of Arguebly Al Pacino. He plays Tony Montana, a small hood from Cuba became the rich and powerful criminal master of Miami, and he does so only with two things he has in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn't break. nobody. Starting work for a long time with Cuban dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and the fast growing organization ladder with his long friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he will be in sight of the superior sexy woman Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees Tony's threat to his position, he tries to murder Tony, but without accident. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him right now. The film has a great support among them - F. Murray Abraham is a gangster, the other familiar face is Harris Yulin as a curious policeman trying to shake Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio Tony as a young sister. The authors of the Oliver Stone Ecxellent scenario. This film is one of Brian DePalma's brightest points in his long career as a career, you can see that this man is very talented. The film has a great view. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: one in a fancy restaurant ("Say good night to a bad person"). The second is the last shootout where Tony shows that he knows more about how to capture and kill about 20 assassins who invaded his house. this is definitely one of the most impressive end of the film I've ever seen. For Al Pacino fans and criminal movies, this is a must-have. For the rest of you it is highly recommended. 10/10
