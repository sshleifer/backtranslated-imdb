It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The film is extraordinary, sometimes terrible. He also received the Oscar for best photography and earned so. I have a lot of movies in my movie collection and many more have seen them, and many of them are not more beautiful or even as beautiful as it is. <br /> <br /> This is a unique and general big movie. The cast is fantastic and does a great job of portraying your characters. We follow their destiny with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them. We are also learning things about ourselves and our lives. I think a large part of the movie he represents and how it is presenting it. I recommend it warmly
