This "film of age" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dan and Maureen, when they learn about life and love as one fateful summer. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Mulligan, famous for his excellent work on "Mockingbird killing", the film never hit a false statement. All work is great. Like Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning movie. Looking at this beautifully captured and superbly directed and edited movie, I felt like looking at the reality of the window instead of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I've been watching this movie at least 5 times and I can honestly say it's one of the best films ever made about the feelings, challenges, and changes of young people, love and young adults. Families with 10-15-year-olds should look at it together and use it as a discussion section, as it raises a number of issues related to sister competition, how to deal with love, parental responsibilities, and so on.
