When I lived in New York, I saw this movie as a Creature Feature as a child. It was a pretty horrible movie, though not as good as the Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on a DVD and it is different from what I remember because the DVD I bought has several scenes where actors speak French and / or Italian and no subtitles are offered. The other participants then react in English to what was said. Weird. Also, the names of some actors in the DVD box are written differently from IMDb. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is different because Elsie's character takes her clothes off and offers a naked shot in one scene, and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) with her to push her into bed and kiss her, when Steele is against. This scene existed in the television version, but it was changed very well. I don't know if there are any additional materials that could be included in the remastered ultra edition? It seems sad that some of these old low-budget classics are bits and are sold in any edited versions. Where are the tapes and all the unused images? <br /> <br /> After the first twenty minutes before Allen's casting into the castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There are not too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia's club is good). Barbara Steele's horrible atmosphere and strange, exotic and seductive look make the movie much better than it should. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele hadn't been in this movie, it would be a big zero. He's making the movie ten!
