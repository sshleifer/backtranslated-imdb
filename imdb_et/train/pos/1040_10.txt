An outstanding film of 1943, where Paul Lukas gave the Oscar calibrated as his family leader, bringing them back to Europe when the Nazis threatened. Normal terrible Bette Davis retains its reputation here and the best actor was not nominated for this or any 1943 film. <br /> <br /> Lukas has treated them, Lukas successfully deals with the situation. He knows he has to return to a secret mission to Europe and return it when he does. <br /> <br /> Davis retracts all the stops next to Katharine Hepburn's tears. He knows that his older son must follow him for freedom. <br /> <br /> A great movie that highlights America's positive propaganda against the evil enemy.
