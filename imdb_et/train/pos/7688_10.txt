Back in 74, Eric Monte made the classic T.V show in the Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching RV in T.V Land. Jimmie Walker seemed to always be a star and not Esther Rolle. John Amos mostly felt a little jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity, which won millions of fans time to sit and watch Times. The exhibition would have been dead if JJ hadn't been there to always treat his School Aid. Drinking a School AID was like his favorite thing at the show. I was 3 when he came out and 8 when he finished. 1974-1979. Instead of a year, she should have gone longer than the 1980s when I just grew up.
