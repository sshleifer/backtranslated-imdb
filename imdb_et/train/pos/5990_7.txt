I don't have much to add before what was said before, but it is a very long time, and the first (and probably only) time the studio completely hanged on Dead End Kids. > <br /> Warner gave a lot of help to boys, from director Ray Enright and A-budget, to almost magical supporters. At each step, we get the real pros of one of these pearls. They are too many to list, but it seems that Warner's (Sans' biggest stars) talks about this picture. (See if you can announce John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> Eduardo Cianelli is always the most trustworthy mobile at Messianic level. He plays this character almost exactly like the Thuggie leader Gunga Dinis. He has something to watch! And Marjorie Main is great and gets its best role because "Dead End" is. <br /> <br /> My offer for this is another feature on a double bill that has something like "City for Conquest". <br /> <br /> Hooray Warners!
