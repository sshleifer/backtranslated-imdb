Although it is too young to remember the first show of the series (being just a child), I was later on TV in the late 1980s, just when I was interested in the war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather, who for the first time showed me this series and also gave me my first interests related to his history in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I've been eating a lot of books and seeing different television series in the Second World War, a confusing opinion. British television stations are generally very good at producing them because The World At War can easily prove that many BBC and independent companies have done this with precious stones. I strongly recommend headlines such as "Nazis - A History of Warning", "Blitz", and the BBC Series Dunker. "Britain at war color" with its companion "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are very high. The world in war is by far the best and, despite its age, it can never be achieved. There are always new revelations about war that will cut back, which is obviously not part of the series, and of course there was such a big canvas during World War II so that it would take more time and money to produce a series with every detail, even if it was even possible. I feel I have to say to those who do not talk about everything that the World War II cannot physically do it, but it is certain that the devil can ask you to do further research and make it enjoyable. It certainly worked for me: I now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Suggest to anyone who even has a temporary interest. The series was so well done that it is difficult for them to disagree with the fact that it is a quality program and very informative.
