After Fatih Akins' first work, "Im Juli", which was quite good, he created a really proud Italian family. This German film, which, unfortunately, is a bad prerequisite, causes us to produce rare films;). But this movie makes some very good pictures ever since. "Solino" is an Italian immigrant who arrives in the "Ruhr" region of Germany in the 1960s. Then the immigrants and their family start in the area of ​​the first Pizza restaurant. The characters are great. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling he does. His brother, playing Moritz Bleibtreu, is not that good. Well, you just don't believe in her role. But the character is well balanced and fits perfectly into this script. I feel the need to compare the style of this film with the "godfather" style. Many people are likely to hate this movie, say it boring. Not much tension? - Yes, but an outrageous film. 9 out of 10
