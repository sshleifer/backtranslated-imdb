Lupine gives up Morocco in search of the legendary treasure. His only clue is the interesting gem that the old man gave him. This is a nice different place for Lupine, the desert and the hot exotic feeling. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing about this film is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, usually in a different place than Lupine. On the one hand, their classic dynamics are omitted, but this is a change of pace. In addition, Lupine can focus on women ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko's rules in this. Throughout this function, he is attracting lupine and our viewers. Then Lara, the girl of that particular story, is pretty nice. It has more nudity than any other Lupine anime that is a fun difference. <br /> <br /> There is a very fun feminine ninja guy who is the best villain in this, and of course he has some great struggles with Goemon, as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Of course, the inspector Zenigata is also in the trawl form here. <br /> <br /> Pretty much, it's a smooth ride with Lupine. The plot is medium and there are some slow spots, but all this movie is a real joy. Enjoy.
