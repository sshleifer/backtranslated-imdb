Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very cool game for N64. Bowser is up to his usual shenanigans (yes it's a stupid word but the only thing I mean) and Mario must stop him again. This game is very fun to play and contains a lot of nostalgia. The only bad thing about today's standards is terrible graphics, but everything else is pretty good (especially the small mini-games you can open) This is the second best N64 game (the first is the bad day of Conker) so I recommend any Mario for a fan or a fan of platform games. It wins the mediocre Super Mario Sunshine every day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
