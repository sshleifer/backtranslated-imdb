The film was much better than the other reviewer. This is a nice family movie. It's a fun fantasy aspect for some time to travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds she can travel from time to time in her apartment building in an old elevator. Of course, no one will believe him when he tries to explain his disappearances. He finds and makes friends with his friends and can help the girl in many ways. He can also help his father in the long term. It reminds me of Hallmark's film, which gives him the opportunity to decide for himself. It seems to be more targeted at children aged 6-12 (maybe a little older) and it's pretty much a PG or G rated. I'm an adult who appreciates a nice "family" movie - I don't think the other reviewer is.
