Unknown William Powell. It is a joy to see the screen when it does without the world without the situation. She always seems to be on top of her game and little care is given by anyone who doubts her. Murder are projects, hardly people. I have noticed that it is from the codend. Other than the casual crying widow, the victims fulfill the reason for the movie. Nothing more. There are enough turns to keep things interesting and Powell is the champion. There is a lot of political injustice, especially with regard to Asian performers. It's a bit difficult to take. Great is cast and Curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset.
