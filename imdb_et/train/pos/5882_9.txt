In Mexico, this movie was only on PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a real example of a good German and especially a good person. The conversations between the character of the whip and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. A true war of ideas: two different Germans, both believe in the faith there. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boy, church and great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I recommended this movie a lot, especially in the difficult times of this planet. In Mexico we don't know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and heritage, it's a great job to save a forgotten hero.
