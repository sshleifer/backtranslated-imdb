I understand why this film was Oscar-nominated for the best live action because it was built masterfully. Even if you don't really like Blues (though it sounds much more jazz to me), you can just understand this movie. It's just very well done, although for my life I don't see why director Gjon Mili was the only one to direct a movie - that's it. In other words, the film is nominated, but the director did not get any career. As for the black speakers, I realized that this did not lead to a shift in their career, because unfortunately, most white societies are indifferent (or worse) to black or "such music." <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, if you haven't enjoyed a particular part of the past, skip to the 5:50 mark - where it rises significantly. When the woman stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, the pace was getting better.
