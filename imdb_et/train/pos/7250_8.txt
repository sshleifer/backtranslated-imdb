I first read the book when I was a young teenager, and I saw the movie for one night. About a year ago I checked it in IMDb and discovered no copies. Then I hit the web and found a site that offers war movies, so glad I did, I ordered a copy and sat back and I could confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> I think you really enjoy a movie that I recommend reading to get a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer printed, but I watched a copy through E-Gulf, author Alan White was a Commander / Preliminary Project during World War II, who was involved in various secret operations and was his first book. It has been written by someone who knows and I believe it will give the book and the film its authenticity. I haven't given ten to the movie just because of the end of the movie, not as good as the book. There are also a couple of plot lines that are also different from the book, which is strange, because the book is not the vast nature of war, but the individual of war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have a copy of this book to let my son read and let the movie in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can watch this book and movie, it's definitely worth it and I just want it to be more accessible for more reading and seeing, one of my best war movies!
