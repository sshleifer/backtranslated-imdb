Well, if you're open enough to want a Barber Shop, you'll love this Canadian film. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, you give it the current score that is: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for anyone who is ready to watch movies outside their racial background. It's interesting, it's alive, two or three times you lose the connections between scenes, but many times, especially at the end, you'll find yourself under tears or two eyes, and that's just because it is so often reflecting what life can be. <br /> <br /> I like it and recommend it to anyone outside the traditional American movie.
