Anyone who finds this movie boring is a desperate dwarf who should stick to autofilms and romantic comedies. This movie is riveting and has no dull moment. Why? Because it is largely made up of intelligent dialogue between real people at the time of the crisis and specifies their efforts to survive this crisis. I repeat - smart dialogue! It is characterized by almost all Rohmer films, so many people don't like them. They prefer action. Fine, let them spend the rest of your life watching movies, while those who are delicious and discriminating are still looking for such movies. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of "talkative". Well, he is, but for me it is a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was also talkative. Is there a talker game like "Hamlet?" If the theme or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and values ​​of conflict, it is necessary to discuss these ideas and values ​​if necessary, which is largely what this film is about. Aristocracy and noble labor vs. egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends, which is the ultimate test when this friend takes what we believe to be the wrong way; the value of human life and the responsibility for saving this life, even if the person who has that life is not so nice or even despicable. (Anyone who ever hears Dostoevsky or "Crime and Punishment?" This is what this film is about. <br /> <br /> Two movie leaders are impeccable as if they were born to play their roles. Especially brilliant is Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as a second language. Do yourself a favor and watch this riveting movie. It can be the last movie master of this screen.
