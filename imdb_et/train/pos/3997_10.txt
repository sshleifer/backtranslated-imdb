What a moving film. I have a dear friend who has been in his sixties and has told me over the last 15 years that people no longer see him, and he misses a companion. Being in my late 40's, I'm gonna see what she's complaining about. You are no longer youthful, beautiful or touching. When May says "... this part of the body ...". How our bodies change and how we are told that it is no longer beautiful. I love when he starts to change what he's wearing ... a colorful scarf ... no longer a frump woman. <br /> <br /> It's a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. Unfortunately, this May gives it the confidence of its daughter ... beautiful because she finds herself through a complex matter and decides to move on and finally have her life. I love the courage of nature even to initiate a love affair. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I love the movie because eventually it is a picture that shows the complex nature of relationships, be they family or not. We see the vulnerability of Paula, but he has what he wants at all costs ... (when he tells his mother that he has a child for Darren, does he want him to ask after his mother whether Darren wants even children). The film strikes a sign of how relationships can change, but still shows what has been there, dormant. May has stifled his creativity in raising a family. The family he didn't really want was "something you just did when he was young." I love this scene when Darren calls him an old cake, and he smiles and says, "I've never called it before". It was really a pearl of the movie. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. Well, I just love her. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is it pleasing to the eyes, it is also a true talent. What a pure role. He is much more than any 007, which is certain, and I look forward to playing more of this role. The scene in which she tastes, and the look she gives her, is a miracle that she has such control over this woman and also delighted to give it to her. She enjoys her joy. Great scene. Contrast is Bruce's love. Bruce is fully absorbed with his pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I don't know where my Darren is?
