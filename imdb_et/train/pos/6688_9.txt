In the history of comic films, "Mystery Men" is one of the least valued people. This is not a regular comic superhero movie! This results in the use of a shameful Wannabe crew, including Mr Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and Spider (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" violate a number of superhero films such as "Superman" or "Batman", such as tiny words and questions about secret identity. Most super heroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue collars related to jobs and neurotic lifestyles. Thus, the director Kinka Usher seems to make heroes something the average viewer can associate with. I found that "Mystery Men" is visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it doesn't become a franchise, it's still a pleasure to see!
