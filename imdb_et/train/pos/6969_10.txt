First of all, this is a great series, although we have the James Bond effect. I mean, when the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it's 007's first adventure, chronologically, Dr No (1962) is the second, while the Golden Eye is the first movie with Pierce Brosnani, Judi Dench. as a substitute for the "M" of a new man, so how could he have been a double 0 before Bond, besides being probably 14 years old? It is more or less a "poetic" license for excitement. We need to turn our heads a little aside if we want entertainment. No, the new Star Trek movie doesn't have primitive electronics from the original series almost half a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were fantasy. (now we call them mobile phones) and sliding levers instead of buttons. OMG, do you think 400 years after they've improved Rogain Jean-Luc Picard? Please give some flexibility to manufacturers. If so, where did all the cylinders of the original land come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. Well, what happened when one of the Cyclone ships that flew with the Caprica fleet was fired or there was a sunshine or any ship loaded with human-sensitized Cylons stopped not only through space, but through time, back a thousand or ten thousand years ago exhausted by a ship near one earth. They colonized it, discovered that they could recover and eventually destroy themselves, but not before they sent the "ragtag" fleet to search for the legendary Caprica, but found a habitable but uninhabited planet that they colonized to become people who eventually became invented by Cylons. The Paradox of Times? Of course. What was the first, chicken or tea? Who cares? It's fun entertainment!
