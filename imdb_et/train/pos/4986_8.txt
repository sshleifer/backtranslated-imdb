Lensman is a rather lesser-known Anime pearl from Toho and MK studios. It is based on a loose novel, but reminds me more of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see it, look at it with Japanese subtitles or just plain Japanese. The English dubbed version was almost trimmed and edited to death. <br /> <br /> Not much new, despite being the first animated feature to connect CG graphics to hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch.
