This movie is as good as it is hard to find. The film's hero (and writer and director) is Simon Geist, a man with an agenda. He creates a fake magazine to have the right to interview Los Angeles pigs - actors, models, musicians who believe their own bowel movements don't smell. With smart dialogue, Zucovic can do it. Of course, the budget for this movie was probably what he paid for the used car, but this film is so strong and well written that it works very well. Anyone who returns to "The Scream" by Edward Munk, reflecting silver in a trash at a local coffee house, should be named a certain type of prize. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because they've made the same car since 1986 ... it's called a "car." Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
