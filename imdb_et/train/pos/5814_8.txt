With all the things that come with MJ right now, I've started listening to my music, watching an odd documentary here and there, watching Wiz and watching the Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get an overview of the man I thought was really cool in the eighties, maybe maybe thinking about being guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part of a biography, a feature film I remember in the cinema when it first appeared. Some of them are fine messages about MJ's feelings in the press and the obvious message about drugs is bad m'kay. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive, but of course it's all from Michael Jackson unless you hate it far from MJ anyway and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egoist with the consent of making this film, but MJ and most of his fans would say he did it to fans who are really nice. <br /> <br /> The actual feature of a movie bit, when it finally begins, is only 20 minutes or so, except for Smooth Criminal and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic powerful addiction. Why does he want MJ to be so bad that it is farther away from me. Because MJ heard his plans? Nah, the character of Joe Pesc, that he wanted people to know that this is the one who supplies drugs, etc. so I can't, maybe he just hates MJ's music. <br /> <br /> Many cool things in an MJ like MJ car and robot and the whole Speed ​​Demon sequence. The director must also have a holy patience when it came to filming a child. The bad order, as usual, the leaders hate working with one child, not to mention a whole lot of those who perform a complex dance picture. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one or another level (which I think is the most people). If not, stay away. It's trying to give a healthy message and ironically MJ's best friend in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is really one of the most talented people ever on the planet, but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention I gave to this topic .... hmmm well I don't know because people can be behind closed doors, I know the fact. He is either a very nice but stupid man or one of the most ill liars. I hope he's not the last one.
