For fans of the 1970s, Hammer-type horror films, this film must be gentle. The only thing I didn't like about the film was that the waste of Peter Cushing was the worst. In general, however, it is a safe, spooky little movie. If this is not Amicus's best film, it is definitely one of them. The best, most recently just recorded episode is where Jon Pertwee is a horror actor - it's really great. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it is hard to believe that he no longer did this type of film. All in all, this is an entertaining film that scared me as a child, and which still gives me a slip to this day.
