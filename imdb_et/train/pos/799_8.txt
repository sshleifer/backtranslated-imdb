he is the main narcissist and manipulator; in this case, the lawyer (and the murderer) represents Tom Capano. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Morris is a sympathetic victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but at first the victim is a bit too much. We are sorry for the situation, but at the same time we become disgusted after seeing the fall of several other women (including Rachel Wardi). <br /> <br /> The sad part is where he actually helps his self-esteem Capano actually killed his psychologist. Pretty hard to believe, but it was based on a real story. <br /> <br /> There's a great fire with Olympus Dukakis like Capano's mother. All in all, it is an interesting story because it is based on a real murder, and you want to read Ann's book to get accurate information. 8/10
