First of all, in the defense of JOAN FONTAINE, Ginger Rogers would have been awfully confused with Alyce, a young British lady with a title role. Fontaine makes the heroine's ridiculous picture here, but her inexperienced experience is bad and her dance is better. Fortunately, he went for better things. <br /> <br /> But here are FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN, who get the best bills - and they're great. Burns & Allen fans are surprised at how easily they fit into Astaire's dance routines. Particularly interesting is the big fun house routine that won the choreographer Hermes Pans Oscar. They join Astaire, which must be the most prominent feature of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story about slow paced can't say much or some hidden situations that require a lot of patience. It has to be said that some humor falls slowly and the usual romantic misunderstanding that occurs in every era of Fred Astaire's film is given the usual treatment. Only musical interludes provide the necessary lift for hope. <br /> <br /> Some of the likes of Gershwin appear once for a while, but not all of them get the treatment they deserve. Reginald Gardiner, who is the best, polished comic result as a companion, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (like Joan's father as a gardener by Astaire) brings a nice supportive pain. <br /> <br /> When Burns & Allen reminds us how funny they were on radio and television days. Both of them are surprisingly able to keep Astaire walking. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens ensures that Joan Fontaine's dance number is filmed at a discrete distance with Fred, but smart camera work cannot hide the fact that he is outside his element as a Astaire dance partner, which he feels painfully aware of.
