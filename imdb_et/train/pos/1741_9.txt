It's a dramatic movie in the sense of the word. It tells the tail that we live here in Greece as a routine, without knowing how sad it is. Of course, it is extreme .. but every time and then the real life of sadness transcends art. It is deeply critical of the goals we set and the whole of the social structure built around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek lifestyles, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek movies that have a specific fast-food-mainstream audience, it's not particularly targeted at anyone, but if you look at it, you feel someone has described your feelings with the best words and pictures. I'm not a big fan of traditional music either, but I wouldn't want to hear anything other than playing it during the movie. <br /> <br /> If someone told me I would say this movie, I would define the transition between scenes suddenly or somewhat cut. I think editing was supposed to cut it to fit for 2 hours and for theaters. <br /> <br /> Anyway I can write more and more to express my thoughts about it, but I think you have to see it and discuss it with a friend. Must see
