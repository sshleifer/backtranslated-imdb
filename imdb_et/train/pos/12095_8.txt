When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he turns to the British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a peculiar wager. I do not believe that Poe's claim that all of his horrible stories have been based on real experience accepts Foster's contribution to Po and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood for not spending the night in Blackwood's haunting castle. After Foster has erected an abandoned castle, he discovers that he is not alone, as he is approached by several beautiful women and beautiful men and a metaphysical physician who explains that they are all lost souls to bring down the stories of these events on the anniversary of death. ! The first time I looked at this brilliant classic horror, I was mesmerized all the time. I found the movie really horrible and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undoubtedly beautiful. The music score makes the atmosphere twice terrorist. The Topless scene threw me off because I didn't expect it. It seems that Synapse did a great picture quality because this movie looks a fine fine for its age, and it's a Uncut International version. This is the film that is responsible for me, starting with the collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
