I have wanted to see it for the longest time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite films and in the first ten minutes of this movie, I thought it was a big sequel after that, although it starts to drag. Operation and direction were terrible. In fact, it seemed that everything in the movie was flowing, except for the script. Sometimes the only thing that drew my attention was the fact that Claire Forlani, the most beautiful woman in the world, was cast. This movie was good, but I was expecting more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for the great fire of Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
