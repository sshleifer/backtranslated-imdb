What keeps us - or at least what I feel the writer wanted us to be early with is our desire to know if Martinaud has done dirty action. Of course, the red herring and the twist are so intact. But then we discover that this is the story of Martinaudi's shortcomings and his coping difficulties. When a revelation appears - we begin to understand and regret it because when the story progresses, we think he is a sick, perverted pedophilia that we are going to remember. One of the things he needs to deal with is far from the gap he and his wife have, although they live on the same roof. These problems, of course, have failed in their shocking finals. <br /> <br /> This movie requires your patience and it has certainly tried out those who are troubled by teenagers. They were obviously ridiculous because they are not part of the "central location" movies. Although there is a bit of travel when we reach the forest and the beach. And we understand that Gallien is not as smart as we think he is. <br /> <br /> The incubator is 5/5
