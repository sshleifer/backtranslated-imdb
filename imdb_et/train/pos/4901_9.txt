No message. No symbols. There is no dark lower course. Just music, nostalgia and fun-filled people, obviously a great time. This is a refreshing antidote to some of the unprecedented dumps that the studios have brought out. Of course, it is worth something incomparable to Judi Dench. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz song is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as Ella. It takes place on the shelf of my movie to retrieve it at any time when I feel the need for a warm experience and a cheerful smile. Just a great movie!
