Let me just go to the bottom line here: I have 3 children, aged 5 to 10. I think the trip to the theater is successful if we don't talk about the animals. I've seen most children's collections in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film turns into Oz's wizard, over 18 sexual jokes from El Dorados and a tragic mistake associated with the Rudolph's red note reindeer. I probably remember Nemo from his memory alone. <br /> <br /> What makes me support one of my kids (this varies) who recommend this title for a family movie tonight? In a word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> The moment of silence ... <br /> <br /> *
