I saw it in the movie theater and it impressed me. Again, it was when Claire Danes was a good actor, not a silly, arrogant, Hollywood bitch who she is today. Anyway, this movie really hit me in a raw, more realistic, and more beautiful friendship. How far would you like to go to your best friend? I was finally taken to tears and tear up when I look at it now (myself). I remember as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and called him how much I loved him. This is a great movie to watch with your best girlfriend. But be prepared for almost a definite conversation, where he will turn to you and ask if you would do something to him.
