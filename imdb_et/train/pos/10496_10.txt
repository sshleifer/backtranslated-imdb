Big Actors, Oscar Candidate Actress, Stunning Landscape, Good Strong Story and Laughing When You Can Get My New Handbag (and it's pretty big). This movie was great. It had worked beautifully in more serious scenes and funny moments. .and, lateral cracking. I never heard a cinema audience laughing so much, and tears flowing with my cheeks during a tea shop stone. Well done for the British film industry and Craig Ferguson, whose magical ingredients have made it one of my favorite films, if not all the time.
