I liked this movie, like Hitchcock movies, this is a thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock realized that people are going to the movies to get some time. Something Hollywood has forgotten in recent years. It is a thriller, but it has a lot of laughs and always has one eye on the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Cillian Murphy is more terrible than Batman's beginning. In the old days there were guys who always played bad. We don't see much of these days because I suspect that Hollywood agents consider it a bad career move, but Cillian Murphy is really bad. <br /> <br /> Control is surprisingly stylish. The story is good, but dialogue could have used some drag and drop. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is really a fun movie and people praised when the closing credits started running. If you have a pleasant spiraling thriller, "Red Eye" may be your ticket.
