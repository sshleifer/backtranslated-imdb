This movie is one of the few quality films of the year 2000 and certainly one of the best. The scenario is based on Vladimir Nabokov's novel, and the move to a big screen is absolutely brilliant. Film photography is excellent for both Turturro and Watson. Turturro still gives its best result, which proves that it is worth much more than we thought. Watson also works great. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro), which is also extremely eccentric in its daily lives. The film is presented in a non-linear manner, creating several Luzhin childhoods. They describe the complex nature of Luzhin. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say yet, but recommend this movie to anyone.
