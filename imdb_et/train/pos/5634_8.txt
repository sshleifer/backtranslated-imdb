EXTREMITIES is a worrying but ripping screen version of William Mastriosimone (who customized his game screen) about a woman who is attacking her car in her home country one evening and is scared when she realizes that she got her wallet and knows where he lives. After his roommates leave work the next day, the man comes home and tries to rape him. The story is surprising when a woman turns tables at one point to a man and is able to win her; but if he realizes that attempts to rape cannot be proven and when a man is arrested, he just comes out, he decides to keep him in prison until he gets a testimony. Tucked away? Maybe. Annoying? Certainly, but there is a wonderful claustrophobic feeling about this movie, especially in the midst of a woman and her attacker that you can't help but feel completely part of what's going on. I didn't see Broadway playing, but I imagine that this work works better on stage, but it doesn't make this movie a less damaging experience. Farrah Fawcett, one of the latest actors who made Broadway's role, got Marjorie's role in the film's version and provides powerful and deeply moving performance as a victim who refuses to sacrifice. Many critics found that Fawcett's performance is one-off, but for me, Marjorie is the woman she has ever done, and that performance works for me. James Russo is sluggish and threatening in his career, as he wants to find Marjorie a much bigger challenge than he expected. Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid take part in Marjorie's roommates who come home after Marjorie's resurrection and has been captured and arrived at his fireplace. And this is the arrival of roommates who take the story to an unexpected level because they didn't see what we saw through Marjorie and I think he should call the police and let them handle this man. Not with a weak heart, but if you can hold it, the film experience grabs with the leading power that surprises you.
