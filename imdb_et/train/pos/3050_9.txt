It's just a more fun movie I've seen for a long time. Bad behavior, bad scripting, bad terrain, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself laughing together. <br /> <br /> So it won't win the Oscar, but if you've got beer and friends around, you can't go wrong.
