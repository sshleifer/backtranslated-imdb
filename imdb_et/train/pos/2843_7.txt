If you don't know more than an hour movie, if this movie can give you some changes. What I love is the ongoing surprises. It's not just once if you want to continue one or more short films "New York I Love You". Yes, some short films make you curious, some of them very short, some of them are longer, some are certain, some are not. <br /> <br /> The sad side of the capital. It shows many different backgrounds of citizenship. Many of them make it as sensitive as I once a year to other countries in the capital, where there are many people who came from different countries. This film explores the many things you have known, but all the characters are new things. Maybe some of you have traveled alone abroad to stay for a year or two to feel something new, meet new people; Feeling dreamy, sad, but kind of sad for what you are looking for because it is just what boring that you were in your home. Maybe you want to look at it again, looking at it.
