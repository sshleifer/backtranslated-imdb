Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. I borrowed books from the library library whenever possible. My favorite was "Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a great showcase of Herge's background and her Tintin development. The filmmaker's personal experience of interviewing Herge and his relationship with an artist who was inspired by Chani's character was very touching. <br /> <br /> A very talented and well-loved artist's great documentary. An excellent example of a person who has become internationally recognized and has brought joy to millions of children (and young hearts) all over the world.
