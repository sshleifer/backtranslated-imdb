"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This tremendously entertaining movie takes you from the opening and never ends with laughs, surprises and unexpected moments. It was more fun for me to watch "Matador" than almost any other movie since 2005. It's an unforgettable harsh film that Pierce Brosnan plays perfectly. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is an assistant (hit-man) who specializes in high-tech concerts (assassination of rich dudes). He also experiences something similar to the mid life crisis. After realizing that he has no real friends, no permanent home, or no plan for the future, he gets into a Mexican hotel bar for a night and drives Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Danny is a happy family member who has lost a big deal that can just change things around. He loves his wife dearly, especially that they have lost their son a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> Two men are chalk and cheese, hardly a common cause except they are in the same desert. night. And somehow there is a conversation that sets in motion a chain that changes their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship they make reminded me a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is a straight man and the other is a persistent stupid who gets them in trouble. Interplay is superbly timed and fine tuned, as it is not a small part of Brosnan and Kinnear's amazing performances. <br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake ... This is Brosnani's movie. He prints one of the most memorable and despicable characters of a decade. He could shoot his mother and apologize right after that and probably forgive him. Brosnan can be the ultimate wizard of the cinema, but it is by far the most enjoyable and complete performance. I wouldn't be reluctant to see the Oscar for that role. <br /> <br /> Think of a scene in which she giggled openly at a high school girl with the most pointless thoughts and rows: "All reddish blushy ... No happy fucking. She does it with a familiar bond that laughs and succeeds He'll be able to tell the young boys: "Tell your mother that she will lose 30 pounds and 20 years. In fact, it makes us even more similar. <br /> <br /> But the film will surprise us with some really touching scenes, most of which will end when the film takes unpredictable turns. But when Julian thumbs through her little black book to find someone calling her birthday, or when Danny and her husband (Davis) console in their bedroom tonight, the film comes to the depth of unexpected emotion. <br /> <br /> "Matador" is stylish and energetic. It's always fun. And it includes the determinative role of Brosnan's career as a lonely hit person looking for normality, friendship, and a means to make at least one good thing in his life. This is an unnoticed pearl in 2005 and you need to make an effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br />
