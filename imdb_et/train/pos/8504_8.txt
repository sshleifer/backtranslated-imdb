You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a US secret soldier, a harsh man sent to discover the Nazi secret and to the top of World War II. That means everything from stepping out of the Nazi cave to the blockade of Hitler's war machine and even Fuhrer himself. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most influential game of that time. This is because it is literally inspired. Many games existed at this time and even more did today, but every time you get a real grabber. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before and recently GTA III in 2002. Legions of Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman, and others are fake with their existence ID. Do it directly or mostly indirectly, but they still do it. <br /> <br /> Even with its old look, very outdated graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, games are now limiting with experience) levels and the scope of all six episodes is fun. Especially discovering those secrets that are equipped with treasures, and with them. <br /> <br /> Also: "Stop!" * bang! bang! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never grows old. --- 8/10 <br /> <br /> The PC-13 was voluntarily evaluated for "deep kill". However, it is extraordinary compared to today's games.
