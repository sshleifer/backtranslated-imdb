Maybe some people may consider it a slow movie. But this is the "slow burning" that allows him to deeply influence the viewer. Like this wonderful first scene: first we hear the voices; then we are allowed to see signs; Finally, the camera is slowly put back and sideways, and we see another character, a young man who just sits there, probably not even listening to the conversation, or at least not really caring. The fact that this young man plays a leading role shows the strategy of the film: allowing this character to develop and to determine the surrounding environment, but unmarked points more than necessary. People come and go, flow into and out of their lives. While most of the film follows him (and most supportive symbols are only seen when close to him, defined according to his relationship with him), we are called to believe that we are objective so that the fine is the director.
