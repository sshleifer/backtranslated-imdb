Being Austria, it is a straight knock on my face. Fortunately, I do not live anywhere near this film, but unfortunately it represents everything that the rest of Austria hates the people of Vienna (or people close to that region). And it's very easy to read that it's exactly the intention of the directors: let your head sink into your hands and say, "Oh God, how it is possible!". No, not with me, (in my opinion) a completely exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary, I watch porn, certainly, but in this context I was rather nasty than in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells how misleading people who suffer from lack of education or bad business are trying to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl who is treated by her good-natured boyfriend's whore (and still returns), a female teacher who discovers her masochism, putting her super-cruel "lover" life line, from an old couple with an almost mathematical daily cycle (she is her former husband) official substitute "), a couple who have directly divorced and who have suffered a former husband because of his former wife's actions, apparently having a relationship with her masseuse and eventually a crazy hitchhiker who asks her leaders about the most unusual questions and stretches her nerves, just being very annoying. <br /> <br /> After you have seen it, you feel almost nothing. You are not even shocked, sad, depressed, or feeling anything ... Maybe that's why I gave him 7 points, it made me react like I never did before. If it's good or bad, it's up to you!
