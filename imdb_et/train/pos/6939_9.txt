I was very impressed with this movie. I should appreciate this as one of the best in the West of the classical era. I say for the whole thing: actor, mature dialogue, meaningless story and excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> director Anthony Mann, who made several well-photographed films swirling around the same era, did some as it is. It has the same film-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated with many Western nations during this time. . If you like this movie, I recommend Mann-Stewart's movie "On the River." <br /> <br /> In short, the story of a human being, "Lin McAdam" (Stewart), who owns a prestigious Winchester 73 gun, is a weapon he won in a fair and square race. Then it is stolen and goes to the pit farmers. All these villains are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> The Stewart Prize for this interesting story is Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. But it was a bit of a stretch to see how Rock Hudson plays the Indian ("Young Bull"), but you don't get everything.
