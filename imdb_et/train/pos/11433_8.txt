Despite George Lucas's patronage, this fascinating and completely original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of animation with live-action-cut-out) is about as far away from the usual price a child made on his flowering day at Ralph Bakshi. Brilliantly styled characters such as Ralph (one cluster, abandoned heroes' duo), Synonamess Botch (fun-loving offender) and Rod Rescueman (pompous beginner superhero) breathe life into a uniquely smart concept: Frivoli vs. Murkwood or eternal struggle for dreams and nightmares. In this context, MOR-infused songs from the soundtrack should not work, but somehow. So it's really a pity that I had to look at this uncensored version with a really crapp look (dug from the TV screen)? is also a milder option that highlights the language of VHS release? because the movie is not otherwise available on the DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked under this image.
