I come from a completely different background to Pinjar than most other reviewers posted here. I'm relatively new to Bollywood movies and was born and raised in the US. So I have no general basis for comparing Pinjar with other Indian films. Fortunately, no comparison is needed. <br /> <br /> Pinjar is in itself something other than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one row, I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important films that comes out of any studio at any time. On a scale of mass appeal, this * could have been the "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" Indian equivalent when promoted in the US. It would have been a very good movie that put Bollywood on an American map. The American film-making public has a long-standing love relationship with Gone With the Wind, and although Pinjar does not take out a loan from this plot, there are some transient similarities. At least that's 183 minutes of driving time according to US standards. <br /> <br /> The Indian and Pakistani bulkheads of 1947-48 sharp backgrounds are a delightful human drama. a woman who was imprisoned by facts and pulled into worries she didn't have. By putting it in a permanent position, he can somehow not only survive but grow - and even flourish. <br /> <br /> If there is no story in any way, it will be on display. Puro's (main character) growth as a person would be better illustrated - at least for western audiences who do not know Indian culture - if his character's "back story" was more thoroughly developed at the beginning of the film. But it would have stretched the 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or even more. Because not one minute of the film has been wasted and none of the things that gave up this change would really be cut off in time. It is better that the audience has to fill in some of the things that came before leaving out any remnants. <br /> <br /> I could use a lot of words to describe Pinjar: "frightening", "disturbing", "weighty" "Heartbeat" comes to mind right away. But "resurrection" is probably surprising than any of them. These are any story that points to the inducibility of the human spirit against the worst coefficients. And Puro's triumph - although it may not be obvious to the people around him - is no less inspiring. The story alone cannot recommend this film very well. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Urmila Matondkar's idea of ​​Puros is inspiring. Too often, younger, younger actors are forgotten, Urmila has the unique ability to offer a completely reliable character in any role he plays. He's not just a part of Puro, he breathes the character of life. Manoj Bajpai was chosen as inspired by Rashid. He controls something too little for Indian movie heroes: fineness. His speech and nuance are important for this role. He brings more threat to the early part of the film when his penetrating foam is combined with all sword winners. <br /> <br /> If you only see one Bollywood movie in your life, make it Pinjar.
