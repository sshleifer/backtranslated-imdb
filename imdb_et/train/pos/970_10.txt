Now I have seen a lot of movies in my day, but there is very little choice for each individual, which has really been good for me. And I'm a 19-year-old man who's directed to a younger audience. This is a very underrated pearl for those who watch foreign films. Almost all the actors are believable, the graphics are decent (for which you don't have to take care of the movie. Trust that cutting the graphics would be a stupid thing), the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not just kids. <br /> <br /> Here is basically what this movie did. It made me laugh ... a lot, two, made me feel like you probably, and three, it's a very exaggerating story. At the end of this movie you feel good. Of course, which anime there hasn't been shown by some young boy who has become a great warrior and anything to win some big evil. This is a formula that is used a lot. But in this case, it is forgiving because, although they use dolls for some characters, and some of the average graphics you see 5 years ago, it's not possible to evaluate its appearance. It's very touching, the end is original and it keeps you in that movie as it is. However, if you try to compare it with other movies, such as "Endless Story" or whatever it is that will diversify your opinion. Look at it the way it is, and you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I'm impressed. The only other film where I felt this feeling was when I saw TMNT back when it came out. There's something about this movie that I felt about TMNT that really loved me. So don't look over or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
