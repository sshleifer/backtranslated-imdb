The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick woman, the risk of death of fans, the deadly publisher and the guilt of his mentally ill father. Although these subjects had a significant impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were great. Finally, we saw Doyle's head in the way he created Holmes and why he had to kill Holme. Participants are great. Including the intriguing Selden, played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, an important role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell's role model. Locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera's work is great. If the first 50 minutes had been so good for the last 40 minutes, it would have been a small masterpiece.
