The series were short topics originally shown in theaters with a feature film related to the pulp press. They are called "chapter presentations", which they were expanded into moving movies, divided into several segments called "chapters" or "episodes". Each chapter is viewed in the same theater for one week. The series ends with a cliff, because the hero and the heroine would find themselves in the most dangerous situation in which they cannot escape. <br /> <br /> Viewers should come back next week to find out how the hero and heroine flee and fight the villain again. Serials were especially popular among children and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, typical Saturday films included at least one series with animated films, newspapers and two feature films. The golden age of the Serials was 1936-1945. It was one of the best of the era. <br /> <br /> Zorro is seen in many films, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was great in this role. <br /> <br /> Action is continuous and we are guided by chapters to the end where we find the identity of the criminal. <br /> <br /> Zorro wins as he always does.
