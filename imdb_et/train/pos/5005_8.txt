Under the belt, such as Wallace & Gromit and Chicken Run, are good people who are on the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, introducing us a bit of twisted humor in "Creature Comforts." <br /> <br /> Due to early career advancements, Creature Comforts is a living story that shows where parts of the conversation are removed from their context and given to some animals. br /> <br /> Aardman Animation went across the country to interview people with safe issues like "Are you a liar?" and then speed things up a bit by asking about your sex life. <br /> <br /> Answers that seem to be boring and everyday are really funny when you realize that dialogues are first and animals will be added later <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like a publisher? One character discussing the woman she is looking for, "I like them thin." is an insect, a walking stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs who speak of smells and smells, but sniff on the trees when they talk about the different scents of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in the cage. Because the "woman" tells the litters that her health is her long-term husband, who says something, saying something. <br /> <br /> While "Creature Comforts" may take time to find "feet", it should find a place on TV for those who are tired of the usual. While there is more to reality shows than Carter's liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is unique and certainly worth a look. <br /> <br /> Some humor may seem a little racy, a claymation that catches the attention of children (like the old Batman series in the 60's, jokes are small enough, kids don't get them) and it's jokes that are adult available.
