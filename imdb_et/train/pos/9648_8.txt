I really liked this movie. The story jumps quite back and is not easy to follow. The story is by no means a resolution, and you are left wondering what actually happened. Because I like this movie, I enjoyed it. I especially like "dating" scenes between boys and me. And, of course, every movie with a naked Staphane Rideau gets a few extra points. ;-)
