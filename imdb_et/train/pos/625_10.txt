This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow. <br /> <br /> It's rare that I'm surprised, but it's probably the biggest fantasy movie I've ever seen, maybe even the best movie ever, and it's all the fault of Neil Gaiman. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could have sucked in a wonderful dialogue that was smart, smooth, and made characters can completely believe. <br /> <br /> I could watch the days, Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is Brilliant like Yvaine and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie deeply into Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The pure joy of humor who was able to laugh at our loud funny, intelligent enough to make the first Shrek similar to the 80s, and fits perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would be a great movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects were almost perfect, t Rue it was not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they used it, they were just what they called, not too much to repel you from the movie and mix the story perfectly. <br /> <br /> Then there's that story? What can I say. How often do you come across a story that contains all the classic components of fairy-tale formulas that don't just knock on another cheap Princess Bride. At the same time, it can be familiar and comfortable but at the same time completely new and refreshing. <br /> <br /> All these things would have made this a good movie that would make it a great movie, but they are pale compared to the rich enchanting world that these elements fit well. Once again, Neil Gaiman has done this, he has led another dagger into his heart, creating a fantasy world that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost everything to live in it and give it just a glance at it. I didn't want it to end, I wanted to suck through the vortex to Stormhold's land and meet personally with Tristan and Yvaine, travel with its fields and valleys, walk through their marketplaces and meet its inhabitants both dangerous and friendly and stay forever. Feeling I've noticed when Gaiman, Sandman, the American gods have read something, Coraline left me with deep sorrow when I finished reading it because it was over, I didn't see anything He had created such worlds that seemed so viable and more alive than what I am forced to live and see that Stardus was not different. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm sure Neil's writing and this movie don't have the same effect on everyone, but trust me when I say you don't regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it's just one of the five best from the movie I've ever seen, and I can guarantee that anyone at least with the soul at least likes it.
