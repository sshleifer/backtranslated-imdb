My father, Dr Gordon Warner (retor Major, USA Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his foot to Japan and also got a naval cross. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that my father was a technical advisor to this film and I hope he had an impact on the film so it would be like it really was, as I read in a number of comments written by this film, which seemed real life. My father is a fan of facts and figures, and always wanted things to be viewed as they were, so I would like to believe he has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> She is currently living in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically, she's a Japanese), and a few years ago, one of Japan's emperors was awarded one of the highest honors for her contributions and activities. Iaido brought back to Japan because McArthur banned them after World War II. <br /> <br /> My father was once at sea, but I know that when you're at sea, you're always at sea. This is exactly what he is and I love him and I respect him very much. <br /> <br /> I would like to watch this movie if someone has a copy of it. And I'd like to give it to my dad on his 94th birthday this year!
