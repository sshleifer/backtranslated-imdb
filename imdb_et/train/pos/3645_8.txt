A subtle story of watching your dreams and actually attacking them when you accidentally hit. There was nothing simple for Morris - he had a family, a job, jobs elsewhere, a mortgage, and so on. It was not as if he could just drop what he did, and hoped to win the AAA ball for 4 months. It took courage. I am pleased that they showed their indecision, almost resurrected, that they were making calls to major companies. <br /> <br /> I remember he saw he was against a red Sox (I think ...), a great story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or Mills Watson than Quaid - that's okay. Quaid does a very good job of playing a man, a teacher, a coach and an oldest rookie .... Like someone in the same age group, I can definitely identify my situation. You are not too old to do what you have dreamed of as a child, but it goes there. You must do it earlier than a lator. <br /> <br /> Really, nicely edited, paced, acted, good to see the familiar faces of Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work everywhere, a joy to see it hit. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who thought that Tampa Devil Rays would have been such a good theme movie early?
