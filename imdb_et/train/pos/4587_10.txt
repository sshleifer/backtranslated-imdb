While John Woo is hard-boiled is my number 1 favorite movie. But I have to say that the police story is my 2nd favorite movie. I say this because the stunts, struggles and action that my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps out of the rail at the top of the mall grabs a ball surrounded by Chrismas lights and slides down through the skylight and finally lands on my back with hard marble on the floor. OUCH! Buy it at amazon.com 14:98. (Or something for $ 14.) VHS's new line video. please answer any questions or comments please. (I'm only 14, but I know where you can find any movie you made.) If you are looking for a movie everywhere and can't find it, please answer me. Thank you and good night!
