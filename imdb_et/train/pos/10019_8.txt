When it comes to movies, I can be quite picky and I complain about something and everything that has been wrong. Although each film has its own drawbacks, the Night Listener was extremely low. <br /> <br /> If you read the last review (it was difficult because half of it was written with a cap and it didn't contain actual information about the movie), you may have believed that this movie wasn't too good. Unfortunately, if you read more than three lines in the same review, you discovered the cause of the generation on the poster: he doesn't like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes a crack ... probably). br /> <br /> So, despite the fact that I've never reviewed the review before, I thought this film deserved its attributes, not its director's sexual orientation. Go to the quick checklist: 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I'm not giving it away, but the plot is very convincing and certainly not what to expect from ads. It's a thriller, not a horror, and it should be treated as such. The story really amazes you, all the more so because it is true (and the plot remained loyal to actual events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful acting? Oh yes. Robin Williams has long broke comedy chains and has since flourished in serious roles that many people would have written ten years ago. He will play his role as a listener at night again in high form, playing a radio network that is increasingly disturbed and grabbed ... well, I'll let you see. <br /> <br /> 3. Great direction? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster I referred to, I know something about the direction. I've been training the school for 3 years now. Of course, I do not believe that it makes a difference (the only thing that is important if you like the direction), but I thought I should just reaffirm that I support my opinions here both important and relevant ... for example : not the director's sexual orientation (or the alleged production habits of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> The direction of Patrick Stettner was moody and dark, and he promised corners and lighting to help create the desired tension and release feelings like filthy, fast work and fast cutting, which we are so often subject to today. Some people can really show you the story through your camera, while others feel they have to play with the camera. I really appreciate if someone these days has the courage to simply use the camera when using it, which is like an eyeball through which we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, Cinematography, and Editing? Great everywhere. I've already written so much, and I can go on to the next three things for ten more points, so I just pack it up. <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie. Don't listen to people with unchangeable motives, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly discover this motif on their 1/4 path. Enjoy the show! -Ben
