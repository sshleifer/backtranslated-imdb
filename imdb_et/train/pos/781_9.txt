"Crush" examines female friendship, mostly avoiding saccharin quality, which violates so many movies on the same subject (eg "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it shows the power of sudden passion to surprise and surprise. The events described were very unlikely, but the basic emotional truth seemed very real to me. It's not a movie about speed-vehicle and explosion, but adult women will definitely respond to both laughter and tears.
