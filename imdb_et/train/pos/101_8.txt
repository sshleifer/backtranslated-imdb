IMDb lists it for some reason in 1972, but other sources I've seen, including excellent program notes, mark it as '68. It is not really important, except that it is quite interesting to look at this abstract film and video collage (one of the first works of art to unite the two apparently) in the context of the Star Gate sequence published in the same year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and with the extremely saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feelings of the highly saturated optics of Rohrschach's blots, birds, etc. It certainly helped pave the way for many other emerging video players in the 1970s and deserves to be better known.
