"Casomai" is a masterful story that represents the story of a young couple who marry in twilight waters. The story is very plausible to say a strange vision between the visions and the constant interference of other people, which is quite typical in Italy (maybe asking if such events are different elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing and one of the strongest aspects of the film. Stephen Stefan Rocca and Fabio Volo are sober and engaging. The sympathetic priest's figure is funny and round. All in all, it is really worth the film, which is probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
