Horse Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary follows the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surfer films, Dana Brown's endless summer, Bruce Brown, Dana's son, and Step's offspring Endless Summer II (IMAX). I saw the first, not the other. While surfing material is remarkable, I most appreciated the filmmaker's historical perspective. He brings us back a hundred years ago to the origins of sport and shows how it has become. This includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers, how surfboard designs evolved over time, which Hawaii and California beaches were most often world-class surfers, and which incredible adrenaline rushed them. Athletes lived on the beach for several months, surfed from dawn to sunset, walked in primitive bunkers, fished for food and returned to their table the next day. What euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /> <br /> We see how the media discovered and promoted sport after a slow start. What was the biggest momentum in sports? Believe it or not, it was a film by Gidget, although I suspect that copyright issues can prevent the crediting of Beachboys' surfing songs, such as Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing the magazine and the Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there was such a tome) mentioned their contribution. We also see the comments of the pioneers of sports, their families, and how the initiators of the 1960s benefited from the present generation. One such story is how 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, who held today's greatest surfer associated with a previous surfer, introduced her to her single mother with whom she married before she became a father. <br /> <br /> The song includes the musical background of modern music of all ages. Am I your appetite? Wonderful. There's a big ride.
