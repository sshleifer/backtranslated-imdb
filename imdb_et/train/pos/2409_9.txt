This film has problems with the presentation, may even be offensive to people looking for time and cultural loyalty, but it challenges the observer to think about several issues. One of them is the nature and nature of the relationship between Jesus and Judah. The second is the historical nature of the Bible and religion. And the third is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ-betrayal relationship is developed and maintained through the film. The passion of Judas is darker parallel to that of Christ. If Judas lives his life, the viewer may feel angry. Peter's denial and guilt, though moving, is not as vigorously depicted as Judah's drama. Chris Sarandon offers novel and provocative Christ, whether it is credible or not. I'd like to find this movie from a DVD or even a VHS to use in learning or discussion groups.
