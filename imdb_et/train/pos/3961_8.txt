This is the magnum opus of the Swedish king, Mats-Helge Olson. Seldom has a movie of this size in Sweden and it is one of the most amazing achievements in Swedish film. Who pays for it? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to hurt Sweden. But his plans are destroying the Russian army, who kidnaps him and tells him he has arrived in Sweden. This trick is their way of seeing Markov continue his work on nuclear physics, which makes the planet's energy supply ground-breaking. The CIA, however, is left to get Markov to the west and send his ninja to release him. <br /> <br /> The Swedish-speaking practice of Swedish actors is something Mats-Helge has improved in his later works. The cheap b-movie feeling it poses is likely to be unbalanced. But besides that? Well, this action is the usual direct video style. Machine guns burning big smoke clouds. Thousands of Russians die. People running around with a black ninja costume trying to hide snow. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is obvious that fighting scenes are choreographed. If they say that I'm looking for martial arts in the title of "Ninja", I look forward to a close fight. But in this movie there may be two or three real martial arts scenes. And they're fun. It's so bad that I don't have words to describe it. When the ninjas move slower, their hearts would stop. And, of course, the whole movie's bang ends, showing a budget of special effects consisting of four food labels and a McDonald's coupon. <br /> <br /> What's the decision? Of course the classic classic. Never has a movie ever been designed to be consumed with a huge amount of alcohol. This is the ultimate semi-film. Insert video and laugh. One just has to realize that such movies are no longer done. This is the history of the film. <br /> <br /> That's why the rating is 8/10, quality 1/10 and accents are 10/10.
