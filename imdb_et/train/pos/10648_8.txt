What can I say is not said "Haunting"? It has everything that makes a great picture. The amazing kits, the fickle music and the sound that die are all in place. The scenario sometimes breaks the mind in such a strange, surreal way. The whole team must forget to read it, perhaps because they were too busy, creating cg effects and building gothic kits to note how small the plot is. All cast members give a worthy result, though little convinced of the handy material. Lili Taylor has the most work, while others respond to her most. But that's it. All I can say is that it was enjoyable for two hours, but you definitely want more. Much more.
