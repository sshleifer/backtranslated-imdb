First of all, I met the "My Friend's Friend" by accident one or two years ago when TV surfing took place. Before that, I would never have watched any Korean films throughout my life, so the MTF was really the first Korean film I ever watched. And what a delightful surprise! I was very amused from start to finish and I had a great time to laugh. Its comic style is quite different from the Hong Kong comic films (which I am used to throughout my life and thus tired), breathing fresh air into my scam experience. I thought there were quite a few scenes and tricks in the MTF that were pretty fun, clever and original. <br /> <br /> I looked at the MTF a couple of days ago and I had looked at it once, a surprise / comic effect to me. It has not had any negative impact on my opinion of the film. Instead, this time something else came - this led me - a story about how two young, seemingly "enemy" who are completely in conflict, thrown away and how they gradually solve their differences and start to care for each other without feeling the feelings remind me long gone high school days. For me, your Wan and Ji Hoon are actually compatible, because they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them, a quality that distinguishes them from people like to say, Ji Hoon sassy girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two different parts - the first part deals with fighting between Wan and Ji Hoon and is more violent and faster. After Ji Hoon passes her final exam and Su Wan dances (Ji Hoon's) provocative dance, things start to change. Speed ​​slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes she cares more about your Wan than she could ever imagine. So part 2 deals with the development of mutual feelings, which, of course, leads to a happy ending, accompanied by a final show with the gang leader. <br /> <br /> Only one last comment. I find this a bit unbelievable - the fact that a 21-year-old self-proclaimed "bad boy" felt embarrassed to be almost naked with the girl he bullies and loses his "cool". . strange. I think it shows that Ji Hoon is just a boy who is clean and doesn't really have his appearance. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) is a sexy body and perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on the list of all ten favorite films.
