Neil Simon's best games. Charming, harsh ex-Vaudeville stars played by Walter Matthau and George Burns are special television comedy. The problem is that they haven't even seen each other for ten years. Full of zippi one lining and inside showbiz jokes, this story flies with constant humor. Good work is also with Richard Benjamin, the sister's nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as the sister, and Howard Hesseman as the head of teleshopping. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear on their own. Trivia Note: Opening installation includes Hollywood Revue 1929 footage and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie's Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards, and Brox Sisters Singing.
