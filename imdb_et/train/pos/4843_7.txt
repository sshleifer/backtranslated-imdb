In fact, this is one of the movies you should give to 7.5. The fact is; as has already been said, it is a lot of fun. Wonderful atmosphere. Indeed, Askey has come across as it is up, but it's a great vehicle for him, as well as Mr Porter's Willi hay. If you like old dark house movies and trains, this is definitely for you. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, this movie is what you want to see over and over again. It is friendly and charming, being in a pleasant way with all the nostalgic references that put high war prices. "Strange" characters just play each other as they do in many other typical British war movies. It would have been nice to see this movie if it were recorded in Ealing's studio. It is a real pity that the original 1931 is not untouched
