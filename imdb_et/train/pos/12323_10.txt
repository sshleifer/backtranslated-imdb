It's the best Chinese film I've ever seen, and I think it's a lot better than a hero or a Chrouching tiger, a hidden dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that it all succeeds in everything! <br /> <br /> This movie will definitely make my top 5 and should be enjoyable for every movie lover. The sequences have a traditional unrealistic jump and even fly, but the way it shot differs from Hero's style and flying always looks good and usually even makes sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, you won't regret it . 10/10
