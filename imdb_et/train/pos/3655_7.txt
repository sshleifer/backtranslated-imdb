De Sica is becoming one of my favorite leaders, but it was amazing for me. Happy idiotic youth becomes the leader of the community of illegal settlers in an abandoned area outside Milan. This is a detailed and sparkling story of innocent bad masses, with evil capitalists and triggering happy police forces, but slowly developing into a magical fantasy story because the boy does not know that Toto is developing unlimited superhero capabilities. I still had it with a constantly smiling Toto in 10 minutes, and when the magic took over, I got dust. There were so many wonderfully orchestrated shots, so many of the settlers had many good signs that I thought it was waste. The association of neorealism and fantasy is a "look-me-ka-ka-egg" -type experiment rather than a fully developed work / art.
