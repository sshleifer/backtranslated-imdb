To be honest, I waited for cars in this movie. Only one was, but besides, the Freeway was a great movie that I am happy to have on a DVD. The only truly big names cast are HOMICIDE's Richard Belzer as a radio psychiatrist and B-Movie villain par-excellance Billy Drago as a revelation quotation from Freeway Killer. The remaining majority generally give good results. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave his character, Sunny, a little guts. He could have been a helpless victim, but he is completely rounded when he searches for Drag with the bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russo, I'm afraid to come over from wood, but then again, he's playing, Frank, is not very well developed except the story of Sunny is given by his former commander-in-chief. The risk factor lies perfectly throughout the film, and the lonely LA motorway at night, where he kills his unhappy gray sedan, is a great way to build tension and the music used to highlight the film is appropriately composed. I don't know why there are those people who hate this movie. I think different people make different strokes. But I enjoyed the "Freeway" absolutely and I can highly recommend it.
