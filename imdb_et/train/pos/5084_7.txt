I was surprised that 'The Secret Fury' was an enjoyable good movie ...... Probably because I had no expectations of this movie ..... Although the movie has its own holes in the plot ..... I'd say you couldn't guess who was behind the scheme until the end of the movie ..... First I thought it was Robert Ryan using the same method as '' Gaslight '', where a man tries to get his wife mad, but I was wrong ...... The main problem with the film is that they drive in the other direction, which didn't give any clues at first. ..... I thought Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert wore their parts well ...... Plus, Vivian Vance, a fine character actress who steals scenes in this ...... Those who like movies, this keeps you away, likes it ......
