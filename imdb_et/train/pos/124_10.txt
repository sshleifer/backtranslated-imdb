* Includes a spoiler because I need to describe some film methods so read it at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. Using some toning on some scenes makes it obvious like an old photo. I also enjoyed projecting people on the back screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and is predicted behind him rather than a typical split screen. His face is big and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses is when young boys kill Ravenstein on the train, a scene shot on almost a political poster, near the face. It reminded me of the battleship Potemkin, this intense continuous style with a red spray to deliver many horrors without much gore. The same as in the scene when Katharina finds her father's dead bath ... you only see red water on the side. This is one of the things I love about Von Trier, his undervalued horror, which makes it even more horrible. <br /> <br /> The use of a movie in the text was unique, as was Leo's character as a werewolf. I've never seen anything like this in the movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this movie was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Uncle Leo. This brings out the snippers that got my role in the kingdom (Riget.) This humor makes the drawing of absurd anal retention by train drivers against amazing WW2 and all the chaos that is easier to take. It reminds me of Rig how the hospital administrator tries to maintain normality at the end of the first part when everything goes crazy. This shows that some people are really overlooked by the terrible things around them. However, some people, like Leo, are tuned, but do not do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> Max von Sydow's well-made voice is also fun. It pulls you into the story and makes you jump on Leo's head, which is a scary place at times. <br /> <br /> The film highlights the point that one is coward if they do not choose a party. I see the same idea used by the dancer in the dark, where the Bjork character does not speak for himself and ends with his own destruction. In fact Von Trier seemed to be at one time against women by Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his male characters are not good either! I found myself in the same place at the end of the dancer if you really wanted the main character to rethink your activities, but of course they never do!
