Originally created by Dudley Moore's solo car "Not only ... But also" saw his former Beyond Fringe collaborator Peter Cook's guests at the first show and so well received by BBC-2 chief processor. to stay there every week. They were a classic comedy team - Cook was tall, nice and witty, while Dudley was short, charismatic and musically talented. The sketch that brought the house down was in a pub with flat hats and mufflers, imagining movies like Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It remains one of the most fun scores all the time and even if Cook's bodies still keep it well. <br /> <br /> These characters - the idiot Pete and even the bigger idiot Dud - found their way into every episode. the exhibition is right, in a different place, such as a zoo or art gallery. In the last munched they artworks discussing sandwiches. "This is Leonardo DaVinci's comic book ... I don't see jokes!", Says Dud. Pete points out that when it was first opened, she probably had people. Dud almost went over to his repast. "You really enjoy these sandwiches!" The couple collided with their humor against each other in a way that was cheerful. The drawings themselves set new standards for comedy that would not fit before Monty Python's arrival. <br /> <br /> As the exhibition's popularity increased, the quality of the guest stars. For example, Peter Sellers and John Lennon, who filmed a feature based on his poem "Kurt Ted, Danoota, & Me". "One foot too little" - was Dud as "George Spigott" (the name that was later used in the movie "Bedazzled"), a one-legged man who is drunk at the film producer Cook's office "Tarzan". Cook tries to let him do as well as possible. "I'm nothing against your right foot!", He says. "The problem is - or you!" <br /> <br /> Dud would sometimes interview eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling (Cook), who, if he hadn't taught underwater flights, was planning to open a restaurant called "Frog & The Peach". Another classic was "The Leaping Nuns" (also "Bedazzled"). But my all-time favorite must be "Superthunderstingcar", a maliciously funny (and accurate) parody of "Thunderbirds" by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. Pete and Dud played all roles, the latter making a pulling "Lady Penelope". "Ludwig" was Ludwig Van Beethoven's star "This is Tom Jones" style show exhibition. "The Immortal Bargo" was a secret documentary about the life of "Emma Bargo". With an unforgettable moment, he traveled through London, worshiping through the loudspeaker: "I want to be alone!". <br /> <br /> The 3rd season feature was "Poet Cornered", such as Ronnie Barker, Spike Milligan Barry Humphries, Willie Rushton, and others hanging in a tank tank. All of them had to improvise the poetry, and anyone who didn't make it into a rhyme ended up in disgusting things. <br /> <br /> Three seasons were all made (at different times) by Joe McGrath, Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Unfortunately, very few publications remain. Worse still, the scripts were destroyed. This gives the belief that this situation was allowed. <br /> <br /> The exhibition ended in 1970. Comics hit Broadway, notorious "Derek & Clive" tapes, but Cook's ever-increasing alcoholism created them. Eight years later, Cook announced that the new series was attacking, but turned out to be a suggestion. His former partner made films in America, and he did not intend to work with Cook (not at that time). <br /> <br /> Sufficient film footage was covered for BBC-2 repetitions in the early 90s. As expected, there were few topics for others as well as others. Cook died in 1995 and, as a tribute, B.B.C made various "Parkinson" interviews and "Not only ... but also" the show program. It ended up with Pete and Dud in the sky. "Bloody Hell!" Shouted the last one. Moore went on in 2002.
