Not after Simpsons made this debut, there has been a sitcom that I didn't want to change in 2 minutes. Of course, it has been said that the Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not that, though. <br /> <br /> The first season was that teen characters were not as cruel as they later changed. Sometimes they went to school. The following seasons are out of the way. Eric, the sarcastic twit, Donna, his flat girlfriend, Kelso, the Twilight, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and the anti-agency bank, Fez, the perverted exchange student and finally Jackie, the corrupted rich floating. As for the adult characters, Eric's mother was "can you believe she is so rude" in the suburb's mother, Eric's father, a straight arrow, which of course was not as hard as he seemed, Donna's rude father and his dumb blonde mother. Everyone knows their character, but special praise to Kurtwood Smith, who finds the perfect balance of strength and still for the fact that his red Forman is quite sympathetic without having to cut it unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace is, of course, the main reason why this show is so good. This is a harsh character to play because it doesn't allow the actor to allow a natural movement like Kelso's character, played by Ashton Kutcher competently. I liked the two characters communicating because they are the most diverse. although I say that the writers came to him according to an excellent story during the last few seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by Family Guy's voice artist Mila Kunis, is fun and has a nail plate type voice that really fits her character. The only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with him and Eric because they were fun together. Too many stories were wasted on his communication problems, because we already got it with the spades of Eric and Donna. Some favorites: Fez 'humongous girlfriend in the middle of the seasons, Pastor Dan, a totally fantastic Leo, played by equally fantastic Thomas Chong, the second of Fez's girlfriends, who is a fully certified and special look, served by the Sabrina teenage witch slutty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Go ahead with Fox, no matter what.
