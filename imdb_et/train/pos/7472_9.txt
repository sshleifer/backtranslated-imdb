I liked this movie. I have read some other comments, and although I am sorry for not understanding this, I agree with some criticism. What makes the strange way even more so for such a movie. I agree that they have been pretty cast into the public for rediscovering an intelligent movie, but it has so many levels and is still nice to watch. I also love movies that provoke so many discussions, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext. Congratulations to Mr.Crowet, definitely on my Top Ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. Saw saw it when it first returned to Mexico, it was late at night and I had to go back to the hotel and I had a big paranoia trip! Where does the dream end and the real start?
