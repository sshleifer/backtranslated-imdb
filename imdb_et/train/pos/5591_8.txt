The alternative title of Ecstasy is the Symphony of Love; A title that appropriately describes the mood and feeling of the film. Ecstasy is an early chatroom, and it could have been a very classic film when it was released in the silent film era. This film is a visual treatment and a deliberate pace so that the viewer can enjoy his sensual lyrical quality, which is in the artistic low key fashion. The director's style is clearly Europe. The theme and approach of sexuality was much more complicated than what was brought to Hollywood at that time. Think of the censorship code of the 30s in the US that it is pretty much. Hedy Lamarr, one of the greatest beauty of the era, was a great choice for this "Symphony of Love".
