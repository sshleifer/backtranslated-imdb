This year's best animated contests are surprised by the Oscar. It's an Irish movie from the heart, but it was produced by Belgium and Brazil together, I think the animators work in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films of the latest memories. The character is somewhat reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis a few years ago, in very simple characters with thick black lines. This movie is not black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie great is to use that color, just some of the freshest and most amazing colors I've seen. The overall design of the images is also much more geometric, with characters essentially rectangular or oval. Much of the movie can be played to find a circle - the main aspect of visual design is the circle in the middle of the picture. All of these geometric shapes have a purpose - the story is a young boy studying to be artists working in illuminated manuscripts (The Book of Clocks is a real enlightened Bible; the art of the film is based on its drawings). The story of the movie is not very deep, but it is a pretty good story. Brendan is a young boy in Kell, in the cities surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to hold the Vikings. Koke's new brother, Brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to illustrate. He also inspires him to do things such as the departure of Kells and the study of nearby forest, where the nymph lives. Bruno Coulais offers a fantastic score that is almost as good as Coralini, which I consider the best of the year.
