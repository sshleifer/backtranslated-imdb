DAVID TOMLINSON FOLLOWING (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie, I was 4 years old and I had this story of witches in World War II. The scene that impressed me most was the struggle between Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was extraordinary to see this army without a body walk to fight the surprised song. This movie is fantastic, from a trip to Portobello Road (which made me the most fantastic place in London) a trip to Naboomboon. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. He is always great, it seems that the great aunt of his family and David with his always surprised face is his great co-owner. we miss him a lot.
