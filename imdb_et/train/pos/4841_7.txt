In colonies, we are not all familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this movie (which had a recent TCM preview) due to the negative comments about his appearance in "Ghost Train" - which I had been expecting thoroughly annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to hear a laugh. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing refer to what you get when Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen have a child. He's not comparing it to Bud Abbott or any of the other comic drawers that appear in movies of this genre. In addition, it may be felt 30 years later that Askey unites the British with comedy; at least from the American point of view, it is clear that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than any of his colleagues here. As for the rest of the movie - the more movies you have seen, the more likely you are to end, but it is still quite fun and atmospheric and you should wait for its next look.
