This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo plays Anna Christie again, but all other characters have different versions in English. Both were filmed back because Garbo was like that in Germany. Garbo himself preferred his version of Anna Christie in the English version. This is a good story and a black vision for Garbo fans.
