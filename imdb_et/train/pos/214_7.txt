The old Vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the best known, but they broke each other in hate. Over 20 years later, they agree to come together with the TV ... but find they still hate each other. Willy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) is trying to work with them. <br /> <br /> A big hit on her day and she won the George Burns Oscar for the best supporting actor. I liked it (somewhat). It's written by Neil Simon so it's a one-time liner. Some of it was funny, but Willy and Ali's oldest jokes were NOT. I also didn't like Matthau. I've never thought he was a good actor and something about him rubbed me wrong. His character is so gentle that you get sick of him quickly. All this next was fun. Burns is just a big trolley, easily and no Matthau fit with him. Their verbal battles are the best sequences of the film. Benjamin is also very good when Willy's nephew tries to work with each other. For me, only Burns is worth seeing. This leap started his career in a great way and two years later he was hit by "Oh God". So, that's good. Just good - not big. Matthau's character makes this love difficult. I'll give her 7.
