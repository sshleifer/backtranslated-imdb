This story has worked beautifully. It's so sad and warm from the heart when a young daughter's journey finds out where she's coming from and where she goes. His mother's best friend took Stephanie after his mother and father were killed in a car accident and since being labeled as a "wonderful child", he is dyslexic and lives a little harshly. His findings affect people around them. His relationship with his former guardian and his guardian's ex-boyfriend is treated very delicately and sensitively, and the whole supporting cast is genuine, three-dimensional and plausible. It is located in a warm, delicate and erotic film around a peach preservation plant in the small town of Australia. After reading some of Hugo Weaving's rather low comment, I would like to add that I think he was perfectly cast and extremely sexy. No, he's not Brad Pitt, but that doesn't mean he's not attractive.
