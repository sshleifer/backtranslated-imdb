Tom Hanks has been in such scenes as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. Most of his roles have been good guys we rejoice. On his way to the road, his character, Michael Sullivan, is a little different. <br /> <br /> Sam Mendes's "Make Perdition", based on Max Allan Collins' graphical novel, shows his story about a man and his son. During the Great Depression in Chicago. What this little journey is different is that Sullivan has been hit by a man who is now trying his former partner. His commander or ex-boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him more than his own son, Sullivan's partner Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After the wrong work done by Connor, Sullivan and his son, who didn't have to be there, witnessed his mistake. This is how Connor tries to take Sullivan and his family out, but only gets Peter and his wife. Sullivan threatens to hit and rush home to find Michael Jr. His wife and child died on Sullivan's answers. <br /> <br /> The story is followed by two when Sullivan tries to do things for his wife and child and for Michael, who feels like he is all guilty of it. He feels that his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a terrible job like Michael Jr. It brings with it the maturity and also the feeling of the minor. The disappearance of his innocence was good when he drove from town to town, leaving behind him. This film didn't work as well in Oscars as he won one prize for the best cinematic art, but still had five music, sound and best performances in Paul Newman's supporting role. This picture is a great story that takes you along the Midwest and Mike Sullivan's legitimate: husband, hit man and dedicated father. This movie is a sleeping film that has to be seen for years.
