Recap: This is a business as usual at Louche Casino in Tangier. The casino closes and prepares a big deal the next day. Owner Louche and some employees leave for the night, leaving Modesty accountable. Suddenly the armed gangsters of the casino are rushing to shoot. It is not known to Modest that they have already killed Louche and are now in custody for hidden money. However, there is no one in the casino and still not in life who knows the code needed to open the deposit. The ship itself is trapped by explosives, so the attackers cannot explode the door. Suddenly, Modesty faces the gangster leader Miklos, who is playing with his roulette at risk. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is an overview that is in no way related to other published media by Modesty Blaise, as I have not seen or read it. The first point I would like to make is that it is classified somewhat incorrectly. Above all, I thought it was a thriller whose main plot was between Modesty and Michael. Of course, there are some activities, but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the main plot and main stop is Modesty and Miklos. This is an innovative and intriguing way of exposing a character's background, and doing so much less than the casino much earlier. Someone said it was almost like a TV series pilot and a feeling that it could really be used as such. But I felt that it was a much better way to introduce the character than many others have done. I was in no way disappointed by the lack of action, but I enjoyed this game, history much more than just an action film. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau did very well. Staden, in particular, depicts Modesty very well and indeed carries this solid and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
