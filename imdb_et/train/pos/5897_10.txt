This movie must be put on a DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, really cute and funny. Not realistic, but not supposed. The only thing I didn't like was that the girl relied too much on a man. However, it represents the mindset of the time period. I've been trying to get this movie for so long and it's not available in the United States only in the UK and it doesn't play on US DVD players. This is unfortunately a classic movie reviewed! Believe it or not, this movie can easily become a cult favorite at any age. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could save small countries or ourselves. Lindy is a painless, positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons. He's funny and charming. He stole the show!
