Long film from South Africa, a very important character, Stephen Biko. He is one of those black people who did not live in apartheid, who actually died long before their normal time. The old film, however, does not show how important Biko was, which he actually represented. His life and teaching are reduced little, at best some witty remarks. The film was from 1987 onwards, with the aim of lifting South Africa beyond its boundary, leading to its release. Thus, the purpose of the film is to show the irrationality of apartheid supporters in South Africa in 1987. To show this, the film has to look beyond Biko's death, so focus on its discourse, not Bikole, but on a white liberal journalist and his absurd absurd system in which he lives. His escape is necessary due to the victim's sacrifice with his family, and because he wants to publish his first book about Biko after his death, and this can only happen in England. The film shows how to escape from South Africa, while apartheid is still and kills. So don't wait for it to be realistic and true. It can't be. However, the film is immensely obsolete because it does not show South Africa any historical distance, the distancing that takes place during the presidency of Nelson Mandela, called forgiveness, when those who want to be forgiven speak up and out. The film is strong and emotional, but this very historic border makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Panegative books or films have all this drawback: they look at the person they should represent from only one perspective. This explains why the film is so obsolete, it seems to come from as long ago as something changed. Remake is necessary. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
