Thanks to Warner's archive, I can see again this mammoth that throws everything apart from the kitchen sink. (The bath is still there.) This film gives time to all the people who were at the time signing the contract with the winners. When some artists seem to be familiar with it, it is because they were quiet in the days of great and mostly faded talk popularity. There are also truly remarkable artists in the Vaudeville era. You are most impressed by Winnie Lightner, who fills two numbers. There is also a French star Irene Bordon who loves lyrics in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the biggest highlighted two bands, Technicolor's "Chinese Fantasy", has been restored for this version. It is truly beautiful and stands for Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is a massive "Lady Luck" final that lasts almost a quarter of an hour. This is a truly early talk time epic. Any old movie buff loves it.
