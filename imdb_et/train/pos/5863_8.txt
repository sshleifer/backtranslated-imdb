Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" came too late and was not superfluous. This is one of the few who are trying to deal with the Second Saddle of War: time after. Unlike films such as "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo", which use their main characters to present themselves as heroes in a bad post-war era, this film allows the audience to meet differently from Vietnamese veterinarians. Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but there is always love and friendship in all this tragedy. "Jacknife" may be a quieter Vietnamese film, but after almost 15 years it is truly credible and legitimate. What's more, it may believe us that the war is not over; at least some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro has done his best job, but Ed Harris is the star of this movie. It may have been his best result ever.
