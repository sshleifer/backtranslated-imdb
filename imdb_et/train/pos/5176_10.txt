Must see a movie for anyone who ever went to camp or wanted. This film reflects the absolute nature of the summer camp. It's funny, it's compassionate that you want to see more characters from the characters when credit starts to play. If you haven't seen this movie ... what are you doing? get off your ass and run a video store. Good summer :)
