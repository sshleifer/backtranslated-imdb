I love this movie !!! Purple Rain came out when I was born, and it's been my heart because I remember. The prince is so tight in this movie. I went to the special show of Purple Rain last night and it was like a concert where I was happy to see some real fans, which is why this film is so underestimated, it's really one of the biggest films of all time. Music is intact. The theme of the movie is "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in town and his eyes are Apollonia, an ambitious singer. There is no doubt why purple is my favorite color for which I thank "Kid". So if you haven't seen it, you'll have to asap. It's classic - four!
