Separately invited to play a general revolution from Russia. But he's not an ordinary extra. He is Serguis Alexander, a former Russian commander-in-chief, who is now forced to revive the same scene he had suffered for a professional and personal tragedy to satisfy a director who was once a revolutionist in Russia and was humiliated by Alexander. Now it may be time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate battle. This is one of the powerful films that have the exact direction of Von Sternberg, giving Alexander the greatest irony of every opportunity. Jannings deserves his Oscar role as a very mobile performer who played at his top and in his deepest valley. Powell lends the support of sin because the vengeance leader and Brent are perfect in his face and movements, showing Jannings' love. The whole shine. Assessment, 10.
