Mr. Lincoln is the first film / director co-star of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember Fonda years ago that he was a young actor, playing with Abraham Lincoln and scared that he wasn't living up to the challenges. <br /> <br /> John Ford, before shooting, will relieve him by saying that he is not going to play the Big Emancipator, but just a jack-legged prairie attorney. It was solved by the Fonda who led John Ford to the classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not Lincoln's biography. It had come earlier with Walter Huston and a year later, Young Lincoln, Raymond Massey made Robert Sherwood Abe in Lincoln, Illinois. However, Massey remains the final Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda's great Emancipator didn't play as a small town attorney in Illinois. The film covers about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him in a general store, receiving some of the legal books of the family of immigrant pioneers, whose journey he later retraces. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with early death, leaving Lincoln the most melancholic. <br /> <br /> Lincoln is now a practicing lawyer who will announce. He made a few concepts in the law, but he is back in private practice, which is not really sure if the policy is for him. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the activities take place. The two sons of this family, to whom he got the right back for the books when they were charged with murder. He offers to protect them. And not an ordinary murder, but one sheriff's deputy. The process itself is a fiction, but the game used to protect Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, which played these two sons, is based on the actual case of Lincoln defending. I'm not saying any more. <br /> <br /> The great strength of Mr Lincoln, apart from performances, is how John Ford captures the atmosphere and atmosphere of a small Illinois prairie town. July Celebration. It's almost like you look at the newspaper. And it was the country's own, young, lively and growing mood. <br /> <br /> The fans of John Ford's films recognize two musical themes that were repeated later in the movies. Fonda and Pauline Moore, who played Ann Rutledge, at the beginning of a romantic interlude, have the same background in the music used in Vera Miles' male freedom. And during the dance, Lovely Susan Brown dances that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver, who play Mary Todd, are the same as Fonda dancing with Cathy Downs on her Darling Clementine tomb to grow the Tombstone Church. <br /> <br /> Lincoln is a favorite theme for biographers and dramatists for two reasons. The first is the lively embodiment of our own American mythology, which concerns people who, through their own efforts, rise up from power. In fact, Young Lincoln shows a very graphic background of Lincoln. And secondly, that he was our president during the greatest crisis of American history and that he made an exceptionally good and moral decision with free slaves during the civil war, although for some necessary political reasons. His murder confirmed his place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Foundation and others, I have also mentioned special praise to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond. Bond's head prosecutor. Also Donald Meek as a prosecutor's attorney and Alice Brady, which turned out to be his last film as a pioneer of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice presentation by Spencer Charters, who specializes in painters as a judge. <br /> <br /> For a movie that captures drama and romance at this time, you can't do better than Young Mr Lincoln.
