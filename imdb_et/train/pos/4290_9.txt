I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I don't understand why some people say he's not. Boring .... ??? Perhaps the one who said he was bored because he is bored. She is a great actor and the film was great. It has many great ideas and very good performers. The direction was great. I imagine myself in a French environment with all the complexities and perfumes, flowers, churches, problems, etc. When a sister goes to the store, it's just amazing. Everything is great. We have a very good actor, wonderful, long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like her more than her next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau did a great job. <br /> <br /> Ana
