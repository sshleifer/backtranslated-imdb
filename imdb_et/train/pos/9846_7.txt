Ok, at first it seemed like "Shrek" - a lonely one who consistently follows a comic relief. Then it will be truly convincing when set in the lap. The result is an enjoyable film that has moments with which I agree that children are a bit of a watch (for example, Manny's past). The premise has obviously worked for a long time so that they can successfully make films that have almost no different set (only ice caps and rocks) and three characters. It is good to know that they can do something emotional about it. As I said, it can sometimes tear, so children are warned. The real decline is animation. It was not as souped as toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. People are unrealistic and we've seen better CGI examples in the past. But don't let this disc predict: if the "ice age" alone is commendable. And it collects many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with this little mouse are priceless and steal.
