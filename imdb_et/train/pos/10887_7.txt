Shooting a horror movie and things are not going well. It's masked for the killer. The director speaks to the killer and the team. He goes crazy and kills two people. He killed himself and the film was never finished. Twelve years later, a number of film students decide to try it - but they are curses. People who try and finish it will be killed themselves. Pupils ignore it. Guess what happens next? <br /> <br /> The plot is an old hat, but it's not bad ... for what it is (low budget movie). It is well done with young and quite talented youngsters. No one is big, but no one is terrible. Mandatory (and unnecessary) female nude scenes are also avoided. It moves fast, gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't offend your intelligence. Also, Molly Ringwald is in this lifetime where she plays with a wilted, faded actor. <br /> <br /> No big shakes, but no bad ones. I'll give her 7.
