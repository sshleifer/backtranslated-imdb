This film is worthy of visual beauty and movement with each other, but is also an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and performers (both concentrated in the supporting role of transvestite opera stars) are both doomed to downstream roles in China. This makes the unlikely link between the older street performer and the young girl even stronger than the native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this movie was that the soundtrack tends to swell the emotions that have become unnecessary due to the forces of the participants. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to sovereignty for unsatisfied films.
