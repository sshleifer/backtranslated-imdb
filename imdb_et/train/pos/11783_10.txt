Rock Star: INXS was the best music series I ever watched! It had one of the greatest ever written rock n 'roll songs performed by 15 very talented singers / performers. It was also (in my opinion) the most heart-sensitive, feeling-good, surprise-full reality on TV. That's fortunate to win tears! During the 13 weeks of this television contest, the audience got to know and met all the competitors. After the 30-year episodes, the rest of the contestants seemed to be friends rather than just a few strangers competing with each other in the reality TV show. And the fact that INXS was and is still one of the biggest rock n 'roll-ensembles EVER, just added the emotional tension that this series of wonderful reality has created. If you don't have a series, ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is a great alternative.
