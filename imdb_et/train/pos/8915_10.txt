The BLOB is a great horror film, not only because it is a vividly horrible image of an almost unstoppable, meat-soluble title, but because it contains a real social message. This is a "sensitive good horror film" in many ways. The clever story is helpful with immeasurably all the cast solid performances. Two romantic interfaces Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsau bring surprising depths and sentimentality to the proceedings. They are misunderstood but very well understood by young people, and it is very easy to root them. <br /> <br /> This is a societal film that juvenile delinquents pose problems primarily with boredom, not with some malicious character flaws. Steve McQueen's rival rival seems almost to be the enemy at the beginning of the procedure, but quickly joins McQueen's campaign to save the city from the escaping intruder when he sees McQueen's seriousness. In this way, the situation of symbols, which initially appears to be a caricature, suddenly deep and human reality. <br /> <br /> The authorities' initial skepticism about the natural claims of children has turned out to be wrong - and if the threat is All recognize that all conflicts in society will disappear. Harmonizing this goal and validating "worrying" teenagers will become formal when Aneta Corsaut's father breaks down to get Blob's fire extinguishers. On the second day, the school's entry into a juvenile offender is considered to be a typical act of vandalism - that is the day that the adult body is required to act. At this turning point, it is clear that there is no division line between the young and the old. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film because it recognizes the "generation gap" perception, but suggests it is more imaginative than real, and because of the real crisis, people naturally have a band together to restore order. "The Blob" is the perfect tonic for a depression that is usually accompanied by a view of "The Dead Night of Life" (1968). <br /> <br /> The movie is cheap but innovative is a lot done. and Effective!) Visual Effects. They are undeniably clever. Many of the tricks of the gravity we see as Blob's accomplishment were achieved with miniature sets for rotation. The camera was usually fixed to the equipment in a very "locked" position (the lights had to be attached in a similar manner so that the lighting remained so and the room was unchanged). These scenes were often photographed in one frame when the space was slowly turned - the silicone pulled out very slowly and had to be accelerated. In some ways, it was similar to stopping motion photography, but using a silicone bot rather than an articulated doll. Even today, the effects are amazing and odd. <br /> <br /> A very good movie with an exploitably audible title, BLOB is a must-have.
