Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", the transformation of Sergio Leone by Kurosawa "Yojimbo" (recommended by the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> It's a strictly B-film; it is quite enjoyable. the direction is sharp, working perfect, the limitations of this "direct video" photography are well handled. <br /> <br /> The film's weakness in a catastrophic decision to marry a so-called. '/' yojimbo 'plot for Leone's "Once upon a West" sub-item. Although Leone drew both "Fistful" and "West", the motives behind his two films could no longer be different. "Man with No Name" (Eastwood) is a cross-border social road with soft spots for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with her own broken family and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not be much related to each other. To put them together, Gun Crazy must spin and aggravate this plot until we lose what we actually follow. <br /> <br /> But it's a B movie, and full of action and stupidity; it's fun at this level, just don't expect anything more.
