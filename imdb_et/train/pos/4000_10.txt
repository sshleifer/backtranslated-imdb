Wow. You saw it last night and I'm still talking about how good it was. Every character felt so real (though most of them were small, selfish ** holes) and a strange story - the middle-aged widow begins to make her daughter's brilliant boyfriend - absolutely convincing. Top performances all around, but hugs Anne Reid and our friends in the bottom of Daniel Craig (the latter is like David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And director Roger Michell? It's as far from Notting Hill as possible. God thanks. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
