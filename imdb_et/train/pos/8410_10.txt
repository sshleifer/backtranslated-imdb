In this really exciting, dark movie, the young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, on the contrary, the devil takes his mirror image (this is done very well in film and gently, when Balduin, a student is practicing a sword game in front of a mirror), a visual metaphor of "a warrior with himself" about its near future. The student enjoys his money, but his beloved wife is inaccessible (he has made a devil covenant, he has been cut off forever from love and other soul riches) that can be loved, or you can change your soul for money, you have neither. Balduin worships his double (the intertitles express it beautifully as it works. Some scenes are unbelievable, the fact that the devil disappears with Balduin's mirror image is amazing as it feels his pact has forever interrupted him from the human society (the scene in which he owns He is driving away from the double and reaches the "wasteland" in the city, is no longer a human being (he has lost his soul), he is like a human society outside the yacht. There are so many other things about this incredible movie that Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director, my cultural hero This helps, if you know a little about German history at the time of making this film and the German doppelganger tradition (don't google it, get the right book) Remember, this is a very early film, it is sometimes cumbersome, but considering what he must say and it is a tragic finale, it is one of the best (yes it) is!)
