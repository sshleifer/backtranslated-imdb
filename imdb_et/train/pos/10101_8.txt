Dominion tank police are practicing controversial movies. The story of four parts combines pointless activity, humor with humor, touching humanity and thinking that provokes philosophical issues. It's hard to believe that only one director, because the style becomes an episode of an episode. Must see a movie for anyone who likes anime.
