Invisible Ray is a great show for both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugos. Karloff pulls the flawless result of a flawless and controversial scientist who seems to have his scientific achievements before his relationship with others, even his wife. His already lonely personality becomes paranoic with intolerance. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays a perfect professional who is passionate about his work, but still finds time to maintain good conditions with everyone, but still seems to be a true close friend. It was one of his few roles as a good boy and he plays it very well. However, it is hard to hear his accent and I believe he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie was that it was all based on "junk science", but in some ways even junk science does it well. Since ideas and ideas are completely idiotic, they are "as relevant" as they were when the movie was made. And they are as far reaching as ever. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice movie to watch over and over. I saw it 5 times a weekend and I can sit it five more times. Operation is wonderful and science is fun. I highly recommend it.
