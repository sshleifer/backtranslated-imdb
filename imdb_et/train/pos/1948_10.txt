This is a great end to the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway was able to make a double switch in Borg, was great. The fact that he promised to be infected by infecting the Queen with a "poison", which essentially ended with Borg, was great. The way they ended up left some, not many, again in the reunion movie. But they brought them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic! It was sad to say that part of my family is good. Ending with Tom and B'Lanna, who have a child as they enter the Alpha quad. was a great way to show a new start. It would be nice to have some sort of reunion to see where their characters are today.
