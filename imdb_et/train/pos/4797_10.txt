I've always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to the critics that he has the talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside the surreal aura he has known in the last decade. As far as the movie is G-rated, it is pure Lynch style, amazing and tone. The film moves masterfully at a hypnotic pace and is full of scenes of genuine emotions and power. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is terrible, as expected from Lynch's film, and the transition sequences are breathtaking. It is also very refreshing to see a movie where characters are all friendly, kind people and not motivated characters that are clearly labeled "good" or "evil". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns to the beautiful Sissy Spacek, his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton plays a small but extremely important role. <br /> <br /> With this film, David Lynch proved to be a critically acclaimed movie maker, as he did in the '80s Blue Blue and The Elephant Man. Critics seemed to lose faith in the last decade after having produced such surreal films as "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway", but with this film he showed that there is a method FWWM and LH, and it seems that the critics finally created their recent film "Mulholland Drive", given that it is highly commendable, and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> 'Straight Story' is one of the most moving moving movies I have. you've ever seen. It is a loving story about family, friendship and the goodness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.
