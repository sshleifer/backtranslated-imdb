Words are not serious enough to convey the emotional power of this film; it is one of the most painful you will ever see, but the end is one of the most loving, gentle and emotionally satisfying that you could count on. Each actor is in every role a terrible, especially wise and undervalued Jamie Lee Curtis, a tightly wounded and tempting move by Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce's heart, which should have been paid to him for every award. (He is Danny Peary's Best Actresses of Alternative Oscars in 1988.) The last half-hour is limited by the melodrama, but the film serves all of its tears - and if you're not made of stone, a lot of them.
