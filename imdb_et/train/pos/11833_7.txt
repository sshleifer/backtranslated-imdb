White Man + Progress + Industrialization = BAD. The first nations + nature + animals = good. Simple formula. In fact, in the past days, the same propaganda was used to protect the status quo; it is now being used to attack. But when I say that, I think the film can overcome the politicization of hackneyed, because it plays the subjects of freedom and original nature in a way that everyone likes. You may not have a review of the film's robbery about how the West was defeated. But everyone can feel the desire to ride freely on western plains. (The film also says that there were no horses in America until the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of animation - especially the open game - is incredible.
