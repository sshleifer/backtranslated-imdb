Wow! I loved this movie and LOVE Judy Marte !! This girl is not just a fantastic beautiful face, she is funny and really very talented !! He made me laugh several times just by being very naturally tough with Victor, who desperately hit him! In the coming years, we will see him a lot ... and probably also director Peter Solletti and co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Victor Vargas Raising is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, nice, funny, well filmed, it got everything: good story, good actors, good movie direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow paced, real life, urban imagery, like maybe Jersey Girl Kevin Smith, you love Victor Vargasi! It's better!
