Despite budget constraints, this is an excellent film that proves that effort and imagination can overcome lack of money. Opening, where cave paintings show that some dinosaurs lived at least to the age of people, is a nice red herring. Then the meteor comes under the lake and causes heat, which in turn causes the frozen dinosaur to be hatched (maybe cave paintings are not the first time such a thing happened). When a prehistoric beast emerges, it is a well-animated Plesiosaur, which soon leads to disappearance in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a real entertainment for monster movie fans.
