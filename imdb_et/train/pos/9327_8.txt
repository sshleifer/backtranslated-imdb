I write it after seeing Perfect Son at the 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When their father dies, two foreign brothers meet at the funeral and after they discover that their brothers are dying of AIDS, they enter the heart of a warming-up reconciliation. Both leaders are doing an excellent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that comes between them as the film progresses. However, I have one feature about the film - although the brother who dies is ill, he doesn't look at it. 0 A person with T4 cells would look quite sick - not even to work to make the actor sick. Small handle, but it makes it a little less realistic. Despite having one small handle, the perfect son is a great movie and you should be able to see it. I hope the DVD will be released in the near future!
