I was intrigued by the title, so I stayed in a little sleeplessness (what was inspired by my curiosity ...), and I stayed with it. Then I checked my TV shows and watched it again! There is one very obvious understanding of what happened to me when I saw this movie - regardless of politics, traditions, culture, etc., Teenagers are almost the same everywhere. The characters from Belgrade could have been transported, say that somewhere in the American Midwest during the same period of time, and disregarding the differences in language, it would be impossible to tell the local teenagers of this age. They certainly showed the same growing pains and worries, politics aside: music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music ... In fact, there are many things that took their time in the 1970s in Southern California. It was a bittersweet story, but the joy of young people made it very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were also completely believable. I'm not saying it was "America Graffiti" in Yugoslavia, but I say it fits nicely with other 50-member movies.
