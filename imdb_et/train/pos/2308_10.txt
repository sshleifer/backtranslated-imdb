I checked this film as an impulse while browsing the store and could no longer be pleasantly surprised! My mother and I watched this movie together and enjoyed it thoroughly. It is not a typical "chick-flick" with a nice love story and tears, but it certainly touches the nerve end. This is the end where, although unexpected and tragic, it does not damage the overall effect of the film. I think Reese Witherspoon was a big movie, even in this movie, her debut, and it's definitely worth it! I did not know many supportive participants, but they all fulfill their important support roles. "Man of the Moon" is such a plausible story of a young teenager who falls in love for the first time. Most women can definitely relate to everything - from Witherspoon's words, his subtle eyes and his not so subtle emotions (like a normal teenage girl). Though he is confused by love, he is not as stupid and immature as many films have been appreciated today.
