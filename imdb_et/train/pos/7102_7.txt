Other reviewers think it's a terrible movie. It's just not true and little unfair. <br /> <br /> Operation is good quality and the direction is moving smoothly. I don't think there would be anything wrong with knitting stories with the Tarantino-esquire way. Maybe it's just a new tool for drivers to try. I thought it made the movie much more interesting. Maybe some elements of the script need to be tightened, but this is the only mistake I find. Nestor Cantillana gives Sylvio an excellent result, and Antonella Rios is also worthy of stunning and value assessment.
