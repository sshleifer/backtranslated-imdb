Some people would say that this particular film smells ... but hey! Thats not right, not right al ... The film may not have the best special effects and may not have the best actors (except Barbari Broside exclusive). Despite these smaller facts, I can say that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen em al!
