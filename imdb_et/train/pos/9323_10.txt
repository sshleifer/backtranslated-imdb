For me, this film was powerful. I don't want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend a year ago; we were like brothers. This movie brought back some vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I couldn't vote against a movie that would have been 10. I got a message like "No votes are placed ..." And I saw the statistics that was there. Try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> The small bugs I forgot. That was the relationship between the characters that got me. Beautiful and real situations. I've been in some of them. <br /> <br /> Little pearl from the movie. Just like "Spring Forward" is another overlooked gem. I am very glad that such films have still been made; people-to-people relationships that are well written, sensitively open to first-rate behavior and direction. After all, isn't that what it is all about?
