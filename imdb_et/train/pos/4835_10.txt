It is a story of the inhabitants of the village of Siberia from the beginning of the 20th century to the 60s. It is passion and feelings, a Russian soul and very romantic. This film is NOT packed, it flows slowly. In the second part you can find great songs - Russian romances. It's much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and made Runaway Train for example.
