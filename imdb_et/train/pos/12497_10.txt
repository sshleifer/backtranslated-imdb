If you haven't already seen this movie in Mary-Kate and Ashley, I can say, "What are you waiting for!?". This is another terrible and wonderful film by brotherly twins we all know and love so much! It's fun, romantic, exciting and completely breathable (scenic)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main landscapes anyway! Would any real fan want it in any other way? Of course not! Anyway; this is a great movie in every sense, so if you haven't seen it yet, you have to! I mean right now! What are you waiting for? I promise you won't be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
