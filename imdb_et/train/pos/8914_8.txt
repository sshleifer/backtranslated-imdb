I grew up in Royersford, Pa. In the city where Jerry's market was. I remember going to my family to watch filming. I remember a man showing a "Blob" in a bucket for me and my brothers. I would also like to share that my mother was in the movie. Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsaut and she was sick one night and they saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some of the shots. They paid him $ 25.00 and told him to tell him until he died last August. My mother was not a teenager and she was a few months after her little sister was born.
