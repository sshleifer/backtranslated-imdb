one of the best low budget movies from Germany! is it the dark side of the new era? If you believe in esoteric, don't look at this movie! it blows all your positive fantasies away. this film shows that besides the peaceful facade of the spiritual soul there are extreme violations and terror. I hope there will soon be a 35mm copy! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, making movies with a few euros! I'm looking forward to another hit!
