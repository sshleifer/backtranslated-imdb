This is a truly remarkable achievement in cinematography. From the very beginning, I totally tried (true) story when Prince Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) crying out for the autopsy of child care residues. This is the enchanting story of Andrei Chikatilo, perfectly played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and compassionately that the viewer will almost regret him until we remember what he is. Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, a psychiatrist who was perfectly played by Max Von Sydow, was completely believable in every detail, and the point he makes in paranoia in the Soviet Union is too obvious the behavior of the local Communist Commissioner Bondarchuk in Joss Ackland. For me, however, was a remarkable performance from Donald Sutherland, proving once again the great character of the actor. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had been so attentive and admired his work. This film puts the silence of the lambs in silence and on the dark Soviet landscape, to all the participating performances. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie 10/10
