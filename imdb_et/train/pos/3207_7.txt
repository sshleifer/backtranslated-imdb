Of course, according to any standard film criticism, a soldier is really a very bad film. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super-soldier who has been killed since birth, but since then he has become obsolete after being haunted by a truly super-soldier who looks like a gladiator race without crash mats. <br /> <br /> On abandoned spamplanes, he is a friendly naffa-hippie community who teaches him about horticulture, family life, and umbrella. Kurt doesn't talk much. Ultimately, super-soldiers will come up and kill the hippies by shooting them back when they run away. Kurt is angry and kills everyone. The planet gets together. End. <br /> <br /> If the Academy does not start a new category "Best Explosion", the soldier does not intend to win any prizes. But as ridiculous as it is, it remains an enjoyable experience. Military hardware is the coolest because foreigners (especially APC) and after 90 minutes do not exceed the greeting. Please note that the sign below is only a guide. Tap five points if you intend to take it seriously and one more if you don't like miniguns. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
