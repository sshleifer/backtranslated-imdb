I'm not a writer or critic ... I'm just a student who has seen this movie a few minutes ago ... AND I want to thank the people who worked on this movie! most ... but it touched my heart ... why would i want to understand it myself ... it's easy and accessible ... this is a movie that makes a good day feel good without regret the time it takes to watch it ! It's about love and caring, the life we ​​have, but we leave it sometimes because of material things ....... Look at all the time we have, but we miss it. ... why do we do that we have to live like dying ... we care about every second and remember: when we do good things, good things come back to us! And this is a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in !!!! Thank you very much for your movie and sorry for your mistakes (English is my second language) ...
