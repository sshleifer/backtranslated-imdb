The uncompromising impression of the 21st century in the suburbs of Vienna, mixing the six-character group of former documentary filmmaker U.Seidl, is a provocative, minimalist and intense watch. <br /> <br /> Following the spread of the whole world, the reality of Big Brother shows that Hundstage is taking the voyeur of modern voyage to an unpleasant and profound level. A difficult and pleasant, but indecent, European art cinema may seem cruel and poor, but succeeds in conveying the sense of modern society alienated from nihilism in a praiseworthy way. <br /> <br /> For world cinema lovers.
