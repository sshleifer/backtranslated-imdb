I loved this mini-series. Tara Fitzgerald did an amazing job of depicting Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman who hides her mysterious past with her son. Like an Anglophile who loves romance ... this movie was just my cup and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape to England in the 19th century. I must also mention that Toby Stephens, who is a very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is a good reason to look at this wonderful production.
