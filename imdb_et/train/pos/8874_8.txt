Higher education is the face of those who have been too long in the closet, regardless of the ethnic background. this is a topic that most of us want to ignore, but we cannot afford to have a real progressive change in the way we can embrace and understand diversity. the question is that ignorance prevails at the highest level in the world and many continue to dominate our society. all the participants in this film have done a good job showing what steps need to be taken to stop making movies like higher learning.sure it seems like a pipe dream, but we have to start somewhere and it helps.
