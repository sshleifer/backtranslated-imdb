"Days" is a typical family drama with little catch - you have to tie the character in any way so that you truly appreciate this example. <br /> <br /> [Possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show] <br /> <br /> Of course, this exhibition is for all the people who have seen the show, Cooper Day, who is the middle child of the family. She saves her days with her family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer from her day. Her family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister and a genius boy. The first episode that sounds a little stupid because John Scott Shepard has caused this situation - both sister and mother get pregnant. This is the first situation a writer will hit. Then his father left the law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The average child can fight the sister's boyfriend. It's all in one day. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this exhibition. I do not know. It's a bit messy, but I like it. First of all, I thought the camera was ripoff, but then I used it and I liked it. I liked the quiet conversation in the dark. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked the actor. I admire this story. Then I find that I want the second season of the days. I started slowly as a fan of this, because the 6th episode ended up in ABC. It's really a good show and it's not like OC. These two have nothing in common. So I hope the fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can be associated with either Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you will like this show. Much.
