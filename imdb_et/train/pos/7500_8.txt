If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is fun, then Disappointed AL is not disappointed. This rare mockumentary does not only include Yanković's most memorable videos ("like a surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road"), but they are interconnected with funny vignettes, which allegedly raise the parody of fame. Yankovic is not for every taste, but his humor is safe and imaginative enough that even non-fans are at least lightly entertained. Heavy fans love it not only for its content, but also for the early exploration of nearly three decades of Yanković's career. Suitable for all ages, kiddies will definitely love funny faces.
