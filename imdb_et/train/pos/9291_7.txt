An interesting look at Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne, as America's first consulate in Japan, arrives in accordance with the agreements resulting from Perry's diplomatic diplomacy. He's not welcome. Wayne finally wins his meeting with Shogun after he controls the cholera epidemic introduced by the American ship. This is followed by a colorful procession of gifts to the capital of Shogun, including the Old Tanglefoot bottle. Meeting with Shogun, discussions with Japanese noblemen, and murder at an archery show an interesting picture of the period's politics. All in all, it's a pretty nice movie and besides how often you can see the Duke, losing half the boy's fight.
