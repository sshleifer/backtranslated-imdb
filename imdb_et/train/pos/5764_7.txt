I was watching this movie originally on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and burst it. I believe I called it "sad" and "turkey". Okay, most of the standards are still turkey. It has almost no value for the production, which little plot has almost no sense and the operation is at the level of the third class game. This means that it has really grown over the years as a classic in the camp. In fact, all films by director Todd Sheets have had this effect. They are almost the same as Ed Wood: watch them over and over again and pick out flubbed lines, continuity bugs (same zombie, two different locations!) And other bugs. <br /> <br /> Say it: the leaves are a very nice boy, and although this one of his first productions is not so big he's better. And I have to add that the only real actor / actor in the movie is Kasey Rousch, although I can be biased because I went to school with him.
