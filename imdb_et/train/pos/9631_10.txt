LAUREL & HARDY comedy short. The boys will sweep the chimneys at home by Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who has just refined his rejuvenation serum. Stan & Ollie continue their DIRTY WORK by spreading the destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the professor wants to try his new drink ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The end is a bit steep, but a big part of the stroke leading to it is terrible. Particularly good is Stan & Ollie's testing competition in the opposite direction of the chimney. This is Professor Lucien Littlefield.
