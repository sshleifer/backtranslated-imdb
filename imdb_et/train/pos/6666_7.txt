I can't say that this film deserves some of the amount of vitriol accumulated by some reviewers. Yes, it is stuck with excessively cushioned working time, stuck in editing, and excessive dependence on the special effects of the cheese ball. And it doesn't have much energy the comedy needs to make your average audience sit through it without checking your watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is also some ridiculous funny lines, gifted and serious and classic underwear. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are great as the "core" and Garofalo and Studi do great work by adding conflict and diversity to the team. I can't say that Reubens or Mitchell added a lot to the movie, although everyone had some chance to shine. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the plot is your classic "underdog-good-good". No surprises, because you know they're triumphant. What makes it valuable is not absurd, devil heroes and villains, but a dialogue and interaction between characters. Underneath it, these people are heartily children who just want to do the right thing. The best scenes in the movie give this film its emotional foundation. Look at Asaria's relationship with her long-suffering mother; Macy has loved innocence if she doesn't want to take Cap. Amazing secret identity; Stiller rage (unlike one weird, dirty child you ever knew, who is always forced to tremble, playing with impotent rages); Garofalo's desire to get his father. This childish conviction that the feeling of justice and goodness always makes the world a better place is a real appeal to super-hero comics; and under the appearance of this parody, "Mystery Men" shows us why these hackneyed comic books are so important to so many. Subplots (Romance, Family, Team Conflicts, etc.), but the main plot is the fun fun it does. The fact that it should be good, meaningless fun, seems to have disappeared from some of the reviewers here, so I'm warning: if you're a type of viewer who thinks he enjoys a itchy and scratching comic that has been destroyed by inexplicable and illogical (" Do I believe this is some kind of ... * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone? "), You are too literal and humorous for this movie. Move the sandpaper instead of the movie. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
