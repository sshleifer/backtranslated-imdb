"Stanley and Iris" show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, this is a struggle for literacy and realizing its potential. For Iris, the courage to love again after becoming widowed. The beauty of the movie is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, starting and ending, before everyone has the skills and the courage to trust and move forward with each other. In this sense, it gives us a very good overview of how life is often, so it is plausible. Unlike other evaluators, I found that all characters are consistent for the entire image. Supporting casting is also carefully selected and adds the depth of character that the main characters add to the presentations. All in all, great movie. The best thing I do about it is Hope.
