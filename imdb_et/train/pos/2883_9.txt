"Cinderella" is a film about a young girl whose mother died and her father married again. When his father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very important to her and made her all household-related households, such as cleaning her after her two evil sisters. One day, the king sent all the individual women a message that they would participate in the honor of their son to find a woman. Of course the Cinderella did not get away, but her steps did. Cinderella was very upset and thought she couldn't somehow participate in the royal ball until her fairy tale appeared. So she did something magic and made a Cinderella a beautiful woman, but she had to be back at midnight because it is when magic turns back. During the royal ball, Cinderella loses time and clock at midnight so she runs out of the palace and loses the glass ash. Then the king commanded the Duke to find women who wore this slipper. Duke was looking for every house, but finally found the women to whom it belonged, Cinderella. magic fairy tale. At the beginning of the film, Cinderella was a member of her family and had no love for her, but a little bit of magic changed her life and finally found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about Cinderella is music. When Cinderella's fairy tale appeared in her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I'll never forget it. I also loved this part when Cinderella and Prince sang the song. So it's love when they danced because they realized they were in love. In general, this movie was my favorite movie when I was a little child because every little girl wants to live the life of fairy tales.
