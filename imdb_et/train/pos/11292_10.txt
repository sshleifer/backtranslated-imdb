I once saw this movie as a late late show and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took 30+ years, but recently I found it on a DVD - it wasn't cheap either - a catalog specializing in war films. We looked at it for the first time last night. The sound was good, but it was sharp and was between the rollers between the trailers. However, it was better than I remembered it. I was also impressed when the game was right. <br /> <br /> The directory is here somewhere. If you are sincere in finding it, come out and see if I can get you information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
