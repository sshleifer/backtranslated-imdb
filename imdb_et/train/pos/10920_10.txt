I remember this movie as a child. I don't remember where I saw it. I have to be about 14 years old. I thought the film was incredible and wanted to see it again. It came to Kung Fu once, but I miss it. I was really fun. This is the best special effect Kung Fu movie I've seen so far! I recommend it very much and now that I discovered where to get it, I can enjoy it again and for years. I also need to return this Venom movie, some of which have been so spoken.
