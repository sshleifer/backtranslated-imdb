As well documented by previous posters, the actual stars of Rockstar are: INXS - and it is the sequel to Rockstar: Supernova - Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Don't know who they are? They are awesome, dense, rockin 'House Band, whose music experience and talent have shown it more than the sad American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Remember "strings" at night? It was musical precision and perfection when I ever saw it. Suzie McNeil's epic appeal of Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody, Ty Taylor's catchy cover Stones' 'You can't always ...', JD Fortune sings 'suspicious thoughts'. The common denominator here is the fantastic House Band. <br /> <br /> As good as INXS was their main, they are, unfortunately, the shadow of their former shadows, although JD's live performance has somehow breathed new life into his music, this exhibition concerns HB. <br /> <br /> Memo Producers: The 3rd season (if we are blessed to happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Get these guys a good singer and they go places.
