Have you ever read Jim Thompson? She is a hard-boiled knife with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I've ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in their work - just losers, psychotics and small-time artists. This film has Thompson nailed - "If God made real mistakes in this world, He gave us the will to live if we have no excuse for this." Each character in the film balances the edge of the razor between surreal and horrible realism. There's a buggy, uncle Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and horribly well-intentioned Doc Goldman, played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives an excellent, often heartbeat-like performance like Kid Collins, no too bright, shy ex-fighter who fears more than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, a sexy femme fatale we can't really understand ... It's not your usual movie noir, it's not meant to be. After Dark My Sweet with Grifters, one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson, is a great adaptation.
