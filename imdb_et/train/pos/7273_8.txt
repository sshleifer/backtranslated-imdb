Carlos Mencia was great, it's a special lesson. He worked hard to show everyone that he was the real thing. I know people have said he's stolen in this specialty, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy as he wants it, not how someone else wants it, so he's so good. People say he's not funny because he says Dee dee dee is too much, and they still haven't realized it's part of his activity, and they don't want it, but he brings it anyway and succeeds people make a laugh. There's a message here for all the hackers out there, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point in putting him down.
