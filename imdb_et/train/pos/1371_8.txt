This movie is a wonderful, light-hearted look for both sides, where the "club boy" rave scene mixes with the New York art, music and performance worlds (with Miss Bunny everywhere). This is the "trilogy of the torch song" for the arrogant girls. "This girl" for our impatient millennia. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is quick and funny, and Parker Posey's defendant - if not the Academy Award - deserves - at least - the stadium's "wave" of rubber. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is based on Miss Posey's very stylish platform heel and is completely cast. Like many of his works, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referencing and well posey ... but it all works. She is a talented comedienne, an incredible entertainer and entertaining, she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap and never lets her fall on the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is a superficial fashionista who is not stealing designer clothes from her friend's closet or with someone else's boyfriend. At a deeper level, this is the story of a girl and her friends who are less caring about the word in every sense, including other people; and the learning process that care is necessary for life. The script is beautifully designed, the witty and the only show that has disappeared is the aunt, which was too one-dimensional and hard-handed; more nuanced operation, would have deepened the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... this is comedy. A surprisingly deep role, which gives this film some content and worldview, is a boy selling fallafel. We should all be so happy ... is she for Mary? or one that goes away? <br /> <br /> I appreciate it as 8 because it is not a great moment in the film's history, it's not classic, and it's not a great art (all that look again). Like "Desperately Seeking Susan", this is something very right about this time period, but may become irrelevant over time. Nonetheless, it is all that is needed for an entertaining film, and it's worth looking at many times only for clothes!
