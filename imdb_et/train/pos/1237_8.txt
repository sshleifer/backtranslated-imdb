It was a very original decent film and a brave move for all participants. I don't care if it's not the best movie ever made, the fact that he has Eddie Murphy's non-formula, and that I don't know what's going to happen, makes it my favorite. I want more movies to be as imaginative as the same old entertainment formula.
