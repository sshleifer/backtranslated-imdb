Very interesting and interesting film. Similarities with David Lynch (even quoted literally in the presence of the red curtains of the film) and Franz Kafka's novels (Mrs Grubach is the owner of this film, as is Der Prozess). ) are clearly represented, but in this case there are clear references to the past of the Belgian colony in Africa. The exact content of the film cannot be clearly described: this colonialism is an important part, as well as the inability to cope with such a past, but personal memories of a fundamental nature are also a central issue and its social contact and love. These are the symbolic themes I have deduced from the film, but in reality they are no more than shows. <br /> <br /> But even if you are just trying to follow a linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still discover an extremely exciting movie full of great shapes (beautiful shots, larvae and other nasty insects that alternate between big dreams and darkness) adds style to the atmosphere). Maybe you can say that I haven't really received the movie, but I've looked at the 1.5-hour hypothesis that visual quality and exciting mystery have impressed.
