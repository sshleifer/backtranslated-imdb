Yeah, I go with it 1-0 and that's why. In recent years, I've been watching quite a few comedies and just a couple of light laughs and a couple of late charges for video, because the movies were so easy to forget. Then I'll stumble on something. It was interesting, not expecting much. I was wrong. It was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a great comedy pair and humor was memorable to remember, but not beyond the lack of complicated jokes. I don't want to mention any real scene because I feel it's a movie worth seeing once. More and more useless concepts that come to the movies (you know, like killer military aircraft and "fresh" remakes that destroy old classics), This movie makes you happy to say it's OK to laugh "Nothing".
