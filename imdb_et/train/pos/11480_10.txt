Cutting Chase: This is one of the most amazing, most intense movies I've seen for a long time. The first film in the years that was absolutely different for me. I can barely get out of the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I've been looking at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this movie and just failed. The highlighting of one aspect - the documentary video diary format, the unreasonable portrayal of events, the characters - seems just that trivializing. Some may laugh that some killers may be normal. But then all the killers are not terrible cavities. Many are quite regular, uncomfortable people. They are just wired differently. <br /> <br /> And this is probably the coldest thought.
