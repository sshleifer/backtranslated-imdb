I was 15 years old when this movie premiere on television. Having grown up in Texas, I realized the boredom and monotony of the lives of teenagers living there. This film touched my impressive teenage heart and reminded me of it for the past 12 years. Recently I saw it on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th times thanks to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the film comes in and touches my inner confusion.
