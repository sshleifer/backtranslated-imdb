I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The story is somewhat better, especially in season 1. Season 2, however, became more of a show and lost DA's original charm. The season one story was more interesting, the light side of Jam pony's life, while the focused serious plot where manticore attacked the X series. I was expecting a new season, actually I'm still. I hope FOX boys and the DA production team realize that many ppls are waiting for the return of DA. Even after it has been revoked, it will be working properly after it has been withdrawn after twenty years, and I think that James Cameron's name should accept that challenge.
