Never heard of this movie, I saw it on a DVD. Great movie, a great example of a movie that took every cast member to work. It is no longer a typical Hollywood movie with the same old-timed actors. has pulled out all the results of this movie. Back to the memory of his post on the military experience of the Vietnam War. It focused on the people who were sent to fight. As there were characters who had fears and emotions, even when some volunteers served. They were also regular people, some just did not interrupt military life, I remember some of my experiences - they couldn't easily adapt to military life - but I never forget them - they should have forgotten I recommend it and then think of those who serve in modern Afghanistan. a trip, you will notice that these drill-outs are not people in the morning and maybe they need a "sensitivity training" HA! HA! HA!
