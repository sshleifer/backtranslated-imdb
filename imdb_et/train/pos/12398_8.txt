What was always missing in Matrix's story was how things came from the real world. Say more, because this story included most of the mounts. What was really interesting was how political it was, maybe even the current cheap strike of the presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things that a person could think of in fighting a robotic horde that had to be considered not only by human servants. In my opinion, it was interesting to use fear and how this unknown idea continued. We, as people, tend to fall into this trap more often by letting logic and lack of thought over us, because people cannot believe the opposite. Well represented and assembled, this is the true testimony of how people can be illogical.
