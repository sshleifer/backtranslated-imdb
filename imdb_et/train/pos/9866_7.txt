I just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking movie. The story is simple but effective, loving and nicely designed characters, but what really looks is a digital set. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animation films than reality, the designs give you a truly enjoyable look by using the incredible color of the world. Sometimes the touch of reality (especially the water was impressive), but it is still a reality-based fantasy world. Reducing the burden on especially large landscapes will help minimize rendering costs. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with technical glory, with the efficient use of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Enough technical babble, fun movie, family friendly and sometimes just fun.
