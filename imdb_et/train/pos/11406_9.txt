The very special provision of Wagner's last opera surely grew for me. When I saw it for the first time, I was disturbed by many movies with surreal images and I felt too much story. However, if you can build a fair amount of rather "tricks", I find that the film has succeeded in capturing the opera in a very strange atmosphere with the rest of the world and that there are moments that are especially good. <br /> <br /> Personally, I never understand the Kundry role before I saw Edith Clever depicting her. His presentation (mime synchronized with the voice of Yvonne Minton) has nothing dazzling, from end to end, and alone justifies the time it takes to film. <br /> <br /> Another reason for this movie's joy is that it strikes out Robert Lloyd's remarkable interpretation of Gurnemanz's important role that Lloyd has highlighted in crisp opera houses all over the world. I have had the privilege of enjoying him several times in Gurnemanz's role on the Metropolitan Opera stage, and his eloquence and warmth, paternity of his interpretation really need to be preserved, just as his performance in the two main monologues of character, Karfreitagi's scene and presentation of the law in law 1 did not get it do. This is particularly regrettable because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces a highly Christian interpretation of a film that forces the interpretation of an opera. It seemed to me quite contradictory both with the openness of Wagner's Christianity and with his very deliberate attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements. (See the footnote with the spoiler at the end of this review.) I find it almost impossible to swallow them when watching a movie with subtitles, and we strongly recommend that you read the libretto carefully if you can change the subtitles in DVD versions. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there is a lot in the movie that I don't want, and that as soon as we saw it differently, it has, in my opinion, been steadily rising over the years since I first saw it. and I find that I've enjoyed it over and over again. <br /> <br /> _____________________ /> <br /> PHOTO NOTE ON SPOILER: A good example would be Kundry's famous line, "I saw him ... him ... and laughed." It is translated into subtitles for reasons that flee me because "I saw the Savior's face." It is particularly irritating to me because, for the entire libretto, Wagner deliberately refers to this invisible nature, which is NOT a BIBLICAL Jesus as "der Heiland", that is, "The Healer" in German - reference to the wound of Amfor and all wounds and diseases, and need for improvement.
