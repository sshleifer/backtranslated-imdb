I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were top notch, including the most important, for me, the scenario and the actor. This is certainly one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is absolutely convincing in his work. Imagine, just because of curiosity, how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could have solved this role. This is my first contact with Jean Peter's work that I remember. He impressed so much that I was definitely looking for another job. Thelma Ritter, who is surprised at his role, deserves the Oscar nomination he received for playing the informant. This movie works on every level. Black and white photography is perfectly suitable and the story is taken from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have a great chemistry in their difficult romance. Recommended, 9/10.
