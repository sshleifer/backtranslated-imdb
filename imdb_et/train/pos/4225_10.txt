Ruth Gordon is one of the most sympathetic killers that Columbo has ever had to deal with. And the plot is brilliant all the way around. This is one of the best Columbo episodes. Mariette Hartley and G.D. Spradlin are excellent in their support roles. And Peter Falk offers a little extra in his scenes with Gordon.
