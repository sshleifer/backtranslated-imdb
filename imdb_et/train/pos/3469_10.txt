This is one of the few films that were published as a "as" type of situation that made me think. It was amazing to hear that they talk to each other and recall all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them. I think there is a good chance that it happened like a movie, and they made peace with each other. These are good memories for every fan who hang and ask what really happened between them would be selfish. What was this AMAZING film. The comedic aspects of the film were wonderful. To think that they were in a way to collide with each other, it is a nice idea for people who want them to be able to free up someone they couldn't. To see John as such caring, he was modest when he heard all the trash he was talking about.
