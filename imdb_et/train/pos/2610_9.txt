For ten years from Wildside's broadcast, there is nothing really close to the quality of local production. It includes two enjoyable but overestimated series of Underbelly, which has brought about events in both Sydney and Melbourne's recent criminal case. An exception may be blue murders (also marked by Tony Martin, but by someone else's law). <br /> <br /> Wildside is repeated on ABC late at night. Despite watching the show in the meantime, I still have an impressive uncompromising story and very human characters. It's great: Tony Martin as a detective, captured by his son's disappearance, Rachael Blake (who later joined Martin in real life) as a community worker struggling against alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young policeman, vice president of gambling. Similarly, Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie himself) and young Abbie Cornish have good support roles. <br /> <br /> ABC published only the first three episodes on a DVD. years ago. The logic of this kind of marketing is beyond me, but I think it may have something to do with the disagreements with the original manufacturers. <br /> <br /> An excellent series that has become very well aged. We hope the ABC DVD department will work together. <br /> <br /> (According to ABC message board moderator, there will be a further DVD edition in December 2009)
