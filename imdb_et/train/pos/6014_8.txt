All the reviews here, how many ZPs do not have plots, work on wood, orgy on the scene, etc., all fall behind. <br /> <br /> Let's face it. This is a film made in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Los Angeles. This is a movie that you were going to watch if you are on H-I-G-H with some psychedelic substance. <br /> <br /> Find some pung and smoke or get a light acid. Seriously, these ZP straight and sober reviews are missing. You can't get anything out of this movie in the true sense. <br /> <br /> Until you watch this movie on the big screen (which I am happy to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare), you don't know what that movie is. <br /> <br /> If you look at it not in a state of intoxication, you can at least assess if the end is blowing up "Pink Floyd's wonderful re-working" Careful to Ax, Eugene "," Come on 51, your time is over.
