Great movie. The actor - from the doctor to the pavement artist, with a few exceptions, was excellent; I thought that soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the least known participants. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who may be accused of excessive behavior, presented a rather plausible and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing was the camera work - and the way he took away the energy of the bomb streets, Gustad's peace, which speaks of his prayers and lives in small apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the walls that will become a sanctuary and then disintegrate - and the philosophical taking of the artists will take it. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies on Indian themes.
