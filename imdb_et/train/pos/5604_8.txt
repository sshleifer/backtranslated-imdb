If you liked Roman Polanski's "Repulsion", you should probably check out "The Tenant" because it is a similar concept, just entering Polanski and playing a schizophrenic wack. It's actually one of my favorite films - secondly, after "Rosemary's baby", of course - and it's a direct journey towards the spiritual collapse of a man moving to the former apartment of a suicide victim. Other inhabitants of the building are all bright and sticky to keep the noise level down - even the slightest "titre" becomes a big deal and Polanski, who celebrates, becomes more and more paranoid and goes on to their bad hallucinations when the film goes on. It gets to the point where she is dressed and acts like a former tenant, and you realize that this is only a matter of time before she decides to step out of a deadly window ... The film is a bit slow and amazing though, but if you You've ever seen Roman Polanski's movie, then you should know that it ends in a bang and this flick doesn't disappoint. It is also best if you do not question the complexity of the assumption and just take it mad because it is sometimes surreal. Polanski is very good as a terrifying, corrupt resident who somehow attracts Adjani Israel. We also see him running around at the same time, disturbing and fun! Damn, he's making one ugly chick! So Polanski fans, who can actually watch their thirty-year pedophile charges, should enjoy the "tenant" as an entertaining psychological main trip ...
