Madhur Bhandarkar has it all raw. But the best thing is that he did not forget to give the ingredients. It is short and crisp for the viewer and now the audience is the choice. Page 3 is the revelation of bare truth, regardless of the coarseness involved. <br /> <br /> Madhavi (Konkan Sharma) is a journalist and enjoys her job. A simple and peaceful life loves her caring boy and a nice roommate Pearl. He covers the nation today, where he has a very supportive editor Deepak Suri (Boman Irani.) But life turns to him when he hits the first stroke and takes himself away and goes a bit. Omigosh! there was a whole new world waiting for him. He is shocked, excited and stunned by revelation. His reaction has led to the loss of work. Finally, she is back to page 3. Now that she meets the fame of the party, she knows every real look that lies under the illusory face. <br /> <br /> The film has a message and it's crude. Audience needs its color. The theme and scenario were fantastic. There are some very good ideas for preparing the target groups. Just like a prelude, a short intercourse is shown before the pedophilia show in the bathroom. The dialogues are strong and the participants are very good in achieving this. Charu Mohanty's 2 words speaks volumes and he has been very successful in giving these two words with such ingenuity, leaving it in effect. Selected options might have been better. Songs do not stand anywhere; but they were needed in the background. Atul Kulkarn has little influence that has a big impact. There are some mistakes. Atul Kulkarni explained to Konkan Sharma that honesty must be labeled with intelligence. Perhaps it would have been a better dialogue because it sounds like a sermon. The meeting between Thapar and his daughter does not require action. This scene looks very unprofessional. <br /> <br /> Generally, this must-watch movie with optional features before the pedophile case. This can ruin your mood.
