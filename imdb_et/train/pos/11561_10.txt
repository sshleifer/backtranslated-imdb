This affectionate comedy is facing some odd character. Of course, two leading characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondria whose wife lost because he could no longer tolerate his cleaning and cooking attacks. So he's trying to kill himself, but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays his friend Oscar, an insecure, unreliable sports reporter who lives in a divorce from his former spouse in a bachelor's apartment. She offers her unhappy friend Felix a new home in her apartment. And soon the problem begins, because two such conflicting characters cannot live together for a long time. Felix makes the Oscar an erroneous apartment a clean showroom. He cleans and matures all the time. After a short while, Oscar feels the mania of persecution ... Filmed with theater and excellent performance. First of all, Jack Lemmon's game is wonderful. He's the perfect clown. He makes us laugh, but tragic-comic. Look for a wonderful scene when both men call their two neighbors for dinner because Oscar has to touch something softer than a bowling ball. When preparing drinks, Felix sits in a living room with two young women. To get out of this embarrassing situation, he starts talking about the weather. A few minutes later he changes the subject and talks about his former wife and children. Suddenly he starts crying and when Oscar goes back with drinks, there are three crying in the living room. The movie is full of such fun and touching scenes. Intelligent and fun comedy with a lot of heart. 10 out of 10!
