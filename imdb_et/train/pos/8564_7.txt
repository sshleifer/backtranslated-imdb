I don't think this film would be well understood by Romanian viewers. It certainly tells about the value of the film or the lack of universal universality, but it also talks about how Romania, compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe, had a different history and even life. The film is a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died during the communist regime shortly after the publication of the book. It tells the story of an intellectual professor of philosophy whose life is imprisoned after an end of Stalinist time. In principle, the first part of the film talks about its struggle for survival in prison, while the other describes its initial opportunity to restore life after release. His release is actually only obvious; Romania in the 1960s asks him for various compromises and crimes, but his struggle for survival is as harshly moral as in prison. <br /> <br /> The film has been brilliantly played by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who has a leading role, would be in some other time and another place that is a mega-star, we get a glimpse of his fabulous acting here. Although the film is hesitant and sometimes talks about insignificant details or comics of characters, it is still an important landmark of Romanian cinema, as well as a process of restoring the moral and historical values ​​of Romanian society.
