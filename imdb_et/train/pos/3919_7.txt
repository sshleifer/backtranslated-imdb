Carmen, who is a senior choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades), brings sexual Carmen (Laura del Sol) to play a leading role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, an independent and seductive woman who is unable to embrace the prevailing love. When Carmen has a thing with another dancer, Antonio consumes his jealousy, like D. José's original opera, which combines fiction with reality. <br /> <br /> Carmen is another great movie about Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to Flamenco's dance. The dramatic love story has been developed with the lives of artists associated with the characters they practice, and many times it is not entirely clear whether what is happening is reality (with dancers) or fiction (from the game). Paco de Lucia is another original version of the famous Bizet opera based on the Prosper Mérimée novel. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
