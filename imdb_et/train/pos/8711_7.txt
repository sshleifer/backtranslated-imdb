It is not my understanding that so much garbage from Norway has been updated on DVD, and such gems still do not respect their past. I give it 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing more than a film-historical pearl, which in so many ways is the first foreign film. And my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the team see the mini-series? However, it is unlikely that the scenes are very similar. Okay, the budget is lower in Norwegian movie _much_, but given that it's really a good job of the hopeless age of Norwegian filmmaking that lasted until the 90s.
