This film is neither sick nor frustrating. It is - sad, because AIDS in the early 90s - sad. But its true message is one of love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term loving relationship. Their commitment to each other is immediately visible, and when AIDS destruction aggravates and becomes the focal point of their lives, you will see strength and commitment that is truly warming your heart. <br /> <br /> When Silverlake Life was originally releasing HIV / AIDS from education and health, I volunteered as an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film told me like no other AIDS movie of the day, because Mark and Tom were real people who lived exactly what I saw in real life everyday. For the first time, I knew the experiences that were like eating Aids, young, healthy people; Seeing it happen to Mark and Tom, it was very similar when I looked at the deterioration of my real friends. It touched me so that even all these years would still affect me.
