Bar some of the interviewed actors (the musicians are there at the end of the day), this is Quentin Tarrinno says "The best rock movie ever made ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 miles, but without rapping - young musician who tries to prove himself to the local community while he is fighting a broken home and a rival. Throw sexual interest and truly extraordinary performances, this is a real 8 miles. Prince gives a solid result, like Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent script, good direction, big plot and remarkable performances. Have not forgotten some of the best rock / pop / funk music you will ever hear.
