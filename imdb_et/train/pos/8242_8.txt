I watched FIDO on some movie channels and I have to say I have become a direct fan. The film looks like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s, knowing that for a decade as they danced to Elvis, dropping nuclear bombs into the desert just for that hell. People were so naive that it was scary and the idea that these clean cut people would find that zombies are actually pets here. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this Canadian production, colorful crisp cinematic art and excellent cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and Child. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie wasn't a big hit. It deserved more recognition. It's much better than the Tim Burton or DEAD team's SHAUN. Oh well. However, this is a classic classic.
