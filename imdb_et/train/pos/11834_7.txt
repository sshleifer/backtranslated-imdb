I love horses and admire hand-drawn animations, so I waited for Dreamworks' new animated image to be no surprise. Spirit: Cimarron slave. I think I could say I was a little disappointed. You have a great animation and first of all what seems like the perfect story. The story of absolutely not a horse in nature. Animals didn't sing cute songs or even talk - a big plus. Unfortunately, the story of Matt Damon is not praying; Bryan Adam's soundtrack; and enough activities to compare it with Jerry Bruckheimer's production. If the filmmakers had simply simplified, we would have a masterpiece here. It's not a great movie, but it's a great entertainment for toddlers. I recommend this to the families of the film because it is in the right place in the heart and the only thing that is out there today that is not offensive to small children. Not bad, but it could have been much better. Very beautiful visual.
