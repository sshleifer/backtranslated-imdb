"Sweet is never as sweet as sour." This quote was, in my opinion, the subject of the film. Tom Cruise plays a young man who had passed all his life. She takes things for granted and it goes around in this great movie with a great twist. This movie keeps you in reality and can't stop it to break the bathroom. <br /> <br /> This movie that really takes you back and looks at your life and how you live it. You can't really understand better things in life (sweet) like love until you have experienced bad (sour). The subject can really "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the movie becomes very complicated and difficult to understand. I think the ending is still perfect. I suggest you look at it and see for yourself.
