It's funnel jokes out of all the Cheech & Chong flicks. This is the first one I saw with these men. I found it really good. My father suggested that I get it. WHAT A GREAT ROLL AND MY GRANDMA bought it for me knowing what it was. What a family I have. Well this movie is pretty good and good to rent if you want to see good classics. I have to warn you, however, it is not funny funny. It has its moments, but not as funny as anything from Mary. Check it out anyway. I'm sure you're laughing. If your anti-drug activist or nothing is.
