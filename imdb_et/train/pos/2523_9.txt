When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. In a few months, I thought I thought it was real. The few reviews I read about WEREN's made with fangirls were not very promising. <br /> <br /> If I had the opportunity to watch it, I was fully prepared to bother, fight and otherwise have to close my eyes to avoid stupidity. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised and a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Moon's child has their own cheese, camp, and general dorkiness - I think it's impossible to avoid it with Gackt Camui, a man who's not known for his peace of mind, but it was all enjoyable at all. <br /> <br /> No, it's not a cinema genius, but it's a very, very affectionate, fun, fun choreography, score score and fun cast. I know little about Japanese cinema so I can't really do justice, but given that the cast spoke a language or an extreme dialect that was strange to them at one time or another and that some of them have almost no action, I was quite impressive . <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good movie, good drama, good comedy, watch this movie. At least rent it from arrival in area 1. <br /> <br /> A side note in this movie is homosexual / homoerotic content. I didn't even see a lot of subtitles. Don't let people who read too much into things destroy it for you.
