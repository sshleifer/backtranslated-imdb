<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / American history of the early 19th century or Yul Brynner, watch this movie for yourself and make your mind about it. Don't miss out on many nervous reviews. My reaction to this was that it was entertaining, well-functioning (mostly), she had a very funny dialogue and she did a great job of portraying the charm, attractiveness and legendary charm of the private sector, Jean Lafitte. Although not all the events on the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that is successful in this?), I feel that the film is accurate for its role in Lafitte's New Orleans history, and love. the relationship between hateful citizens of New Orleans and the law of one of the city's favorite boys. Do not worry about what the film does not do, but look at what it does, that is, to study New Orleans and America's most intriguing historical figures.
