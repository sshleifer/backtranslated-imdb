"Truly a nice story with moral love" describes this strange David Lynch movie. It was especially "strange" because it was not a movie Lynch put out in the last 15-20 years. These were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and that is the opposite. I know it's disappointed with your fans. Others were happy about it. Read me one of these last, and I own all these three "dark" movies. <br /> <br /> This was another alleged biography detailing a senior man's trip to a sitting lawn mower from West Iowa to Wisconsin to see his heavy brother with whom he hasn't spoken over the years, but wants to see before when the latter dies. Well, I think this assumption - the old man who drives a lawn mower for 400 miles - is still making a "strange" movie, so Lynch remains that character! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He's the kind of guy, face-wise, voice-like, low-key personality that almost everyone likes. His face wrinkles tell a lot of story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after the release of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this movie is not much and not always pleasant, as it shows the main character of the adult and the mentally challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and his tragic past, but when Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) starts your journey, hitting the story. I played it for many friends and they thought the film was never up, but I'm more generous with it. I think it's a hidden pearl. It was a sleeping capsule for them. <br /> <br /> I found my journey quite exciting, but you have to realize that this is not going to be the story of a Lynch crime. It's slow and if it's fine with you, you might like it. Charm enters the picture for some people Alvin meets down the road like a steep young man who runs away and some nice city people who help the old man when he gets into trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan, is challenging in this respect.) Harry Dean Stanton gets the third bill, but it's a joke: he's only in the last minute of the movie! <br /> <br /> Iowa Landscape I've been living there for several years and I can admit mountains and rich soil, it's a nice state with nice people .... like this movie.
