I love this movie, but I don't get what it is. People who do not like this film must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe it is Mr. Carrey behind all this makeup. And I'm sure most movie actors and actors have made a movie before the movie. And there is a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen, who plays Cindy Lou Who. As it opens, Grinch (Jim Carrey) is hiding. And some thoughts on Whoville. Sicne we know who love Christmas. Although Grinch does not like Christmas. And even makes a small Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), a daughter of the city postmaster (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the voice of the narrator is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is a mayor. Who doesn't like to talk about Grinch at Christmas.
