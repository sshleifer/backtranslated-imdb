"My child, my sister, dream <br /> <br /> How cute every thing seems <br /> <br /> We were living in such a country, <br /> <br /> And I love it slowly and for a long time, <br /> <br /> Self-loving and dying <br /> <br /> The scenes that depict you are proud of the weather. "Charles Baudelaire <br /> br /> Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, can "Enachanted April" be described in one sentence? it takes place in the early 1920s as four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy in April. This is the right description, but it doesn't make you "Enchanted April" - the ultimate "good feeling" movie is the perfection of this genre. Lovely and sunny, gentle and calm, kind and magical, it's like the sun's rays in your spring, if you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this peaceful happiness and cherish it forever. This is a film that really influenced my life. I looked at it in difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely when I had to deal with sad and tragic events and agree on some vague truth about myself. It helped me get back to optimism and I hope something can be changed and everything is possible. I had promised myself that, regardless of what I would like to do, I would struggle and get rid of myself and I would appreciate every year - joy and sadness ... I promised myself to go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone. <br /> <br /> Enchanting, enchanting and cordial warming "Enchanted April" is one of the best films ever made and my everlasting love. This little film is the highest quality diamond.
