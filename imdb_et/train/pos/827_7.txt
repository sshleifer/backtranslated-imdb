The perspective is good. Since the release of "Star Wars Episode I: Phantom Menace", claims and countermeasures about how Episode II and III are going to take place have been highlighted by "original" Star Wars films, making them part of a single whole. instead of separating parents and new movies into separate trilogys. New movies have allowed older films to place fresh perspectives. This new outlook allows us to better understand what is often seen as the weakest of the original trilogy: "Jedi's Return". ROTJ is often too cute because it is in some ways as strong as the original and just a little less impressive than the almost perfect "The Empire Strikes Back". Indeed, the ROTJ "cute" element, namely Ewoks, is the weak link in the whole series. Did George Lucas place a furry dwarf movie for purely sales opportunities? Only he can answer that question. <br /> <br /> This lovely factor sets aside the perfect circle and saga of the movie. After the end of the Empire's rebound, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends at his home in Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a space pirate turned to Rebel's hero who was caught in Jabba Hutt's late debt. <br /> <br /> Skywalker has become a man because he left Tatooine against Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight against the evil empire. Now all is black, Luke has discovered his origin that he is confused and torn. His psychological formation is not as strong as his appearance would look. Although he always wants to help his rebellious friends, he is waiting again to fight evil Darth Vader, despite his uncertainty as to whether he is destroying or eventually turning to the Dark Side and joining Vader on the emperor's side. br /> <br /> The early scenes of Tatooine are impressive from the Jabba's nest, its floating castle and the all-powerful Sarlac - the intensity that lives in the sand. The improvements of Lucas CGI's 1997 film actually worsened Sarlac's overall impact, making it fake and overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> Tatooine's battle scene is outstanding and is one of the most memorable. saga. Luke almost unanimously anhiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his abilities as Jedi has now almost completed. <br /> <br /> When Luke returns to Degobah to visit a vulnerable Yoda once more, the viewer misses Yoda's lack of clear strike. Undoubtedly, "The Empire Strikes Back", the story of Yoda, is deleted, because Luke's fate progresses on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ is actually Luke's movie, maybe even more than the original. His journey carries a film when he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. Other insurgent characters will certainly work in their shade. Find (Carrie Fisher) and Solo romance are all but non-existent, unlike the "empire". In fact, RotaJi has only developed Leie's character, Solo's character seems fading, because the facets of his personality are too familiar in the first two films. <br /> <br /> Their roles are aimed at working alongside rebels to destroy the entire new Death Star, which ends with termination. This time the emperor himself monitors the final stages of construction. The Empire is going to break the rebellion once and for all, while the emperor's own plan is now to bring the powerful Skywalker aside to work together (or replace?) Darth Vader. The Emperor is a different kind of evil for the film, less insidious than the head of Star Cushing, Star Wars, deeper psychologically darker than anything else. Ian McDiarmid has played great, Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate. <br /> <br /> All other participants are well established in their roles. Hamill is surprised when Luke was more amazed by making his character progress from a teenage teenager to an impatient student's enlightened warrior, one of the few real events. The role of Ford is thin, because all his charm and charisma were spent in the first two films - he was the real star of the first film. Fisher Find is a proportion, at least at the end of the film, where he learns himself that he is never sure ... Add to favorites like Alec Guiness like Kenobi, Yoda and the beloved Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the wild battle of the film, which includes Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and contains a triple battle: Endor, in space and on a dead star, each with very impressive special effects. Music, as always, is brilliant and the mood of everyday life is great. Just as the "Blue Danube" worked perfectly for "2001: Space Odyssey", John Williams' score on the same "Star Wars" folklore as light swords and forces. <br /> <br /> Lucas left the open end of interpretation, meaning that there could have been more episodes. Indeed, sci-fi fans have created their own versions over and over again in their VII, VIII and IX episodes. ROTJ works wherever possible, and a hairy cute animal is set aside for a good finish. <br /> <br /> When all six episodes are reviewed, this saga may be the best ever made. Is it already? Adding Episode I changed the series landscape. That is why "Jedi's Return" can now be seen in a different light and given new recognition almost 20 years after its release.
