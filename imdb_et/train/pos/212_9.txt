Like the title of the comedy duet "The Sunshine Boys" has become a forgotten classic for 30 years a few years later. Along with other great movie comments from the 1970s, this is hardly mentioned. It makes no sense, given the special nature of this film, perhaps the best Neil Simon ever wrote. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once half of the legendary Vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark. A 73-year-old solo act who doesn't work with potato chips. His nephew Ben (Richard Benjamin) is confident that he will work if Willy agrees that he will be reuniting with his alien partner Al Lewis (George Burns) to mark ABC TV for the nostalgia of the exhibition's business. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" has begun to do in this pot, from the very beginning, when the 1920s movie clips presenting a variety of entertainers long ago blink in front of us with Cole Porter's "Be A Clown". Then the movie's current place in Manhattan, where burned pants and wide polyester ties are numerous. Periods collide with Willy's Manhattan apartment, where framed photos and cartoons celebrate long-lived celebrities along the wall with tabloid titles and empty Zabar food pots. If you were alive in the 1970s like me, you might seem to have been in this apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy has been living there for too long. She sleeps in front of the television when the kettle boils in another room. Willy wakes up and takes the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is this?" Pause. "Never, it's the way." <br /> The old men alone can be the materials of almost everybody, but Simon's alien spirit and unknown feeling makes gold the comedy of adapting this 1972 stage. The amazing thing about The Sunshine Boys is how much it rubs your nose Willy in an almost existential state without ever turning you off. "89 years old and just dying," says Willy from an old singing companion before deciding that a man probably died of writing a song that rhymed "a lady." <br /> <br /> Burns defeated the Oscar for his undervalued performance like a gentle but sharp Lewis, but it is Matthau who brings this one home, his makeup and a gorgeous but dirty camp that really sells you to the idea he's there were already 73 when he did. Willy is extremely terrible, full of Ben's description of the "crazy crazy" old man, but you drink him all the time, enjoying his little victory even when they come for the patience of others. Also, his lines will kill you, especially if he tries to kill Lewis, who has a bad idea to come to the TV. <br /> <br /> "You've touched!" Willy tells Lewis at one point. "I'm still demanding. I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room was a fire, you wouldn't be hot," says Lewis. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross shoots everything in a very casual and undervalued way, with low light and average, even in emotional moments, to leave room for comedy and the film's overall musical message through silent reception. You never know that you are watching a movie that is one of many "The Sunshine Boys" competitions, and the direction of Ross, like the action of the three principals, goes a long way in achieving this goal. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult, especially when the subjects are people who watch life, but "Sunshine Boys" makes everything seem to be a joy because our viewing is.
