Since a few years later this class was reviewed, I decided to go back and watch it in the department, but first some comments from the film critic's insider. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those that I grew up, made my childhood joyful, made it fantastic, today some of the things that we obviously don't see as much as we did back in the day ... <br /> <br /> The Talespin or Luftens Helte, called in Denmark, is a great animated series, it's a lot like a chip and dale, ducktales and a lot of them, so it's a weird feeling I can't remember this series as much as I would like to remember. <br /> <br /> But I think it was very big, it came with a message, not a message, but it's one of the old ones that can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I don't want to be old or sound, but I feel the time slipped out with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy, or something like that, we have all these new ones or almost new exhibitions like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel we don't have cartoons or real exhibitions in the same spirit as we did Now maybe I'm wrong, but I feel the time has changed a lot to conclude I would be happy when I see that the series like the Talespin is released again on the TV screen, not all new ones give me back my childhood cartoons, give those kids who have a few days, give them back ...
