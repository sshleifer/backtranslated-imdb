Ankaria and lawlessness have dominated the Elk Mountains. The city's elders are replaced by harsh, imprisoned Vietnamese veterans Aaron (a remarkably robust and interesting performance by Kris Kristofferson) and several of his colleagues who cleanse this place. The plan goes sour when Aaron and his brutal crowns decide to take over Elk Hills after getting rid of the bad elements. The task of Aaron's decent brother Ben (which Jan-Michael Vincent plays satisfactorily) is to stop before things are too handy. Writer / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage joyfully draws a modern western winner of immoral, cynical, and maliciously locked redneck exploitation: he professionally creates a tonic that keeps the pace brisk and gripping and sets great action scenes with a significant muscle aplomb (a special strong and distracting explosive climax). Choosing the faces of the well-known B-functions is the main asset: Victoria Principal as Beni's sweet hottie girlfriend Linda, the fabulous Bernadette Peters as the glowing salon singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter as the uncompromising mayor, David Doyle as the slender bank president Andrew Stevens as the accompanying gas station operator, John Carpenter filmmaker Charles Cyphers as one of Nam-veterans, Anthony Carbone as a fragrant casino player, John Steadman as the owner of an old eatery, Paul Gleason under the strong hand and Dick Miller as talentless piano player. Moral: Don't hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cronjager's slippery cinematography, Gerald Fried's lively, harmonious mountainous bluegreen score, and rich raw violence add to this amusingly neglected little funny fun.
