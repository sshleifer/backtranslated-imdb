My comment is generally limited to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This great series was one of the first TVs to be made, and it was very influential for the Americans to buy a color TV that was about $ 800 in 1959, which is over $ 3,000. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege to view an example transmitted through a 17-inch cathode ray tube? I was eleven when the series started, and I looked at it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Looking at it now, 50 years later, several things came to mind. First, many readers are linked to the prosperity of Comstock Lode and silver mining, dating back to 1859. By 1859, weapons and clothing are mostly not authentic. (Hairstyles remain outside the discussion.) It's basically a nitpick. And it would have been impossible for Ben to arrive in Lake Tahoe in 1810 and have collected a 100-square ranch in the next twenty years. Pioneers were still trying to solve the problem of Sierra Nevada already in 1847 and Gold Rush didn't even start two years later. <br /> <br /> Indians have not played American Indians. John Ford used Native American actors in the 1920s. Bonanza producers could have done it thirty years later. This is a big nitpick for me. <br /> <br /> There are other schedule problems. In the 1st season Mark Twain appears and is depicted middle-aged. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories were also more suitable for the 1859 - 1860 (pre-war) and 1880 timeframes. There are continuity problems over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is also somewhat widespread that there is so much killing in the first season. Over time, a lot of slaughter was reduced. <br /> <br /> Many episodes take a socially liberal inclination that is hard to believe based on the schedule, but give writers hope for seismic changes to the Peoples' attitudes that began in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, it is a good thing and I've come to the conclusion in recent years that Adam's character is better than any other. I don't think Pernell Roberts would ever have earned credit. Also in season 1, Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many stories are hoping for real historical events. Guest letters were interesting. <br /> <br /> It was a great family home and the series is getting very good.
