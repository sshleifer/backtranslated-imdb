"Tenant" is Roman Polanski's largest film IMO. And I love "Chinatown" but it's so much original and unusual and outrageous. It's also a big black comedy. Some people I've shown that this movie is very disturbed after *, so it's warned that it affects some people like that. Polanski does an excellent job of acting as a lead tenant and directing it.
