If you go to this movie that is waiting for something that is not, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway described as the "iceberg effect". On the surface, it is just a cache of random movie clips that were hit to shoot. If it had been written in the book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast and if you don't really try to catch it, the plot's justification (along with some subtle shades) is very good. well. Definitely a movie that you need to see twice to fully understand it. Experimental cinematography hardly describes this film. Camera work and mail production add a lot to the overall taste of the film, making it somewhat artistic at some points and open to others for interpretation (something that American films want later). Although in some respects some audiences may be somewhat nervous, tough, and too difficult, the film never becomes unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie I write as "needs improvement" is the selection of the soundtrack. No movie is ever good without the right sound, and while the soundtrack is quite appropriate, opening is a bit too long, and other rap songs in the movie would really be replaced by something more appropriate (a heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electron would have made this movie a real trip). The flood of images and dynamic ... color palettes adds an "artistic" aspect, which is also combined with the events of the film. But it also makes it much more desirable to watch a movie and not one that you get bored fast. 8.5 / 10
