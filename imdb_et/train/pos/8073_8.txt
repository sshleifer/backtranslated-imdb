An excellent scam portrait (Victor McLaglen's Oscar winning performance), captured by his own conscience. McLaglen plays the IRA Rouge, who is making his leader in Ireland during the Sinn Fein uprising. Scenes showing struggles and violent activities are very realistic, focusing on the despair of individuals. Lack of nature for a better future seems to be worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford creates a superbly slim and intense atmosphere, enhanced by the blurry and wretched image of Ireland's landscape. Max Steiner's dramatic music score enhances cinematic joy. The Oscar winner also for the best scenario, nominated for the best picture. It's one of Hollywood's classics.
