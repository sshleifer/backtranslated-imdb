Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was great for Seann William Scot as Stifler, but after that the quality has fallen. Band Camp kept the standard relatively high, with characters engaged with characters, but Naked Mile was the same joke and plots that were reused (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). It had some fun moments like a medieval football game and Coozeman's "punishment", but it was generally lacking in originality and "Mile" was just stupid and moral. Not to mention an irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Naked Mile is enough. I was looking at the Beta House for fear because I thought it might have been a new series, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, there is no real plot of land, but it's full of hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex fun. Yes, it is formal and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with surprising performance. The Greek Olympics are entertaining especially for the penultimate and recent events, while Christopher McDonald's home is fun. However, there are weaknesses. Coozeman is just as irritating as he was in the first, I'm still confused about how he ever got involved. Although Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White has been bothering to look at Naked Mile, but at Beta House he makes his presentation completely new. First of all, he has no charisma, no Stifler prerequisite. You really don't care less about him. The only reason I bothered her was that Ashley was on the screen! She looks over her, as well as the rest cast. Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and possesses as much charisma as dead fish. <br /> <br /> Saying that the movie is not amusing and Coozemani's fear that her girl is not exactly a girl is a great joke. In general, it is worth renting this movie, getting some of your companions and laughing at the vomit festival and releasing your anger to Erik's loser, Stifler.
