Damn, it was a lot to take in. I was pretty much mesmerized. It was quite perfect, though I would say that editing is a lot of it. I can't believe that this man stayed with the good conditions a lot of them (Anton in particular) to get all this movie material without serious ... beef. Dandy's came together well, middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and right!). I felt bad about Jonestown and especially Anton, which maybe was not what many other people knew. Great cinema and a great selection of themes. I recommend this to a music / movie fan. You probably know something about cinema.
