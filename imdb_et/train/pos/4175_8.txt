I was always thinking about what happened to the magical feeling that old Slovenian films seemed to be in them ... Well, after a while I wondered if this feeling was just nostalgia. Or did this "feeling" decide to pack your bags and say "goodbye" in the middle of our cinematographer and then never came back? Or did it? Because for me it came back for the first time when I saw "Ekspress, Ekspress". And it was this old me again. <br /> <br /> There are three features of this movie that make it somewhat unique and enjoyable when you look at the story, the stream of colors, the warmth of colors and the most I appreciated - the excessive use of verbal communication (which many others (not just ) Slovenian scriptwriters should at least consider). There is no use for words if you understand each other as well (yes or better) with the other tools you use. Just look at Bakovic and Cerar. <br /> <br /> So in so many words, why would I recommend to you all "express, express" as a black-Slovenian movie, no matter what you heard about Slovenian movies (if you've ever heard of it, is ...). <br /> <br /> Oh, and the scene where Bakovic dances to Vivaldi's music ... Treatment. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Look out.
