Mardi Gras: Made in China is a great film that shows how two cultures have a lot in common, but they don't even know the impact of every society. David Redmon opens your eyes and lets you see how Chinese workers make beads that cost little or nothing and are sold in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon asked the Americans about where these pearls came from, they had no idea and seemed stupid. When he told them that they were made in China with less than terrible wages and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed sad, painful and somewhat regrettable, but it didn't really seem that they would stop buying beads after finding out the truth. When Redmon questioned Chinese workers, they did not know that the Americans carried them over their neck and paid so much for their beads. The workers laughed at the purpose behind the beads and couldn't believe it. This movie is a great movie that gives us something to think about in other countries. <br /> <br /> Pitts
