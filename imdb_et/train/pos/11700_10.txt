I've read most of the comments in this movie. I've seen this film (and a whole series of prophecies) with family members of many times, we all enjoyed and we just wondered what we already knew about reading and learning the Bible. Nobody scared or traumatized as I read some posts. The film is simply based on the facts of the Bible. I've seen a lot of end-time movies "Tribulation", "Armagedon" and so on, and this is one of the best Bible testimonies. It may not have many great special effects like today's movies, but I believe it is a good witness. This movie and its series of predictions can be seen on this website at freepraise.com and the judge himself. Blessings to all.
