Keep your man in Jean Harlow, a Brooklyn working class girl, Clark Gable and all kinds of trouble. The film begins as a film, but by then the pressure has definitely changed its character. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Gable, who pulls a street contest with a partner, Garry Owen and a brand that punishes the police. When he drives the Gable ducks into Harlow's apartment and he is such a charming companion, he protects him. <br /> <br /> Before that, he's tied to him and sadly with his rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen are trying to pull the badger game into drunk Paul Hurst, but then Gable won't go through it. Of course, if Hurst realizes that it is, he is still painful and becomes warrior and Gable has to kick him out. But then he comes up dead outside Harlow's apartment, and platinum blonde hair makes it easy to identify. He goes to the accomplice for killing. The rest of the movie is her and her adaptation to prison life. His communication with other female prisoners gives him very good scenes. I think some material was later used for MGM's classic Cagedi. <br /> <br /> Harlow is also making a title song and it is performed as a torch-like ballad, which is very popular these days. She speaks / sings it with Sophie Tucker and quite well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well cast as a conscience, a part he often plays, especially on my favorite Gable film, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> It's still Harlow who shines in this movie. I think this is one of the best he did in MGM, his fans shouldn't miss it.
