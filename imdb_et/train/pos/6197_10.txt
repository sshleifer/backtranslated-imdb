Fay Grim is a real example of what I call a finished puzzle movie. It has all the functional, guide, storyline and entertainment values. They all fit together and, when they do, create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This movie follows a single mother, Fay Grim, who is trying to raise her son so she does not grow up as a father who has left the law and disappeared. Soon, CIA will communicate with Fay desperately to find 8 of her husband's Henry magazine. These magazines were filled with their long past testimony in the CIA and its participation in the activities of the states and their government. Fay is sent to find these magazines, on the contrary, to release her brother from prison and sent to cats and mice all over Europe to recover these magazines and learn the hidden secrets of her spouses she never knew before. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey was already an actor who liked it after I looked at him in OH's and Best in Show. He brought these two comedy roles to his vitality, but Fay Grim had a much different role to the other two films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt her, I took her and wanted to know more. He grabs you on the screen and when he's off, you can't think of what's going on with him. <br /> <br /> I've never seen any other works by the writer / director Hal Hartley, but I believe I'm watching some of his earlier films when they're half as good as Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to choose a movie the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD, I would strongly recommend choosing Fay Grimi. If you have a sense of how a movie should be, you enjoy this movie tremendously.
