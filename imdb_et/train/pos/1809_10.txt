All dogs go to heaven to be the most cut to animated dogs in 1989. The previous Don Bluth land of the film before the time (1988) became successful. Dogs are as cute as small mice. I want to hug them when they're cute. Where was I? Oh, yeah. His animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are perfectly tuned and the songs are cute and touching. It was opened on November 17, 1989, the same date as the Little Mermaid produced by the Walt Disney Feature Animation. <br /> <br /> The part where Charlie was killed by Carface was so unforgivable. Carface is so important because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on him! Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson were so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated film.
