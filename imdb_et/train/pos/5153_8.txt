Christian Duguay in Hitler: Some minor historical flaws and some exaggeration have been shown successfully in the beginning and in politics of Hitler's life. It is only natural that a Hollywood film contains things like the main purpose of production, the income they get from the movie. While such errors can disappoint some of the audience who believe that the book should do everything, I believe most of them fit well with the rest of the film, making it more interesting. We should not forget that this film is not a documentary. Who cares how his dog died anyway. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film Hitler is depicted as a psychologically unstable figure that gets very angry and very passionate about his ideals. But he was not considered a super-villain, but rather an ambitious politician. I believe this is a nice perspective, because the film is not contaminated with a ton of negative emotions and it made the film somewhat objective. Yes, he was a little crazy, and his methods were tough, but he was still a human, not a completely crazy figure, as "Inglorious Bastards". I believe that this made the film more real even in the case of inaccuracies in historical facts. <br /> <br /> The flow of history is well reflected by viewers. Although the focus of the film was around Hitler, we also had the opportunity to see what's going on in the country because of their activities through newspapers, people's discussions, and Jewish cabaret songs. The reaction of society was also reflected in the film, but it was very limited. The fights of the journalist Fritz Gerlich and the ironic games played in the cabaret were interesting and interesting, but it was all. Mostly we only saw his followers on the streets and rejoice at him. <br /> <br /> Another thing missing from the movie is information about the origin of Jewish hatred. Some ideas are given at the beginning of the film, but they were quite superficial. Suddenly he was a politician giving speeches about the necessity of destroying the Jews. <br /> <br /> To sum up, Hitler: The ascent of evil cannot be considered an excellent film that everyone likes, but it is not at all satisfactory. If you can exchange cash for drivers, this is an interesting film that successfully reflects Hitler's personality.
