For me, movies and acting are telling a story. The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the Bible account. In this film, I thought that storytelling by Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward was their best. To find out and understand the story of David and his journey to the King of Israel, it made this story even more important. You could feel his desire for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the true human side of the person who was, at her time, greater in life. Susan Hayward's fear, reluctance, but obedience to his power as his king was beautifully depicted. You might also feel that David's anxiety is close to Uriah spending his home at the gate of the night. Also sad when he was killed in battle. Raymond Massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel angry. Sets were real enough and the atmosphere believed. All in all, I think it was one of the best films. I gave her a rating of ten.
