It deserves 10 out of 10. A completely refreshing show with real characters and real tides. This exhibition has to come back, I've seen every episode and it's a real quality. <br /> <br /> Exhibition Centers around the New York City State are playing six levels of separation and cleverly embedding their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are stunning and so is the divine Caseman. The landscape is amazing and the wardrobes are fine. <br /> <br /> We need more such exhibitions so that viewers feel they are intelligent people who are not frantic drones. <br /> <br /> If it never comes back, six degrees will be missed.
