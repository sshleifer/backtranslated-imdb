Marion Davies celebrates in this remarkable comedy "Show People" released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays Georgia's Savannah, who arrives in Hollywood with his father (Dell Henderson). They get there - it's Davies' terrible South costume. Davies manages the job of slapstick comedy, not what he wants, but it brings him success. He will meet a man with a hit time with William Haines, whom he will be treated immediately. Well, Davies then gets a job in a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and lets work in a stormy piece. A beautiful but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows him the ropes of being a typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies gives up his bright friend and father for a good life, but of course it is not who he really is. Marion Davies is wonderful all the time because he - nervously - runs into the emotions of the "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual wonderful comedy, and Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars, including film director Kingi Vidori, are coming. This is a quiet movie with some "sound effects" because the sound images were just their own. Movie treasure.
