It was a pretty decent movie. This movie is good for just sitting and watching and amusing. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This film never wins the Oscar or anything, and certainly does not deserve it, but I thought it was pretty good. It's like Exhibition 24, but is set to film format. If you like it all, we have to stop the terrorist president from killing the movie, then you enjoy this flick. Personally, I think the story is too much, but Sentinel adds a mystery to the secret service. All in all, this film does not leave your jaw on the floor or change your life, but who says every movie must be good to be?
