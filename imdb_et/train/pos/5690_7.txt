I just watched this movie on a DVD and thought it was very good, but much wanted all over the story. This film has the same texture and appearance in Panic Needle Park or Cowboy Pharmacy. It's hard to believe people can live such a lifestyle; under-pressure in society, where their full existence is based on the heavy use of drugs, crime, violence, gender and the lack of complete self-esteem for someone or something, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is prominent in his "burnt" role as a former porn star John Holmes. Supporting casting is just as good. But this is a dark, dark, disturbing and frustrating film. The murder was brutal, but their daily lives were also brutal. If you have no interest in these murders or John Holmes' fan, this is not really a visible film. If you want to see the murder documentary drama, Truman Capote's 1960s are cold blood, with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake participating much better.
