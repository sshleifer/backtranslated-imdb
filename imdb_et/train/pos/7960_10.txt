In the past, there have been countless talking animal films, most of which have digitally animated animal mouths to almost respond to the voice, or are ridiculously amateur. "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is not so. <br /> <br /> This movie does not require the infant to be added to moving dog lips or gifts. It is capable of believing that animals are talking to one another authentically, and you can attach them to your heart quite emotionally (like all big boys and boys' films). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is for me the joy of all family-friendly animals and proud beautiful cinema, an inspiring soundtrack (Bruce Broughton's genius) and impressive cast ... <br /> <br Michael J. Fox ... Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br /> Frank Welker (God of Voice) ... Different <br /> < br /> This is a modernized version of The Incredible Journey, a classic of children's literature, made for a long documentary by Disney long ago in 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Francisco) is not nearly as good a movie, but extends your favorite fur-free friends adventure and is a fun city-twist grand-outdoor adventure theme. Want to bring your children to entertaining, beautiful, heart-warming mini-epic entertainment without the idiotic and often completely ridiculous comedy of a modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three kids for your kids - now! Thank you, Disney, for tearing my eyes every time I look at classics in the early 90s.
