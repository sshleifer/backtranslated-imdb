Together with "Brothers and Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my favorite new dramas in the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> The great cast of the whole, but I really enjoyed working at Campbell Scott (the coming photog) and Hope Davis (a journalist recently killed in Iraq widow). <br /> <br /> In addition to the actor, writing was fresh and the actor was great. An example was also shot in the real city of NYC, not Warner Brose or another studio backlot, adding a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the latest "Survivor" and other reality garbage. It didn't work out too bad.
