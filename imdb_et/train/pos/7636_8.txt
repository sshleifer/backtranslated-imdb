I've seen it for several years, but I remember it and I would like to see it again. It became a "therapy" with personal experience. Thirty-five-year-old man complains of a high school baseball game where he "missed the ball" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if only I hit the ball" and how his life would be better for it. Then he gets the chance to find out .... and gets a little more than he wanted. <br /> <br /> It reminds me as much as I was in high school, I tried twice for a drill / dance team and didn't do it. This team was the closest thing to my school corporation. If you were there, you were "all this." I didn't try HS before the last two years, and after the second time, I really took it hard. I hit and hit my feet badly before testing and wore pantyhose to cover the impression, and it caused me to do it. It was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, sometimes sometimes, I think, "If I hadn't hit my foot, I would never wear those funny pantyhose." Now I don't sit and think my life would be better or even different when I did, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never know how different things can be, changing one past back into the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events so that I didn't meet my son's father. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who has wanted to change at this moment. Be careful with your wishes !!!
