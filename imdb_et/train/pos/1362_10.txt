I and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can't get enough of this awesome Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on a DVD, but it doesn't seem to be too bad because I'm sure these features would be "very special" !! :) We all recommend this uber-cool comedy for flickerino for a date or even just a cozy stay alone! It would also be the type of movie you can watch with your cat, or even a party based on a Party Party party, just like the one that is loved, squeaky, pressable at the end of Parker Posey. Oh, and look at the thrilling and HILARIOUS surprise that ends ... Continue aside, the sixth mind. Sorry, no offense, just calling it like it is! Take it from an old flick lover, comedy just doesn't improve with Parker P 'Party Girl'! Know it! You, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
