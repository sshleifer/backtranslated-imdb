It is somewhat short. First, don't listen to the critics because it's not as bad as most say it is! The sniper uses a classic film formula, which many reject immediately as a film error. Although the sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, it gives those who do not know a professional sniper a glimpse of the Sniper world. And yes, the film has a lot of mistakes, but what's the movie? Tom Berenger has many good scenes and good action. I have to say that the two worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie, with Billy Zane in a helicopter, followed by Zane Marine's bar. Sniper's best scene is with Berenger in the middle of where the opponent's power sweeps it! There are also many good pictures of the jungle and some classic shots, using the camera as you look through the rack. And yes, the sniper's motto is "one shot, one kill". Judge Sniper himself! <br /> <br />
