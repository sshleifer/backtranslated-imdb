This is by far the most frightening game I ever played. It's not the middle-to-everything-it moves fps (which I usually don't care for), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ...") and all its incredible atmosphere . I love Scrye, which allows you to see or hear the events that happened in certain places in the past. The only game I had to play after a few minutes at regular intervals was because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I am a very spooky fan, especially Clive Barker's stories and films, and participation in such a horrible story that makes me wait for more games that emphasize the atmosphere and more inclusive story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fps fan, and maybe the game was a bit short?)
