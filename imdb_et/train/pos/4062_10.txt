I just realized that I've been using IMDb for years and I've never reviewed my favorite movie. As a favorite, I don't mean something I like right now, I think this movie is so supernatural that there is never an animated experience. This is obvious because I can never be a child; I saw this movie from ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 years old, this is the age group to which this film is directed, I am also a man, the sex for which this film is intended (the vast majority of Miyazaki's main characters are women). Consequently, this film indelibly inspired your child psychology and I have owed me forever to Carl Macek (sp?) For copying the English movie, which is much better than the production of Di $ ney, which is not even funny - I've never even been able to see that one - of course with subtitles - the only way to end, but the Macek version is SO good (the votes almost exactly match the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on Japanese DVD! It is not available in an English speaking country. Go figure. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent comments, so I put some tricks here, not that I am the final archive of the information related to this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to agree with a reviewer who claimed that you need 20 out of 10 Miyazaki films to review - they are so in their league that they make almost all of the IMDb catalogs that are combined with pale insignificant. <br /> <br /> The fascinating story of this film is that Miyazaki is based on the Slag's Ravine (Pazu Urban Area) in Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales in the early '80s (perhaps in the late 1970s) just after some major mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of student socialist movements in the sixties, he felt his difficulty. The struggle between city owners and pirates at first shows this empathy for the working person. On earth and clouds especially in this film, I am reminded of where I grew up because his film depicts a fantastic version of the mountains of the western islands of the British Isles. <br /> <br /> The island is, of course, Swift's genius Syrian 18th century novel - the story of Swift's book is deliberately ridiculous. Sky castle wyves Miyazaki together with myths like Atlantis and Babel Tower - I think architecture is based on the ruins of Peru, although I'm not sure anyone told me that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who goes around to read this review and who loves this movie really wants to watch the Miyazaki epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan, based on Alexander's short sci fi novel "The Incredible Rise" available online). Conan is basically the prototype of Laputa Pazu and Shita. In addition, you may not be familiar with his previous work for the Masterpiece Theater - some of his key frame animations. He also dealt with Sherlock Hound's key frame - it has some of the best backgrounds I've seen. See also Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun (1968). What else ... Gauche Cellist and Flying Ghost Ship - though they are quite rare. <br /> <br /> This movie is such a gift, I don't know what we would do with it. This is another capture of narration, it's like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
