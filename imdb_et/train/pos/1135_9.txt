I saw it for the first time in the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really in the movie, making the experience even more fun. This is a huge set of characters, many big names, some of which were not as well recognized today. I think this is a great idea if you follow one of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to the watch list. Some scenes really remind me of comedy that was well done, like Birdcage or even Clue, an odd spontaneously appearing comedy that is truly professional by their beloved actors. The film did an excellent job giving you some insight, perhaps even a very realistic, day-to-day soap culture.
