There are a number of things that are not right, although it is not too important, because what happened to someone and when there is still a dispute. The most obvious freedom with the facts I think is when they start playing Bruno Koschmidder's Kaiserkeller when they actually played in Indra and later moved to Kaiserkeller. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was biased in favor of Pete Best, but when he is a story consultant, I think he calls the frames. I also agree with Semprin's assertion that the recordings of Pete Best play the last word about why he was fired. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not as big as a later movie "Backbeat", I prefer this movie because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with deeper characterization. <br /> <br /> The movie has quite a lot of importance - as Brian Epstein tries to hide from being "steadfast" to find out that the band knew he was Gay all the time. Small touches like the band goes to the cafe and orders "Corn-Flakes mit Milch". My favorite scene, which actually has some reason, is where Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass guitar while listening, but he can't play it, so he stands behind his impression and tries to cheat it, but gets stuck. It's a rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out.
