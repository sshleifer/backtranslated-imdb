I watched, entranced and mesmerized that vocal and physical acting. The roles played by each player were made to the highest standard. Words, words, every gesture, sunrise announced it all. The film told me. It shed light on the different perceptions of the person believing in humanity. Who believes in peace and delicate behavior. I also had disbelief, sacrifice, and depiction of human dignity. Power without grace, demented and without feelings. To be human, it is so incredible. This film made me so scared of people who are no longer in this world. And I think they are sad. I like this film for conversations and facial expressions. Let this film be blessed.
