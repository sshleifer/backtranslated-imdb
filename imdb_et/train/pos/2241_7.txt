Another comedy from strange small countries fighting in the jungle of the global world of today (the forties), with only a native spirit and a blow to steer them, is a good entry into Ealing's cannon. Terry-Thomas shines as usual, as the exclusive ministry man led to the edge of the catastrophe, when the country he allegedly is responsible for attracting the world's interests, Ian Bannen takes a big romantic lead, Peter Sellers puts one of his quiet performances as a corrupt politician and uber-suave John John Le Mesurier plays the opposite revolutionary member. A lot of fun is everything, especially the viewer; perhaps not at the top of the classics of Ealing's classics, but rather high.
