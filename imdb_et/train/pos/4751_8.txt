I have no idea why so many IMDb users are causing such friction (some say it is his "worst movie". "What? Has anyone of you seen Cradle 2 Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is completely stupid and just excuse to hang up all the actions Duh! What kind of mess do you expect from Jet Li? Did you honestly believe that someone thought about this story, just downloaded it by action? Of course not! Black mask is fantastic, wall wall -Activities almost all this working time, it is also delicious, and we get a lot of interrupted limbs, losses and creative ways to watch bad boys (and quite a few innocent people!) Killed. Most of Li's other martial arts are kindergarten compared to black mask; there is no recall for free from violence, bloodshed or sequences of action! And it made me a happy camper. Again: when you go to Jet Li's movie, waiting for a great dialogue and intriguing plot, then you go for the wrong reasons. The black mask is likely to be the favorite of his films (but be cautious about scary copying).
