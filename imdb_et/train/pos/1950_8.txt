Diane Keaton has been playing on the big screen for many years, but she is mostly known as "light and fluffy" with Woody Allen, like Annie Hall. He deserves the Oscar for the best actors in the drama of this endeavor, and it is not really important what was the year in which it was first shown. Try and find a scene where it doesn't appear. And it was all a difficult drama, at a pace of exhausting and restarting, action, all at speed. Make-up made her as young as possible and fit even in close-ups with the 30-year-old, but she played half of her age and very quickly. The film was pretty well done, staged and shot well with strong support, but Keaton was carrying the burden.
