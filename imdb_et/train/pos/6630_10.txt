This is an important film. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. Here's a lot of fun. The director seems to be interested in some of the more tired film arrangements. Unlike the recent American film, this film is interested in what it means to make a movie. The DVD includes many bonus features and there are two comments explaining the movie that the viewers are still watching for the first time. When the film was filmed at Sundance, it made more than a few audiences inconvenient and angry. It's a Sunday morning coffee film, not a friday evening. For a dedicated viewer, this is a treasure trove.
