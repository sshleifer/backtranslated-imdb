Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman who has been fully and reliably introduced, despite the fact that she is unlikely to be bound. She does everything to do her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. So it shows a rather sweet value system under the vicey exterior. The film has a steep and unexpected end that after all feels completely inadequate, as comfort is known by ending its school's creative writing exercise 'and then I woke up'. It also ends up with the other end with the most eccentric headline I've ever seen, but don't let it in any way put you down.
