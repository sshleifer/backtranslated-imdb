It is a very well-made film that is carefully targeted and has a great character that sometimes works deeply - for example, a loyal but complex sidekick with a policeman and his wife's scene. The plot is convincingly developed and exciting. The character of Gangster is particularly interesting and plays a nearly metaphysical role in the life of the hero. It is clear that police officers are as harsh and prepared as the stars of the underworld. <br /> <br /> A few small reservations: I found that the end is somewhat one-sided because it marks the successful integration of the hero into the police and the judiciary, which destroys the vagueness of the police characters, which has been preserved so far. I also found a somewhat weak female woman: little more than a hero's rescue catalyst, everything she seems to have done is crying and sweating as the harsh boys fight.
