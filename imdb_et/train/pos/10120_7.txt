The film begins with something less hyperkinetic, more pasticidal, or dead: the strange underground action takes place when the police detect the body. But when a policeman is killed, one Tatsuhito is involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is involved, things get pretty fast. <br /> <br /> Earlier work at Miike, Shinjuku Triad Society is still full of my usual I was in ultraviolet and sadistic sex acts, although it is not one of his eclectic or terrible pieces. Rather, it is a pretty well-designed little bit of cellulose fabrication, because Tatsuhito digs his way through the underground, a labyrinth that leads him to the gay-triad leader who sells illegally obtained body organs from Taiwan and keeps almost the brothel from the young boys (especially one who initially policeman kills). Tatsuhito's brother is related to society, so that Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty policeman and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this bright area. <br /> <br /> What's that little bit about working with it? is the relationship that Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito was born in China and later returned to Japan and alienated for it. Wang is a Chinese who was alienated from China, killing his father and developing a wing of crime in Japan. Wang is also surprisingly the character of Shakespearia, which is rather strange, as it is, much less that you really start to make him sad when his final capture with Tatsuhito comes. And Tatsuhito himself is like a tragic figure when he is forced to fight for his inability to lead his brother. While it would be unlikely that Miike's films are successful in terms of shock value, it is true that sometimes it is easy to lose how well Miike can create bitter, embarrassing signs. <br /> <br /> - PolarDiB
