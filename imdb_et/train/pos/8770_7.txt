I thought you would believe me in good shape. It is true that this is not life. The whole thing in Oirish becomes quite thick, but you'll enjoy it here - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, and so on. All good. I also liked seeing the Mike Mazurki course where he played the boxer, what else? Typical forty flicks are familiar consecutive faces and fast-paced scenes. <br /> <br /> Flynn is good as a gentleman, Jim, you will never miss a 1-dimensional view of him. , but it's okay, it's a cartoon and it's meant to please. Boxing scenes were pretty good, Ward Bond's vaudeville logging is a rebellion, and you liked to see all those billiard clubs who use the racing scene a few times. <br /> <br /> Really nice, Flynn was a roll at that time and it is clear why the viewers loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
