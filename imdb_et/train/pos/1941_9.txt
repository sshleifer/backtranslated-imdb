I thought it was a comedy and I sat watching that she was waiting for my ass to laugh. quite soon it became clear that it was not a comedy or at least not a "Jim Carrey" type. What we looked at was the characters - the film starts with a somewhat gloomy and restless person who gathered to try to fight one of his main fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. we'll see a little bit of our lives, see their worries, guess their thoughts. <br /> <br /> In fact, I made it much darker than it really is, and, in addition to the chain of events, soon brings light and I hope their life would have been. <br /> <br /> I probably wouldn't have been watching the movie to know it was not comedy, but rather a drama, but I had a good time enjoying this story and not minding me spending about 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Many movies treat alienation among Western people, this movie shows how people can come together and help each other <br /> <br /> "and when you die, when you meet him, don't let him pass you and leave, don't release him, he's your gift from the sun ... "<br /> <br /> Peace and love
