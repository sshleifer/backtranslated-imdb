I don't want to spend a long time with the hero here - you've seen a trailer, and if you haven't been online. I do not recommend it - it was badly designed and did not offer the smile or magic of the film. So those who avoid this movie because of their bad trailer should give this opportunity. It's really funny. The intelligence and originality of this film blown me away. The first 40 minutes were on my hysterical floor - my only problem was that it turned into a bad Austin Powers movie in the 20's. However, this is one of the few movies where the end of campy wasn't a pleasant movie for me (which is usually). Everyone gives a great result (especially Joan Cusack) and there are really great moments. I personally plan to see it again when it comes out only when I try all the details I smiled at the first time I was watching!
