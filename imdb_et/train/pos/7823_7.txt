Long-lasting but convincing retelling of friendship between Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first side of the film is the strongest one where we see the bond between the two men and how they help each other, but the other half is not as strong as the loss of Biko's character. However, it is a movie with great performances by Kline and Washington that put it on the map. Washington was also named for the first time as the best supporter. In general, it is a well-made film that could have cut a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
