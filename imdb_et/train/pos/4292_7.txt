I didn't know anything about the movie before watching the movie, and I think it was a "no expectation" factor that helped me first to tolerate and later like more than I thought. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. The style had gaps / jumps that I think throw the audience a bit. There is no big soundtrack in the background, creating a "romantic" atmosphere. But they were not all important. <br /> <br /> Emma's and Luis's chemistry was just fine. There was some unexplained strange chemistry I couldn't resist; I loved it and I'm here writing this review. The subtle portrayal of love by both parties was great and I believe it is the core of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a daily romantic comedy; In fact, we do not understand all of this. I had to sit for a while and then I started to understand slowly what little things I didn't do. I can't guarantee that everyone likes it, but I hope you do it.
