Many people have commented that this movie wasn't nearly as good as the first one. Well, maybe it's not for you. But how does your child react to it? Well, my loved it more than the first one. <br /> <br /> The Disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for young children. (For example - Bambi's mother got hit.) This movie was really great for my sensitive girl who likes humor and happy ends. <br /> <br /> If you want to be nervous about what Disney standards should be based on the past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a soft-hearted little boy you really want, buy this movie and treat your little kids. This movie is great as a bedtime movie as a nightmare instead of horrible dreams. I'm happy with the film my child likes and doesn't have to impress my parents all the time.
