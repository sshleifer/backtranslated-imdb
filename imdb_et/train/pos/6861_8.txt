Comparing what Brian De Palma did in the 80's, what contemporary entertainment is, his films look better and better. "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are all excellent filmmaker's work at the top of their powers. It is a pure Hitchcock, with its 80-bit dashed perversions, a delicately spoken story and a murder story that has many twists, great style aids, a stunning Pino Donaggio score, and a tricky, giallo-inspired plot. Camera-work and luscious blood-smudged visuals help to overcome logical holes, while Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (good director himself), Nancy Allen (at that time De Palma's husband) and Michael Caine make great results. Particularly special virtuoso takes you to the surreal, frightening, erotic charged odyssey and enjoys every "Dressed To Kill" frame.
