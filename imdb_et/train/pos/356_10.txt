It was referred to as a stylish production with a low budget. The number of characters is amazing, from ax-driven dwarfs to 7 feet! I liked the relationship between the leaders, not too sentimental, but romantic enough to keep the interests going. I also liked the mix of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much / not enough), which meant it didn't get too dark or too buggy. It was a major step forward in Eves' other efforts, from Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, to style and production. They have a great website to look at. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of recovery continues, it should be fantastic.
