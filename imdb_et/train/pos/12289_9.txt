First of all, I would like to point out that I have not read the book, so I had no chance of being disappointed with this aspect. The biggest mistake I noticed was the historical detail, several cars, the train, the clothes, and so on. I don't think it belongs at that time. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical side of the movie is ok, nothing is talking. But I think the action was terrible. I have no experience, but I can't believe how people find it terrible! Maybe they've only seen two movies (never before) and the other one must be really good! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons and really understand his character, someone who got up on a social ladder with hard work, fights against those who would take his life work out of him, only he gets in the fight, he doesn't understand why is it no longer next to him, and he comes to a beaten, frustrated person. The irons made it so plausible, I feel my character despite my brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also a wonderful romantic young woman pulled by her boyfriend (Banderas) for revolutionary ideals. I thought he was retarded, and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average score, it wasn't bad, just didn't meet the standards of other players. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actress, with so many stars. <br /> <br /> Unlike today's movies, here only interpretations, only people, but at the same time, it's not a real film, too worried, trying to be intellectual. The best proof I really liked, I write a review 7 years later.
