I agree with another user and say it is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever! I looked at it as a child and loved it completely! Scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really think of this man because he is being treated as a drunk. Nice humor and fantastic kung fu this movie stones! If you like Kung Fu, you would love it !!!
