There are movies and movies. Movies are mostly cinematic "candies", while movies are real works of art. The Fraulein Doctor is definitely the last one. Like most viewers, I was very impressed with the scenes of the battle, but the imagination of the central character is what I consider to be the most important quality of the film. Fraulein has died all the time in morphine addiction, despite all his efforts, after making every effort to serve his country as a true Deutschland daughter. The scene where the Doctor is delivered to the back of Mercedes Benz's command, alone, empty and loot, is probably one of the saddest but truly beautiful examples of "spies" life. Only the emotional pain that Richard Burton put in the cold spy is near. Fraulein Doctor is a much deeper film than individual viewing. I just want his producers to see it on the DVD, so those who never experienced it, and those who would see it, could (again and again) enjoy this extraordinary movie again.
