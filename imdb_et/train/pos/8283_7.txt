Strong B-film. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. His undervalued handover is refreshing at a time over the top races. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked family dynamics. Wendigo looks silly, but it's a child's toy and dead deer. It's like joining, look? This is a psychological story, not Freddy slash em up with instant joy flick. Look at it and think about your inner child and what the film can tell you and you have a good one. <br /> <br /> Nice job.
