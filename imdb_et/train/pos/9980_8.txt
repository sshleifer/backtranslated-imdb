Every movie that shows federal PIGs (individuals in government offices) that they are mad threats that they are in real life is a lot to recommend to me. sometimes management is wrong, so there are people who scatter the whole movie and ignore the good moments. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it. I thought it was a terrible and irrational spam. <br /> <br /> Now I don't remember why. <br /> <br /> I think these two should not be compared or even combined. <br /> <br /> Note that these are two different films. <br /> <br /> Rate them as two different films. <br /> <br /> This "disappearance point" offers a rallying place, a banner for people who want to encourage individuality, who believe in human rights, who are at risk of freedom, can be, and are, especially the federal government. of New Hampshire: "Live Free or Die". At one point it would have been the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite the obvious mistakes, "Vanishing Point" is a movie that delights.
