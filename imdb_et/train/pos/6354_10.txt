jim carrey can do anything. I thought it was a childish film, and it wasn't completely. it was so incredibly funny for EVERYONE, adults and kids. I ever saw it almost out of theaters, and now it has finally come out on a DVD on Tuesday and I'm as excited as you can see. you should definitely see it, if you haven't already, it was so big! <br /> <br /> Liz
