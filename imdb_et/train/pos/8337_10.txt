As a great fan of the romantic comedy genre and because we saw a large number of these films, it is rare that I am completely unique. That is why it is just as rare that I have to breath through several scenes through laughter. The love story is a bit thin on the spot, but I would say it is probably the best because this romantic comedy is firmly emphasized in "comedy" and in any case stretches the limits of credibility just a little more than I like most rom com do. Four scientists offered some of the funniest moments not only in this movie, but also in every movie I've seen for a long time. I hesitated for short moments before finally choosing "10" over "9" because I believe that too many people are using it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating will lose some effect. I am also a big fan of Meg Ryan that helps, but it is one of the few movies I've seen where I would say he has been thoroughly overshadowed. He and Tim Robbins are cast as leaders, but for me, the second violin plays on the manifestations of worshiping intellectuals. The real ridiculous-loud type of film.
