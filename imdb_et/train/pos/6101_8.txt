So I won't destroy it for you, I'm very short. Attractive pain is some great actors and funny lines. The young graduate of Harvard Med School (Brian White) finds that he does not know as much as he thinks of people. She goes to a small hospital in Florida for her practice because her girlfriend (Mya) left her as a television producer. His elder (Wood Harris) helped his creative partner (Zoe Saldana) admire him to speed up. They help protect their careers and show them broader opportunities that result from a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be the case with many of my pre-med friends).
