The people's castle has been placed in one of these settlements built in Jerry, in free areas and in the park, which at that time was called Hooverville, which was named after its regrettable 31st president, who was left behind by his great depression. The proposition of this film is that the man's home is still his castle, even if it is just in the courtyard of Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has such a hit and the truth is that this guy, even in good times, wouldn't work that much. But to Trace, before he was elected a priest in San Francisco, at the beginning of classical roles, he plays a tough good natural mug that takes Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> One of the people in the castle is that it shows the effects of depression on both women and men. Women had some additional strains for them when men had trouble finding a job, women were twice as hard. And they had sexually harassed and some used prostitution only to eat square. Spence takes Loretta Young, who faces these challenges and does not make her own castle demands. Pretty soon, though they're in love, though Tracy isn't the one to live on. Loss. And both were Catholic and married, and these days it was an insurmountable obstacle to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously. <br /> <br /> Walter Connolly is also cast as a father's figure in the entire camp, Marjorie Rambeau, who has been through all the pitfalls young people may encounter and try to lead him clearly and Arthur Hohl, a truly incredible slip with also eye on Young. Hohl brings the mansion's peak to its peak. The look of a man's castle is a great depression, not an ordinary film-espionage reward for those who try to avoid such a reality in entertainment.
