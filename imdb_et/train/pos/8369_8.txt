Hrm-I think this line comes from old movie posters. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie that seems to have been translated from a language that was completely unknown to the translator. Tip: Every movie that starts with a black screen and reads text in the "Future ..." is fun. This means that the assumption is so unlikely that they will have to explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "in the future ..." means that countries are attacking countries rather than fighting wars. giant robots and dukes to find out, well, it's never very clear, but it's probably something very important. There are good guys (probably capitalists, ie "us") and bad guys (Commies!) And there are big stop-motion robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the impact budget was pretty thin, so we don't see many big robots. There are many cheap looking interior scenes and then a great space fight to the end. The fight against space is particularly nice because it serves just another purpose than the impact of the impact on the rest of the budget. <br /> <br /> As the money is now spent, the climatic struggle will worsen (and I will not do it) two guys who hit each other. I can always laugh at the bar to finalize the scene, with the last line that leaves all the audience scratching their heads. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
