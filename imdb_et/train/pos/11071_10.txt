I give ten out of ten, one of the best films. Absolutely shattered, stunned and enchanted by the whole picture, the wonderful Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the whole team playing, the amazing plot ... Just look at yourself and let your courage admit - it touched your soul as it is weird but has all the answers you have never been looking ... Best, mr. Ritchie! VERY BETTER EVER. Those looking for simple figs and stopping are screaming that they are disappointed. But Hollywood has a lot of movies today, you don't remember what was about the next day you saw it. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I can hardly expect to be able to portray a clear and genius image of myself, anyone who would look at it. Absolutely insurmountable, amazing, dazzling ... This can be seen, I have no doubt. In fact, no word can express your admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy Hollywood garbage we watched. Thank you all very heart, that's just the best.
