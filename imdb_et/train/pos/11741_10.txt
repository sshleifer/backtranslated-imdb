This gently made crafted production was deeply bitter in my being. Irresistible pupils, a lost bus driver, and the personalities of teachers present an unconscious discussion when the story is introduced. Adult characters seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each of their opinions is so plausible and well-known. When the main incident occurs on the bus, they are sent to the point of view. All the time, the energy of teenagers is only controlled by the organizers of control. Mr. Harvey experiences all the pain. He reminds me of the teachers who have been damaged by war, whom I do not understand when I was very successful. Rhidian Brook and the manufacturers deserve this excellent design of the British film. An unknown, inappropriate scene, it should be widely available, but it seems that he has not been given the right opportunity.
