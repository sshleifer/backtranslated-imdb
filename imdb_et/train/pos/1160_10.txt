It's funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but the man it's funny. Kline and Fields are great. (His toss-off line "God, you're so shameful" when he climbs in his window - great! He explains who he really is ... soap opera changes when everyone was one! Alone worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> Don't solve any of the world's problems and don't see the beautiful source (hope) of daily TV.
