I loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I got a copy of it. This film had so many emotions and felt so real that I really sympathize. Every time I watch it, it ends up crying. I can really identify the busy Phillip character and how I feel the same thing would have happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all high schools should be showing this movie. do the same. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Especially those affected by school learning. <br /> <br /> It's really the biggest movie ever.
