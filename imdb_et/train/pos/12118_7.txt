When I saw that the film was just 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble. The gigantic W. Somerset Maugham novel condensed to the film, the watches of which were hours and a half, seemed like a catastrophe that awaits. But you know that the movie is not half bad, and even manages to keep a lot of what makes the book so resonant with its readers. <br /> <br /> I've heard many film fans complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodle actor and she was, but I can't think of anyone who fits Philip Carey's role as a wet noodle, because that's definitely what Carey is. Howard plays him well, which means you want to shake him repeatedly and hit him on the head, then take him out and buy him back. <br /> <br /> Ah, and then there is Bette when the girl to whom Carey is obsessed and who brings her world around her. I didn't know what on earth was Mildred's appeal to the book, and the film remains on that detail. But as Davis played, he becomes the most fascinating story and, if he is disgusting and unlikely, he is at least a more dynamic person at any time on the screen. Davis's performance here is credited with changing the way the screen works, as Brando does almost 20 years later when he shouted "Stella !!" In this little-known Tennesee Williams game it is not hard to see why. Davis is daunting. He does not make an effort to give the audience sympathy, and he promises to look ugly and strangely. Its appearance, when Carey walks at the end of the film, to find a dead or unnamed disease almost dead (though not much care to hide the fact that it is STD), is shocking. Of course, this film helps to stretch out before the production guide comes into force; if it was done a year later, you can bet that things are a little different. <br /> <br /> Yes, much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts remain on the floor of the cutting room, and the story really changes about Carey and Mildred and much more. I found this to be the least interesting and tedious part of the Maugham novel, but that is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be part of what the readers are still attracting, so that it makes a reasonable decision for the filmmakers to they decided to adapt the novel as they did. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
