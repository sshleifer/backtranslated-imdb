Popular sports enjoyed surfing many people. Just after watching the documentary, I realized how dangerous it could be. In fact, surfers are also afraid of waves. Even someone could kill it. But they were still surfing and enjoyed themselves. Only brave people can do it. <br /> <br /> According to what the surfers said, we can clearly know what they felt, how big the wave came to them. You have to adapt to your best and avoid a direct strike on a big wave. If you win, it will probably bring you great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Amazing cinematography cannot be forgotten. This is completely visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> A great sports documentary. 8/10
