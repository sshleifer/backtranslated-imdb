I would start by saying that I am very pleased with the top of Bourne's trilogy. Please, do not destroy it if you do it for years or prequel. Leave it alone. Right ... moving on. As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it seems he was just meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed with the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how well all the data we receive under "Identity" and "Supremacy" are all "Ultimatum" meshes to finally paint Jason Bourne's anxious past. The sequences are fast paced and keep you on the edge of your seat. The battle between Bourne and the assassins is always fun to watch. I have always been a fan of films around CIA agents and how the CIA collects its Intel and this movie is on the street, making it even more exciting. <br /> <br /> If you choose the Ultimate Bourne View without previous 2 installments. You look at the movie thoroughly, but I would recommend looking at them first. This would allow you to fully understand and become a character of Jason Bourne and be part of your world. This will make the movie even more appreciated and enjoyable. I'm not sure what's better from the first 2, but I think the "ultimatum" can only be trilogy compared when I am right.
