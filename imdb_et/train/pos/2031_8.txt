Such a masterpiece, as the first of these two films from the Snow of the Snow, was the follow-up to the Lumel River man everything to watch. It does not break its predecessor's toes, preferring to leave the legend that was the first film to live in a unique immortality. <br /> <br /> The man on the snow from the river II is based on Jim Craig's return after three years of snowfall. The film tells the story of changes in the 19th century, Australian history, legend and horses. The story shows the touch of Hollywood in lighter shades, which was completely inadequate in the first film, but it is unique to the special feeling of Australian patriotism. The plot is much more lively than the first film and much more expressive, with some aspects of the previous film, but the person on the II snow river has all the basic features of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, the stunning focus of Australia's highest country, the second most impressive film material ever filmed, and the fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack of Bruce Rowland, which first equals first. Geoff Burrowes has done a great job with this film, and it is very worthy of recognition, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian film industry. Tom Burlinson's and Sigrid Thornton's leadership and well-replaced Brian Dennehy carry their parts as much passion and distinction as the first film. As for the aftermath, the man is a masterpiece of snow from the river II; a deeply moving and inspiring experience.
