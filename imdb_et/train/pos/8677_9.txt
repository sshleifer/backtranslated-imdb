This movie looks good when the time Tom and Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things have been idyllic for some time, but it is predictably sour. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless struggle involving a tube, a frying pan and a baseball bat, which two plus Butch dogs are involved in at the beginning of a short period. I liked one heap and you should try it on Cartoon Network.
