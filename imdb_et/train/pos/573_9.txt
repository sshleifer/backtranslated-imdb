I've always enjoyed movies that depict life as it is. Life is sometimes a dull patch, there is no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending. "This river runs through it" is the ideal name for this movie (and the Norman Maclean novel). Life shifts and flows like a river and has rough spots, but it's a great trip. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the movie. His story has a friendly feeling that fits perfectly with the picture. As a director, he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the actor, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well as brothers. I don't know how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances except that they feel really real. "The river passes through it" is a great movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
