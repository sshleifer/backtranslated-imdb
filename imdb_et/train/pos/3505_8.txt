I have no idea how IMDb sorts the comments, but I know that, as is often the case at Amazon.com, there is a remarkable number of very negative comments on this film that repeat the same, somewhat hidden speech points, almost literally. Campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> For this movie: it's good. It's a funny, cute and very simple movie. <br /> <br /> It has been over ten years since working in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited relatives in South Bronx. But I didn't find anything wrong or exploiting about these children. Does Grandma Have a Odd Character? Yep. Does dialogue and plot recognize it? Yes, thankfully they do. Are there any other films in LES that include Dominican / Puerto Rican children? You betcha. Does this make this movie a crime? like some (my eyes, astroturf) comments would show? Hardly. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom. <br /> <br /> It's better than any Degrass JR episode. High or Degrassi high. Beating off the comparison, but never had it, and I touch the core of this film with the humility of purpose and gentle spirit. <br /> <br /> That means I'd like to know that this background is behind this search! :-D
