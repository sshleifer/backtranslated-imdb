It could have been better if it was led by someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it is not a big piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie. I loved it because the local channels show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. His novels and stories were made of pretty bad films. (Many love The Fallen Idol, but I am not among them. I think I saw "Brighton Rock" once a year ago and liked it, but maybe I just mean a novel.) It's perfectly cast. Charles Boyer is not, it's true like Spain. But he seems to be the perfect temperament for this character - tired, careful, caring. Lauren Bacall is a British girl who falls for her. But supporters are the best: Katina Paxinou is great. His performance is a small Grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we meet for the first time, gives Boyer a lesson in the Esperanto-type universal language, as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix can break the hardest heart. He comes over as an early adolescent. This sign wants to be helpful. He does his best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservation. The reservation is primarily that it is small. But this story and action can hardly be improved.
