So, it's coming in a few weeks, but it's here. Mostly, this is due to the statements of the various negative beings. From technology. When Star Trek: TOS ran, the special effect technology was very small and even more so the team had little money to make any correct pictures. At the age of 35 at TOS, the Star Trek team has become an economic expert. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, they have decided, in my opinion, to give up the look of TOS and the opposite of TNG. all. What if they decided that the carrier wouldn't make a golden spark or that the phase guns saw Star Trek II? As for picking nipples from the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was assumed that Kirk and Riker commented that the Earth met Klingon in 2200. Nothing was firmly fixed. <br /> <br /> The company gives us the most promising research site we've seen for a while. That could be Voyager. No series can evolve without some contradictions, but be grateful that Star Trek has so little. So, give up grabbing and enjoy.
