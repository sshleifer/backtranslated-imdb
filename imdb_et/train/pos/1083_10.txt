Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. A performance worthy of the Oscar, which was once occupied by the Academy. Mr Grant runs a stupid competition in this great comedy about a man who decides to go out of town. The home-building traps are well chronic and became the basis (loosely) of today's Tom Hanks vehicle "The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you like good old-fashioned comedy without being a passionate and free movie, this movie must be visible.
