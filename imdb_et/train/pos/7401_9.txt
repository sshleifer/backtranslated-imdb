I found it very interesting that the film managed to bridge the gap between its American culture and its initiator, the Chinese culture. It becomes a story of values ​​and causes the observer to make his own choices in life and loyalty to the institutions. Surprisingly, he managed to do it in a gentle, lightly humorous way, which only threatens afterwards to threaten his status quo. I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if I could.
