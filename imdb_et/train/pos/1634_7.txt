First of all, I first captured the movie in HBO (probably) in 1981 and 15 years old, I thought the movie was fun. I remember not seeing the images of Alfred E. Neuman on the trailer trailers. When the MAD Magazine film sat down and stopped the half-apologies for the "normal gang" to make himself a satire, I just assumed that they would beat myself, which I am sure they were, but to find them seriously (and Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credit, I was quite surprised. There are certainly a lot of bad movies. Watching the movie on the video now (at age 32) with the MAD reference was restored, but I get out of it. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, where is Poppa?), Then I think it's his jewelery (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
