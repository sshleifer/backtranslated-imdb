Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their faith in such credibility, just cried. The role of Glenn Close in Ruthina showed that he wanted to solve the situation, but he was under his wife's domination. "Let him think about what he did," said Robert Duvall's character, Joe. The story depicted a family of rural people, who are dealing with their brother's accidental death, called "stone boy", which means he was so upset and puzzled by what he did, emotionally bad. Then at the end, when Jason Presson's character Arnold, it all made it out to strangers, I was so cordial about him that I actually thought of some terrible things I did in my life. I personalized and identified my character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs did not add much to the film. I was thinking of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's controversial, feminine brother Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a madman who made Arnold around for his frustration and blamed him for his worries. I was not very sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to keep his marriage together, he had failed. Both did not deal effectively with these problems. They really didn't do anything for the movie and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's small role as grandfather was his only touch, which showed Arnold no attention. I felt that his role should have been developed. Players did exactly what they felt was enough and sufficient. But I really liked the end so much that I actually smiled and cried out with tears. I felt good. Hillermans were a family again. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
