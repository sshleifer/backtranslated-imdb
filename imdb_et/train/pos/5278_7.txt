What begins as a conflict in the generation of this film ends with understanding, solemnity, and grace. The film is leaning across Europe, where father and young son are in the car for over 3,000 miles. The cramp forces life style, beliefs and life skills to collide. There is no really clear winner. Ultimately, it adds experience, multi-life experience. For those who are interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle prospect without being on the agenda. The young son has come to an age story, his rejection and rebellious nature turning to openness to get more lifestyle.
