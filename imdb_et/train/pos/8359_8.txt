Bertrand Blier is really French cinema terrible, and in the seventies he could always be shocked by the public. Filmed with his foolduo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and regular sex (Miou-Miou plays his typical role, at least in the seventies, when we know that ten years later he would be the best French actor). The first "Les Valseuses" also has one of the first highways as the viewer is just a few of the few little criminals on their way. Those who are only happy with family life or do not know anything more would be quite shocking about the film, but this movie is more than just that, it just lets you think about all the things you do in life (working with a car, working with a car). workplace, etc.). It is kind of critical to the hypocrisy society we live in. Great work and it just wants two things: Dewaere died too young because she was a topactor and of course Depardieu, she would be better off in French if she proves that no one can beat her. Timeless classic and 20 years later it still shocked ...
