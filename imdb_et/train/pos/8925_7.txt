This film is for some of us who were born in the early years after the war, with almost a definition of the generation (and especially when you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending on your neighborhood dwelling on Saturday afternoon) almost certainly saw it. And the memory of seeing it is probably left with you. It is a style that is short and somehow brilliant in our growing days. <br /> <br /> It was a modern space-era symbol for the audience of that time. The set was any city with a supermarket and a cinema packed for a Friday midnight show. It has hot rods and rebellious youth, but "why can't they have fun with us", not disturbed, hysterical rebels, without reason. All the characters were recognizable to us - teenagers, parents, old man, doctor, nurse, mechanic, boy, puppy, even the police - we liked. We can associate them all. <br /> <br /> He had an extremely terrible monster. This is the first victim who hears it hurt because it hurts ... and it was painful and we were convinced and scared. Threat grows steadily throughout the story. McQueen has intense breaks, colorful effects, fabulous lead and humor, if not. He even had an almost overflowing sad part to make us crying more sensitive. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the summer, at the age of 9, or so, double-billed with "I was married to the outer space" and was so excited about the experience of this double function that I went a few more times before he left. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved it.
