It's pretty well known, so I'm not going too deep. The main story is about two teenagers who find that a meteoric alien arrives on earth. Human exposure to the mucus ball burns through the meat like acid. It also absorbs human organs, making it larger. Nobody believes in teenagers (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do, it seems that the blob cannot stop. It's really well done for this age, and unlike many other 50's, the pace is pretty fast. The story is very unique, changing it and seeing all kinds of old sci-fi and monster movies. If you can complain about the horror of 80's whores, be sure to check out '88.
