The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a massive documentary about Persian family Persian migration. Twice a year, rivers and mountains cross over 50,000 people and half a million animals to pasture. After seeing these cattle see ice-cold water, you feel like a pampered weakness and walk through barefoot snow to cross the mountains, trying to walk their animals on steep and narrow mountain tracks.
