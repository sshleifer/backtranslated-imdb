Preston Waters is a bad summer. In addition to your birthday, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> First of all, he has to share his room with his brothers who start running the business. They can't do it on their premises because they don't have enough space. To turn off a birthday party, he only gets $ 6, while others get $ 32, $ 35, and even $ 50. If one of his birthday cards arrives early, he gets only $ 11. <br /> <br /> To go to the bank, he learns he needs at least $ 200 to create an account. When leaving the bank, the check steals the check. After the boy is almost Quirley (played by Miguel Ferrer), he almost goes out (surely his bicycle will be destroyed). Quigley has just come from the bank to give the owner $ 1,000,000 to give this man tomorrow. Quigley starts checking for injuries, but manages to write only his name before the police car is surrounded. Fear, he gives Preston control, tells him he's giving his father to stop. <br /> <br /> This evening, Preston tells his father he doesn't want a new bike, he wants his own room back, better his house. His father is confined to his room for the rest of the night. Preston figures do not get worse than he understands that he has forgotten control because it is still in his pocket. It's empty. <br /> <br /> With a computer, and after careful consideration, he will make it out to $ 1,000,000. The next day, trying to cash in the bank, he will be put on the owner who thinks he is the person he should give $ 1,000,000. He's not because the real person named Juice arrives in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Now three of them have to watch Preston. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Preston has fun buying all sorts of things, including his own house, and even dates with a hidden bank lady who really is an FBI agent (who tries to track 3 bad boys). He makes this man named Mr. Macintosh who works for him and even plans his party on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But things finally end up (run out of money, bad guys get him). In general, it's a pretty funny flick. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you enjoyed her with another Stakeout, you love her here. He does all kinds of evil crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (Ghost boss boss) plays a wonderful friendly driver in this movie.
