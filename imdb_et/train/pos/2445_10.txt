I like this show. That's why I was disappointed to find out recently that George Lopez was racist and that he unleashed the Masiela Lusha exhibition just because he discovered he was not an emigrant of Latino but an emigrant from Albania. I learned it from people in exhibitions. He was really one of the best parts of the show and so to learn that even among those who think they would be sensitive to racism, they may be disappointed, just because of the country in which they were born.
