Okay, but just dark. Not bad for horror / comedy. I read how people exchanged it with the Michael version, and I think this is a good trick because some adult women hate horror and when they see it, they get interested in horror movies like this, or maybe (never seen) horror (maybe comedy) Uncle Sam, I have to see renting or buying this movie, but the other is better than that, but I bought it from Amazon's VHS and got it on November 21st, a day before thanks. worth four bucks, l.o.l. on this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
