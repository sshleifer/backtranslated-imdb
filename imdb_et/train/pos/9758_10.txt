Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! no, i'm not 10 .. i'm 30! I own the old, original VHS that I bought from the rental area. I've been watching it countless times. <br /> <br /> If it's a fun movie for kids, it's an interesting movie for adults. I saw this movie that I was .. wasn't sober. my eyes opened for things I haven't noticed before. I saw strong encouragement of morality, both publicly and somewhat sublimatively. I wish I remembered all the things I noticed, but since then it has been a very long time. you can rest assured that the whole film has tonals. if you have the opportunity to watch it .. not sober .. do it, you will not be disappointed .. indeed you will feel quite happy and warm. <br /> <br /> Unique and wonderful!
