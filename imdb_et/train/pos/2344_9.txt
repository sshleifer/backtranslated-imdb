I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep their feelings private. Daisies pushing is my exception. I was curious about the programs that made the ad, which showed a glimpse of the premise of the show. I was first skeptical, especially after Six Feet Under was in the finals. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third, and all other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and was presented in a way that was tasty without getting sick. The characters were tempting and I like the idea that Ned's main character cannot literally touch the love of his life without the consequences of his death. <br /> <br /> Most characters want things they don't have. For a long time alongside Nedi and Chuck, Olive is Nedile. Lily and Vivian yearn for their niece Chuck, and Emerson is always longing for the financial benefits they understand from mysterious deaths. I think the characters are perfect and plausible. I like how Emerson, who is black, plays the rest of the characters because he is African-American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. I think the exhibition has enough romance for the romance and enough for the mystery buffs to do it. I just want the writers to get back to work so the show can evolve.
