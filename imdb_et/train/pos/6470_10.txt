This is one of the biggest "Our Gang" shorts of all time. Spanky is her sweetest and most fun, and the kids she gets to have a baby are also fun. Gang forces a small Spanky to look at all his little siblings. They are all opened during child protection because it is entertaining with the various things left to hang the fish from fishing posts. <br /> <br /> Spanky's look carries her big toy when her older companions are asked to be a babysitter, as well as her response - "Hey, where are you getting these things - I don't care for babies!" A little companion who says "remarkable" on the whole film, all the beautiful eyesight and Spanky, who tell the children about "all about Tarzan", add that it would be one of the best "our gangs".
