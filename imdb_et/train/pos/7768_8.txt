This gloriously hardened melodrama represents Douglas Sirk's highest tension. It avoids the clever sentimentality of "Everything in the Sky" and "Imitation of Life", and instead fever and overheated tension. Of course, it's all busy in a vibrant Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Basketball story has something to do with the friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack, which becomes a rival when Hudson grabs Lauren Bacall's affection, but who is really the focus of attention? Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her excellent result as a Stack Sister who takes the family business into her hands when no one else does it. The film is highlighted when this living child lives in his bedroom with a frantic dance that cannot withstand the limits imposed on him by middle-class dignity. As often happens in Sirk's movies, the scene is so involuntarily fun in its absurdity as it is, and still strangely moving in its effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Circus came closer than anyone else to turn a clean camp into high art, satisfying the Philistines. and high fingers at the same time in the same movies. He was a unique talent and I don't know that there has ever been another filmmaker like he is. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
