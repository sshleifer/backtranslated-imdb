Panic is a slick little pearl in the movie - you think you've just figured out this first half hour to be very happy to understand that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director. <br /> <br /> Film builds slowly, one quietly devastating scene after another. All of these are wonderfully William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most remarkable children's actor I '. I've seen for a long time, David Dorfman, like Macy's son, offering his traits as if they were completely thoughtless thoughts created in his mind. Rich and cost-effective, this movie will stay with you long after you choose a credit.
