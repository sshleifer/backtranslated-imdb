I've seen this movie some time ago after I ordered it for my friend, a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, although it was positive, which for me was Donnie Darko's "wtf?" factor after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, negative points are also positive. For me, the young girl in the movie was incredibly good and Dominic Monaghan did a good job. Unfortunately, I have no opinion on Daniel Burke who played Lonnie. It might just be me and I don't claim to be a serious critic, so I can't find enough qualified, but he just didn't seem convincing as an actor. But perhaps it is even more striking, because although I am not a critic, it is my attention. It is interesting, confusing and you should have seen it.
