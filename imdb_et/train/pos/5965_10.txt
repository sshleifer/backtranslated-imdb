I gave it 10 points out of 10. I love it so much. I am a child of the 80s and for many years completely heavy metal. These are the reasons why I like this movie so much. It is so cool to see the posters in the bedroom of the young (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (introducing the excitement of Exciter, the master of the mutant rise in the shock metal Impaler and Killing) is my business Megadeth). Also, FASTWAY's soundtrack is absolutely incredible and fits well with the plot. If you are a metal, TRICK or TREAT is your friend. Don't buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they're in the movie in a few seconds, watch it because the soundtrack and story that will take you back to the 80s. You are not the same person after.
