What a great movie! It resembles such great Disney classic family films in the 60s and 70s. I was so pleasantly surprised that, after the last 20 years, the absolute detritus has been defeated by Disney's live production teams. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute pleasure. The letters of the child were just such; professional and high quality participants. I have the most impressive quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was here a complete cytophantic * hyperbole * that ran a prison camp for distant boys. Siobhan Fallon was perfect as a star mother. <br /> <br /> I am not talking about the story here, because it makes little sense, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the exemplary quality was great! This work reminds you of being a child without having to be all candied or too gloomy. The deleted scenes on the DVD version were really the best. They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much. Although misuse referred to the final product, it was not fully shown. That was the best way. <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely pleasant movie to watch. <br /> <br /> It will be from 9/10 ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
