I saw this movie at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival, and I had the privilege of meeting with both directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all living and explicit in New Yorker. The film's title in Amsterdam was the River Hoia on its right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less visible. Equally important was the loving and gay relationship Tobias Schneebaum with the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion at the age of almost 80 and the inevitable departure was very mobile. I can highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is something other than a pedestrian.
