It's a very cool and largely thoughtful drama. For the film, I find it very impressive not only for the plot and for the excellent action, but for such a unique film. Most spy or war movies are full of British or mighty battles but not. It does not concern such a war, his war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, anybody who ever forgets to forget evil. When the war is over, Campell thinks he's going home, but his true heroic attitude must remain the secret of the government. Returning to America, Campell will meet Nazi supporters as well as Nazi enemies, providing interesting conflicts, both domestic and foreign. Nolte more than pulls the role and fits well with the plot he asks.
