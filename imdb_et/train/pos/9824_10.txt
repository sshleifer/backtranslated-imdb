This flick is an example of the condition of erotic B movies: bad porn movies without hardcore sex. This plot is not as bad as these things go; it includes a female lawyer who is trying to prove that her lover is innocent in killing her wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves something to be desired. Bad behavior, bad direction, bad face woman, bad sets, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scene. Filmmakers should learn the difference between dirty and erotic. They don't even have the common sense that Gabriella Hall is naked or in a state of love. <br /> <br /> How stupid is it?
