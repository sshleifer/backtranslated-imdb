I was a little young for that, but I had to see it. There are some great music that many people have mentioned, but nobody seems to think Angel is a very rare look that is now mostly ignored, but never quite popular with musical equipment. They carry "branded foxes of the twentieth century" as their white brand and apparently try to deviate from the camera's field of vision. Gregg Giuffria Keyboard is still highlighting the bands and probably never got a lot of hair! Cherie Currie (a former Runaways singer) starts a short but remarkable acting career here and is quite memorable for Jodie Foster and the rest. (His topless 3-D scenes in "The Parasite" and his UFO observations in "wavelength" kept us all watching him for a while). <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but it retains that period to make everyone look and wonder.
