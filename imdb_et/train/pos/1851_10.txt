I saw this movie in August in Milwaukee, WI, 27th National Black Journalists Association, the first public screening. THE FILM IS GREAT! Derek Luke is great as Antwone Fisher. This young actor is a very bright future. The actual Antwone Fisher did a great job of writing a movie and Denzel's direction is the right money. See it at the opening weekend. You don't have to be disappointed.
