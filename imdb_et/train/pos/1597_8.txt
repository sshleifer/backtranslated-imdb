This is a movie on a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can move on with its business if you fall on a large armchair for a few hours. Cher and Nicolas Cage's wonderful performances (as always) gently draw a plot. There are no crosses, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty paddle in New York. Family film in every sense and what deserves the praise he got.
