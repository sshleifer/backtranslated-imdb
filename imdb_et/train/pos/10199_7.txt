As a child, I loved this game. I played with my friend Andrew in the spring of 1993. I played Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it, we never seemed bored. Then the streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that it even existed. <br /> <br /> You will play as former police officers Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have come out of violence on their own. There are eight levels to work through a corrupt and corrupt city, led by evil Mr X. Beating all the bad guys and beating the end-race is fun. Level 4 (Bridge) was my stupid because you could drown the baddies into the holes in the river. You even have the chance to become Mr X right-hand person at the end of the game (price). This leads to a "bad end" where you get the syndicate boss. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery, because you destroy the syndicate on the journey to Mr. X, but never. Composer Yuzo Koshiro made absolute miracles with the limited technology of Sega Genesis. The main theme, first level, level 4 and final boss, are standout tracks. Like the Wii owner, I'm proud to have it on my console forever. But also on the street Rage 2, this is the first to make the first somewhat obsolete. <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> Medium graphics, but a nice background is represented in the comic book as a panel progress that matches the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great sounds. <br /> <br /> Easy to get around and set down hard. <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> In contrast to Rage's infinitely sophisticated streets 2. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI. Baddies often walk instead of you to fight. This is especially affectionate for level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> The lack of combined movements. <br /> <br /> Lack of effective weapons. <br /> <br /> Poor models are repeated far too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B-Sound A- Playing B- Enduring B-
