Three Sergeant of the British army deployed in India are sent out to stop the murder tribe known as Thuggees. One of the Sergeant, Cutter, takes away from the camp in search of the golden temple and is captured by Thuggees, led by the evil Guru. The regiment's sister Gunga Din goes to the camp to get help and the other two sergeants after him, but also shut. Now the Ambassador sends after three plenary sessions, but does not understand that they are trapped by the Thugees. But Gunga Din will save the day. A wonderfully made friend's film, although it is politically wrong today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give Jaffe very humorous and exciting performances as a title and Cianelli is very sinful as a Guru. Rating - 10 out of 10.
