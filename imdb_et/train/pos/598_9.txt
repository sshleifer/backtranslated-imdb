this is a fun fact i was a baby baby, one crib. :) I'm 19 years old. my parents took me to try this part, we lived in Texas. I think I only did it for 80 bucks, but I wasn't very long there. My parents said I was crying if I had to be happy and I would be happy if I had to cry. I was all mixed. Strange and funny thing I think .. and not I am not a child actor. I'm working in San Antonio working in walgreening. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived most of my life in Maryland. This movie is a great movie, a good concept. I've seen it several times in 19 years.
