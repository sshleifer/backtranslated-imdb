I remember that this is its original ventilation in 1962 at the age of five or six and really enjoys it. Recently I had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since it was broadcast on "Walt Disney Presentations" on the Disney Channel. I forgot this majority and some of them were for kids, but it was still enjoyable. I can't wait to show it to my brother and granddaughter.
