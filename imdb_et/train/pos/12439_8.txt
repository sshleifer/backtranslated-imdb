Though the main story should be in Morocco, this film was filmed in frantic Romania for 18 days with a very tight budget. But breaking these cards can be, the actors and the team play with considerable skill and dedication, so finally I found the result both touching and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau offers amazing action in halbana. The script and the direction give some gems. Whether you like the movie or not, it probably depends on your competition as the title of Alexandra Staden. Other reviewers have pointed out that the disadvantages of Staden are Modesty Blaise. They may have a point, but I found his interpretation admirable and very appropriate. Modesty succeeds in overcoming terrible odds through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to be the same here.
