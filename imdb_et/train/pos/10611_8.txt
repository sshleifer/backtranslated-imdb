What another observer called the lack of character development, I call the underestimation. The film didn't move overhead or unnecessary in the background. Yes, there were a lot of stories that we only saw, but it was mainly a one-day moment for an event that catalyzed changes in the lives of all the characters. Henry Thomas's presentation was a truly wonderful study of operational capacity that focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rent.
