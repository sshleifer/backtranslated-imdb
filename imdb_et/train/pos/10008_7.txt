You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, in recent times, constantly walking himself in all those foolish comedies he has made in the decade (or the exception "Death To Smoochy", which was bombarded when he came out, but is now a cult classic). Recent dramas have been fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". Despite mediocre reviews and fast DVD distribution, "The Night Listener" is one of the best works of the period. <br /> <br /> This is a very cool story, even though it does not contain a serial number and is not physically dangerous to anyone. The film's concept is based on a real fraud case that has been officially confirmed. In high school I read an autobiography by Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered terribly from abuse and eventually died of AIDS. I told the story until I read online reports that Johnson might not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confusing feelings Robin Williams had so brilliantly thought of reminded me. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette probably also gives his best dramatic results as a sociopathic "caregiver". His role was far from those he had in "Little Miss Sunshine". It was even when he looked at the camera where I thought he was staring at me directly. Such a role is played by a good actor, and this is the undervalued (yet well-reviewed) role that apparently makes Toni Collette one of the best actors of this generation not even to stand for the Academy Award (since 2008). It is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is such and that is also scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be dissatisfied because this film leaves you with a strange feeling.
