Pierce Brosnan is probably the only thing Richard Attenborough introduces in the new biology. The rest is new to the international audience: the history of Canada and the culture of the first people. <br /> <br /> Gray Owl is an easy study of how a man came to Ojibway in North Ontario, learning and preaching environmental protection for decades before it became politically correct. The film contains the story of love, the moral message, and the man whom his past tortures. However, this torture does not always have a dramatic effect on what it may be. <br /> <br /> However, it is a film that keeps your audience out of violence. He pays tribute to Canada's first people and presents them with dignity and non-stereotype. Brosnan's performance is somewhat rigid, but I suspect that it was Lord Attenborough who wanted him. <br /> <br /> Thank you for proud Canada.
