Someone releases this movie from a DVD, so in the decade or twenty years critics and film historians can watch the 1990s films and see how they were about to make Lars Von Trier revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece . "Zentropa" (or "Europa" as it is called outside the US) is one of the most exciting and artistic views and almost psychotic insecurities that fell out of Europe after World War II, namely the destroyed German landscape whose physical horrors were only in conflict with the psychic damage of its people . Von Trier paints his vision perfectly on the screen. You feel that you are watching some lost espionage classics from the late 1940s using perfectly lit black and white scenes, while you feel you are in the suburbs, especially in scenes such as murder Train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are witnessing the development of the art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Von Trier got his dogma moving right after that. And while his "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are classic in themselves, he really raised the art of making movies to new and exciting heights. 10/10, aged like good wine, and comes up with DVD release.
