I stumbled over it (Act-I) with a pure fool and it was more than ten years ago. It was not even mentioned on the cover of the tape. It surprised me. It scared me. It shocked me. I finally forgot and almost ten years later I thought again. Then he went and bought both acts. They were even better than I first experienced. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that, while the tank police are continuing and staying in the war of war, military equipment and heavy artillery, it seems like they're really serious with criminals. It is never shown or it is just wrong because they tend to appear easily. If this little knowledge of the state of war was really propaganda, it has certainly not been shown. <br /> <br /> I don't think the original Japanese version could have been as good as the American version. But touching the story, there have certainly been some correct interpretations that lost the translation, but it can be apologized.
