First of all, I will give my evaluation for the whole series; ******* 7 out of 10 stars. I have taken away the three downhills that John Amos went when he suffered. Don't do it wrong if it was hard to hit later, but only after Esther Rolle was out of season and returned. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, for the first time, there was a huge sit-com CBS. It was first a television, an exhibition of an African-American family living in Chicago projects in the 1970s. Created as Norman Lear's "Maude" spin-off, he again hit the right chord with the viewers. <br /> <br /> Not since this exhibition has seen a situation where comedy speaks directly of the struggles of families in the urban environment. (Well, there was Fox "South Central" in 94, but it wasn't updated.) <br /> <br /> John Amos as James Evans Sr was the ultimate father of this family and acted like every father to keep his family and his children can't go wrong in life. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle was a wonderful, non-meaningful mother figure who was raising her child on the same page as her husband. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as a Michael young but very bright young man for his age, but staying in a school system that doesn't meet his academic needs. Her character's name is the same as the founder of the exhibition, Mike Evans, who was "The Jeffersons" by Lionel Jefferson. (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a 16-17-year-old young girl who has to deal with the young woman's ghetto streets. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is a typical young smart and splitting young man who doesn't take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Simply put, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, except for the Penny Gordon / Janet Jackson story line. After the disappearance of James Evans' character, the exhibition lost its stability and the viewers left. Esther Rolle left the whole year but didn't want to play another violin by JJ's smart-aleck "Dyno-mite"! <br /> <br /> He returned the following season after the collateral that the writer even released. Wilona Woods, a neighbor of Florida, was a divorced woman who had taken up an abusive little girl Penny Gordon (then played by 10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's abusive mother was played by Totie Fields, mother of Kim Fields. <br /> <br /> In August 1979, an exhibition where everyone left their projects for a better life. Artist JJ sold the idea to the comic book company, Michael went to live on campus. <br /> <br /> Wilona & Penny, wife of Thelma & Soccer Player Keith + Florida moved all in the same building in downtown Chicago. Not the most realistic end, but by that time it wasn't important.
