Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg does not want traditional woven fabrics. I hope nobody puts him into Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet films, but Estrella Warren didn't bother to crack - her hair is always on her way. Tim Burton could have had sex with this simian and give viewers something to watch. Even Helena Bonham Carter will never get out of her costume, which looks like a big curtain. She is cute, but all things in love are limited to the look of anxiety and a little endless kiss. Like the artificial intelligence that speaks between the sexes of the species between robots and humans, but never gives - the Apeside planet hints at the romance of species between humans and monkeys, but only clues. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who dares to be sexy. This film has three major actors Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti chewing in the landscape as a monkey trio and they are fun to watch. Superlative make up (certain Oscar) suits, sets, music make this 2001 hit summer picture.
