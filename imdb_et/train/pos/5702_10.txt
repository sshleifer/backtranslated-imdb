I didn't expect John Holmes to convince Val Kilmer, but I found that I forgot that it was not a pornendendend myself. In fact, the whole cast of amazing performance turned into a remarkably underrated movie. <br /> <br /> As some mentioned earlier, look for a set of two disks and first look at the documentary "Wadd"; it gives you a lot of backgrounds to help you evaluate the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to be dissatisfied with the LAPD crime image video attached to the DVD. There are several reasons why this might have been added, one of which is that John Holmes's murder trial was the first in the United States where the prosecutor's office used such material. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; this is clearly defined in the menu as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage"!
