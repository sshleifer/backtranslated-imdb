I went to this movie after reading that it was a drama about a person with a supernatural gift that became a monster of society. Suffice it to say that I was expecting something completely different than I got. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I both thought the film was very romantic (the fact that the male leader is not bad to be sure to help), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it takes them to 3rd place A part of the movie that was now called by each other was a laughing joke to keep you entertained and story. So, briefly, not what I expected, but a very good surprise. I definitely buy this movie on DVD.
