I just read TomReynolds2004 comments and I feel I have to jump here. I understand he doesn't like the film, but his reasons aren't obvious. My feeling about this film is that he is not afraid to travel on the darker paths of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sadness. The two people, as depicted, have many reasons to be bitter and angry, but they find tenderness and comfort with each other. Only a great actor can do this job without becoming emotional, sentimental and cute. I am really interested in these people because of the overwhelming humanity they gave them so strong performances. I have every reason why Jane Fonda does not like her activities in the Vietnamese era, but personal feelings besides her, she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is great as a man whose intelligence and goodness begin to be indifferent to his inability. This is the first thing I have seen DeNirot tend to tend to tend to sell as a character, and I like it. This movie was a big surprise when I first saw it, and I'm waiting for it again.
