I love Korean movies because they have the ability to really (silently genuinely) capture real life. I tend to watch Korean movies for this very reason. I've also run other films before. What is closest to the feelings I got is Oasis and another fantastic movie called This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> But my headline summary should be from Chrstian's point of view, so I'll start doing it instead of just having a shower with praise. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, Director Chang-dong Lee has strived for an impartial and almost eerily realistic image of the modern Protestant Church (regardless of name). . I've always been waiting for a Christian film that really depicts the darker recesses of the Church's life. Because Christian films tend to speak a language different from the ones they want to share. Many movies with religious undertones, though with good motifs, tend to only resonate with the special resonance of a Disney movie or school. They have to show life as it is. True people curse, real people covet, real people fall. And while Christians believe that rescuers are available to those who seek it, we are still challenged by the daily lives of this life. And Do-yeon Jeon's character is a completely honest and almost brutal image of a woman who found God, but because of the bitter realities of life she loses the love she once had. He does not deny God to exist. It is that he refuses to live with the idea that He is all loving and forgiving God. <br /> <br /> The edges of his decent morality and insanity are posed by questions of his character, which are either religious or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is love, why does he allow such terrible things to happen?" This movie doesn't match that right. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the film, although open to interpretation, leave us with a promising future as our main character and bring the idea of ​​a "secret sunny" circle. <br /> <br /> Believe a second time that this movie was trying to be religious or had somehow tried and showed it. There's a reason why he worked even more. It's real, it's honest. And that's why it's really the best filming of Christian life I've seen on film.
