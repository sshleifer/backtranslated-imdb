In addition to being a list of my favorite filmmakers: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) the rest ... this movie is actually better than a book (and TV miniseries, though it's a simple presentation, given the director). Flawless filming, actor and (Kubrick's first) music - make this a horror masterpiece. I watched TV channels a few years ago and liked the story and I had the hope of getting it. ATTENTION! This is much better than I ever imagined. It starts slowly (Kubrick's trademark) and has a lot of downtime that creates a mid-term. The Intro scene is classic with all the tools and I watched it about 20 times only for the shear environment that creates the whole film. Also, the film does not offer a lot of film (that's just enough and it's not at all tasteless) the trend I hate in the horror movies last day. Check it out!
