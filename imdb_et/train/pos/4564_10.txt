If ever there had been an inspiring story that could have been with the disability or not, to stay in the perspective and do it (even if "to do" as an expression, right, there may be a wide place that is ultimately a personal truth), MY LEFT FOOT is that. It's a tough movie to watch at times: seeing the lesser aspects of the personality of Christy Brown appears in two key events - one when her sister declares she is pregnant and is going to get married when her father is in a bad reaction, and a dinner table when she arrives she made her capable of communicating, now she has announced the key word (opening of Brown's art) that she is married to another man - tough. Very, very harsh. What's more, because it is a man who cannot respond to these events properly and can only express himself in the way he knows how to: shout, scream, and scare himself. But this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction, even if there are quite a few autobiographical accounts, but the fact that a person who crosses his or her severe disability becomes a functioning human being and a force to be considered. art world. Daniel Day Lewis won the Oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance, as it was faulty, but durable, Christy Brown and Brenda Fricker did so for Brown's strong mother supportive role.
