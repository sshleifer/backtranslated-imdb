I had never heard of this flick, despite the relationship with George Clooney (whose company was produced and it appeared in a very funny supporting bit) and with his ocean director Steven Soderbergh. Worse still, we chose this $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars for that!) At a discount. But then I think if William H. Macy is in it, you won't be disappointed. It was reminiscent of these Ealing comedies from England in the 1950s. OK, more embarrassing. It's an odd and sometimes intestinal-fun movie. The real ones made me laugh so hard I cried. Perhaps the more fun use of panties in film history. Maybe it was the low expectations I had, but I looked at the group with people and we had a blow. Best $ 5 I've spent at age.
