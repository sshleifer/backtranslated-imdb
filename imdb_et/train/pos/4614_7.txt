This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like about this part of "Guilty Pleasure". This movie is easy to condemn because it doesn't include Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and make math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had grown out for a long time! Time does it for young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who re-evaluated Lili's role, rejected Big 6-0 (although he was still good and was still the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo didn't get much of it. However, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lew in the roles that made them so famous! During the 2 seasons when THE MUNSTERS was in first class, Gwynne / Lewis made the chemistry of this series a success. The remaining majority supported cast members, not to say that they were not needed. They were! The TV series would not have survived as long as it was without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also a better choice for Joan Marshall. In the late 1970s or early 1980s, the boob tube was plagued. <br /> <br /> '
