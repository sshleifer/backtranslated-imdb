It seems to be the perfect day for swimming. The ordinary family wants to benefit from it and travel to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped, and his wife or little son cannot help him out - as the tide rises. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and looks for help. <br /> <br /> John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is impossible due to unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help but he has to pay for it. The film raises a double question. How far are you going to help the man you love and, on the other hand, looking at Stanwyck's behavior against a stranger - does he really love his man? Like a good short story, it leaves the film viewer with questions he can answer himself.
