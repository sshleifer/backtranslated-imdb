The time of the sentencing service provides the Cold Unit with information on the murder of a police officer committed many years earlier. The murder of a good police officer, Sean Cooper, was never resolved. Of course, detectives believe that new evidence will help them put together the frustrations of their colleagues who are disappointed. <br /> <br /> Returns will take us to James Bruno's child. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is a tension when the godfather Sean, who is a godfather, comes to the grave and late. Eileen Bruno doesn't seem to be happy there. The real secret is revealed by him. He hit Seani, who in the yard with Jimmy in the backyard, kissed his man and more shockingly, Jimmy was happy to respond. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the station, partners became the center of rumors. Sean has not resisted her boss because she discovered her region against a criminal who controlled drugs. Sean realizes that this man is a strong man with a drug because he always apologizes to release Sum and Jimmy bags all the time. The pressure is too much for Jimm. Sean is comfortable in homosexuality and wants to be honest about it. Cooper's father doesn't want anything to do with his son. Even his boss McCree wants him to get out of his jurisdiction, but the case is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving the police. Sean is killed because of his homosexual status and too much to know about his companions' participation in dirty money. <br /> <br /> Tom Petit wrote this honest image about the life of a police officer in a closet and his secret love with another colleague. We thought it was a fair report on a serious issue that nobody talked about these days. Sometimes, real situations are not shown when people who are involved in exhibitions are afraid of revenge on sponsors or networks. Jeannot Szwarc shows a sensitive approach to this complex issue, which is treated without sensitivity, because the case might have been shown to another team. <br /> <br /> It's a rare Chad Everett, like Elder Jimmy Bruno. His hand has a touch of sentimentality with the right target that doesn't go out of hand. Shane Johnson makes a great contribution to Sean Cooper. The cast is wonderful and it includes everything that all the guidelines of the Szwarar direction show. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Nick Vera gets closer to his basketball player's mother, to whom the detective took the ball. Nick goes to a woman with romance!
