First of all, when I first saw this flick, I was 9 years old. If I had seen it for the first time two weeks ago, I would have obviously said it was just one of the cheaply made cable television horror films with some well-made scenes. But if you're nine, you don't know these facts. It then frightened me of hell, especially those of the above-mentioned Zelda scenes (and they still do). Nowadays I am attached to this movie. I have to see it once a month and on the eve of each new year I look at it with 12-seat beer and friends. It's like a good party appetizer! I agree with those who said that acting here is quite pointless. Midkiff and Crosby look like I want Louis and Rachel to look, but these two faces don't see much commitment or feeling. Hughes and Gwynne record a lot of scenes that "believe" subordinates. What I really want to say is the fact that there is really no other movie with any similarity to Pet Sematary, and I don't mean zombie stuff here. ATMOSPHY OF THIS FILM IS ATTENTION AND ONE ONE. Frankly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks like a cable TV on a superficial level but leaves you cold compared to only the best horror coolers there? Alright, I ended up with a few ball balls a few minutes ago, but I have to say that all the pieces on this level perfect the overall action. But hey, if you really know a movie like Pet Sematary! I really would like to know ... And I don't mean the night of the dead living here ... it's quite far from intelligence compared to it.
