9 / 10-30 minutes of pure vacation terror. Okay, so it's not that scary. But it's sure it's fun. <br /> <br /> Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) speaks about the fear of vacation, giving us all the Christmas lights ... GosseBUMPS This is. Bwahahahahha. You should really be wary of what you give AX Santa. Be scary for Christmas and happy new fear. Okay, I finish. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the story, the greedy wife (Best Screamed in the World, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, a coach who gets a towel dead in UNO 2) for money. BUT, his plan is destroyed, as the crazy outfit dressed in santa suits (Larry, Dr Giggles "Drake") goes on the road. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on YouTube, you can watch it for free. , but most of you have already seen it (my third viewing). But if you haven't seen it, I suggest you do it.
