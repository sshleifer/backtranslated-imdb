I think the ultimate passion for participating in the Toronto Film Festival is your release date. Frankly speaking, I'm just happy that Fido got the United States for distribution. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Ever seen dead Shaun? Good. How about Lassie? Can you agree on these two? Well, if you get your name to be Andrew Currie, the Canadian family's primary zombie comedy or zomedy. (Seriously, this is what the Toronto press book called it.) Although Fido is not as violent, dry, or British as Shaun of the Dead, Fido remains at its roots: a commitment to old 50-year-old black-and-white television that includes both Lassie and infamous sci-fi cellulose pumped out during the period. <br /> <br /> Fido's talented headquarters (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker and Tim Blake Nelson) show it's bright. script. The film examines all the effects of this assumption: a world where zombies have become servants because their number is a strange accident. What would you use your new Undead servant? Butler? Crafts? Pet? Inexplicable acts? Fido deals with all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly stylish way, thanks to Connelly (one of the zombies mentioned) and the young TV actress K'Sun Ray, who sometimes seems to be a better young Elijah Wood than the young Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting another dead Shaun, don't waste your time. The genre has almost no gore and pokes that will satisfy you and just leave the theater bitter and depressed. But if you're ready to see what happens to Shaun of the Dead when it jumps over the lake, you're treating. Think of Fida as a sensitive, often beaten little brother, Shaun, for the Dead Rebel loser, and you're starting to drift. If you like (or at least tolerate) zombies, toddlers and a deadly satire, Fido is a movie for you. If this is not the case, then you know the exercise. Just press the square between the eyes.
