One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season, he started downhill when they decided to join Jean Bruce Scott. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun to watch her and Ernest Borgnine's character goes with each other. The last episode he appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, these days there were no black TV shows. Some episodes in the second season, when okay, but in the third season, were more human than Airwolf and it wasn't shown until it was almost at the show. When he went to the US it was disgusting !!!
