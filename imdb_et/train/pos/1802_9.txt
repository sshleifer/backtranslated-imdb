Okay, I saw this movie as a child and really loved it. My parents didn't buy a movie for me, but I think I'll go and buy it right now. I'm a mammal of animated films before 2000. Anyway, for a real inspection. <br /> <br /> What I liked was the actual depiction of heaven and hell, one of the few I've seen in an animated film. Character development was there! The characters in this movie are easy to classify (ie Charlie is a selfish mole, Itchy is cynical, but he believes Charlie, Carface is probably a relentless villain, etc.). I also loved King Gator's song. I've always loved loud, tedious, terrible guys. This song can be casual, but it was so fun. Finally, the animation was beautiful. You could say that Charlie was all messy and stuff and the backgrounds were pretty. <br /> <br /> WHAT IS NOT RECOMMENDED: The actual representation of heaven: how Charlie reacted to it, "no surprises", it really seems very boring. He denied the place in the sky and STILL had finally to return to it. I remember a few lines of certain songs, for example, "... you can't keep a good dog", "... we make music forever" and "... welcome to be dead", but I can't remember most of them. The songs were not so memorable to be honest. Whippet Angel: She is annoying and NECK! TO USE! <br /> <br /> WHAT PERSONS DO NOT WANT: During the movie, some very scary (depending on the viewer) hell images are displayed. The surface is quite dangerous. The beer is also indirect, but in fact, DUBBED is not beer. Gambling is a key element of the film. A good man dies. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: I love this movie, even if it's sometimes a bit forgotten. Stronger children's animations are always my favorite. It was created back at a time when manufacturers and writers were not afraid to give children a little fear. Today it would probably be rated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed children) should not watch it. In addition, I give him 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Happy viewing!
