I recently watched this 1954 film that played Vincent Price for the first time in Turner's classic films. The price depicts Don Gallic, a magician / inventor who travels to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, depicted by lovely Eva Gabor). Though the Price is a murderer, I actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character, harassed by those who are tempted by him, who exploit him. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not on T, there are some of his most famous roles (like my favorite "House of Wax"), which has a "fear" factor, but it is enough to keep the audience interested. <br /> <br /> This is mandatory for Vincent Price fans.
