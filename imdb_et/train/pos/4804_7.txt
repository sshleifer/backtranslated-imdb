I watched this movie a few times on the DVD, for the first time after the second hour I looked in the second half and then went back to the first hour. An amazing entertaining movie, thanks to the god of knightley in it, refreshing and giving us a true view of Queen Victoria's complex life and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing is bad about the film, a real bad language or something of a sexual nature that would be offensive to the family. Could the kids look a little at Queen Victoria and perhaps less well-known characters like Conroy and Lord Melbourne.
