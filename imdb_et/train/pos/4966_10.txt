Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen years old in 1978 when Argentina won the World Cup home. He was already the biggest star and the biggest player in a football-bound country. Everyone had asked Cesar Luis Menotti to play the boy's genius, but the leader thought he wasn't ready yet. <br /> <br /> History writes that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup quite convincingly - they didn't really need Maradona. . The same was not the case in 1982. Spain was the catalog of disasters for Argentina. Menotti - still chain smoking - played Diego this time, but the event was too much for such a temperamental boy. On 4 June 1982, Maradona had signed up for about $ 7 million for Barcelona - nine days later, he played his first match at Camp Nou and Belgium won Argentina with one zero. It was not a comforting debut, and although he won twice in the next race against Hungary, Maradona remembers the mundane, which is his lowest place, a raw, petulant violation of Brazil's Batista in the second round, which sharply ended his tournament and Argentine rule as world champion. <br /> <br /> But now it was all behind him. Maradona was somewhat crazy in Barcas and left Naples in 1984. It was like he would end up at home. Napoli's Tifos had done everything to attract Maradona to the poor, lowering Naples. The gifts of old women and the purse of young boys were uncomfortable with millions of Camorra as part of the transfer fee and the city decided to feel at home. So Maradona was at least now El Rey - she brought one of her favorites to Argentine in Mexico and Menotti instead of new leader Carlos Bilardo. <br /> <br /> Maradona is the hero of this story, one man's world championship winning machine. In 1982, hundreds of young men died during the futile battle of the Falkland Islands; now the press in the British press in the Mexican city has the same result. Maradon was still considered to be distinguished in England, more remembered for Great Britain's great achievement during the 1980s tour than in Spain. But he was still Argie: the enemy. <br /> <br /> England really started well, and Lineker might have gone up in just 12 minutes. An important event took 8 minutes. Fenwick, a large and limited English defender, was booked - he was now scared of any challenges around the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After the tense first 45 minutes, the other half started with a bang. Maradona danced after 50 minutes, but couldn't go through any way. Similarly, only white shirts hit Valdano's test. Then the notoriety that works for Diego epitaphina. Hodge rolled the ball back to his penalty area, Shilton jumped fast - but there was Maradona, somehow the English goalkeeper rises to pull the ball into the net. How did he do that? Easy: handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous violation of football history went almost slowly. Every spectator waited for Al-Sharif to break in Syria (he didn't). Shilton looked and turned to the rails - he ran back to the center. If he does not die of the popes or becomes the first man to walk on Mars, when a great man dies, it is shown first - with a long, protracted, slow motion, followed by the appearance of his face. The next picture is his next gift to the world - the best goals of the World Championships. <br /> <br /> Burruchaga strikes the ball to Maradona, who was on his right side. He passed through and accelerated from Beardsley and Reid. It was a real Diego - he broke off Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick was now able to stop the attack. Usually he would have tried his delivery near Maradona's thigh - sure he would have received a red card but who cares? Then Fenwick had a brainstorming - he hesitated and decided to go to Maradona - maybe he tried to put him away? Diego shot the box when Fenwick crashed. Butcher had run with the genius as if he had been encouraging. Shilton panicked, and Maradona turned her around and was ready to evaluate. Now Butcher recalled his role and tried to break the Arabic language - instead, he gave a boost to the hit that hit the target. England came home. <br /> <br /> During this magical summer in Mexico, the world had found Pele's descendant. In fact, more than ever, a footballer had crossed - Pele was great in 1958 and 1970, but there were big players around him. Maradona didn't. 1986 was his World Championship.
