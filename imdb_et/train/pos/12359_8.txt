It is remarkable because of its notorious explicit scene when the proud Maruschka Detmers takes his young man's penis into his pants and mouth. Even without that moment, the film is great as a bit disturbing passionate and dazzling sexy ride. Detmers puts high performance in a partly uneven, unsatisfactory joy, migrating his flat naked. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, he steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy, and politics. For me, the last two slightly disappeared and the end is the most confusing when his fianc√© is released while the terrorists are released, he seems uncertain who wants and the young man seems more interested in his exams than anything other than crying, of course!
