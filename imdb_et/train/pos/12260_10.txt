This is a great start for Mickey Rooney's film career. His talents show that he has a long career ahead of him. Car and truck chasing is exciting for the 1937 era. The beginning of the Andy Hardy series is in my book American Treasure. Spring Byington's performance is excellent as usual. Please, Mr Rooney or the owners of film rights, take the opportunity and get it on DVD. I think it would be a winner.
