I don't know quite well how to explain "Darkend Room" because, in summary, it would not really be justice. This is basically a short film by Lynchia with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say that this short is definitely more about the end of the Lynchia spectrum "Mulholland Drive" than "Elephant Man" or "Straight Story". It is hidden and searchable on the Lynch website.
