I bought this game from eBay after hearing that it was a similar game to Elite. The game is really very similar and very addictive. When I played it a couple of times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun .... I've played this game right now and the story makes it feel like you're really in the movie, it's great. If you are having trouble exploring because of the narrow nature of a single player game, just set up a freelance server on your computer (easy and included with the software) and play your heart's content. There are still a large number of freelance servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is not a problem and it's not all that threatens, because you don't often mean other players if you don't want to. So go get a copy of this game by learning a single-player campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game is amazing, for exploring huge systems and finding wrecks, as well as for any other discoverable things - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. A fantastic game and especially if you get it on eBay for a couple of quids. It is possible to get a full written handbook (blue box, not Xplosiv red box), it will load better!
