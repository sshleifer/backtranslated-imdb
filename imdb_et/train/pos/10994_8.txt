This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I was looking at it all fortunately on one night's television. In the first 5 minutes I thought it was a B movie, but after that I realized what this amazing product was. <br /> <br /> I suggested some friends to see the movie to be a bad B movie. How wrong. Surface criticism. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is almost a genius! The well-known director did a great job here and it is a shame to say that he was out of the game all the time.
