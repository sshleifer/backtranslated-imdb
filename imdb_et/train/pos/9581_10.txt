In the mid-eighties, this film documented Harlem's ball around. Much more fun than Palazzo Volpi, although it is just as ill, this movie is a real ghost. There can be no attention because of their conscience. The sole purpose of middle-class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of trash and glitz. Here the most difficult dump is very well documented and properly glamorized. The determination of characters for all who are glamorous inspires even more characters to participate in their viewer by creating a "phenomenon phenomenon" effect that makes it a film for art.
