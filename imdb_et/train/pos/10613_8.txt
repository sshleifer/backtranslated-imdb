It's a long lost horror gem starring Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it is hard to find a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This movie is at the same time creepy, but cheesy. It seems that 3 young people (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) are traveling to the small town of Solvang, California, to cover the festival when their hotel room takes place, and they are looking for refuge at Earnest Keller (Lassick) home. and her strange woman in Virginia. Vickie is left behind, feeling bad because the other 2 have turned off their story for filming. He will soon be killed in the house, very fun, by some unknown forces hiding in the ventilation system (he breaks the fan shut-off lid as he falls on him when he is towing and hanging in the basement). ). Soon Karen returns and is murdered even more brutally when his face is through the fan cover. Jennifer struggles with her (former) lover in a rather boring sub-bed, and when she returns home, her hosts (whom we have now discovered are brother and sister and whatever it is in the basement is their son). Try also to kill him. Virgina does not fully agree with Earnest's plan to kill Jennifer, but she is kept in the basement where she meets Junior. Here the film becomes almost comic, because Junior (Hysterical Furst scenario) is deformed, mentally deficient, a manchild whose actions and movements cause a couple of fooling, although it should be scary. Here, the speed of the film accumulates and the end is well done. Actors / actors do terrible work, especially for Lassick, Furst, and Bach, and although it is still not the most terrible movie, it's a lot of fun!
