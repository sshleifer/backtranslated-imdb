He had never heard of the Moon Man until he saw it last night on this HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like every other, eclectic. My favorites are flying from Blue Velvet to dr. To Strangelove until Ghost and Mrs. Muirin through Oz and a loved one, Eraserhead, Repo Man and Spy. <br /> <br /> Man's Moon is a wonderfully made, gentle-hearted, cheerful and tragic film, beautifully filmed, in which the participants live rather than acting. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life in the Louisiana countryside, which is a much more subtle era, literally carries its pastoral setting. <br /> <br /> During the last moments of a movie, it is hard to remain stoic, especially when a young girl is the heart of her older sister, wearing private pain and forgiving everyone. <br /> <br /> Instead of enjoying your joyful prose with joy or getting in touch, this suggestion ends with the one who enjoys watching movies that speak heartily to us. <br /> <br /> If you don't buy any other movies, buy a man for the moon. This moving story is the one you enjoy again and again. It is joy and pearl, a film that is too hard in the world of this hardening heart. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues that have emerged from the Human Moon are a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 5, 2009
