It takes the courage to make a film about Gandhi in India, where she is not shown as a man who can't do anything wrong. This film shows how Mahatma was not a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). The performances are awful, the cinematic art is fantastic, the direction is fabulous, but the film's drops. If the intention was to make this movie without any box-office expectation, which I expect it to be here, this is a great experiment, but when the waiters waited that this is a commercial success, the fate of the film was condemned on the day they chose this topic. <br /> <br /> Twenty years later, this film is remembered for the excellent portrayal of Harila by Akshaye Khanna. He deserves to apply for this Oscar. And frankly, his only result worthy of praise is Shefali Chhaya is also great .. <br /> <br /> Look at the scene where Harila hears her father's death. No dialogue, no screaming, but with Khanna's wordless picture. This is one of the best scenes ever hit during filmmaking <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my Father is not an exciting cinema at all, but yes, its a great cinema and a black watch.
