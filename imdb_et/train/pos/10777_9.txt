Radiofreccia is a film about us, our dreams, our friends, obsession, addictions, fears. This is a great film, where a group of friends, like all of us, lives through the difficulties of growing small towns for one of the most important decades. The film does not take things happy or sad, but tells us a story we could all have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. The power of this story is that we grow up in the love of the characters, one of the films you watch over and over, you feel closer to the small town of Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to finally be able to walk along his streets alongside Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world radio of Raptus International's famous radio, playing his dreams, dreams. Radiofreccia makes you laugh, it makes you cry from time to time, it shocks you and comforts you, it gives you and takes you. I personally believe that it has played an important role in my life and in the life of my friends, and I suggest that you all look at it and let it take part in you.
