Perhaps the last movie you would expect from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavatt (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). This is a neo-realistic fantasy, a kind of oxymoron. The old woman finds a baby in her cabbage and raises her son. In a few years, the child will be a young boy (called Toto) and the adoptive child will die. She goes to the orphanage and when she finally turns 18 she leaves. He immediately finds that he has no home. However, Toto is optimistic and does not let him take anything away. One person steals his lure and instead of getting angry about it, Toto gets his friend and goes and stays with him on a small boat. Toto takes the initiative and organizes a lot of homeless people in the area and builds a better stream. Soon the landowner will try to sell the plot and the citizens of the snowboards will have to defend themselves. After several attempts, the owner confirms the strength of the police to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a full-fledged fantasy (before that it was Charlie Chaplin's comic / fantastic melodrama). This stuff is so weird and shocking that it's probably the best when others see it. It's pretty amazing and very funny. There are certainly objections that could bring Milberg's miracle to the plot. Fellini and Visconti were heavily criticized when they began to roam from neorealism. I think I read it widely at the time of its publication. It's so enjoyable right now - I loved it very much. This may be my favorite Vittorio de Sica movie, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves are very close. 10/10.
