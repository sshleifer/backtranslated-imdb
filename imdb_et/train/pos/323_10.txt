This is a really great movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and in content) that should not be missed by any French New Wave or Underground movie fan. Opening or closing credits is hard - we have just fallen into the world of applied art, revolution and youth. This film has little to do with documentary and it is more interesting to advertise with our ideas and its relation to reality. Overcoming the real and not the real lines is in the films about the documentary, but this time we do it for the sake of consumption and marketing, not for the actual description.
