Hired and watched this short (<90 minutes) work. This is by far the best treatment Modesty has received for the film - and his creator Peter O'Donnell agrees by participating in "Creative Consultant". This character and we who love him are treated with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best he has done so far, and the pain was very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect when it fits the original Jim Holdaway illustration of Modesty. The one who threw her away is terrible! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also great. Hope you Tarantino & co. continues more of the series - I'm especially interested to see who they would like to be incomparable with Willie Garvin!
