I looked at it recently, but when it started, I couldn't figure out what the concept was, what the topic was ... in short - I had no idea what it was. Was it a documentary, was it a comedy routine ..... Well, that was it. <br /> <br /> It started a bit slow, but I think it was because I had no idea what type of program I was viewing. But it looked at me quickly. The episode was Robert Wuhl, who discussed history and fiction in history. Mainly, how do we (Americans) learn history that is not really true - and how we learned what we did. He did it so that the viewer would be interested and interesting. I have actually learned some things and this is a real indication of how effective such a program is. <br /> <br /> I would like to see it on HBO. I believe it can be just as fun and effective on a variety of topics - especially if they are "taught" in the same way as this episode.
