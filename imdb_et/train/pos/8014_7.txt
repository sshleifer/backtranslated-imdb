But if you like muppet, I don't want to like it. Basically, the same plot has been revived (this time in New York, not LA), where there are lots of fun bags and mups hi-jinx. Many Muppeters leave the movie very early because it focuses around Kermy and Miss Piggy. I had enjoyed it very much. Have fun watching your kids.
