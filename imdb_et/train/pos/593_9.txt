This show only lasted for one season, but it was interesting for the audience because it needed a visual fit and a constant hand. One wrong move would disqualify a competitor from winning, although it was clear that the competitor knew the right answer. It was always exciting because the competitor started drawing, wondering if they would draw or praised; allowing the second race to win the race easily. It was a frivolous show, but it was clear that the competitors were often inadvertently made a foolish mistake. Rarely seen that there was more than one season left to show the game. This example is remembered only by a flavored game actor, as it turned out to be quite unpopular, although after the 1950s scandals, games showed a great return to the television screen. But it was a unique concept for showing games and what has never been seen before.
