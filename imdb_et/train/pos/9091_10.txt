Great movie. All you want in the movie. Huge battle scenes and many other activities. Thrill and romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Like the old parents movie. Completely entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Editing was fast and you will never forget yours. The story is like a classic story of a royal household. The actors are beautiful and the kits are great. The costumes are remarkable and the work of the stunt is imaginative. Special effects are also amazing. He looks like a solid bet from Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is great as usual. He is one of the greatest actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is a great and ideal for a leading woman, even making significant progress with an English accent. I found the film has won many awards and I understand why. <br /> <br /> All this is an amazing independent movie. Check it out for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give him TEN + !!!
