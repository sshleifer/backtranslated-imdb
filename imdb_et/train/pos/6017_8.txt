Zabriskie Point cannot be rationally confronted or attempted to describe it with words and conventions used for other films. This is because it's not a movie. It is an idea and a feeling that filmmakers are somehow peculiar than film. What we see is not the opening of the plot, but rather a series of events that we don't see in the movies every day, but imagine that it happens as a background we ourselves provide when we hear about a tragic event in news or friends. We see that our imagination is for people who are abstract to us, someone we do not know, but we have undoubtedly heard them in a book or on television or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people who claim to fly and inevitably flee. The only escape comes from something immaterial - it is a collective situation and cruelty that the mass of civilization has promised to exist in laziness or ... human history. At the end of the 1960s, our Los Angeles players play against and respond to the suffering of modern existence. These creatures are actually empty slabs that can display any attribute we can imagine. Although the measures taken may be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters themselves are not criminals. They are people who are looking for a return to a familiar, unworked existence that is beyond the ordinary they experience daily. Not that they are ever happy or sad, but they will attain some type of self-realization when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern life. They only achieve real life in nature, although it is the next victim of modern existence. Finally, "Zabriski Point" is the affection of the humanities related to the natural world. Because even the most abandoned lands are going to our progress, we lose our souls on the death of the human spirit.
