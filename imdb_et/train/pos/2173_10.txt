Often, after years on, we can look back and see the stars who are truly stars. Like the French film critic whose name escapes me, he said, "There is no Garb. There is no Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks"; and there is, thank heaven! Louise Brooks! This is one-third of his European masterpieces. But this is also an extraordinary film, if one, if not the first French speaker, to follow the famous script written by Ren√© Clair because he is said to have finished (direction, ie Edith Piaf before he was well known! So much talent and film work) how could it not be a masterpiece ?! And this is the movie. Shame Louise Brooks was blackballed by Hollywood when she came back to the countries - so many talents were so far away! 1930 and hear Piaf's young voice, I can never get tired of this movie!
