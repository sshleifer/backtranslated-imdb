Sarah Silverman's program is very similar to Sarah's uprising; It is so up if you fail to take it to the heart. However, the fact is that while most people "get it" does not mean that they all appreciate it. This is a very polarizing and one-dimensional exhibition, so if you don't like it in 10 minutes, you can also give up. If you like it in 10 minutes, then keep up with it because every episode so far has been as good as the last one. <br /> <br /> As everything shows, it's not perfect. I personally love the program, but there are some big mistakes. Racist songs are funny, but they grow much faster than Silverman seems to understand - the problem I also had with "Jesus is magic". It seems that Silverman gave himself an episode of a song quota that is not needed. Not to mention that although the lyrics he wrote are good, music is not good. Another thing to keep in mind is that although this show for some reason fans like Monty Python, a permanent brigade, etc., there's nothing like that. I can watch Monty Python all day, but as much as I like this show, I can't watch more than half an hour at a time. It becomes very fast. The repeat value of this exhibition is too small - the second time around the episode is quite funny and the third time, I think it's boring. , very funny. Give it down.
