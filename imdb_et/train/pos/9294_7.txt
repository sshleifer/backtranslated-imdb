Before I start, I should note that I know the editor of this movie. We have never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (the things that came before the bulletin boards), and we've been talking on the phone, so I'm biased here. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Somehow it's ironic when the "Rat Pack" culture, which came from the late 50s and early 60s to the early 60s, made a return in the mid-1990s, one of the original Rat Pack, which was done in a similar way was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop; I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who didn't live it (he gave him a confusing look, as you remember). And though I don't think it's the world's biggest film, and I'm not a fan of Rat Pack or "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> First, it looks stylish and moves to the right. For the other, the core activities are all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly confirmed here when the head gangster returns from the sanatorium and has an edge attached to him. Jeff Goldblum returns silently to the ironic performances he gave on his pre-blocking days, such as BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin only needs to vampire this movie, she does it in a fun way. True, it's not a great movie; the dialogue consists mainly of punches, and many of them do not work (like the whole "Zen of Ben" call). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terribly here. However, I was entertaining and if you like gangster movies, you can also be.
