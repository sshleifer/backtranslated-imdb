I saw a list of films in the Santa Barbara Film Festival Guide where I went to Hollywood when it was screening. In principle, the election of the new chairman of the Hong Kong triad Wo Sing Society is coming, so you can imagine how much violence will take place during that time. The struggle is between "candidates" Lam Loki (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) to control the oldest and most powerful parts of society. Louis Koo also plays Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung jetina, Cheung Siu Fai, Mr. So, Lam Suet, and Lam Ka Tung Kun. There are some good realistic corruption issues and moments, almost enough action, except maybe when the police are involved, but there is a sequel, so it's pretty worth the crime drama thriller. Very good!
