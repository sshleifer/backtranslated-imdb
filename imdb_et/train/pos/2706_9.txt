I saw this movie at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also met the film director. I heard Ed Wood wrote the story after 10 years! I'm sure he thought he would be his masterpiece - his triumph. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the movie seriously (like Mr. Wood), it's really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And it's cool. Big jokes I woke up early when I died that it didn't even try to be a decent film. <br /> <br /> This makes the movie very, very good. The script is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely perfect. You see, it's either high art ... or low garbage. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
