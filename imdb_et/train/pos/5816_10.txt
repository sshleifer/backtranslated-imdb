The first time I saw this "movie" I loved. When I was 11, I was more interested in music and dance. As I am old, I have become more interesting as an actor. While in the first half it was only Michael's career behind (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still fun to watch. The "Badder" sequence could have been omitted, although the kids were pretty good. "Quick Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were funny, especially when a police officer says to Michael, "I need your autograph here," after he stopped dancing in the dance zone. But this is the "Smooth Criminal" that is cake. Joe Pesci did a great job when hair (and hair was natural). Dancing is perfect and so special effects. The only thing I could have done was spiders. Every Michael fan should see it if you haven't done it yet. I'll give her 10+!
