This movie is funny and suitable for all ages. This is definitely family-type entertainment. The cast works fine on playing with people in Central West, Big Bean, Illinois. If we have to assume that nothing happens because the excitement of the decade (prelude) is a new (and only) exit ramp from Interstate. Location reversal is appropriately boring and completely unlikely to be a Martian invasion of land. But these marches are completely wrong, despite having a well-equipped and deadly arsenal of weapons, including one designed to destroy the Martians! Martians died out of their lines and threw just the right accents that the viewers and locals would like to help them ... leave the country. Mr J. Anderson, who plays a very young Halloween carnivore party, is just big. See this movie for ridicule and entertainment; thoughtful it is not. But it's fine and enjoyable.
