This film was directed by Victor Nunez, who also wrote a manuscript (Ulee's Gold). A nice and easy-to-understand writing application for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's everyday life. What we see is a young wife in the life of Ruby. Ashley Judd (sisters) won the prize for the best independent spirit for this role. Ruby will live independently and establish his identity. He explores jobs, friendships, boyfriends, sex, typical young adult searches. The film won the Grand Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival. As an enthusiast, the independent film I chose as a film for Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie because it doesn't carry Hollywood luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different, it reminded me of a stupid one, looking at Paul Newman. The later film is part of the everyday life of a normal person. I like it. The story is very nice and everything we had to do was sit down and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure is the title. I am sure there are not so many mistakes and flies in paradise like Florida. Since I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me, I'm itching all over Florida. I'm turning into a full red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and his friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean, who rides on the Florida city of Panama City. Indeed, sand is very white. I've been there. Favorite Quotes: "The need has always been a good excuse." "Everyone who thinks about finding a person is not completely different now, who will be and when and why." <br /> <br />
