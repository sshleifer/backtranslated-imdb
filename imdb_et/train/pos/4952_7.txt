Review on September 12, 2006 at the Toronto International Film Festival in Paramount 1. In the film, the world premiered at the Elgin Theater VISA screening before the day. <br /> <br /> The main plot includes Morgan Freeman, who plays a one-time popular actor who is down his career and who takes on roles that may be under him, but which he still feels positive about knowing he must pay rent. The downturn shows that it has long been among the roles that the former clips in favorable DVD boxes and its manageability is not too sure that it itself helps the manufacturer who falls to Freeman's local community market, where he plans to conduct research as a supermarket manager. He will soon discover that the real market is driven by the iron-based "10 products or less" cashier, who plays Paz Vega. When Freeman ever goes back and Vega needs help in preparing for the interview, the fact that they combine the power to drive across the city to get Freeman home and get Vega's job to send her to a moving career. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was pleasant, it seemed like it was still a chart or an ongoing job. There were two extended musical sequences (one with Vega & Freeman who taught each other children's songs that literally play like Paul Simon's music video) that felt like cushioning and even then the film was only about 80 This is a good thing Morgan Freeman is as he is, because without him it would have been too little. Of course it was funny in some parts and Paz Vega is also a pleasure, but here it was not enough to say it was a complete film. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car and Paz Vega said he would never. Who ever heard a boy who wants to ask for directions and a woman says no!? In the real world, this is exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay on credits. A little Target Store vendor who taught Morgan Freeman how to sell sales is just fun! The early bit where Freeman's driver calls is Freeman's voice on "Books on tape" reading was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Director / writer Brad Silberling and actor Paz Vega were screening for a short Q&A there. Silberling answered one question, saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman, and that when Freeman took his role, he really changed very little. Quite a compliment to writing Silberling as well as how Freeman can slip into his role and feel he's completely born to play it.
