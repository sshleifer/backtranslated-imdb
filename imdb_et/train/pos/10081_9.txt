It is a beautiful, rich and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful story. He basically talks about how the old master story must be found by the (male) heir, who continues his craft, but does not reach what he expects from his male dominant world. The characters then have to deal with their situation, and the old captain must seize the conflict between his desires and heir and his traditional concepts of society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and challenging. The study of the characters, their lives and emotions is rich and the characteristic development is strong, while the characters are complex and not one-dimensional. The film professionally transmits the old man's emotions and the desire to find the heir and shows how he and the child solve this situation. There are also humor at the right points, sometimes quite fine. The film also examines the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture, creating interest and depth for the film. <br /> <br /> Leadership, acting and landscape are all outstanding. For other strengths, it adds rich and compelling visual images and compelling real characters. As a result, the film creates strong empathy and feelings about them. <br /> <br /> Some have argued that the ending ends with a film's weakening, but I don't necessarily agree. Perhaps it would have been stronger with a different end, but any improvement in the overall film would have been quite small.
