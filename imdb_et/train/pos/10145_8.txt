This is a really old fashion charming movie. Locations are great and the situation is one of those old times in Preston's sturgess films. You want to watch a movie that doesn't require much more, then sit back and relax. Action is good and I liked Michael Rispoli. He was also in Rounders. And when you slept. The rest is fun. This happens just when two married people meet what they really love at the weekend, that they plan their wedding. I know ... it sounds kooky ... but that's it. And it makes it fun to watch. It will make your girlfriend either hug you or leave you, but at least you know.
