This movie started slowly, then rose to the center. But the fact that the film lasted more than two nights broke the peak. The second part was really interesting, but it was just a miserable end. Playing football in the yard? Really, could it get more gentle and majestic? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the 70s. I do not make great efforts to make it as "60s".
