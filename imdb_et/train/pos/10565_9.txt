In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced three Warner Brother musicians, who offered a momentary disorder to their depressed audience. The Gold Diggers of 1933, the 42nd Street and the Footlight Parade were all in the Broadway Theater world, where there is essentially the same subject that must be shown. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films were presented by Busby Berkeley's kaleidiscopic choreography, showing staging music and many of the same supporters. <br /> <br /> Everyone is probably the classic of their genre, but I have to admit the clearly preferred Light intensity thanks to the energy tempo and leading James Cagney. Warren William Gold at Diggers and Warner Baxter on the 42nd Street is great when it comes to the production of exhibitions - especially Baxter when burned Julian Marsh was looking for one of the last ticket outlets. Both lack Cagney's infectious energy, who excellently praises Broadway's commitment to madness. He is an absolute whirlwind when he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners, and a gold digging girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cagney does not make classical lighting alone. The script is cracking with some of the sharp double cleaners that deliver Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee, and especially Joan Blondell, who cut everything down. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, desirable and nervous, and are only made at the time before Hollywood code 34 arrives. Unfortunately, the thirties and sometimes far from seeing such a wealth of music at the foot. again. Gentileism and morality have ensured this.
