This movie is a cold, empty truth. Often we think "no, it won't happen to me." But it can. Drug trafficking is big money and often people are unknowingly (or cheated) on smugglers. The story of these two girls is a story of many of their favorite youngsters, just wanted an exotic vacation that turned into a nightmare. People need to know that such events are not unlikely or exaggerated - this is a big problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to a mature viewer because it is necessary to really appreciate it Film. It is very emotional and raw. It's worth a look and definitely remains in memory.
