I haven't seen the BSG, I tried to show it once in the middle of the show, but I couldn't get it. But I saw yesterday that I took Caprica Rebirth because I felt a little lost, so I decided to look at the pilot today and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising exhibition and the only side effect I had was that I now want to look at the BSG. <br /> <br /> But what I really liked is that I didn't have to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand what was going on in Caprica. From what I've read online, they tried to reach the female population because BSG got more men and at least it worked for me. <br /> <br /> However, I recommend that if you try to look at the exhibition from the outset with a pilot.
