This docu-drama is what Richard Attenborough, a man who gave us "Gandhi", would be beautifully captured, in a massively cast, well-written, meticulous, literary way that Hollywood cast back in the 1930s and precisely. It stands out as a genre film that depicts its native language (or more appropriately in its Canadian, "First Nations" culture) and stands for "Black Robe" as a well-photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, about 1934). This idyllic portrait originates from his theme: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scottish woman who has grown up in Hastings (England) by her aunt, who was so obsessed with her childhood "red Indian" that she went to Canada. in the forest and got trapped and became the son of the Ojibway band. He was a useless man who had a habit of getting married and giving up. India / Brides, none of whom knew him less because he was extraordinarily charming and long-lasting. One of her women (one of the wiser ones, most of the accounts) brought her famous as a writer and early lawyer to protect northern natural land, and that is Attenborough's story. The chemistry of Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (like Gray Owl's husband, Pony) is related and if not, it is still quite touching. A good movie if you need some time from the mad crowd.
