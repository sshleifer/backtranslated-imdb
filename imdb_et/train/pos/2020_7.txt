USE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I saw an ad on this video. Then my sister discovered we had a book so I read it. I borrowed the video the same day I finished the book. it was very memorable, as was the book. The cast was brilliant.Tara Fitzgerald was great because Helen and Rupert Graves were hateful of Arthur. Costumes, music and settings are amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING! Viewed on this <br /> <br /> The negative sides have some sexual scenes that have been added and some are violent. This is the reason why the video is rated 15. There are some other things that are thrown away. After the first I felt the accuracy went down. Although the book is better than that, I am glad that I have seen it and recommend it to people reading this book who are Bronte fans or similar costume dramas (all 3!) As long as you accept sex scenes. The book is quite undervalued. That Brontes books don't seem to have been widely read or known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, which has made it many times for television and film. Another thing.If I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion it was, but here they were all out! <br /> <br /> 7
