It must be one of my most popular Twilight Zone episodes, mainly to depict two lonely souls in an apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> Grocery stores and gravel streets are terribly the best way of Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Although the parable may be a bit more difficult than today's drama standards, it is great - using a setting to make a statement that is consistent with human experience, as well as geopolitics in a way that is timeless. The whole drama is based solely on Mr Bronson's and Mrs Montgomery's shoulders, who do not disappoint. (They can both rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> True classic.
