Victor Nunez imitates this unpleasant story of a young woman's emotional journey that is sometimes seen in the cinema. Poetry is the meaning of literary and cinematic play. There is something very literary about the film, almost like a novel on the screen. In this sense, the film achieves a lot that cannot; but it is also quite slow at other times, lowering the depth that it ever gained before. The movie star Ashley Judd hasn't made a better movie so far. She fits the lead with Ruby like a glove, almost like she shouldn't have done. He has a real movie star in the film, and he has not really succeeded in passing on the same subordinates in his later films, although he was impressive in his normal life.
