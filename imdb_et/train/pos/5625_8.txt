Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after a single biker has accused him. He is deadly shaken by the fact that his attacker knows his address. As expected, Joe (James Russo) strikes his way into Marjorie's home and humiliates him. Black and bloody, Marjorie manages to get his attacker upside down by tapping the living daylight out of the jerk and making him helpless thanks to his palm squirt in his eyes and throat. Hog tied and beat himself, Joe tries to explain to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they get home. There's almost a sense of mercy, but it doesn't come from Marjorie. Should he still punish? Violence, sexual abuse and tough language give R-rating. Fawcett really stay away from ditsy roles that would forever stain his career. Kudos directed by Robert M. Young.
