The events of September 11, 2001 put this Oscar award ceremony in silence for a minute's silence before the memorial was erected, and there was little way for everyone to sing all the dance comedies we're expecting to show, but that wasn't bad. Entertainment was more or less limited to the LOTR sent with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, and that was the case. The other exhibitions were admitted and I have to admit that it was really more enjoyable than song and dance numbers reviewed over decades, and Whoopi Goldberg was not a bad performer, unlike very esoteric David Letterman a few years ago and one minute of silence on September 11 was haunting. and dignified <br /> <br /> The prizes were completely kidnapped from New Zealand. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four small prizes, while BEAUTIFUL MIND mostly raised the main prizes, except for the best actor who should have gone to the tough New Zealander, but instead went all over America's nice guy. The only Oscar award I accepted, except those presented to FELLOWSHIP, were the best actors and the best actors, both were the right speeches.
