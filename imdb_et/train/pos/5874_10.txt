this step was great fun! funnier i've seen for a while, akshay and john kick ass as always, and chicks are hot too. the story is awesome, a lot of great jokes, and who looked at it before is an idiot. i tell him u have no Indian background, so u don't understand humor u moor. do not appreciate movies u do not understand. what u look at, a subtitle version where most jokes have been lost in translation? that's what i thought about jackass. <br /> <br /> akshay kumar is the best actor and proves his versatility, he can do not only action but also comedy, and that's great. John has also proved himself, this is his first comedy role and he was also great.
