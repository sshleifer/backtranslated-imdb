The film is very perfect in what it is, keeping one constantly interested in childhood setbacks and growing up with such a strange father, and it shares it with the successive tails of murder, just can't go wrong. It is a very plot of land, a very story and essence of the film. This is a story that a director (Bill Paxton) could do so much, and in that case he really did a lot of cooperation with it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you expect more and more of what is going on and where the film is going, and the creativity behind this story is first-rate. I felt that this film would be finely made from beginning to end, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without boring noodles - this activity flows properly, quickly and tightly from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> This shows how far people go: so they do so dreadful things to their loved ones and do such evil deeds in the name of "God" when they are disappointed as in this case. It is also sometimes interesting that it is a concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a movie that one simply overlooks, but I would advise you not to do the same and watch this movie - it's very worth your time.
