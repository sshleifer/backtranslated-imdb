These French and Germans definitely have a long history that doesn't like each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship is being translated in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler confined Germany and started to take over his plans for the world, France is a victim of his ambitions. But they are the times of peace with the future. A group of miners at the border are trying to go to work in France. They cut back and later their nightclub with their French neighbors. Then there is a catastrophic and well-designed and written scene in French mines, where the German miners' group decides to escape. The simple story is not it? Pabst was a quiet cinema poet and I'm not sure if it's his first sound or not, but his poetry is discoverable there. He is not clever, but brings to the test a harsh reality. There's even a setback for the World War II event that brings this story to the point. Probably the real event is based on the fact that the film proudly makes events direct and embarrassing. Smetimes, this must be a movie.
