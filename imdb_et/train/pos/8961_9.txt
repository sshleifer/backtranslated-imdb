Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to what we are seeing today (in the 1970s - more than ten years later - there were endless references to this film). It made Novak a big address, put a nice item on Jack Lemon, gave a new light to Jimmy Stewart and gave Lancaster and Gingold new ways to explore his career (both continued to play witches and other curious bats) ", in film and on television. <br /> < br /> With 40s, I married a witch (which helped to turn the Lake of Veronica into an icon), Bell, Book, and Candle inspired big films and TV shows with everything that started with Bewitched and continued through practical magic, the worst witch and Harry Potter. br /> <br /> What I rarely see is that the film is also a pretty interesting alternative to Xmas, and that the story takes place during the Christmas holidays and, despite being superficially witchcraft, is actually embodied by a large number of Xmas spirit (giving, love , family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I always watch this movie (I've seen it many times since the first viewing in the early 90s), especially when it is shown during or shortly after. It has style, content, great cast and terrible value. And like Adam's rib, he occasionally expresses ideas that were quite radical for this time, are radical even now (in both films the female character is innocent and powerful), and so always seems to be ahead of time.
