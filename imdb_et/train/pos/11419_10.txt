Claire Denise's debut is both brave and confident. In depicting the life of the French colonial Cameroon at the end of his life, he explores the relationship between men and women, black and white. <br /> <br /> The black servant "Prot√©e" as the main wish and oppression of the film, enters the taboo territory from the beginning. Denis builds a picture of life through a series of characteristic relationships that keep an informed viewer on the screen. The film's mood is struck by the lack of camera work and lighting. <br /> <br /> Great discourse.
