Young people, sexuality and French painting - one of the most unique movies you will ever see. If you see this, it doesn't mean how difficult it is to find copies (a combination of scarcity and censorship). Sometimes it is erotic, sometimes disgusting and sometimes funny. A little boring in the middle, but you can't summon yourself to a strange movie until you've seen it at least once.
