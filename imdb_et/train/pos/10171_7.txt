Once, when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying, "No boltay!", Which means "Don't listen!". I "translated" this to "television viewers" generation "Don't be Gladys Kravitz!" (referring to "ridiculous neighbors", "Bewitched"). <br /> <br /> However, when you see Pvt. Snafu's short "Rumors", you see, is not quite ridiculous. In this case, a permanently hidden soldier hears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the United States has been attacked by the Axis. So, he tells someone who tells someone who tells someone else and it continues. As "Russians come, the Russians come", the story strikes more and more proportionally each time, so when he gets back to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it is mostly propaganda of World War II, which has a deviant term for Japan, but I have to say that Pvt. Snafu's shorts were actually pretty funny. Of course, since they had Dr. Seuss in writing and Mel Blanc gave their votes, it is not surprising that they came quite cool. It's worth seeing.
