When a small town threatens a child's killer, he goes to the police commander after he pretends to be his friend. As he becomes more and more emotional with the murderer, his psyche begins to beat, so he loses focus on catching criminals. Not a high-tension movie, but a strong image of a bad police and a psychotic loser.
