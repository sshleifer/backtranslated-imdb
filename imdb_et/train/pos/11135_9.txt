What makes Midnight Cowboy a successful movie is how Joe Buck is tied to Ratso Rizzo with a number of difficulties that affect both of them. There really is no hope in this film that either character is, but the difficult realities that both of them will give the film its kind of optimism that these men can find humanity at least with each other. <br /> <br /> This movie contains Jon Voight's best results and probably Dustin Hoffman. The rest is made up of unknowns, although it is rounded up with a fine character, including the bus at the beginning of the film. Andy Warhol's apprentice is also interested in briefing Paul Morrissey during the party event. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, it's important. Look at it.
