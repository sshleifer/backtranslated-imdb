Because this movie is the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only produces, but also produces and directs, you know it must be good. While some say that Enforcer is the best in the series, I totally agree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force, the only two who deserve to participate in the series. Although Enforcer is the right movie with a few good sequences of action, it doesn't get the dirty and sharp effects of the other three movies. This movie captures all the excitement that makes Clint Eastwood's movie good, and it got quotes that make Dirty Harry a movie. Diry Harry's this ".. Are you, punk?"; Magnum Forceis "Man must know his limitations"; and it is "Go ahead. Make my day." Also in this movie, it's nice to see a change in the landscape when you get a little tired of seeing the same old streets of San Francisco in other movies. With the good leadership of Clint Eastwood's great actors and Sandra Locke and Clint, this is, in my opinion, the best Dirty Harry sequel.
