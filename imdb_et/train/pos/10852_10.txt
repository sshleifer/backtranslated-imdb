Hi, I was alanrickman. I'm still crazy. It was just one movie that I watched partially on television. Then I had to get a video tape to finally find out how it ended. Then I wanted a DVD because the tape showed a few weeks after the first signs of decay. After the DVD, I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several movie posters and film scripts. It has become so bad now that I try to get other people to become addicted to my website and Still Crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How did it happen? What made me addicted? <br /> <br /> OK, this is one funny but somewhat sad and melancholic intelligent comedy, just as the Britons can produce. <br /> <br /> Okay, the film is the worlds, except things like '' This is the spinal faucet '' because they are characters that are neither kids nor extremely cool, but real. This is also a story of male aging. Story about men with each other. Or not. It includes some of the best participants. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy, one of the best performances I've ever seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> Good, the sound is incredible. Alien Mick Jones has written songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bass-man Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, depicting an egocentric but uncomfortable singer Ray Simms is really a song. We know about Jimmy's nails, but if you've only heard Bill Nighy's song "Love Acently," you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you have a fever for every scene that comes in x times, especially those scenes in the concert. You would die so you can really dance in the crowd when Strange Fruit makes "the whole world", singing on the lungs. You have a long time to cry and celebrate with thousands of people at the Wisbech Festival Festival the revival of a real Strange Fruit. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to strange fruits. If there is a world where this band actually exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> I got mad ... someone?
