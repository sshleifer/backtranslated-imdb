Unfortunately, many consumers who write IMDb comments equate low budget and not good. Whatever the film needs, no more budget is actually part of it. Big sets and many special effects would have made it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two. <br /> <br /> Almost unknown Alexandra Staden is enchanting as mysterious modesty, and it's very important for this movie to work. His clever little smiles and feeling of appearance are terrifying and you will find yourself wanting the camera not to miss his face. It makes sense that the bad boyfriend Nikolai, who is also played by the little-known (at least in the US) Nikolay Coaster-Waldau, may be unusually interested in what Modesty can use. He can only direct his rape with a blow and spit "stop wasting your time!" then he attacked his heavily armed but suddenly vivacious people. Making such a scene unbelievable does not happen by chance. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with rail-thin Staden playing with Modesty is not just believable that his hand is handled by a sporty and muscular-looking man like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. He's just not Peta Wilson or an inflated Hilary Swank-type actor who can convince. Coaster-Waldau, who allows himself to be fired at Staden, looks like he's just against his little sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is not really an action movie, it's not a big mistake. I hope they do it better when and when they do.
