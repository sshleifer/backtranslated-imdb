A captivating horror movie full of the famous face but stole Cristina Raines (later TV "Flamingo Road") as a real but somewhat unstable model with a haunting smile forced to pay for her suicide attempts, guarding the gate to hell! Scenes from Raines modeling are very busy, mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina palm, but when Raines moves the creepy Brooklyn Heights brown stone (where the dark priest lives on the top floor), things really start to bake. Neighbors, including the fantastically evil Burgess Meredith and the kinky couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are stupid and Eli Wallach is a great fun as a clever police detective. The film is a cross-contamination of almost "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist", but what a combination! According to Jeffrey Konvitz's best seller, "The Sentinel" is entertainingly horrible, full of strokes brought by the director Michael Winner, who starts with a stroke that ends with skill. *** 1/2 from ****
