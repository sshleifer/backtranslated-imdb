"Man In The Moon" is a pretty good movie. It is sometimes very moving and very well done in all aspects. I wouldn't say the movie was terribly original, but what are those days? <br /> <br /> Cast members did a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age and doing a good job. Jason London is doing a good job. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his job. I really liked Sami's character (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he seemed to be a father you are afraid of, but in the end you really like his character. The rest was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you are concerned with movies about growing up and throwing in life, you should watch this movie. I suggest you read the plot summary and if it sounds like something you'd like, go to it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading. <br /> <br /> Crisis
