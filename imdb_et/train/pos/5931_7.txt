Though written by Stephen King, an overpriced writer, if it ever exists, is actually a pretty fun B movie. Vampire, bleeding creatures living in a candlelight house and draining virgin life, a great grave-terrain, heroic cats, and a very beautiful virgin. Music is even Enya's music, an idea I found quite ... nice. I'm sure the king is disappointed with this little movie, even though he has dirty dialogue and ideas, all of them in a real and annoying king's potboiler. (Although Sleepwalkers, once I understand this right, is a script without a novel or short story). However, these touches of sewer smells show that they haven't used a ghost writer ...
