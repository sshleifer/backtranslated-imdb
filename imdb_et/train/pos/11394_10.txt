Although the story is sweet and dancing and singing in the main part of the film is a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is a dream. It includes a combination of the highest form of American music (Gershwin), the fascinating beauty of French impressionist art, Kelly's appealing choreography (including his striking "pas de deux d'amour", a truly separate genre) with a selection of the most beautiful set. Quick matching with music and visual explosion with these dances was a creative genius and a great artist.
