I just saw it last night, sent in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Passionate Eye series. It has recently been reviewed (in September 2003) at both the Toronto International Film Festival and many others. This is a pretty remarkable movie. The filmmakers literally hit the story, being a documentary about Chavez. Instead, they found themselves in the midst of events, when the coup was opened. They had unprecedented access to events and people, and most of the time, the story was as it happens. Of course, they have their own ideological perspective (what they are showing), but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to pay attention to events, people and background, and the history that leads to the coup. As a film, it is not a breakthrough in stylistic or aesthetic terms, and that is, in my opinion, the way it should be. What we can see is what the "hidden" press should be. What we see is a remarkable report of a country fighting for democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who really cares for his people ... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests to lead a coup d'Ã©tat of a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historical event when it manifests itself. <br /> <br />
