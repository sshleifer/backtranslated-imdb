It is a disgrace that, because of this title, people in the movie who hate football are avoiding it. Turn it like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sport flick. The story is touching and intelligent without being funny, jokes jokingly joking, and the characters have worked well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are excellent as teenagers Jess and Jules, providing great performances both on the field and outside. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess's anxious father and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazing about the "Rattas fucking", as well as any nice guy, making the most of his great Irish accents! Even if you don't like football, watch this movie. If something makes you smile.
