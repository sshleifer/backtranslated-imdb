This is a good thing that I rented before seeing the movie viewer rating. It was a great movie that I add to my Christmas selection. The cast was excellent and Ben Affleck has a good lead. I'd say to viewers who didn't see the movie to go ahead and buy it. I appreciate it there on Christmas holidays. The film was very funny and well written and Ben plays the eccentric rich leader very well. The things he says and does are just how I imagine that a person with too much money would work. The film is much more fun than Santa Claus and Christmas with Kranks. The pros have a good story and teach the true meaning of Christmas, which means you can't buy money with love.
