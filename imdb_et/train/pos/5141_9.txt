I have to admit that I didn't expect much to watch this movie in my Japanese film class, but this movie pulled me away. The director is doing a great job with the title of his film, depicting truly madness. I think this silence of the film adds to the similarity of madness, helping the viewer to experience the inner characters, not the world outside his mind. This movie just added feelings between the silent foreign films and America, because the foreign films work much more to use their mind and think instead of always going to the end of a happy film with a imaginative film.
