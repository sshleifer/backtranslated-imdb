Someone pulled the customs and for a moment their life changed forever. In the confusion of a new life, they learn a highly respected lawyer named Hank Green (Bill Pullman). <br /> <br /> An American who knows the legal system of Thailand is fighting for her girl to be free. However, they will quickly go out when they leave or go, and if they are looking for a great movie that will stay with you for years - the Brokedown Palace is definitely the way to go.
