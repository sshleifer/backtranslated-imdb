From the unknown of this movie to the Rialto channel, I found it to be a pleasant, striking and enriching film. Casting was great. I loved all the characters, they were a bit exaggerated at times (but it's a movie). The way he saw and pleasantly drives the main game lasted until it changed badly, as it can and will be in real life. Yeah, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested in watching the movie after it started, because people so often joke about their ability to act (I find it quite amazing, because I think it is always a sure actor). <br /> <br /> I loved a little ending, where Andy's character said "sometimes I feel like he's never been here", etc., was just as it really is in this situation (which I personally know), then it was a great classic piece "Nocturne" I think Chopin, which was a nice way to stop (hinders the end of light comedy, which was probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I say "well done" to filmmakers - I've seen 1000 of the worst movies!
