Every "Hammer" movie I see is something that really brings a new world of fantasy. Something can happen in the Hammer world. "Abyss Guardian" is one of these types of films. It advances deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring about another type of horror fantasy. All in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
