Kill (1980) is Brian De Palma's mysterious horror movie and it really works. The atmosphere is there. The atmosphere that scares you. And that's not what the horror movie should do. All actors, Michel Caine, are perfect as dr. Robert Elliott, a small secret of shrinkage. Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated mature woman is terrible.Keith Gordon as his son Peter is brilliant.Nancy Allen as Liz Blake's speech is fantastic.Dennis Franz makes his typical detective role.His Detective Marino is one of the most colorful in this movie. There are many scary scenes in this movie. The elevator scene is one of them. Comparisons have been made of this and Alfred Hitchcock's psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. Both films can cause sleepless nights.
