I love cinema, so I feel deeply embarrassed. I gave thumbs down "Che, parts 1 and 2" without seeing the movie. Terrible I know. But I felt a trap committed by ... who? I really don't know, but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like a wild fire, and no matter how clever I think I am, I got into it. But fortunately I hit the Argentine film director Martin Donovan, whom I love and admire. When I told him I wasn't going to see it because I knew the film was a failure, he looked at me as if he was ready to hit me and Donovan was pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the movie and why. I immediately went to see both parts and "Che, Parts 1 and 2" is the best film I saw in 2008. With this purity, it is to remind you of the work of some great masters. the past. Our audience is something we are no longer used to. I don't know if we ever were. Chewing, moving, without a concession and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. We see his soul, we can perceive it. Humanity of mankind is overwhelming. So, thank you again to Martin Donovan for educating me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and all who participated in this oriental film. Don't make the mistake I was about to make. See it on the big screen now
