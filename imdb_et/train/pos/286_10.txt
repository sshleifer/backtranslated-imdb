I read a lot of responsibilities when they were in theaters and they were all bad .... I think you have to be a type of person who can enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who enjoyed Walton or Little House ... U don't understand or enjoy these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now that you love the joy of joy ... I knew he was bad news about the beginning of the movie .... I wish it would show more end instead of letting you just think about it. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff ... it's 6 years later that you know he's interested in girls. <br /> <br /> I want to say I've enjoyed all 4 movies. ... Wasn't crazy about books ... Don't wait for the next movie. How Clark speaks to you every time. I'd like to see Jones's appearance in January ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
