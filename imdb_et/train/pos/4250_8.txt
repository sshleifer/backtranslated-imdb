Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones", her third and most complete, short film is an amazing sense of humor and leaves some head scratching. What the film is close to heart, and he almost does not agree with me on this issue, is how ordinary Joe finds confidence to live with little inspiration. Or not. You have to see yourself. The short is alternating, making the festival ring around, so keep your eyes peeled and catch as you get - you'll be happy. This is fun. And look at Todd's other short films that open here and there: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
