A somewhat funny and thrilling thriller with Jamie Foxx as an unhappy, fast-talking hood, selected by too demanding US Treasury Agent (David Morse) who is released on New York's streets to find a picky computer thief / hacker (Doug Hutchinson) who stole from the Treasury forty two million dollars and left two guards dead. <br /> <br /> "Bait" stands for Antoine Fuqua ("Replacement Warriors") and it does quite well with the task, although it does not exceed its first movie. The common feature of the two films is the sequences that are great. <br /> <br /> Foxx is pretty good here, although his character is annoying at first, but I started to catch up with the whole movie. Hutchinson is wonderful as a champion who can be merciless when John Malkovich and a patient, as late as Laurence Olivier was "Marathon Man". Morse is okay as an agent who comes up with a brilliant plan to get it at all costs.
