This Peabody award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st season, where Captain Picard, Beverly, Data and Starfle's historian named Waylan, named after San Francisco, struggles with Holocaust failure in San Francisco. This episode is a tribute to Raymond Chandler's "Malta Falcon", where Patrick Stewart assumes the role of Humphrey Bogart - with fedora and trenchcoat. The office itself is almost an exact copy of what appeared in Bogey's "Malta Falcon". <br /> <br /> This episode also briefly introduces a mysterious insect trail called Jaradak, who mostly interacts with high-level buzzing sound. Communicating with this stranger race is difficult and Picard has the ability to communicate with this contest in his mother tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. The best part of this episode, however, is the appearance of the famous Hollywood actor Lawrence Tierney in the role of gangster Cyrus Redblock. He was such a beautiful man in the 1940s. Oh, well ...
