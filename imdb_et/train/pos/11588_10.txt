This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather's young eagle. the boy must eat and take care of the eagle until it is old enough to grow it. boy saves eagle from killing and tribe. The eagle helps him eat a small pond scared by the boy. Later, the brother had a deer that the bully's child claimed because their arrows were as close as they were. Only until they control the thickness of the red lines, they determine who is actually the deer. But it was unfortunate, because it made the other boys even more cruel to him, and eventually robbed him of the rock, but if you think he falls out of his pure love around the eagle, his gold bag becomes only a necklace as a reminder of who he was. Please, if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, let me know. I haven't seen it for more than 30 years, but I still remember the movie osi.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
