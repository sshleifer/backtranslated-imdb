Okay, so the plot is on a trembling surface. Yes, well, there are some randomly performed song and / or dance series (for example: Adam's concert and Henry's stage). And Leslie Caron can't really, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But somehow, "American In Paris" can do all this as polished, first-rate music-- thanks to Gene Kelly's incredible dance talent and choreography and the magic she seems to be importing into every scene with Caron. (She needs it because she seems to have a ... emotional problem). <br /> <br /> The most successful and technically frightening number in this music is obviously a 16-minute ballet to the end of the movie. It's amazingly filmed and Kelly and Caron are dancing beautifully. But my favorite number should be Kelly's character singing "I Got Rhythm" with a number of French schoolgirls, then breaking into a number of American dances. Just proves how you don't need special effects if you have real * talents *. <br /> <br /> Not a "classic" level with "Singin 'In The Rain", but beautiful high there. Worth checking out!
