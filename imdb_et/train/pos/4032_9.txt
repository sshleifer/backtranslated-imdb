Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves the label and makes you think. In the Partition Index, this movie shows the true reality of the Indian partition. Urmila gets perfect signs of her beautiful and deeply emotional image of a woman who has no chance of going. His freedom, personal identity and family respect were taken overnight during a tragic inter-country dispute. Manoj bajpai is just as brilliant as his unfortunate robber. There are several moments in the film tears. The film at the points is deeply traumatic. Some partitions are cooling the backbone, but Urmila's durability and survival are both remarkable. A woman who has been abducted from her freedom to a woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. A remarkable film that should be given a credit for smart signs and storytelling.
