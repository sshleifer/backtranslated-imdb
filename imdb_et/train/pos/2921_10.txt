One and only was a great movie. I had just finished viewing it in EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought it was a good idea of ​​what life is like a professional wrestler. Now this film has been made 4 years before the birth, but I don't think that traveling with professional wrestling has changed so much. Sad, funny and everywhere GREAT !!! **** 10+
