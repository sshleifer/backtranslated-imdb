I am not a lot of expert in the details of acts or other films, but this film hit me deeply. I don't think I'll ever forget it. Especially one scene (I think someone who sees the film knows what I'm talking about) is printed on my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched a similar film by Lily 4-ever (see previous commentator). It was also very touching, but not quite straight and cruel. If you're sensitive at all, your eyes are tears, but Anjos Do Sol (sunset) can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very depressing topic, but I think No, I hope the film will be able to pay more attention to it. <br /> <br /> More movies to see !!!!!!
