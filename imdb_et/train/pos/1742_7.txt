Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I've seen in the last ten years. Excellent performance (especially yiannis zouganelis is excellent), well written script and effective direction from very special, very average standards in Greece, auteur. The film, apparently influenced by Sam Peckinpah Straw Dogs, may be a masterpiece if it finally avoids obvious and exaggerated situations and symbols. However, it is a film that deserves our attention and belongs to this rare category of Greek films that should be viewed outside Greece. It is a disgrace that other counterfeit and major major productions such as Politiki Kouzina did not commercially work in Greece.
