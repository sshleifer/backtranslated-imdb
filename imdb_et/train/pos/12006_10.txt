The most amazing, spiritually uplifting film about the Restoration of the Gospel. Better than any other film or film that has been made for restoration. If you haven't seen it, then create a Salt Lake plane and look now. You won't regret it! You really know what the first Saints had to fight, giving complete and complete faith to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Finally, you get some insight into what the Prophet had to fight and the persecutions he and his people were facing. If you have questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings just look at this film, it will do so in a complete and complete sense.
