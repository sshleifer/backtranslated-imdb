Just as Al Gore shook us with a painfully honest and clever documentary "Uncomfortable Truth", leaders Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield remind us that it's time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet will have catastrophic consequences for all living beings around the world. Al Gore showed us the dark future of the planet Earth, presenting difficult facts supported by documented examples of a long and always interesting monologue. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful path to achieve this. They do not give us a future that could appear on our planet if we do not change things, but rather show us the true beauty of the planet Earth in all of its amazing glories. We see places we knew they existed but didn't think they were so beautiful. In this film we see a wide range of extraordinary places, such as abandoned deserts, large forests and flora filled with fauna and flora, until the eye is seen. And in all these very different environments, we see beautiful animals that are trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is precisely the kind of movie that came with Al Gore. so we understand that our planet is too expensive to get into it. Patrick Stewart's voice is always relaxing and so well done, though first it seemed like I was watching an X-Men movie instead! The film is probably the most remarkable thing about this documentary. Sometimes: what you see is so unrealistic that you forget that a camera with a camera had to shoot all that pleasant material. <br /> <br /> In short, it's definitely visible to everyone because it touches all the people on Earth on this beautiful planet! The truth is that I've never thought that our planet was so amazingly beautiful!
