I know I would like this movie and I'll do it mostly, but as others have mentioned, this tooth is a bit long. I also found that the scary hormones of all male teams are a bit annoying. It's a miracle that they didn't start rubbing and crying for months. I must also say that the film leaves me cold. This is a very sterile atmosphere that goes through the film. On the plus side, the effects are big (in addition to cartoon), as well as effects, props, costumes and of course Robbie. If the robot wasn't in this movie, I don't think it would have been as popular as it was. The other half of the movie picks up steam when we start to explore the "widgets" of "Krell". As many times as I've seen this movie, Krell still scratches my head to exactly who or what they were. Based on what was being produced at that time, "Earth of the Earth" is also banned for miles above the average Sci-Fi films of the time. Filming with color also increases its enjoyment. Definitely classic in itself, shortcomings and all, and worthy.
