Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry her homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) out of Belgium. The only other problem is that Stella herself is a lesbian. They have their own separate lives when one night after Albert's birthday, they get into bed and then love. Later in the film, after falling in love with Stella, he suspects Albert was cheating and appearing in his work one night after closing. What he finds, leaves the viewer stunning. It's a great movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their role that it is amazing that they have not recognized their work better here. The highly controversial "R" movie "P" published in 1978 is in this much more liberal time. <br /> <br /> The recently released DVD has the specificity of "making" on the disc and says the movie was based on real story, so viewers who say the movie is not "real" are wrong. Everyone is individual and different people fall in love for different reasons - these are the questions that are being explored in this great movie for anyone who has ever loved!
