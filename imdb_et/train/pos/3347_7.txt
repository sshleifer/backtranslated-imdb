Robert Mitchum stands for Clint Tollinger in this short but harsh west: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional city player - just as the city needs someone to save himself; he's the one who puts it in. Tollinger's last concert will be an accident: searching for a city to find its own escape will come to the city that the western gangster plays like a doll. But many townspeople begin to hire Tollinger on the day when his cleaning method becomes highly taxable (suddenly, the High Plains Drifter seems less original). <br /> <br /> A man with a gun begins as an average western tough-cinema movie, but starts to surprise you more and more when the movie progresses. What starts as forgotten and the running of the mill ends in the dark and the center of character. The whole movie is very well shot and cast is very enjoyable. Mitchum is his usual great self-person who is not his best performances. Mitchum still has a classic and effective rugged-man presence with high speed and captures the thrill, meaningful and shocking scene of the movie from the park. Man with a gun is a nice western part of Mitchum and is well worth it.
