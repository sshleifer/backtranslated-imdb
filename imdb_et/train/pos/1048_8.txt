For Muslim women in West Africa, it can be very difficult for men abusing married life. The community may not explicitly approve of this behavior, but they may not be ready for it as an offender, a attitude that of course allows. Fortunately, the Cameroonian Act Letter for Everyone promises equality, and this documentary follows the real exploitation of various female practitioners in Cameroon's legal system as they strive to ensure justice for many women and children. Remarkable (except for the central story) is how courts, in spite of their informality, are actually pragmatically progressive when it is actually purchased. The program also provides an exciting overview of the entire Cameroonian lifestyle, which, except in terrible crimes committed in terrible cases, seems astonishingly emotional and joyful compared to the European or North American population. And while I admit that this comment may be na√Øve, this attitude seems to be an amazing festive English that they speak. In general, it's a terrible little movie and much more fun to see than you can imagine.
