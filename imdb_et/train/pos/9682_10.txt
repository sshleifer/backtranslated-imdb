I absolutely loved this movie! It was so good! The parrot, Paulie, talks about this movie. Paulie is given a little girl by Marie. Paulie helps Marie learn to speak and become the best friends. But when Paulie says Marie is driving, she falls and the birds are sent away. Then the adventure begins. Paulie goes through so much to find her way back to Marie. This movie is so cute, funny, touching, sad and much more. When I first watched this movie, it made me cry. The courage of the birds and the desire to find their Marie throughout this time was so touching. I have to say that the ending is so cute and sad, but you have to look at it to find out how it goes. Finally, the janitor tries to hear her help after her story. Does she find her long lost or not? Find out if you watch this sweet, warm-hearted movie. It touches your heart. Rating: 10
