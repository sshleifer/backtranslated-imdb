If your airplane type fans have to see it! In the 1920s and 30s, Johnny Dangerous has not only great actors but great lines. "Clear the data wall, end the data wall, and drag dat # @ $% # @ $ sein." "You shouldn't hang me johnny" or "Sounds like putting Johnny". It's definitely an old James Cagney movie looting and pointing to them a lot. There is a great scene when Jhonnys died and is a priest who has set up his escape. Listen carefully to the reading of the fake priest, pretty funny. Another big scene is when Dom Delauise plays the popes. Look at his reaction to Johnny after he hints at the Pope, without saying much without sound. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves to laugh or has old film fans.
