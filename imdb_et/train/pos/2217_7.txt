I am usually skeptical about watching movies or mini collections based on novels because the scenario is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The scenario was very close to the novel (I think it helps the author to be the CEO and writer, huh?) <br /> <br /> Cast is outstanding. I can't describe how much I enjoyed such a wide range of actors (Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chardin and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> Location setting ... I was expecting to see in my homes and houses what I thought: what I saw on the screen was a little different. But that wasn't enough for me not to like the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 stars out of 10! <br /> <br />
