But it's kind, at least when you grew up at Weird Al, as I did. It is his life and career mockumentary, starting with a superstardom and turning back to tracking origin. It is uneven in places, but some segments are still very funny, especially when it goes to Japan. Although it is not quite emotionally textured as Lost in Translation, and he does not find love in a short time, he takes an absolutely bizarre cultural melange, which is Tokyo's street life. is not recognized as an insightful cultural commentator that he is; maybe the name of another rose smell just as sweet. However, this is a funny film.
