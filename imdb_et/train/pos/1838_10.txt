WAQT is the perfect example of a chicken soup not your soul. Of course, the broth has lost its true taste because it is diluted and decorated. Hindi cinema in his first attempt, but who at his second trip gives all the stereotypical film formulas. Although Vipul Shah had the conviction that he showed something unlikely, because the blinds kidnap the bank at AANKHEN, he can't revive the whole WAQT package, based on something so imaginative of his father-to-son relationship. In Gujarat's game Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a reasonable story with a social message backing up. The relationship between parents and sons, the unconditional love of his father for his son, and the son's responsibility to the family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who has lifted his entire empire from scratch, is leading a wealthy life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never had to strive for something, because she was specially made and fed with a spoon during her lifetime. Ishwar's Pentecost has further damaged her. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar, but does nothing to fulfill her dreams. Meanwhile, he marries his ladylove Medal (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that Aditya will make marriage a more responsible person, but she is disappointed. Aditya is still the leader in its good lives. <br /> <br /> The end time will end when Ishwar exits Aditya from his house. The sudden change in the attitude of his loving father between him and the woman he now expects creates Aditya. He has no choice but to try to make a living for his wife and his unborn child. He begins to become an independent man, but the division of his relationship with his father is growing. <br /> <br /> The story is simpler, but with a simple scenario, it's a very basic approach. It is easy to identify and associate with both the father and son's trusted characters. If you are not one of these two, you would have at least come across people like those in real life. <br /> <br /> Add a simple handwriting to Vipul Shah's manuscript. With such a family affair, every other chairman of his place would have included melodrama tons in the proceedings under the cinematographic laws of the Bollywood family drama, making the film a compulsive tear. But Shah faces no emotional effort in dealing with most parts of the film. <br /> <br /> A clear example of his modest direction is evident before the interval scene, where his father excludes his son from his house quite lightly. The purpose of the scene is achieved when the brains of the audiences are not struck. For the other half of the scene where the son of the now separated father is in the conversation. This is what distinguishes WAQT from KABHI KUSHI GHUM or EK from RISHTAA and in practice places it one level high in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after getting all the isolation points, you can ask where the WAQT still fails? The problem is that, although WAQT is different from the type of treatment in the other parts of the league, it provides a disorder on the package. Which, together with the director, forces song-n-dance everywhere and then in the first half. There's the song of the Shadow of Johar's glove, the song of Chopra kinda Holi, the father's son's disco dandia, the dream song and the dream that creates a horror for the viewer. Imagine this ... Dad is just a son pulled out of his house and his son dreams about his wife from the Moroccan mountains. Inappropriate! The reason! and the audience sitting out. <br /> <br /> The movie will drag in the first half and the real story will only start in the second half. The director has wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements. A lot of the dog's chasing sequence is not bad, but it doesn't redeem. However, Akshay Kumar's reducing dance is simply ridiculous. Imagine getting a hunt for this (inadvertently) fun histrionic movie star. Add to it the climax set in the star-yacht finals where the son breaks with emotions. It's so archetypal! Also, the editing pattern could have been reversed to hide the father's reason to change his attitude to his son. <br /> <br /> Although Anu Malik's music is good, it is necessary in the proceedings. Santosh Thundiiayil's camera work is competent enough, though not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia has come up with some good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make the moments of film or light very efficiently. Although Rajpal Yadav has gone overboard with his comic hysteria recently in many films, he is showing his character this time and is completely restrained. His death expressions are perfectly complimented by Boman's upper histrionics. Shefali Shah is convincing in her mother's role. Don't take a picture, but it is flawless when playing as well as looking at your character. Priyanka is great and performs well. <br /> <br /> Of course, great applause deserves Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is a particularly expressive scene where her deliberate father deliberately wants her to be aware of her responsibilities. Although Bachchan goes a little dramatic on a few scenes, his shine captures the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, WAQT is like a soup with ingredients that are tasty and nutritious, but the final recipe is somehow not so appetizing.
