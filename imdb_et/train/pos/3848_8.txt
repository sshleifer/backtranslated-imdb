Gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination. He is also a homosexual and Catholic tendency to a Catholic guilt and some seer, or so it seems. Christine has "attracted" her to Flushing. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit of a tough trade, he has decided to stay far from franchising. After all, the benefits of heterosexuality are forced. Then he realizes that Christine's three previous men are dead violent deaths. Did Christine murder them and was she a boyfriend Herman? Verhoeven is an overheated, over-tasted blend of melodrama Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious images, and a lot of red color. A lot of time that seems and seems like a dream and we can never be sure that what we see is real or Gerard's imagination. Fun is thinking about it. Also, the fact that Christine is an endlessly more pleasurable character, whether by Gerard or bullish Herman, means that we do not want from either man to her. In fact, it's fair to say that Gerard's fire can't get fast enough. Also Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk's super exhibitions and Verhoeven's best film until his superbly submissive sci-fi "Starship Troopers".
