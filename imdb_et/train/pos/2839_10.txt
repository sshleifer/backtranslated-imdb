I saw this movie in advance and found it great. There are huge, real oceans 11 by Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all give their eye-catching performances in one way or another. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean -WOW! This film is not a straightforward romance or romantic comedy, although it is as romantic as funny. It also has serious stories and notes. But I think it's good. See it for yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others are saying.
