Surprisingly well-functioning comedy was a small British effort "Lady X Divorce (1938)". It marks the first pair of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon before this small film about uncontrollable passion in 19th century English mores. And while Olivier and Oberon aren't particularly good at screw comedy, it's all good. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who comes to the suite of Priggish divorce lawyer Logan (Olivier) as it is a nasty English mist that prevents travel. She does everything she can to irritate her - but in a crazy movie she goes against her. And he falls for him. But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberon's "Lady X" (that's all she sees from Oliver) reads that Olivier is a married woman. Worse and more fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier, who wants to divorce her husband, whom dear Larry considers to be Oberon! Have a nice sex dialogue and a fun study of sexual policy. You see that Olivier is not too sure about comedy, but in the real Olivier he is the perfect professional and offers. And he's dealing with screws, perhaps not easily, but with pleasure. Oberon was not a big shiver as an actor, but he was usually competent enough and, despite his prestigious screen, he didn't like him, he worked well with Olivier. It was filmed in early Technicolor, which nowadays looks very primitive (everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe printing needs to be cleaned.
