Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film of 18 segments. You can do math - 18 segments in 120 minutes, which means that each director had seven minutes to tell him or her story. The film is based on the premise that you can really talk about this short time. The room works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Both represent a different aspect of the Paris experience and almost every director draws great and grandiose actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful images in this movie that are hard to pick one or two favorites. Probably most memorable to me was Juliette Binoche's laughing mother in the "Place des Victoires", Gena Rowlands as "Quartier Latin" beauty, Catalina Sandino Moreno as a servant in "Loin du 16ème" and Margo Martinda as a postman in Colorado who has learned to speak French to visit Paris ("14ème Arrondissement" segment). <br /> <br /> Special attention should be paid to Gulliver Hecq, probably the smallest boy who would ever harass a Parisian metro station (segment "Tuileries"). <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we could catch some fine points that we definitely missed. But Paris is photographed so beautifully that I would recommend it on the big screen. In any case, don't miss it!
