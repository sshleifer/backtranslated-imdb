This movie was great, a little scary, but great. For those who have heard about Colombia and know this story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. It is known to the mind that people think about this thing, but you never understand how bad it is, and this film makes you understand. That's really good. It also makes you think before you can hear yourself. I read a book about the Colombian massacre, and it made me think, this film makes me worry and scares me to death. The downside is how to kill someone's driver for killing sera. I recently had a threat and I flew without thinking, but after this movie, I should take it seriously. Some people are crazy and you never know what they are, so take it seriously and don't appreciate anyone.
