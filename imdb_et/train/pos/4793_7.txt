After seeing the film, I feel I know a little more about the US. David Lynch is synonymous with shocking and strange, and these elements have not really disappeared from the Straight Story. But it is in the light I haven't seen from Lynch before. Let's start with a simple family who lives in a quiet life, but comes together with a number of absurdly interesting characters that have a deep life that cannot be seen in their introduction. In particular, there was a bar with two WWII veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current life and emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, don't look here. But if you are looking for real people with real stories, this is a movie for you.
