SMALL SPOILER <br /> <br /> Little Stephen King is a shocker. It's not perfect, with any imagination - even though the slippery performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, the mysterious story is still misguided. The old Micmac burial site, Rachel's sick sister and Jacob-Marley-Victor Victor, never came together together and the film's places feel confused and overwhelmed. But a few horror movies are really perfect and what it may lack in other areas that it performs in its shocking readiness. "Pet Sematary" can actually be one of the most cruel horror films of the last memories, with its murderous zombie child and its highly sensitive image of Zelda. It's politically inaccurate, it's tasteless, it's free - and it makes us desperate so that "safer" horror movies never get. Add this to Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's wise direction, and you will have an intensely satisfying scary movie - even with a hokey finish. Recommended for genres. 7.5 out of 10.
