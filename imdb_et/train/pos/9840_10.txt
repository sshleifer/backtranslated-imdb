Born again in Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a person can come back from the dead, a little girl's head will live with a vengeance so she can <</ br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For me, once again, is a highly rated classic episode that forms part of which defined the X files for me before I started to view it. I saw a couple of segments before the show first appeared and I was too young to watch it, for example, the Jersey Jersey parts, but I especially remember this episode when I was 11 years old and completely out of the scene. where they kid with the bus and then with the little girl's hypnosis. I tell you I couldn't sleep for a week! For this reason, the episode is now a special aura that has since been enjoyed since then. This is enough to allow me to look at some obvious drawbacks on the plot, such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous vitality really began to refine her revenge. Or what he did just by sitting in the bus in the middle of the night. You think his parents would be worried. And maybe they were just not seeing this story. And it was telecine? Other than adding a really cool Carrie factor to the horrible story, there was no good explanation for that. But even with minor flaws, this is, in my opinion, a classic episode and I have no reason to dislike it. 10 out of 10
