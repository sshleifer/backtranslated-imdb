I admit that we create great expectations before we watch it, because some friends mentioned it (and they're not pervs!), Because you have to see it. And that's black! Just don't wait to see something break out. <br /> <br /> Freud's psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the movie, but there is just too much perversion and it won't end there. <br /> <br /> Some good things are Kieslowski's blue analysis, most of David Lynch's, some of Hitchcock's and maybe a couple more of what I missed (I just remembered ... Dogville) and I usually leave nothing out if they are too obvious or open. <br /> <br /> Apart from being repetitive, which is too long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense that we observe some perversions that are fed by our unconscious, and therefore, business success. most thrillers learned and used this theory as the basis. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the story and the efforts of Mr Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which has been dull for too long. North-America. Again, this is the way over the top and I believe it is not a waste of time, because I believe most people have death and blood in the dark.
