20 out of 10 This is a truly wonderful story of the evacuation of war and the passionate carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is hidden with Tom and it is immediately evident that he has serious problems when he wets his bed on the first night. William is illiterate and frightened, but somehow they both find solace in solitude. It turns out that William has the talent as an artist, and we see Tom's talent as a choir during the amusing transfer of Jerusalem. William is friendly with Zacharias Wrench, a young Jewish boy from London, and finally, with Tom and Zacharias, learns to read and write and feel part of this small close community. Just as he settled down, William recalls his mother back to London and here we see why he's been twisted. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when Tom does not hear from him, he drives to London to look for him. Finally he finds that he has a dead baby sister, where he is in the basement. After some time at the hospital, Tom realizes that he has to kidnap him and take him home. The climax is the bitter sweet when William is told that Tom will take it, while learning his best friend Zacharia has died in a London air strike. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom talked to a home office officer. <br /> <br /> I love "im," for what's worth, I think he loves me too. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't improve what it does?
