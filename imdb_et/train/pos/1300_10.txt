I first saw this DVD from a hi-fi show in London in November 2006 (I haven't been to the choir so far !!). It was through a high-level Arcam system, it sounded great dts. I always had this DVD and I tell you that it is by far the most exciting music DVD I ever watched. Cream's performance at their age was just remembering that the sound blows and the sound quality is the best I've heard from the music DVD. The music you like, this one will definitely grow to you. It is a mere shine of their performance that will make you look at it again and again. Even new musicians will not cut the mustard these days as these old rockers do.
