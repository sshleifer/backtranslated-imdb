"Life Comes On The Face ........ We Must Try To Be Beautiful" <br /> <br /> Debut from one of Belgium's best artists (she sings songs), Tom Barman. A long-awaited movie and --- a happy joy for Flemish film making --- really worth watching and promising work! It takes us to the lives of 8 main characters living on Friday and night. The title tells a lot about how we spend time with them: we float as they do on Friday afternoons, where they come together. <br /> <br /> This is a rhythmic style very "thought". Great use of music. Sometimes it takes the top edge of the pictures and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience that causes it to be photographed. It really keeps you with it when it is placed in a small place with lots of people with a big party ..... so hard to shoot. <br /> <br /> Thank you, menij√®r Barman for making this brave movie for a few years, the bad times of Flemish filmmaking. You made my day better!
