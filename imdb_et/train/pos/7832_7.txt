Finally I got my desire to see it in the cinema. A few years ago, I saw Fritz Lang's film. I hope the ideal screening conditions work for their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions were ideal for Cinematheque Ontario. Pristine full-length print. Intertexts in the original Gothic script in German with simultaneous translation, accurate without being too written. Live with piano. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie was sprayed for a while, but ultimately it was not captured, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This movie is not related to Wagner's ring cycle, as I already knew, but some may not. Wagner had adapted the 13th century. Niebelungenlied for your own purposes. Fritz Lang's epic - "Siegfried" - Part I is a lot familiar to Wagner's listeners. <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" is the story of Siegfried's wife Kriemhild, his marriage to King Etzel (Attila) hun, and his desire to revenge Hagen and Gunther, reversed against Nibelung, for murdering Siegfried. The remarkable confusion of this film is likely to have evolved and expanded in Wagner's myths to his Götterdämmerung, the dimness of his gods, and the end of Valhalla. This film remains on the ground. <br /> <br /> Most films are remarkable. Massive sets competed with Cabiria (1914), which inspired Griffith's "intolerance" (1916). Their decoration creates a new benchmark in barbaric glory. There are huge intimidated, mangy huns and Art Deco burgundies. And battles. Battles that don't really end. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in his revenge plan. He can destroy everything around him. His loyalty to his martyr Siegfried does not seem to be either love or devotion, but something that is closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth cried, "Unsex me here." He knew he was emotionally prepared for what he had to do. However, Kriemhild does not have normal human emotions and is certainly not a feminine principle. From the outset, he is "the ultimate full of cruel cruelty" by borrowing the Shakespeare phrase. Margarethe Schön and her director are sending this glow. I do not want to exaggerate, but this glow is practically the only expression ever "animate" the Kriemhild's face. This is one comment. However, this is clearly a deliberate, not just a case of bad behavior. <br /> <br /> What we have to offer is a one-dimensional sketch of enchanting fury. Some may see Kriemhild as an authorized heroine. I just see the movie as unkind.
