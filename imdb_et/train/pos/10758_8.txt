9/11 is a classic example of a cinema verdict, a sort of realistic documentary film, for New York firefighters when they fight against an extraordinary event in the history of the world. It's all small, unobtrusive, handheld camcorders that are usually betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming (and the director, the Mint's hand that often wiped the screen). <br /> <br /> In this movie, check out most firefighters - Tony Benatatos, a newcomer (or "probie in NY's firefighter language"), firefighter Joseph Pfeiffer (who finds he has lost his brother later) and some others. Throughout the film, most of these people are interviewed in the studio to emphasize the personal, reflexive nature of events. Development is quite dramatic and well done, especially the fire department announcement ceremony, some useful swish pans, and sort of dialectical editing of pretty limited footage (like Rob Reiner's some good men). Tony sees pride. <br /> <br /> The angle of view and the angle of the camera are usually in the midst of firefighters, which is interesting and the WTC1 has great materials, while Pfeiffer and his team plan to do the following. this is a classic cinema. There is also an eery, haunting sound from a random human body that fell outside the portika. Then the unfortunate Fire Chief Pfeiffer realizes that his mission is desperate and apparently hopeless - and that is before the WTC2 collapses. You need to be given a credit to Kettet to find out what's in front of the movie and at what point. The sound of the collapse of the neighboring WTC2 is so terribly sad, terrible and frightening that you understand what the challenge is for firefighters. The lobby seems to feel and sound like the end of the world and poor firefighters look so surprised and frightened. You hear a huge rumble, a trembling maelstrom - like a giant monolith beast who slowly falls to the ground after he was so deadly wounded - a neighboring tower has collapsed, but the fire team left in WTC1 is not attentive to this event. Where is Communication? <br /> <br /> This movie is enchanting, but narration is amateurish and should have been avoided - signs like "it was really a day like no other" or a frequent banal statement by Kettett, "you are afraid of everyone's eyes" and "I knew Tony was amazing! "The movie is really just one long-term video diary. There are no pictures of some of the higher structures, some firefighters have gone. Imagine that this movie mixes from some of the higher-ranking rooms in the CCTV footage or the news of a few days. The impact would be bigger. That story could even be combined. Mayor Giuliani and perhaps the famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla, who literally was a hero. <br /> <br /> I don't see a lot of film in this propaganda element, as some reviewers suggest. This film is not a triumph of the Riefenstahl victory. time later firefighters fired in a building near the American flag overlooking what has become Ground Zero. What then? <br /> <br /> There are also some moments of suspicious camera work, for example who keeps the camera when two Brother Brothers has it been staged again? Is it staged? <br /> <br /> It's a great finish, a great French director Alain Resnais (Hiro shima mon amour) has two light bands that are reflected in the water.
