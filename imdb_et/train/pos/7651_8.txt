An interesting TV movie based on a real fact, and one of the leading characters in the prison. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate task of deciding whether he will go to court for his brother to die. But when he visits him and enters Elias Kotea, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Kotea's ability to act. He just looks like a prisoner of proletarian roots, according to "G.Q." a magazine whose language is too complex for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This understanding came to me after an old friend's meeting, which I had not seen for almost 15 years, which he spent in several Panama prisons. The young man I knew before has disappeared, not only because he is older, but thanks to his long-term punishment system. There are prisons and there are prisons, but one of the "Shot In the Heart" prison is definitely out of this world.
