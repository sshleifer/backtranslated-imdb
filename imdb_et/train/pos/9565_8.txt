Dog Bite Dog doesn't come to everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Perfect hitting, clinging and photographing (but don't worry about the terrible shooting of leadership), this can best be described as violent pressure through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin to kill the barrister. Despite being filthy about her journey, she is almost at the big table, probably in the middle of a restaurant. If it sounds amazingly incredible, you should probably avoid this movie. It worked to stop the belief for me and I had a lot more fun for it. <br /> <br /> Pang's search is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, nervous cop who likes to hit people almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai walks with a fine line with his inner investigation, and his father, a legendary good policeman, is a comma after a southern drug transaction (this suggests that Wai will let his father take the rape off his corrupt relationships)) <br /> <br /> Here are car accidents, a lot of killings and the strange and uncomfortable love story offered here, all played in the comic book. I suspect that humor was deliberate (no one uses huge concrete buggies without the eye of extreme absurdity), though being obsessed with some of my compatriots. There are at least three points where the film may have ended, and in 109 minutes it may be more useful than ruthless editing or deleting one narrative thread (the frivolous stuff worked well so I would have left the relationship with three fathers). <br /> <br /> However, I tend to give it a (high) pass, if only because of an end? I've rarely heard so many people who laugh so loudly, what should have been a terrible moment. It's one to see friends who love the ridiculous
