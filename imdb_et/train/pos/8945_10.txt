It is an honest attempt to make an amazingly sweet love story. The obvious inspiration behind the successful TV series "Bewitched", this lovely sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. comparisons are obvious. jimmy stewart plays an unhappy but firm "straight". kim novac plays a wonderful blonde witch hitting her with the charms of love. but when this spell is shattered by a stronger witch, she fulfills her own store operating obligations and takes the comfort of having her beloved aunt (familiar with her cats) taking care of her beloved aunt. you know aunt from Death to Death. this movie is fun and touching sweet with some remarkable sense and a nice funny feeling. worth a look.
