"Panic on the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a little disappointed. The central theme of a city attacked by today's urban plague is fascinating, but the film will never really explore or develop it. It's well done and fun, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. Its scenario is really weak and brings the whole movie down. None of the central characters are really convincing or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film is very well done to compensate for the weak scripting. The direction of Elia Kazan keeps the film tense and moves fast. There are some standout sequences, especially the memorable chase climax. When his direction was combined with better scenarios several years later, the man was mostly wrong. <br /> <br /> The actor is also very good. Richard Widmark was always an observable leading person and he does what he can in writing. Paul Douglas spends his time shouting a bit too much, but also does a decent job. The whales are the chosen two villains. Zero Mostel, especially known for his comic roles, is actually a candle-like cinema's ultimate comic. Jack Palance is surprising that he is a lousy villain. "Panic on the Streets" is disappointing but still worthwhile. (7/10)
