OKAY. I'm biased. I live in England near Shrewsbury, where this wonderful film was filmed. It still looks the same today. I remember them in movies here quite vividly and fake snow on the streets of the day. Often when I go through Shrewsbury, I see the street or the house and it reminds me of this movie. . His physical appearance is not a typical criminal. Scott is big and terrible. A man who thinks that those who are smaller than themselves are worse. We all know the story and quotes. The book is one of the most expensive works in English. And I don't think there are many cynics who would say people can't change and redeem. This movie version is all beautiful. George C. Scott can be an American, but he plays an excellent part of English. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you haven't seen this version, please urge it to do so. It is usually available for a very small amount of money ...
