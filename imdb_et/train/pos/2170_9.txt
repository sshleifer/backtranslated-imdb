I think the creator (s) of this film concept deserves much more recognition than they probably ever did. Of course, this is not an Oscar caliber film, but at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression as I saw it for the first time in 1984 (in theater). <br /> <br /> I don't think it's (and I hope it's not) a spoiler, but imagine how your impulses work. Making the first thought that appears on your head by saying the first words on your lips ... There is no restraint, no conscious, nothing that would tell you back or do what we know as intelligent adults that we shouldn't really say or do . If anything, this film scratches the surface - it won't go as far as it could go. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with trying out older "classics" to try and make cash today, wouldn't it be nice to see them see an older movie for modest success, bringing it to the next level? To go a little further, or even to look at what the original team did, wouldn't it or could not be dealt 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion. : o)
