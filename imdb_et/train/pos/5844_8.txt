In 1948, it was my favorite movie of all time. The costumes of Betty Grabt were so striking that I wanted to grow up and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was an irresistible Hungarian officer. Eye and fluffy, because this film may appear at the beginning when I was eight years old, it seemed to me to say something important about the relationship between men and women. I saw it again the other day; I was surprised that he still did.
