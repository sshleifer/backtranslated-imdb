This is one of those unfortunate films that suffered even more sad, unfortunate death. I saw this movie in a local cinema, in a reborn form, just after it was in mainstream cinemas. It certainly deserves a second time (or even a third). Sandra B. leads it to the limit by saying a spoken word and taking part in the songs known in this music (her version of Hank William, "I am so creative that I can easily move Cry"). Maybe one day, the audience is ready to take this film a little more seriously (but also without a good laugh). The movie is moving at a fast pace (thanks to some nice editing) so some viewers won't find it old and boring. Perhaps revival is just under the pipeline.
