I didn't see Barbara Stanwyck's "Baby Face" restored or any version until I got it on TCM. What a great movie! Lily, in short, lives in Lily's jargon, her father is pimped at age 14! Then he still blows up and killed Lily (Stanwycki) alone for her black servant Chico, whom Theresa Harris played very well. Lily leaves for a big city (New York) who decides to use her sex. She does it in a great style! <br /> <br /> He seduces the pudma secretary to go to the first floor and go through men like disposable candies! One dump lets your kill and kill your close father, Lily's sugar-father, suicide! Lily hardly flashes! STanwyck is great as a girl who really doesn't know what love is. bolts. Almost free Chico and half a million, he realizes that he loved the court! Lily competes to find her, but is she too late? <br /> <br /> This is Hollywood's best code. Stanwyck is huge and the film's appearance and music are perfect. It reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, the second flick of an ill-ignored immoral woman, those who didn't like the movies being very romantic, don't like Baby FAce, those who have faith in sex, love and love. love it with power. Highly recommended! Look at this!
