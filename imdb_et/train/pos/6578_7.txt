Ironically, a film that is not available on film or video for so long is ARMS AND MAN MAN in the post-debut years of 1894, in a rather small part, because it is both old and solid satire in heroism and war business. Every time the world drowns, ARMS AND MAN seem to grow more timely and relevant. <br /> <br /> This is a game that Oscar Strauss transformed (excluding most of Shaw's best ideas) into a successful operetta CHOCOLATE SOLDIER (when Hollywood got it *, * they left Shaw's last prisoners out of paying for his rights - was by the Oskar winner on his own). Although Shaw's best has always been his idea and dialogue, not the plots, then in ARMS and MAN, the plot sparks and the captain manages a happy ending for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter), the officer's daughter and the wealthiest man in her town, is engaged to a foolish officer of the Bulgarian cavalry and everything looks good until the Swiss mercenary (Pip Torrens) on the other hand climbs out of the outlet that fleeing from the battle where his army is being attacked. As is usually the case with Shaw's satire, there is nothing like it first appears, and the social conventions stand in the light of their simple, and not so simple, reason. There are no "good guys" or "bad guys". Just the people of different classes get the best of mind - just like life is better - and of course Shaw, all those involved are pampered. <br /> <br /> The earliest (1932) film version of Shaw's most traditional and most funny joke (Shaw's own scenario) and one of its first hit in this part of the Atlantic has long since disappeared. Shaw does not sell screen rights for his games - he licensed them for only five years, and it turned out that with the fast-developing sound technology that makes the 1932 film primitive just a few years later, Shaw did not renew the license to show it. As a result, we have a very high BBC debt to finally bring out our 1987 broadcast version of a DVD box with nine other sparkling games. (Sometimes, PYGMALION, that many see Shaw as the best, with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers with this set less well.) <br /> <br /> Even in a pair, like a DVD, with a less impressive one, HISTORY, ARMS AND MAN is a real treasure. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter, after cutting the teeth into such a television crew for a great film career, will lead many viewers to this early role. They should not be disappointed because Mrs Carter is delivering in line with the audience of the layered innocence expected of her, but James Cellan Jones is somewhat walking towards the pedestrians (and despite the BBC's equally beautiful and well-traceable physical output), the role is a scandalous fire (and its outrage in the last underestimated) is only about 80% of its potential. Much the same can be said about a piece of the actual star Pip Torrens, such as Bluntschli's "Switzer". It is a good, tempting force, but it does not go into the physical comedy that is indirect in the early scene, where a young soldier can barely keep awake from his mortal threat. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a solid production of a great game with a small screen transfer. It deserves widespread visibility and, ideally, should revive even more lively resonance of the big screen, the style and enjoyment of which has recently been a revival of Wilde's IDEAL HUSBAND. Almost * any * ARMS AND MAN need to be pampered and maybe we can finally see the original 1932 version. â€œUp to one or another surface, this product is pleasing to anyone who loves good Shaw.
