I remember this movie years ago. Surely my experience is the best topic. The fact that I remember alive so much of the movie after so long shows its effect. <br /> <br /> The level of performance is difficult to comment on because of the language barrier. However, they were very powerful. <br /> <br /> This theme will continue to be fascinating for us over the years. And it was most efficiently processed here, given the historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I want it to be shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Does an art film archive contain a copy of it?
