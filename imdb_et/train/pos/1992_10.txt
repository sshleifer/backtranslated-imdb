I'm really old, I'm in the midst of watching this 40-year-old flick, and don't know what my grandchildren are looking at for 40 years, its old saying, but they don't do it anymore ... not just the story, its music, both young and old The old actors, but it seems to have been born to play their roles, the young oliver, the old Fagin. The role of the judge's oliver is before, I've seen other roles over the years. Sensitive soldier ,, Ron moody like Fagin ,, Mr. and Mrs. Bumblebee, not only won 5 Oscars, but also won some golden world prize. If you decide to see this movie, either yourself or not all the kids to see this masterpiece
