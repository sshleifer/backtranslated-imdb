This cute animated short plays two comics - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is a bald, slightly portrayed boy from comics who never talks. <br /> <br /> Well he's talking here! <br /> <br /> She wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet shop and if she leaves a store, she will have some fun hijinks. <br /> <br /> Betty is singing a song about pets Henry can fight battles and monkeys, but everything will end up.
