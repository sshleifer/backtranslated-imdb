This comic is short on the plot, but it is a visually stunning job. There are very small spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short is a "story" that is incredibly light-ground areas that are responsible for returning every spring, but must fight in the winter, which is not yet ready to retreat. Both girls and storm have their own songs. It's a lot of plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not about a plot â€” it's about color and animation. Visuals are exceptional. In 1936, such a bright color was still novel and here are some incredibly inspired works. <br /> <br /> My short short moments surround the flow of liquid colors through pipes. In more than one point, there are a number of tubes aligned sequentially, the shortest and the highest, and the colors move through the tubes and the music track seems to be a line of pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The battle between the evolving greenery and the winter storm, which refuses to quietly leave, is extremely well done. These shorts were the things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are celebrating, but they probably also contributed to their final departure from the MGM, as it was likely to be over budget and MGM finally decided that the animation department would be able to control costs better. they were managed by someone who was a little more aware of the cost than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> It's a really nice cartoon and it's worth noting. It is available in a 30's DVD attack. Recommended, especially if you like good animation.
