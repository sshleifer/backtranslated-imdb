When Braveheart first came out, I was amazed and was really one of the most striking fans in the movie. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued and although I enjoyed the movie, it didn't mean that it was a great movie. But when the time is up, my assessment for Rob Roy has grown and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has decreased. Braveheart is a solid entertainment, but there are also some mistakes. In my opinion, the most important is the uneven portrayal of Robert Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. The second is the historical inaccuracy of the film, filming the film proportionally with many historical distortions. I think I am also disturbed by the fact that it was in this film, which was seen only (at least by myself) retroactively, so that the beginning of Mel Gibson's egomans can be clearly seen for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy has grown over the years. This is partly because it largely avoids the mistakes that Braveheart has made me most. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine that grows more mature and complex with every view.
