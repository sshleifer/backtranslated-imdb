If you can't enjoy the chick flick, stop right now. However, if you enjoy movies that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary action, read on. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord Dies. Her two daughters reached her bed. Ann talks about her past people who don't know her daughters, and they wonder if these lost acquaintances are real or imaginative. They realize that these people from their mother's past are indeed real. <br /> <br /> The story shifts mainly from 1953 to 2000, and a few glances at Anne's life between these years. It was in 1953 when Ann met her life with love and experienced the greatest tragedy of her life. <br /> <br /> Anni's two best friends from college, Lila, are married. Ann's second best friend is Lila's brother Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of the rich Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer living in the village of Greenwich, who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of the 1950's conventions. <br /> <br /> Shortly after Ann arrives at Lila's wedding as an honorary servant, she will meet a person who will become three in Harris's life. She is an adult son of a former family servant who grew up with Lila and Buddy and has been a doctor in a small New England city. Ann will soon be pleased with Harris, which adds to the complication that Lila is always in love with Harris and continues to be. A friend is also in love with Harris, but in 1953 he has redirected this homosexual desire to Harris for his good friend Ann because he cannot admit that he has a sexual desire for another person. Buddy exhibits his inner disappointment outward, being a family alcoholic, wise and bad bad boy - much of his very true and dense fears of parents. emotions lead to a tragedy - after that it is a chick flick. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Ann's daughters have become distant from their mother and suffer from the realization and doubt of their lives. Constance works for emotional exhaustion, trying to keep her mother and wife in her roll. Nina, who has always felt worse, cannot maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Mix all these relationships for fifty years and get an intriguing look at society, its values ​​and its effects on individuals and the activities of complex people. <br /> <br /> All evening activities are great, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - with two unique family relationships - that make this movie so great, very special <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays 1950 Anni in the 1950s and does it in a style that clearly shows the wise woman of those times, who is in conflict with what she should do, not what she wants to do. His performance is not easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays Dead Anni, whose mind shifts from current, past, fantasy flights, and of course, Redgrave pulls it out sterile. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's true daughter - plays Ann's daughter Constance. The styles of this real-life mother and daughter playing fancy mother and daughter are attentive to watch. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays Anne's second daughter Nina. Nina spends a lot of time in her depression and feeling when she closes a good man who loves her both mother and sister. Collette is perfect for such a part as this, but I've never seen it give a bad or incredible result no matter what part she plays. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer plays Lila 1950 and shows us even more controversial women about her expected role in life than her good friend Ann. He's very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's Mother - is playing Lila today. About Meryl Streep, she is always remarkable and rewarding. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai claims on DVD that he was looking for Glenn Close to play a relatively small part of Lila's mother because he felt he was the only actor he could think of playing a single scene in a movie. Certainly he was right, and Close's performance is that one scene eats it in your mind. All other scenes, where Close is the very true mother of Lila, and you get another treasure value. <br /> <br /> There are three more scenes in the movie with the Close described above, which makes the whole movie worth watching. On the Lila's wedding day, Ann enters her room and climbs into bed with her friend to discuss Lila's misconceptions about her upcoming wedding for a person she doesn't really love. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila comes and climbs to bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived. In the last scene, Streep and Redgrave are amazing. <br /> <br /> Another memorable scene - at least for me - is when Buddy declares his love for Anni. Hugh Dancy, as a friend, gives us a heartbreaking report by a young man who has broken his controversial sexual feelings. His performance is supreme. <br /> <br /> Chick flick? Yes, yes. A very special movie with incredible performance, leadership and landscape? Certainly. I can't recommend the evening too much.
