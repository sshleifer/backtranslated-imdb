He had a nice little movie over his dead body. It was decent and fun, yet quite funny. There were some clich√©s, but I found the most recent stuff. First, I didn't think it would be good if it started. When you get past 20 minutes, the film will become even more interesting. This movie was not fun laughing and it wasn't OH MY GOSH wonderful. It was just a movie that you can sit back and enjoy, how enjoyable it was. The movie was bad. This rating is just a bit too low. I could have dealt with 5.5 but 4.8? Also, giving this movie 1 is a disgrace. It was pretty good and there was nothing terrible to give it 1, which is what most people gave it.
