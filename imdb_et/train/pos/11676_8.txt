If you love the Long Way Round, you will enjoy it almost as much. It's educational, funny, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two great operators and too much Russ. Ewan does some appearance, but Charley pulls it alone. He's funny, tempting and still stress and suspicion. Great things! <br /> <br /> The series breaks seven episodes. Like LWR, preparation is almost as interesting as the competition. Although they cover races and competitions well, there is little more to explain about trucks and cars that are just mentioned and rarely even seen. However, this is a motorcycle movie and everyone loves it on two wheels. <br /> <br /> The series also features stunning photography and some interviews with people from the mouth. Yikes. There is another very memorable theme, such as LWR, but it is not nearly as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the US, God knows when it will be released to buy it at Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Oh, and be prepared to buy another motorcycle.
