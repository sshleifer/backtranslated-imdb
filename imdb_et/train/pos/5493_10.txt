It is really rare that you get the interior design of the media fraud that is so widely described as the official "truth" and caught so many "news agencies" in your pants down. In my opinion, this film deserves to be priced at all costs - it is objective (yes!), Bold and real scoop. It can do without comment, fake scenes or leading issues - everyone, including Chavez, gets their own fools. The filmmakers had to watch the events and keep their cameras constantly. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches us "How to take off the president and sell it to victory in democracy". It is amazing that they eventually lost - so far. I know that the biggest TV channel involved was revoked by their terrestrial license, they still transmit via cable and satellite. I doubt very much whether George W. or Barack Obama would be the one after the coup attempt. But then they don't have to worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that "Chavez supporters are shooting the innocent civilian" scam repeatedly rejoiced around the world to show how "free" (the established media has indeed changed or has always been more. who are interested in what is really happening in the world. "us" - this has been true of the spread of the atomic bomb, the "democracy" of the secret world of the US or the war of Iraq which, according to Johns Hopkins, has now killed 1.3 million Iraqi, not mention 60 000 Afghan (2003), which has never been mentioned Objectively, Saddam Hussein was less harmful to its people than the US, and the US is ready and willing to be worse for the Iranians that it was. <br /> <br /> I am quite curious on the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders at The Hague International Tribunal, whether there is "our" involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot guerrillas in the 80s when Vietnam won them greatly. t no. <br /> <br /> Even more reason to seek balance for independent media, if not for fraud.
