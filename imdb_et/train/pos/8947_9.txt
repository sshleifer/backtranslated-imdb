Kim Novak is a witch for the mortal lover and James Stewart is his choice. Shining comedy on Broadway; captures James Wong Howe in witch colors and performed a pound sterling. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful because it is an eternally corrupted writer Redlitch. I love this movie, though few others seem. Kim alone wins it in his book. Ha! My # 5 Movie 1958.
