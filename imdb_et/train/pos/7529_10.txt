Two years passed and mostly everyone looks different, some good and some worse. I still had as much as I originally did. Hamill, which is plus I think. They made Poison Ivy's more white hints that he would become more and more plants, and Catwomen looks a lot different and not "attractive" as he was in the original. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow look bad, especially scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is not as dark as the original, because Batman does not work as before. Mostly, Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake work. Although NightWing (Dick Grayson) often comes to rescue. Batman gave up the yellow line and waved the ball over his head and seemed to have a bit of a kick, but still hit a ton of ass. some updated characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the edge" can be one of the biggest Batman episodes, so make sure it's reviewed. <br /> <br /> Overall, 8-9 / 10
