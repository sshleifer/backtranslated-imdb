"Luzhin Defense" is at the forefront of the story of an idiosyncratic male-savant (Turturro) who consumes the game and backfires in the background, through his boyfriend and the forces that have created the man he has become. A good and evil factor for his love (Watson) and former "mentor" (Wilson), and you have a bright and gently humorous moment of sticky drama mixed with the rich scenic beauty of Lake Como and the intensity of chess playing. The perfect film from time to drama, the author's euphemistic chess-metaphor for orgasmic joy is a reference to the subtle thoughts behind the film.
