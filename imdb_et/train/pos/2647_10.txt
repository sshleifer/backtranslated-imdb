This film can be interpreted at various levels. Do not listen to other comments that play the movie and say it is a re-played story or w / e and that it's just about drugs. It has a very superficial superficial metaphor for drugs; the rest of the movie (and why I think it was personally made) is not really at all. It is really a mocking psychology and conditioning of society. It shows for the second second that the main character's brother watches these sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it shows that all the horror we encounter is making our jobs more mechanic rather than seeing people. As for the logic scene, it also reaches people who were federally empowered in 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematical, and logical as it seems at a macroscopic level. You need to apply Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty (along with all other laws and principles of uncertainty) not only in physics but also in life, and to leave room for changing your plans and adjusting your journey. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It can just go overhead; it is not for you, it is for those people who have trouble coping with life that doesn't work like a math problem. If you critically analyze the movie or write your critical review, don't read the back cover first (written by distributors and parapsychologists)
