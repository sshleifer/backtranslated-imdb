For 13 days, Gloryle speaks with a traditional story of Mexican compassion. The main problem with this film was that while the cowboy actor James Arness played a convincing role in Jim Bowie, the rest of the names were too old for Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston). <Br /> <br /> Raul Julia played with General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna for grace and dignity in front of a professional soldier who finally fought. The scene where the scriptwriters did not understand is the scene in which he suffers from being victimized by the officers and preventing the sorting. Failure to observe the driver is a major disregard for the military. Santa Anna was in her privilege to be angry. Raul Julia was excellently affected by intermediate writing. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York was reminded that if Dickinsons greeted Pennsylvania, they would probably not be very Southron.
