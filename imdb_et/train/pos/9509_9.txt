Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. The film features Michael Sullivan, perfectly played by Tom Hanks, a kind of hit-man / killer John Rooney (Paul Newman). He doesn't want to do this job, but does it because Rooney paid for his house and helped him financially. He had nothing and Mr Rooney gave him everything. But his children do not know that it is his job, and if one of his witnesses is his cold bloody murder, he is placed in an awkward situation. And when cruelty arises, he leaves with his son and bends revenge. They rob much more and build ties. They are the perfect team. Hanks does a good job as always and also with Jude Law, who plays his horrible role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and shows how the 1930s were.
