It was a completely enchanting series and I was sorry that I got a few pictures back when he went to the UK late at night. Its style was different from that of a different form, and the whole thing was the air of a stylish fear. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (no negative what I see) to understand what a truly innovative series was and how it tried to imagine. Now, I understand that I read the comments he got REJECTED, it's just that incredible. What a number of "stop over-paid turkeys" must be (or maybe just) to do.
