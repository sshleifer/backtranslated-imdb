Well, the main reason I watched this movie was that it was made by the fame of Trey Parker and Matt Stone South Park. But as soon as the movie started, I laughed at my belly. From a fine gesture to the joke, a blatant toilet in humor with constant support for some very funny enthusiasts. This movie can spoil an event where it has the toughest poker face, not to mention its poker underwear. Some of the funniest blinking and longing for what is ever portrayed in Hollywood, along with the constant criticism that is being thrown into the deal. <br /> <br /> I just show that not only is Trey Parker adept at writing she's not too shabby as an old actor. I was surprised by the amount I had absorbed in this film. But I am quite concerned that it is not possible to buy it online here in the UK. Sort this guys! <br /> <br /> I will show it to all my friends who are annoying with funny bits and from time to time with my band. All in all, it is a great movie if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. But if you don't have stupid things with a sense of humor, head well! But I am sure that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could have ignored these prejudices.
