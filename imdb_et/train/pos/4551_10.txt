I've never seen such an incredible work on the film as I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lew playing Christy Brown on his left leg. In fact, his role was not even over. He played Christy Brown, or at least with his disability, like filming a movie and the necessary surgery his boss was doing for his back injury. To me, this is remarkable and through all the pain he was doing with this role, I believe it is quite true to say that he made history the most Oscar worth. He was so masterful in this harsh part that I didn't think anyone could have done it better or more than influence him. Although I cannot say that this is the biggest film ever, I can say that how he played this impossible role and then acted until it no longer worked is undoubtedly the biggest leg I saw as an actor. Probably this man too.
