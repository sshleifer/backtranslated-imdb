Harem Suare is the best film I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Harem Suare is a sensationally captured and amazingly depicted film dealing with racial romance, a Hollywood taboo. Movies are full of women of all shapes, sizes and colors. Cut off the world, women attract each other, telling stories of intrigue, rival and jealousy in their ranks.
