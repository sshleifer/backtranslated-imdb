There were times when this film seemed much more complicated than it should have been, but I think it's part of that charm. Detective Philo Vance's observation powers seem to be greater than all the eastern parts of this era where the final assessment of the murder has ended. The fall of the streak on the Chinese vase was a kicker for me; I wonder if anyone could just drop it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) was the 'psychological impossibility' of Archer Coe's early movie to kill himself - I had to think about it for a while. I was left wondering whether this concept was really a scientific basis for the concept, not the psychology itself. It seems logical, but then there is always a case that does not comply with the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I got hit by an irritated coroner (Etienne Girardot) who reminded me of Star Trek's dr. McCoy has said a few times that "I'm a doctor, not a wizard" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective". I can imagine DeForest watching Kelley's movie and saying to myself, "I have to use it sometime." <br /> <br /> When the killer's identity has appeared, it doesn't seem like a big surprise, but until it's really someone's guess. But besides Archer and Brisbane Coe, the film didn't answer the central question about the title and the murder that I really was interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's dog Ghillie?
