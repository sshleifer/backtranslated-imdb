If you have trouble stopping unreliability, then this is not for you. Think: A woman who is already in the middle of her life will find a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and lift it up. Think about it; she is not trying to find a mother who may be a confused teenager who needs medical treatment, and apparently no one in Italy's social equivalent of social services is trying to care for the child (no social services? I know this is fantasy. Before you know that young Toto is ten and his adoptive father dies, leaving him in the orphanage, where he shows a happy man who loves everyone, nothing he has given not only his suitcase to the person who stole him, but has organized the local homeless to be a good Shantytown resident and he is leading them in the fight against capitalism who buys the land where Shantytown stands to discover the oil there. It wants some swallowing without the start of the next "miracles", starting with Toto's dead mother (the old lady who raised her, not her biological), which appeared to her and gave her a dove that doubles the magic wand that allows it to give a modest desire and finale where hobbies fly to the right place, which is probably somewhere Over the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie is related to Charm and it's easy to pass. Balanced little masterpiece.
