While some may call it "Cuban Cinema Paradiso," this film is closer to How Green. The film wisely avoids the political trap (pro-Castro? Anti-Castro?), Which focuses on the human weakness of the characters and the importance of the family, into a political trap. Filled with a good example, especially Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who plays a masterpiece by Keitel's wife, full of references to classic films, from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role, a critical story of dramatic profitability. to act (remember ROOKIES?), a homeless hell, who acts as a Greek choir, is very good, it is a pity that this film, originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA, has appeared with THINKfilm CUBAN BLOOD with a terrifying title that has nothing to do with the film.
