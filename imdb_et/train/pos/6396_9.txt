You think it's hard? You should review this movie. Carl Brashear is a manifestation of courage and judgment. What this man had to become a naval diver should be an inspiration to all of us. And after seeing this movie, I learned that what's shown isn't even half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. Makes her best work for Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is good than the southern red who trains him. George Tillman is only in his second important feature (after "Soul Food") as a filmmaker leap. If you want to be moved and inspired, you should definitely review it.
