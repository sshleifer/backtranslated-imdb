It's funny how your life can change in the second time ... For the first time in Waterdance, it was an unforgettable experience how you have to get used to a new lifestyle that may seem scary and notice that there are other people in a similar situation who will help you to proceed. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly Helen Hunt (oh man! Helen is the cleanest and graceful woman on earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises with your last serious roles. A simple and at the same time a deep film that will not leave us indifferent to the message we are sending: enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Really, the movie's hour is not there! (Sorry, this is the Brazilian expression ...).
