Initially, I doubted about this film (only because of this topic), but the richly drawn characters, the fabulous scene of the hunting of buffaloes and the dramatic conclusion make it worthy of attention. First of all, it was difficult for me to distinguish between two buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed, they became more and more different. The final scene still worships me.
