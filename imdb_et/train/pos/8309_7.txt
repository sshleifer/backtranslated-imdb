It's always a great surprise when a movie made for a TV is entertaining, like Little Richard. This is a very observable film about Rock and Roller, Little Rich's exhibition, played by Leon, who I have never seen before, but does a great job. Because most TV movies are little tamer than cinema, which is a disgrace because I'm sure there is a lot we could have seen from Little Richard, which was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious garbage, which is the only thing that breaks the film and ultimately violates a very promising career. All in all, this movie is good and the actor is over the television movie medium. 7 out of 10
