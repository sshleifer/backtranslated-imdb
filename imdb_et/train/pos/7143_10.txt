"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far I have seen this movie three times in theaters and I look forward to it on DVD next September. I read the book after seeing the movie and I was surprised how much the book and the film were. The director of this film did an excellent job of re-creating the book in film. Also, all the role-players perfectly selected their characters, especially Max Kasch as ZigZagi. For everyone involved in making this movie, it's a real success! From 10 out of 10 stars, I would recommend it to everyone!
