Leave a McCoy (Richard Widmark) shell Candy (Jean Peters) purse containing an important microchip designed for a communist cause. This is followed by 2 federal representatives waiting a little while giving a microchip to their contact. But Skip steals the wallet in the subway under everyone's nose and starts by both the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want the microchip back. Skip can only be tracked through Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information about criminals. Skip it is clear that what he has stolen is important and both sides want a movie, but he plans to keep a high price. This leads Joey after him and the conflict between Joey and Jean, who is in love with Skipi. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a well-functioning movie and has a good start. It's a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters falls in love with Widmark right now, but this point is necessary, otherwise he would stick with Joey later. This is a good movie.
