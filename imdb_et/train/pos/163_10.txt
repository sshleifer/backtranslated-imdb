First-time director Tom Kiesche turns the winning film into a dark comedy spirit. Hitting a shoesting budget but had a taste of the early Coen Brother movie Blood Easy ... and throw some Monty Python flavorings on the boot! Must see more than once to understand all the elements that carry one scene to another. Wait more for good things from this writer-director actor.
