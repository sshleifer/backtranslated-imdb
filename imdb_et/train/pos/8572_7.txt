The first film was nice, but it's not as good as the wonderful animated classic I found more embarrassing and loving. This sequel is worse, but not bad at all. Of course the hit is too much, the script has weak spots and the plot is unetspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is scented like a scar. The movie is nice to watch with stylish cinematography and outstanding costume (especially on Cruella) and the music is pleasant. Action is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is tempting and Gerard Depardieu, when he has given better performances, is fun as a companion to Cruella. The best value, as it was in the first movie, is the amazing Glenn Close, which is delicious overall, like Cruella, even worse than before. In general, it's nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
