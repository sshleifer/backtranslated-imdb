A true story about junkies that rob honest businessmen, drugs, jewelery, weapons and money. Some say it is an American tragic story of an excessive eighties, where the high sixties of peace and free love had fallen on drugs and AIDS. Frankly speaking, it's just ordinary people who have no purpose in life and who sit high and decide to rob a ruthless person. What is the second part of their overall plan? If they are their stuff ... they sit around and get high again. Great plan. Even if you don't know the story, there is no tension or surprise in this movie. The fact that Cox is trying to make these characters by scenes and looting the party of certain folk heroes is weak and offensive. The story was better when the approach was better. As it is, it's just a sad story of the small drug dealers who kill the drug dealers of the time. The bigger story, more than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story. This movie should have been her, her life. She was in the wonderland with whom she began to lose her miracle. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes life. It's not entirely factual, but it's much more enjoyable.
