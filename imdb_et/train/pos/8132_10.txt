I don't remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rented it about six years ago and it's still one of my favorite comedies. I admit that you probably despise this movie if you don't know anything about rap music. But if you're a rap fan, even casual, you'll love internal jokes and references. One of the best lines in the film is the difference between a b **** and h **; I use this line today and get a lot of laugh. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played Nerli's revenge joke with Lamar. It is unfortunate that this movie will probably never get a DVD.
