Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie are really one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the majority and the team are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura repeats a couple of pictures in the fight that come in the second half of the movie, but it's about where the similarities end. Versus takes place mainly outside, showing Kitamura's ability to treat an interesting B-film in natural places. Alive for almost everything inside. In small, narrow spaces. Here is the art of design for your face, and WHAT is a work of art for it! We are treated with many very complex and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly confined to their spaces. Another important difference is that we still don't get much to the end of the movie. Versus was all about action and cool; here, LOT puts more emphasis on characters and the situation and confuses the mind. That's why Alive is a much more interesting film than Versus. You may not open it and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of chilled zombie bloodshed, but you are sitting on the screen for about two hours looking at how it interacts with some really interesting characters. <br /> <br /> I'm now ecstatic to order a DVD despite some naysay. You should! Be sure to understand that this is an animal different from Versus - it is often slow and requires a bit of thinking to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters will pick it up with subtitles to release R1 DVD!
