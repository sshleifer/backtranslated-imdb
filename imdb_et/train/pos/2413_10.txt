Love the TV show. The first time I saw it was a hook. I wish I was with them. It concerns the reality when you love someone and you think you want to spend the rest of your life together, in an exchange of events that you meet with someone and that person is more of the one you want to be with. You are in a situation where you have to choose one or the other. No one starts to hurt, it won't stop. Making a decision is difficult, but do you want to be unhappy if it could have been. Why go and live a life that you thought you wanted or thought to do the right thing and you both are unhappy. This other person does not expect life expectancy, they have life well. Making the decision you really want is finally better. The best thing you have is a good thing. Money, cars, houses, etc. Don't make you happy, being the one person you really want to share with.
