A strange pleasure that combines an appropriately distant plot of land that includes Adam and Burt and a return to the original TV series. Most setbacks of scenes were lifted directly from Burt Ward's book "The Miracles of Boys: My Life in Tights" and I imagine that his book was an inspiration for making this film. Like a book, he left fans of original certificates nervous. <br /> <br /> If you missed it, you should definitely try to borrow a friend who may have recorded it. I'm making a copy for my kids right now.
