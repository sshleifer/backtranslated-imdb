For the first time I met this example when I was in Japan last year for six months. I found it online when I searched for subtitled dramas to help me with Japan. My mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was strange, but I found it admirable! Koyuki showed such contradictory character traits and Matsujun's spirit changed my day every time I tuned! I saw her for the first time at "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked it much better! <br /> <br /> Although characters are interesting and well-developed, I was disappointed that they didn't change very much throughout the show. Their relationship grew, but they were not. However, it was a fun time for everyone (even Fukushima!).
