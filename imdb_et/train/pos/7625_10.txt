Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis at the show, there are so many things wrong in this movie. First of all, the creators claimed that Elvis opened his famous live show in '69 after the nineteenth film study, carrying the 1972 white jump game. They also said they sang "burning love", which he sang for the first time in 1972 and "your miracle", which he first recorded in 1970. They also claim that he got his first Christmas guitar when all Elvis fans know he got his birthday. I know that all movies based on the past are something wrong, but these things are so obvious to Elvis's pleasant people.
