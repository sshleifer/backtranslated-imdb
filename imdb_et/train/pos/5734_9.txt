I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's work as he offers absolutely unique films to the audience with typical "Lynch elements". Having seen most of his work, I thought naively that I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead wrong. Dumbland is something I could never imagine under David Lynch. But after recovering from the first shock, I began to think about this extremely primitive main character and concluded that all the absurdities, cruelty, cruelty and disgust presented here reflect reality bits, emphasizing it by distortion. There are things in our lives that we hardly ever emphasize because they are either disgusting or terrible, but they surround us so I dare say Dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces. It's not a movie to enjoy, though sometimes laughing at a strange, perverse sense of humor, an animation that reflects all the things we look at, its simplicity, illness, and absurdity. Take it as it is, you don't have to like it. It's just there. And finally, if you are attentive enough, you will also find elements typical of Lynch. I recommend it to people who tolerate it !!!
