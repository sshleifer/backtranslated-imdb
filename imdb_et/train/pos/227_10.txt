Robert Duvall is the direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to IMDb.com. After seeing this movie, you might think that Duvall looks the best. One of my favorite films. I wish the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or had a soundtrack. Wonderful scenery and music, and "the real life of all life", especially for those who live in the south or have moved. This is the "real time". Life moves slowly, but "strangers are not left."
