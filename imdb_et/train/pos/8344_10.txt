This is one of my all-time favorites. It's so simple and cute - definitely a chick flick for a romantic comedy. I like a movie with a very good quote and that's it ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters, "Do you mean what I mean" and Ed says, "What are its odds!" the movie is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get as much pleasure out of it and it can be !! I also liked the way Walter M. Einstein portrayed. I think all the characters fit well and the story flows nicely. It is so many times that I find myself smiling with the film and quoting my favorite lines when I watch it! I recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and now enjoy such a romantic comedy!
