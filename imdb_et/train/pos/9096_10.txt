Cute! In October, I saw Philly's domestic imports with my children. We all liked so much that we saw it for the second time with our parents. I have not heard these years laugh! It was the first time I remember a movie my parents and my kids could enjoy. It's really cute and we can't wait to get it out of the DVD. They need to make more movies like domestic imports. It is refreshing to go to a movie that three generations can enjoy (and not be embarrassed). I haven't seen this cute movie after my big fat wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. He was also at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this and he is fun. I remember him from WKRP.
