This is the movie I saw when it first came out and what I've seen a few times over the years. It's always nice. <br /> <br /> One thing is that comedy does not take sides: it hides the workforce and capitalists equally. Only Sid seems to be outside the classical struggle, although he is responsible for it. Spoiler warning: don't read on if you haven't seen the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, although it is quite plausible. Ask yourself: does anyone support most of their weight in one fabric? It would cut almost any kind of support. <br /> <br /> Sid also uses angle, using rubbish, such as a knight's shield. Lovely insignia. <br /> <br /> One day I get it on a DVD.
