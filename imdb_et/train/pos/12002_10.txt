Despite reading "initial comments" from someone who did not curiously dislike the film - (WHY ONLY THE NEGATIVE COMMUNICATION IS ON THE FIRST LIST?) It was very nice to note that almost everyone else loved it! Apparently, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and to portray the Prophet Joseph Smith positively - that is the whole idea. In fact, these points were very effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was human ... but despite this, all the scary negative attempts the opponent looked at showed how he was able to accomplish a remarkable work given by God. I recommend it to anyone!
