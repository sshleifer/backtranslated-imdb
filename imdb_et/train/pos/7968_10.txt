I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 6 or 7 years old and didn't think it was particularly special. The time of AS went through and I looked at it a few more times and started growing up as I began to understand the morale of the film that I will come later. For a while I left this movie alone and didn't watch it for a while. When I looked at an old classic film a few weeks ago (now 15), I dug up my domestic VHS. After watching it, I stayed at the natural height that I couldn't really explain. The film is a great joy that you never expect. With three completely different animals that work together to find your home, the movies really send a message home, no matter how much you are, you can always find a common ground, something you all need. The way the personality of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. It has an old-conscious, intelligent golden retriever who takes care of or directs "casual" fun when it is a cumbersome young American bulldog with a smart, sensitive but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible that it causes magic to start believing that this trip can happen. <br /> <br /> I don't want to call like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to movies that assure you I'm the opposite, but the most resilient part of this movie is undoubtedly the shadows when the shadow tries to desperately and accidentally and dirty, painfully told to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners, there is silence until the shadow crosses everything. There is a good line between heartburning and brilliant rubbish, but this film is pure magic at the age of 15. This movie may not be Lord of the Rings, but Disney to produce such a fantastic movie with the help of animals, and it could raise itself the way it is even at that age, it is worth 10/10.
