Othello, a classic Shakespeare story about love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember this story while studying in high school, I actually found that Othello is probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of the fascinating fact that Shakespeare struck the feeling of friendship, love and racism perfectly. I mean, if you really study this story, you could go into so many philosophies why Othello went crazy with jealousy. But later, in my report, I looked at this Othello version and I have to say that it was brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just hit the story so well and realized it was darkness. <br /> <br /> Othello is a big soldier in his city, loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king discovers that Othello sniffed with his daughter Desdemon, the king is furious, but he expresses it. Othello is welcome in the city and will do his best friend, Cassio, as an aside of Iago, who has stood by Othello. Because of his mad jealousy, he is revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he just hinted to Othello that Desdemona was cheating on him with Cassio, never saying they were, just makes Othello think it's going to happen. Othello is going crazy and has no pleasant plans for Desdemonale or Cassio and Iago are more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story, I suggest you read it. This is an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you read it. Othello's film is also great and again I recommend it, it hit the story perfectly and has a great tearjerker-type feeling, or you can just be totally shocked by what's happening between Othello and Desdemona, how fast he believes his true love gave him. It's an amazing movie, a great actor, good settings and a good direction that Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
