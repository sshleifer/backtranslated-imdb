What's really sad shows like six degrees and brothers & sisters is a real reality TV, not the garbage that is nothing but glorious games. I think that the burning of discontent has been the premature cancellation of many cultural figures in recent years. But with more vocal repercussions, Jericho fans (which I also enjoy) and other exhibitions may change the trend of networks. I am like others, I do not support any new exhibitions until they have been given another season. Then I decide to watch and catch up with DVDs and online viewing. So far you have lost me to ABC as a new exhibitor.
