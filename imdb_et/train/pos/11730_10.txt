What can Elvira say about what has not been said in the world press? The classic comedy that IS Elvira offers in its first full-length masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Since the first film framework, Elvira offers a working punch that clearly says Film Great .... heart out, Bette Davis! See Elvira, see Elvira inspiring, see Elvira jealous, see Elvira murderer. You can't do anything if you admire his ability to act! <br /> <br /> At the heart of this comedy is the masterpiece Elvira's desire to see Las Vegas. Despite the fact that "boob back to the damn" put the horror host (the most), Elvira finds a small screen that is emotionally restrictive ... and PHYSICAL! Nuff said he packed his kitbit and led the east .... hotdog on the one hand and a letter from his aunt's lawyer describing his legacy in an "unexpected" second. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times, I can almost literally say .... (literally just outside)! <br /> <br /> Grab a copy, laugh yourself stupidly, learn lines .... <br /> <br /> Why didn't he win the best actress Oscar for the role that is next to me.
