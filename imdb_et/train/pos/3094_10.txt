This is the best and most original exhibition over the years. The more I look at it, the more I love it. The cast is great, writing is great. I personally like every character. However, it is a favorite sign for everyone because personalities and backgrounds are similar to real life. I believe ABC has made a decoration for actors, actors, and potential audiences to cancel as quickly and not enough advertising and give it a real opportunity to get the following. There are so few examples that I can watch anymore because most TVs are terrible. This exhibition, in my opinion, was my favorite Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this example if they even knew it. Why is it always that the loser shows that there is so much extra time, and the high-winning exhibitions will always get off. I'm so sick of the reality that I don't look at them. It was so refreshing to show a new idea and then hire great actors, this show was so much a promise. The last episode was still the best because everyone is really getting into their parts and showing it really. View this exhibition on ABC video and let ABC know that you want to show this example back. PLEASE RECOMMEND THE COMPETITION ABC ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
