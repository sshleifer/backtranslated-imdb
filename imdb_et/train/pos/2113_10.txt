The location of the store in the corner is precisely marked at the beginning of the film, on the Balta street in Budapest, but it can really be anywhere. The small number of kits reflects the average European design, but it can be a shop in every corner. The film does not touch Budapest or the retail store of leather goods, but the ups and downs of love, which are reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are workers' sparring partners, but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story relaxes to bring these two aspects together nicely. The shop owner Hugo Matuschek has problems with his wife, he is just the voice to the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadasel is a secret matter. Ilona Novodnyl is a gentleman who buys her fur clothes. Mr Pirovitch's life focuses on his wife and children. Pepi Katona plays Santa for Santa at Christmas. You even feel that Silent Flora Katchuck, being home to her mother, dreams of people. <br /> <br /> The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves from scene to scene. It's one of those quiet movies that look back and forth, simple but deep. The dialogue reflects the talk of character that is not common today. <br /> <br /> All actors are great. Even small characters like a waiter in a cafe and a policeman on the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play great each other. He really took his step as an actor and then gave a sweet and sharp result. Margaret Sullavan was a terrible actor and underestimated these days. Some of his other films are worth the effort. Like Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. The moment of his truth is very touching. Gold stars performers all around. <br /> <br /> This is a well-worn phrase that they don't do as they get used to (vague repetition "You've got a letter" was terrible), but in that case it's true. Director Lubitsch has not succeeded in the farce mode, but gave the classic spirit, charm and warm mankind.
