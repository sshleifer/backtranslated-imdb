What can be said about the film, one of the most dull, the most nasty and sometimes the most strange - I don't say "sympathetic" .. I say "charismatic" crooks in the history of cinema and the best sword fight from Flynn and Fairbanks were their prosperity? It is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly brave and honest man who fights for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I love it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were big villains. Jessica Lange was very touching, gentle and sensual.
