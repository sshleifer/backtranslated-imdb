The document presents the original theory of "weapons, germs and steel". The series graphically depicts episodes that strongly support several theories and protects theory against common criticism. <br /> <br /> I was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about the lack of new series. They say the documentary provides information that is taught in high school. Indeed, it is. In fact, I greatly enjoyed the original picture of the information I've felt since high school and unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So if you like to know why NOT things work when you try to try the phone to see how it worked when you went to the farm to see how the farm works and how the cows are milking, you enjoy this series. A firm recommendation.
