This is one of Joan Crawford's best talks. It was the first Gable-Crawford tying and made it clear to MGM and the audience that they were a cheerful team, bringing together seven more movies together with them. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly depicts a brother and sister slipping down, who, after losing his father in the event of a stock market accident, has to take care of himself and work for him. In depression, life is difficult and soon even their efforts to find legal work will be useless and they will use the underworld. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is excellent as a social minor. He's smart, challenging, and credible. He even encourages the rigidity of the early Talkie style theater of other actors. Clark Gable is a dirty, masculine and dirty as a nonsense gangster who is engaged in Crawford's character. In the same year, he played a similar and even more successful role as opposed to Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul", securing his position as a male gender symbol in MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of Crawford role, don't miss "Paid" that he did a year earlier, which is also his best early talkie performances. <br /> <br />
