I saw this movie when it was new. Later I rented it in Japan after three years here, I'm afraid I'd spit when I looked at it in the harsh light of my extended international experience. The film was pleasant to me, how exactly it represents the clash of culture between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I come from). Not all things are actually on the ground, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I am still in Japan years later and I also enjoy this film for bilateral treatment. story. Interestingly, although Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialogue in the Japanese version has been reinstated to cover the obvious problems of second language delivery. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one reviewer uses it in Japanese class. I think you can find out more about what to expect from a meeting with Japan, watching this movie as reading a "serious" book on this issue (most of which were written in the 1980s and funded by Japanese companies). br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the average rating of one star reviewers who found, among other things, that Japan would be unlikely to want to build cars in the US. (Of course, many Japanese factories operate to be close to customers and avoid commercial friction.) This is a very warm and funny movie that I would appreciate if not in some of the 80s clich√©s like dancing around fun electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been funny.
