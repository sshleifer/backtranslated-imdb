This film has a steady, haunting pace that is based on excellent performance (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and the story that appears to us over time. <br /> <br /> In addition, music creates a full mood and helps to maintain a calm, cautious and terrible tone. <br /> <br /> Weir's story has been enhanced by using aborigines, their stories and tensions with the dominant white population to offer a fantastic story that is malicious. <br /> Although they are not both story and genre-related, it kept the same feeling inside me as Ursula Le Guini's "Latere of Heaven" (1980). <br /> <br /> "Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember that "hacking and slicing" does not make the movie a horror film, it is the psychological element of fear and intimidation within all of us.
