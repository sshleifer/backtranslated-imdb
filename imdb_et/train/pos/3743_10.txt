Dense script, good direction, great performances, strong cast, effective use of places .... <br /> <br /> Paul McGann, as a detailed and subtle presentation, is investigating a new murder as a central man who may have just committed a similar murder. <br /> <br /> An interesting moral and emotional journey (Ben Turner) takes place with his interest, and it intersects with Amanda Burton's journey. They inevitably cross ... Who has done what? <br /> <br /> WHY, in the past as well as in the current, rather than the WHO investigation, could have given a more interesting, dostoevsky story, but hey who complains? <br /> <br />
