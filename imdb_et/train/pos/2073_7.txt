In 1958 Clarksberg was a famous speed trap city. Many of the revenue came from the sheriff's department, who tried to speed. Those who tried to cross the sheriff? Well, it gave the sheriff an opportunity to pull out of the Clarksberg curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the film, a few soldiers trying to return to the base in time will die if I recall correctly. Then one day a strange city drove. It may be the coldest in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is the name of the car, like the McCord seals. It may be the ultimate hot rod. Black flamed '34 Ford coupe. The colors of death, evil and hell. He's getting a sheriff for speeding up. He controls the land. He's the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is all in favor of Sheriff. There is only one way to get justice in order to kill your brother and improve things so that "it never happens to anyone else again": create again and solve the death-style style of death. She goes to the curve and practices. Sheriff knows that McCord knows. The competition begins ... This is a movie that is remembered by anyone who has ever tried to maneuver on a certain track.
