The title ranks the credit written on the rain-soaked pavement when people are driving on it; music is played by someone who whistles Alfred Newman's "Street Scene". Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man was not: a man on the right. But he's pretty cruel for a good boy. After several complaints about his pastures, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) discourages him. Foley tells her she's a good man, but she has to straighten her head and have more Det. Thomas Thomas (Karl Malden), who has just received advertising. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, with excellent slippery performance) is an illegal dice game that wants to suck a rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell), introduced by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She thinks it's too late for her husband to use her as a lure and Paine strikes her when she refuses to play. Morrison, a soldier, intervenes, but Paine hits him cold. It seems to be the worst, but later it turns out that the boy is dead; The pressure is guilty. <br /> <br /> But it's not Paine's story. Soon Dixon will fall in love with Morgan, but not before he loses again and the terrible act he is trying to cover. Morgan's father, a dancing taxi driver (Tom Tully), can take this rape. Dixon's job is to try to blame Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger runs a script credited to Ben Hecht and three more William L. Stuart's novels Night Cry. It is a strong film with a magnificent performance and all the shady photographs and dusky morals we expect from this genre. It holds up to a brightly lit end that looks like something the studio had filmed to soothe the censors. Of course, Preminger's classical noir and Andrews and Tierney starring "Laura". You enjoy it, but you can't forget it.
