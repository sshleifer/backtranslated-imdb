Daniel Day-Lewis is a brain palsy victim who uses "My Left Foot" to write and paint in this incredible 1989 movie. The film also features Brenda Fricker as the mother of Christy, Ray McAnally, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor. Jim Sheridan's excellent performances, a great script and a great direction help to paint a lively portrait of an artist and writer Christy Brown, who died in 1981, aged 49. <br /> <br /> Brown was born into a lower middle class Catholic family where her mother was constantly pregnant (a total of 22 children, 13 of whom survived). His father found that Christy was mentally and physically disabled, but he did not allow his son to go home. The children of the family offered him goodbye every day as they went to school, and then his mother eats him and talked to him. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Fricker gives her a sense of a woman who, despite being surrounded by a large family, needs someone to talk to. Christy is not talking back. Finally, it is considered that he can drive, and the children of the neighborhood, all of whom are familiar with him, are involved in all his activities. The only part of her body that works really well is her left leg and when the kids know how well she strikes, they put the football games for that very purpose. One of the most beautiful parts of the film is the relaxed way that other children treat her. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but none as powerful as Christy writes on the "mother" floor, which has a chalk between her toes. "She's a real brown," she says, lifting her to the shoulders and carrying her in the pub. While walking in the pub, he says, "My son is a genius." Things change when Christy gets older because she has a young boy's desires and emotions. He develops to crush, reject, and go into his own colors. Finally, he goes to treatment at a nearby clinic and works with the therapist Eileen (Fiona Shaw) at home. She loves her. When he discovers he's bound, he's almost crazy. But he lives to live, paint, write (a total of three books) and love again. <br /> <br /> Because it is a movie that is absolutely necessary for certain things to go out and characters to be combined. Brown had not been diagnosed with brain damage for some time, which was left out of the film. Therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic indicators in Christy's life, and although we know her mother believed she was happy, she really worked with Christy when she was a child who taught her the alphabet, and so on. Prior to Mary's 12-year relationship with Christ, Christial also had a wife to whom she dedicated "My Left Foot". And typical Hollywood, which ends 9 years before his death, where his wife's neglect was not done, does not end the story. <br /> <br /> Although Christy Brown's biopsy is incredibly powerful, all the more because of two performances: Hugh O'Conor as young Christy and Daniel Day-Lewis as adult Christy. O'Conor's facial expression and the way he drags his twisted body is intestinal intake. One is exhausted for him and at the same time cordial. <br /> <br /> And what can be said about Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the world's greatest actors, he will bring Christy to life, become perfect flesh, an intelligent person who can swear, become angry, bitter, drunk , tiring, funny, funny and loving. That same year, the well-earned Oscar won Tom Cruise nominated for "Born in Fourth of July". I remember someone wrote to the editor that Cruise was so sensational that it was wrong in the academy? Uh, something to change. Something at all. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is amazing as Christy's mother who never believes in her and what she can do and who keeps her family and husband together in tough times. In Fricker's presentation, it is wonderful that support, love and work ethic seem naturally to the mother. A character never sees himself as a hero, or as someone ordinary. Fricker shows us a religious, but not fanatical, woman who believes her role on earth is a good woman and mother. And whatever, even if her husband does not work, she throws her daughter out of the house, no matter what she controls. She saves money for Christy's wheelchair, she gets photos of her daughter and child, she starts building a room at the back of the house for Christy. All part of the day. The Oscar-worthy performance he received. <br /> <br /> Brown's life was more complicated than this inspirational film, but it is an amazing achievement for all players and a must-see.
