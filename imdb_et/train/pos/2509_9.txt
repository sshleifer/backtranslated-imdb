Vampires, sexy boys, guns and blood. Who could ask more? Moon Child gives it all in one nicely packed flick! Gackt is an innocent Sho, who communicates with Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows with time, but in Sho's age, Kei's immortality crushes his heart. It doesn't help that they both love the same woman. Special effects are pretty good with a low budget. This is a poor story about people's feelings. You laugh, cry, laugh, then cry. Even if you are not a fan of their music, watch this movie. It works perfectly as an independent vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 out of ten
