this movie is a very relaxed, romantic comedy that is very enjoyable. Meg Ryan makes a great job as Albert Einstein's genius, although he believes in his skills. Tim Robbins does the same job as a mechanic who falls in love with him when he enters his shop when his car is ready. I liked Walter Matthau as the only Albert Einstein. This film has a very relaxing feeling while maintaining a certain degree of seriousness (if it is possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> I personally found this movie very fun, especially old scientists - I thought they were brave and fun! This film seems to be undervalued. If you have a funny sense of humor, it's a movie for you!
