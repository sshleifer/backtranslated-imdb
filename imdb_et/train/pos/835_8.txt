Pierce Brosnan is the newest, but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He's very good at what he's doing, but he's getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as a straight and narrow businessman. Now that the story opens, the film shows these two people in their lives. Then one night there are drinks in the bar and they start talking. Then suddenly you will find that these two people are gathering together during a series of events. The story is great, the actress is top-notch and humor is fun. I've never thought Pierce Brosnan would be funny, but he's really and I have to say that this movie is black.
