Better than a regular TV film, CALLS HAPPY is blessed with great pain (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a high concept of the renowned Faustia plot. Urich is pleasing as always and Lucci is pulling and damagingly over the mother of all femme fatale roles. Definitely STEPFORD WIVES and their LIVE hybrid version, the film will soon put its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision and horror fans in a lot of complaints, up to soppy, maudlin denial. 7/10
