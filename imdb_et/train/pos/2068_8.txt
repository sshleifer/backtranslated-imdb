1958. Unine small southern city of Clarksburg. The evil sherry Roy Royress (omnipotent Vic Morrow in top-notch form) cracks from the top with extreme complexity, forcing the offenders to cliff due to their unreasonable death in a particularly dangerous part of the road. Childress meets with his game when the chilled young hot rod driver Michael McCord (Martin Sheen's beautifully smooth and admirable image) appears in the city in his souped-up car with the specific aim of reducing his brother's death (Sheen's actual sister-brother) Joe Estevez with a short listener. Director Richard T. Heffron, who works in Richard Compton's tight and intriguing script (the same man who led the 70's "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line") binds a thrilling story with a vigorous pace, naturally creating a delicious 50- For an annual period, and milk milk much tight out of a tight game of mental and wills between Childress and McCord. Uniformly exquisite mold helps a lot: Sheen radiates the leading James Deanesque rebel vibe, Morrow makes her obscene evil, and Michelle Phillips is a great supporter of sweet food at Maggie, Stuart Margolin as People's Deputy Nick Nolte as a friendly gas station at Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan Buzz's fun-loving brother Lyle, Janit Baldwin as sassy local sour sissy, Britt Leach as annoying cab driver Johnny and Frederic Downs as stern referee AND Hooker. Clarkactic vehicle confrontation Childress and McCord is a real pulse-pounding white-knuckle exciting doozy. Terry K. Meade's sharp cinematography, well-drawn characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with shock accelerators after his wife and child were killed in a fatal and rolling incident), Luchi De Jesus's creepy, synchronic result and beautiful mountain scenery provide an even better overall sound quality for the TV changer.
