It was my second time watching the film (via the French version, not the first one that was in Italian) and I feel that it improves later views. <br /> <br /> Persistent when slowly built - character research that is beautifully beaten and the Paris settings are just as impressive. In the long run, it is not top-notch Polanski, and I would appreciate it in my filmography in 9, but it is still a mixture of finesse and surprisingly often wide comedy. It also has fine pain, all in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I am a bit overwhelmed by Trelkovski's sudden coercion. "Change" with the previous tenant; besides the owner of the caf√© opposite the apartment building, to whom he is given what Simone used before, without asking him if he wants a different one, there is little to note (as far as I could distinguish) that it is all wanted by him! Okay, so she found that Simone's stuff still in the apartment, but what she started wearing her dresses and she put her up (even if she probably started it subconsciously)? After her delicate visions in the bathroom, the last part of the movie (where Adjani is all but disappearing) is almost anti-climatic - especially the scene where the landlord and other tenants know their suicide attempt, as if at night in Opera - a concept that Jean Cocteau had already used for 46 years POET VILAS (1930)! <br /> <br /> The end is immediately predictable and unresolved: just what made the two passengers jump out of the window of that particular apartment?!; I also remember the factor that I lost when I first saw, and I'm sorry to say it's not clearer now! Keep in mind that the first two thirds of the movie are pretty strong, but I want Polanski to be less dependent on hidden plot points.
