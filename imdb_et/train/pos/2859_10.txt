I know it sounds strange when someone was born almost 15 years after the show was finished, but I love that example. I don't know why, but I like to watch it. I love Adam the best. The only disappointment is that the only place I bought in the DVD season was in Germany and it was just the first two seasons. It's disappointing, but it's OK. I look online. If anyone has tips on where to buy from year to year, please send me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already have the first one. The only thing is that the DVDs come from Germany, they only play on my portable DVD player and my computer. Oh well. I still have it!
