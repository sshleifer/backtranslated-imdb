My main problem with the film is that it goes too long. Other then it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is planning to marry through an organized marriage. Luise Rainer is a maid girl who marries Mun. They live with Muni's father on the farm and they do pretty bad. When he finally buys money a little more, the drought will hit a bit and nothing will grow. First, the stars heading north of Muni will fall off. When they leave the city and arrive, they find they are not jobs and they are worse than before. They even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave, but decide against it. When a number of people begin to loot the city, the military will appear and begin to fill people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won the second film for this movie.
