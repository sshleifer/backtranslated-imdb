I saw this movie for the first time when I was about seven years old and then it was completely fascinated, but for years it was not possible to find out what the film called. now i'm twenty one and hit the accident after the movie about two weeks ago and i bought a copy. Although my memory of the film was a bit blurry, I was in no way disappointed with what I saw. The animation of this film is a great world that is so plausible and so animated that it is pulled into a movie alone. But this film also has a plot that captivates and attracts both adults and children. with a floating island, mad general, friendly pirate grandmother and well-built love story, this movie won't let you down, I would recommend this movie to one.
