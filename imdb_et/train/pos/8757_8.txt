I like movies that do not offer a typical "happy ending", and this is my main reason why I like this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are being arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling after anonymously calling the Thai authorities. The film is working hard to keep viewers guessing whether the girls were involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as his horrible lawyer. Jacqueline Kim is a terrible, grand woman, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I want girls to be more abused in prison, as the second comment has said, because I have heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. When this film grabs me, it's the end. Alice puts a total of 96 years of punishment so that Darlene can be pardoned and we (viewers) realize that they are both innocent. Any movie that violates my expectation will win extra points with me and this well-functioning drama is definitely worth it.
