Since this is a black history month and I look at the achievements of many African-Americans on the film in chronological order, I got this movie from the VHS library because there were Duke Ellington and his orchestra. The Franz Liszt's "raps" jazz version was its main powerful mix of murder mystery-music comedy. Many other numbers I liked were Kitty Carlisle's especially "Sweet Marijuana", Carl Brisson's Cocktails for Two, as well as her duet with Carlisle earlier, and Gertrude Michael, who is a big woman who you hate . Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen will probably go a little too long for their love and hatred as a producer and detective, but they will grow with you. And Toby Wing is a sexy buggy like Nancy, who is trying to say something to Oakie, but she gets "not now" every time. While many characters are the cause of the murders, I was not surprised at who did it. And get the burden of how women are naked here (though, of course, their breasts are covered with either their hands or some thin upper). It was obviously a preliminary code. It is worth looking for this type of interested movie. P.S. Like a long-time resident of Louisiana, I like to note that someone was born here when Carlisle was the native of New Orleans.
