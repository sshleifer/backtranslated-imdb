This film is not just one of the titles of the big films, but it is the third team of actors of the 70's Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. It seems to me that I remember the movie that was sent back to the 78th year of Halloween week against our Linda Blair in our house. I left it on the first screen to see another movie. Later, repeatedly, I saw that I made the right choice. The film is not really bad, but there really is no chills or surprises. Although I did a scene where Richard Crenna hits the family dog ​​with no results.
