My siblings and I stumbled upon the championship when our local station rode again in the 1970s. We absolutely respected it. There was something so exotic and mysterious, especially when compared to traditional American raids (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get an idea). It was the same for Avengers (not too big a surprise because it was also a British and spy / adventure genre). <br /> <br /> I would like to see it again - hopefully it will hold up. I mentioned this example to others and nobody has ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I can imagine the existence of this whole. But the miracle of the web has allowed me to find information about it. Hopefully he will find a new generation of fans.
