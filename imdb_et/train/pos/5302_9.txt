This movie kept me constantly entertained. Compared to Serial Mom, Mr. Waters has returned to his grittier. It's not nearly as polished. <br /> <br /> There's a dark side here. A message about how success and celebrity change people - but more importantly how it changes the people around you. <br /> <br /> There is no wrong moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are somewhat comic ... but I want to believe that what Mr Waters is trying to achieve is. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see how Mr. Waters has evolved ... It's really his best job.
