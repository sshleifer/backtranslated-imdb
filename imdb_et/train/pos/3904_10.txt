I think it's the best stand-up show I've ever seen. I immediately became an Eddie fan after I saw Dress to Kill, but I have to say that it's her best job. I would say, however, that if you could definitely live, surely. It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time you saw a stand-up routine a few times, the jokes are getting older. But I have to say that I've seen this example so many times that in the literal sense everything has been remembered (which is, yes, I understand it is sad), but every joke makes me laugh. This is a really good feeling. <br /> <br /> The dress will never be old for me. I own it and look at it whenever I need a good laugh.
