It was a very enjoyable movie. A funny but embarrassing look at the family and the accompanying responsibilities. A story about a man who lives in a city in his father's bath house in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate, even pamper things he left home. The film is both visually beautiful and emotionally beautiful.
