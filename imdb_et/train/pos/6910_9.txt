Paul was completely hanging on someone's supreme who made Dave. It's the same story, not so funny. <br /> <br /> Paul, who was involved with a scene this morning, where a new national anthem of the paradise is singing in Sammy. he arrived in brazil after a long flight from vegas, three planes, a car ride, etc. he barely stood, had to use a cane. he was in the trailer about the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> He didn't know he could do it. then he saw a crowd of 6,000 extra, costing 7 bucks. he came to life and they shot this scene for two hours. he was great then almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a great man, though very liberal. real talent.
