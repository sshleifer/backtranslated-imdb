I happened to catch this movie one afternoon. I have to admit that I've never been a big baseball fan, but sometimes I get a good sports movie. The more interesting it was to find a family family system. As a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community's mental health as well as the well-being system, I was quite refreshing to see the film, which showed the ups and downs of this system: people who jumped from family to family, biological parents are not always actively involved and transitions , which can only be heartbreaking and melting from the heart. The anchor of this film is Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover, and both are incredible performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I found myself in tears at the end of the movie.
