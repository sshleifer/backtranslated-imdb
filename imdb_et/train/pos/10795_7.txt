Ooverall, the film was pretty good, a good line of action with quite a lot of explosions and scenes, but barely Chuck Norris had done anything except disarming the bomb and some characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11 when a bin-stormed terrorist sent a video to the President (Urich) and threatened to explode. Judson Mills had some great roles in the action, taking out Rashid's compound and different kick-butt roles, but missing Chuck Norris. Judson took over much of his activity by leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on his computer. But in general it was realistic and lacking in action, but it was only part of Mr Norris. I gave the movie 7/10.
