The Lion King series is just a crowning achievement of Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece of cel animation. Lion King II: Simba Pride is BY FAR's best direct-video sequel that is animated by Disney or another studio. It served as a theater publication. The same can be said about this movie. It has Elton John's original songs, a fun story, exciting action and characteristic moments. Everything you've been waiting for in this series. Not so much a new story, but a filler and extended background in Timon and Pumb and their place in that story. What impressed me most was animation. All of the time, Disney is short on the animation quality of his video and TV shows. But here they blend smoothly with the new animation from the original movie. Scenes never seem inappropriate. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing like Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly repeat their roles, respectively, with Simba, Rafiki and Nala. We even get the hyena of the return of Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin. So if you love Lion King, you need this movie. The story is not complete without it.
