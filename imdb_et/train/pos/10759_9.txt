It is true that you will always remember what you did when a disaster or tragedy strikes. And no more that September 11, 2001, the date that changed the global landscape in the fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary did not take place on 9-year-olds. 11. The filmmakers, Gédéon and Jules Naudet, rather, started a documentary about the trials and tribulations of the New York firefighter. They had gone to the academy and did some exercises, and they had chosen their "probe" (probationary firefighter) to join them in the NY fire, where the ladder 1 and the engine are located 7th time, which is probably the only first train that came into the world hub. <br /> <br /> I drove back on the train at a friend's night in LAN games and got a call about 850 minutes from my local time from my father, who told me the above. A few minutes later, he told me there was one more and that WTC was under attack. By the time I got home, the floors and smoke of the top floors of the twin towers were, and they fell under an hour to my horror. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers had two cameras working on that day, one who had followed the team after routine calling, and immediately competed with WTC when he heard and saw the plane crash. In the WTC1 lobby, we are watching the only series of filmed events, where firefighters, paramedics, and police first respondents had to understand what happened and quickly develop an action plan. Another camera held by another brother led WTC to search for his sister-brother and many New York expressions along the journey, as well as a sense of chaos in and around Manhattan. > <br /> The documentary has a lot of interviews with Ladies 1 and 4, who did not really suffer the accident. But when the survivors have also brought their psychological instability, they tried to agree with the event. Through emerging events, we learn to save lives between men who risk living and risking their lives every day. <br /> <br /> We started with what the documentary was supposed to be before the events of the day turned fully into focus until the rescue phase, where the hopes of finding crushed survivors were men working 24 hours a day in terms of collapsed steel structures. It is not a film that is made, and what you do not see here, can not be restored in any other documentary (and in the sky, not in the sounds of Hollywood composers). It's as close to getting to that day, close to the event, for safety. <br /> <br /> Code 1 DVD contains a separate set of additional 4 interviews with Ladies 1 and 4.
