It is always sad when most of the filmmakers do not miss out on the "retreating" films. "Panic" is a wonderfully convincing and amazing study of a character who feels trapped in his life. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, like Alex, is as convincing as ever. This beautiful actor seems to have a special talent for pulling her heart off, no matter what her mistakes may be. we may not always agree on the lifestyle of our main characters, but the emotions of fear and confusion we have come up with are often too painful. The title, "Panic," seems paradoxical at first, given the lack of obvious emotion. At one point, Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. But as this story emerges, it becomes increasingly clear that rage and despair, not indifference, are the driving forces behind this man's existence. <br /> <br /> More than once I was reminded of my performance "Fargos". another highly characterized film. Both "Fargo" and "Panic" witness a middle-aged man who seems to have somehow left his life. He has lost his way, and the only way back to deception seems to be in the dark. He knows he's making bad choices, but despair goes beyond self-control and reason. <br /> <br /> Alex associates a 23-year-old wife with Sarah (mesmorizingly playing Neve Campbell) whom she meets with a doctor. location. Thematically, this union is less of a coincidence, more of a destiny. Alex thinks he is confident with Sarah, knowing that he is a fellow citizen, like him, someone who has lost his way and swamlessly through the rest of his life, waiting vigorously for his inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> Selecting movies like this is a nice and convincing way for Neve Campbell to respond to those critics who question his ability to act. Too often, what he has played is the weakness, giving Campbell any depth to hone his muscles. However, this performance can be an eye opener for many. <br /> <br /> In a perfect film world, not only would there be more movies, like "panic", but they would arrive and appreciate them. a much wider audience. If you look at the richness and depth of film characterization, not just the latest state-of-the-art special effects, it is impossible for you to "panic". A +.
