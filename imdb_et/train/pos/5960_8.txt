It's nice to see the role of Jorja Fox, where she smiles a lot. He also loved to hear him. Nice change to see him out of CSI / West Wing / ER. The film itself was entertaining, but it seemed that many parts did not leave any explanation. Several characters seemed unhappy after a minute and happy, and it fell under your imagination to find out why. However, each character was peculiar and in some cases I couldn't wait to see what they would do next, or hear what they were saying next. This film was not full of nervous clean people, but rather complicated and realistic people who could make mistakes, make them bad and find a way to fix them.
