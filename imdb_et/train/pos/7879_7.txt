As with most Eleanor Powell films, it plays the most common plot. For some reason - oh that's explained! - he has been selected to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. The good guys and the bad guys are competing for the mine and the one who gets confused. But as always, Powell's dancing is great and worth the entrance price. And this is where Lahr plays his coward, creating warm memories of this 1939 Technicolor film. A special discount is the young Frank listening to this wonderful voice and the lean vulnerabilities he later gave up to his wise man. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a marvelous time, showing his virtuosity. Take a look at your unique duet with Dorsey's trumpetist Ziggy Elman. I say "unique", or ignorance, but I do not know any other drum / trumpet sequence, as is the case with film or documents. This movie is fun. Even the cozy person of Skelton is relatively restrained. Powell shows again that he is the greatest film dancer ever.
