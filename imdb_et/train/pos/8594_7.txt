I was hoping that Sentinel would be a good movie and I was right. A great story first of the novel and I thought it was the original story, but I think it wasn't and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good and Keither Sutherland is too, but it is still very difficult to complain about him from Jack Bauer 24, but finally you do it and he is very different in Sentinel when he is the 24th. another person trying to lower his TV role but couldn't. Eva Longeria. It wasn't so good in the movie and he had the whole seat in the back seat. After I saw the movie, I was constantly dreaming about Sentinel and couldn't do it. The Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
