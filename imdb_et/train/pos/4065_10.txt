I've seen the original version of the video. Disney's choice of voice actors seems very promising. I can't believe I say that. The story is about a young shopper who meets a girl who is intertwined. These two are thrown into one fun and intriguing ensemble on any animated film. The quality of animation is great! Once you've seen the Disney Kiki delivery service work, you'll see the quality of your production. It redeems them almost back to steal the story of Kimba's white lion. (but not quite!) Finally, Miyazaki movies will show up properly! I can't wait to see the native English version of Nausica!
