I have the original picture as I have been waiting for some time. The Brokedown Palace is the "hard to believe" aspect, but with the brilliant leadership and scenario, Palace's results are great. <br /> <br /> I've never really enjoyed watching Claire Danes in any of her movies, but I tell you what she really changed. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes for a vacation in Thailand, where they meet a young man who convinces them to travel to Hong Kong with him. But he ignored the fact that they would inform them that they were carrying an uncomfortable amount of drugs. Eventually they get stuck and arrive in Thai prison. I know I know how you didn't know you had 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you get this little scam, you will find a very well written and acted story. Recently, I've found myself pulling the story of the movies I watch, and developing a personal feeling for the characters I look at. This movie is no different. At the end of the movie, I found myself taking care of more than any other movie characters. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, an attorney who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman delivers excellent performance and combines the film nicely. <br /> <br /> There are some turns that are tears at the end of the movie. This is one of the films you've probably gone through when you searched for this movie at home. My opinion is that next time it won't go through the video store again.
