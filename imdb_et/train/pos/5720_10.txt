I saw "The Grudge" yesterday and wow ... I was really scared, good thing. I love horror films and I liked it. There were so many "surprises" scenes (which is the English word?) That made you jump into your seat. Although too much shouting from the audience, it was hard to laugh. I think the most frightening scene was ... on the bus when the face was blinking from the window or when Yoko walked without a bang. Makeup is also very good. Sometimes you see it was there, but it was still a terrible picture. The boy was really very good, so nice without a makeup and so frightening. The next time I hear the cracking noise, I probably feel pretty scared ...
