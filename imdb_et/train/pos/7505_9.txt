If there is one genre I've never had, it's a biopsy. Always misleading, full of false information, dramatic scenes, and trickery around the world, the bioplay is almost ever done. Even in the hands of those truly talented directors, such as Martin Scorsese (Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great service to the people they are trying to capture. Skepticism takes the place of jumping with most of the biological materials that go on the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was not different. Some critics and filmmakers challenged Gretchen Mol, taking into account the role of Bettie Page, saying that he was no longer a celebrity and had no pieces for him. I have no doubt that Mol could handle this part, but I never expected his amazing effect to be as I was just watching the film. Mol offers an exclusive Oscar value, a 1950s iconic girl who, after an early abuse (depicting fine and tasteful, something from a few directors apparently) becomes involuntarily the most famous models of all time. The picture covers a lot of the ground in its 90-minute ride, but despite at least three sub-tiles, there is still a feeling that the story may be small. Director / co-author Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantastic script are just too steep and not as clear as they should end. Nonetheless, two ladies must be given credit to create a virtually flawless biopsy that can respect both her and the decade she masterfully emits. Come to Oscar Time, Mol, Turner and Harron should get candidates. Doubt this happens, though certainly not the three women are more. 9/10
