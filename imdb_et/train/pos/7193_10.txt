God! Zorro has been about as many films as Tarzan, and so many players were often in the title. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my personal favorites, and as mentioned earlier, it is one of the five best sound series. Strangely enough, this is one of the products produced in the 1939 waters. * For this production, "39" was really known as Zorro as a (cellulose) literary and film brand. The film opens with a small footnote about Mexico's struggle for freedom from the European monarchy, namely Spain. The story calls for a comparison of the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on San Mendelito's mythical province and its council. This is being dealt with by Benito Juarez ** in relation to his gold mine with the new Republic of Mexico. Shipments of gold must pass through the city of Mexico. <br /> <br /> Don Francisco's peace with Diego Vega says he has organized a group of patriots to act to protect the gold convoys. Oro mob, stepping into an "insult" and challenging Don Francisco to a sword duel, Don Frasncisco will run. Z 'in the form of a bad boy he sends him forward. Don Francisco announces with his dead soul to his congregation, Ramon (William Corson), that Zorro is his nephew of the city of Los Angeles. He also tries to talk about the true identity of Don del Oro, but it expires before the application is completed. <br /> <br /> Diego has a great reception with Don Francisco Hacienda, where Diego disappears from Ramon (as well as Don Francisco) with his timid action. "A FOP !!" he says. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon slid together with a volunteer meeting. When they ask, "Who brings us to Don Francisco now?", Says Ramon "Zorro, we are the Zorro fighting legion!" Well, there is a big battle with Legion, now it's all gray, covered with masks and coats, protecting the kid. Then Zorro seems to be trapped in an artificial avalanche for a convoy if you know that the first end of the chapter is a capricorn. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for one chapter, but like most other series, opening is longer and has a lot of reasons to create a story. Let me just say that there are still 11 good, well done, completed chapters after the operation. We have an unknown evil leader who creates problems between different groups. There are a number of suspects who were actually behind Don del Oro's mask. We had soldiers, renegades of white, hostile Indians and legions. In short, it is safe to say that there is everything you could and then some in this series. And by the way, they wisely choose that there are no participants to influence Mexican accents. <br /> <br /> What's right here, what makes ZFL different from the rest? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, it is a much more complicated and exciting musical score that plays and highlights drama and action on the screen. The theme of the opening will even appear on the transfer of flamenco guitar in the first chapter of Cantina. This is probably the only time that such highly specialized innovation appears on the soundtrack of the series. <br /> <br /> And there is yet another feature that really sets the fighting legion out of everyone else. This means that the film has not only a heroic musical theme, but also a sport Lyrics, yes, legionaries sing! We hear them in credits for opening the song and in several chapters! It really works well and adds the feelings from viewing. <br /> <br /> When Serial was first shown on our local television (around 1955), the whole gang of Reed Hadley was immediately recognized by Captain Braddock of TV RACKET SQUAD. Hadley had a very special and deep voice. Her costume and particularly elongated mask seemed very good and probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a small slip. Some minor anachronism occurs when Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) turns to the San Mendelito Council because Juarez was about 18 years old at that time (1824), and although he was probably the largest single figure in Mexican history later, he had certainly not yet achieved such a highlight. . His involvement in the story was probably cash when he released Warner Brothers JUAREZ this year, which celebrated Paul Muni's role. <br /> <br /> This is not just my five best sound series, but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We are reminded that this year's biggest airline films are GONE WITH THE WIND, MR.SMITH WASHINGTON, CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE OZI, OUR AND WIZARD, MILLMONNA BC, ZENOBIA, OUR OUR OUR OWN ALL YEARS. <br /> <br /> ** Again, Juarez does not pull national significance up to around 1850, about 25 years later. The provinces are also called political subunits of the story. In reality, they are called "countries". Just as we are called the United States, they also call their Repubhlicit in the Mexican United States south of the border. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was prominent in some very A-pictures where his richly toned voice is well used. See and listen to his story HOUSE ON 92 YEARS (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
