Ice Age is not only an animation of the year (in my eyes) but also the best animated feature I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Teaser excited me last year and have spent a lot of happy hours on the website. Scrat is cool! So are the rest of Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> Animation is great. Your heart really is the characters of this movie. They have good dialogues and they are well developed. It is difficult to tell which person actually steals the picture. <br /> <br /> I experienced my journey with laughter, tears and astonishment. Nothing was forced or done. Emotion was genuine, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film that deeply influenced me was Anastasia in 1997, as well as Fox Production. And before that, it was a land ahead of 1988. Everyone has a real charm and is trying to attract the whole audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
