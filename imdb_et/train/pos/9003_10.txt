<br /> <br /> I think it's not the best movie ever made, but I voted for it by 10 stars. Mainly for my feelings. I and all the people around me were touched easily. This is something you often don't know. We all get a little cynical and get tired of sentimentality, sloppy manipulations, or preaching in today's movies. The story of the films surrounding Jane, a young woman in the last stages of the MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, the man on the verge of disintegration. It could have been such a boring and worthwhile piece, but it is so humorous, humane and incomplete sentimentality that it will win you completely and contradict the good film. <br /> <br /> Actress Branagh and Bonham-Carter are great, especially the last, who is always credible and strong in her role. Two chemistry raises the film. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards' masterpiece, the plane and his old paintings. Flying here is the symbol of both Richards and Janes living life completely, so one can continue and the other may face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and funny movie I would recommend to anyone. don't let it down.
