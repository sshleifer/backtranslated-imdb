This film deserves more recognition than getting it. It is indeed a stunning and abundant image of blood links, sexes and offenses in the world of crime. The film strikes beautifully and shines in all classic themes such as betrayal and power. This film is a movie for the visitor, it requires attention and understanding, and it is worth it at the end. This is a Hong Kong godfather, and it is a welcome change rather than a second struggle with a wire frame, an epic of martial arts, which seems to be the biggest contribution made by Hong Kong and China to the cinema world. It has the layout of big characters, actors and development, although it is fair to say that I had to look at it twice to happen to some characters because they have so many interactions in the film. All in all 8/10 Characters from large plots, but there are signs that don't look good and music didn't start me and sometimes I felt that it didn't sync well. so it loses some points.
