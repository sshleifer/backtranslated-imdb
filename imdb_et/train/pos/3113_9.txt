The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role), the newest spy form in the block, completes his quest for identity when he also tries to end the CIA's latest program "Blackbriar" to make super heroes like myself. <br /> <br /> I was so enthusiastic about looking at my predecessors yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I remembered and the primacy is weak (but still enjoyable) for the weakest plot and in addition to the car chase that this movie chase is easily up to, a mild absence and intercourse. <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, is there a tension in the ultimatum! Even if you know that Bourne is fleeing from the authorities (and the boy's attention to the police as an intuition), it's still great looking at him. It's pointless to think that two arms and moped men can create 10 times more tension than all those $ 150 million giant robots in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Criticize this with Paul Greengrass, who has such an idiosynthetic style by shooting a stedicam a la documentary, even though he is shooting very common characters in places such as the CIA headquarters where no camera is allowed 10 miles away. He seemed to be listening to his various complaints with Supremacy, because the ultimatum is nothing but terrifying because the various tools used as a weapon are a candlestick, a hardcover book (I never look at them the same way) and an electric fan (don't ask). The music also helped to create a lot of tension, and there was hardly any moment to bite the nail. <br /> <br /> Action is good and Julia Stiles' character "Nicky" development put her situation in a new, very sympathetic light. Damon plays the role of his signature with the reserve, but the competence (which sounds little, but it looks like Matt Damon could leave something out of the CIA and Interpol), but noticeable moments when he is still struggling to find his humanity. Its longing for real life can be boring and almost superior, but it just works better in ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I am reminded of the scene "Goldeneye" (the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond movie) in which Sean Bea's character asks James whether Martin is silenced by all the dead men. Bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he must (or at least make me think) the purpose of the activity, the meaning of life, and how the government has made men into resources. Although the resources known to Krav Maga and capable of doing something out of the gun are Sidenote: I am always disturbed by the fact that despite the CIA, Interpol and police have wanted to hunt, and almost everyone who goes, Bourne never thought even the smallest attempts to hide their qualities or create new passports. Maybe sunglasses? <br /> <br /> If you have pulse and love movies, Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, this is probably the best movie that came out this year. Of course, you would be stupid to see it without others watching. It hits the end, but I feel almost tempted to forget it. This is the first summer summer "3" movie that matches at least the original and nothing that says something. <br /> <br /> A-
