My daughter, her friends, and I literally looked at this film tens of times. I bought it twice and some little girls fled with it. Then I rented it very many times. It just won't get old! Blockbuster no longer has it on his list and I've been trying to buy it, find it, rent it for over 5 years. Undoubtedly, this was the favorite movie of my daughter's childhood and that's it! We laughed, we shouted, we talked about real life and how hard the kids are in the world. There was nothing to imagine about this movie. We are linked to every other and every line Bill! Thanks to a million people for restoring faith. Sincerely, Shudel and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Update for August '07: <br /> <br /> Who should we decide if a rich woman falls in love with a poor person; or a man with love decides to raise a child who is not his own. It may not be mine or your life. It's not only plausible, it happens every day. Thank God! Keeps your faith in human nature alive !!! celebrate !!
