I really enjoyed the film's relationship that sometimes arose between American soldiers and Japanese women in post-war Japan - and the obstacles they had created. Brando desperately goes to Japan (which is natural when he looks at WW2) to love a Japanese woman and wants to marry her. Her performance is okay (I'm not her actor style) and the film is wonderful. The red buttons got the Oscar for their second-touch presentation that loves Japan (although Japanese women who play against it also did a great job). <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil it, but the movie is good for viewing the box. <br /> <br /> This movie can say SOMETHING and be entertaining at the same time. Mostly underrated pearl.
