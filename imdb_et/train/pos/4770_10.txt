The only exhibition I've seen since 90210! Why did they give up? It was the only example that grabbed Hawaii's nature and made you feel part of it! At least what they should do is release it on a DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked similar exhibitions, but nothing is close. The incredible chemistry was cast and I was expecting every episode with much anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by showing it. If anyone has information about where I get a North Shore DVD, please send some lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
