Masayuki Suo, who led this beautiful film, has a role to play. After a good "Fancy Dance" and classic (Japan) college-sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo has followed her tremendous traces of terrible success. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting. We both laugh often (Naoto Takenaka is fun as he is in the two previous films) and the root of the characters. But for me, the big bonus is the appearance of the film, which gives the viewer Japanese society - a real life in Japan. Suo can show real activities with fun. The result is a movie that pulls you in, laughs, thinks, and both attract you and give you an insight into today's Japan. <br /> <br /> See also Shiko Funjatta's main 8 actors. because they all appear again in different roles, from supporting (Takenaka) characters to short (many).
