There is a complicated story behind the Bharati partition. An honest Muslim who robs the innocent Hindu girl and educated prices that burn a Muslim harvest, but eventually both. The story is powerful, but the scenario and the flow are hesitant. The background music score and the songs are outstanding. The next one is memorable by veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography saves the time, violence and taste of Punjab in rural areas. Other participants did not act well or could not act. The direction is really the weakest link. The characters were not well developed. Not crisp, unlike "Earth", where even a 5-digit character leaves a mark. The end is very interesting. This story may have several different ends - and all of them could have been equally good.
