Great entertainment from start to finish. Great performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and many actions. The film was made for me! Funny lines in the scenario, good music. Dalton as a tough sheriff and Railsback as a "redneck-villain". I have to recommend this movie to every action adventure fan! 10/10
