This is the best list on my favorite movie! It's a fantastic and remarkable movie. It was historically interesting and nice to watch! I thought Emily Blunt's actor was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a great Albert, Albert was the best actor. The costumes were proud and the settings and scenes like the opera house were amazing and detailed. I just loved it, all! I loved childhood scenes when John Conroy wanted to tempt him. And where her mother says she has to go upstairs with an adult. Once again, writers have done it! They made this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> It deserves the prizes they received.
