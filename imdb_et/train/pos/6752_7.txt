The detective (Dana Andrews), who is violent for violence, accidentally kills the suspect (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover it. The film by Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere, but the story shakes when the dead man's wife (Gene Tierney) falls to Andrews. He did quite well digging into and out of the big holes, but he was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a young film. Gary Merrill is great as Scales, a criminal boss that Andrews is obsessed with and the tensions between them give the film his energy and drive, especially in the Old Town of the scene with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand and at night. at a time when the Bellevue Hospital was outside, which puts the film in the conclusion. High atmospheric trail, Andrews, Merrill, etc. And the general image of the underworld, although the angle of love and the simple good policemen, does not help the cause.
