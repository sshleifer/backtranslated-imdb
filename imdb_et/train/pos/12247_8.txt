I loved this version of Emma the best. Kate beckinsale was fantastic because Emma and mark strong were very good as a knight. the only complaint I had with Mr Woodhouse, I can't believe that a person can make so much fun or be so selfish with his daughter's life. As always, I love the places where these Jane Austin films were shot. the settings are so expressive. it will make me want to go so far from England as well as Ireland and Scotland. I think the participants selected for this movie were also a good choice and all the other story lines that were connected to Emma's finest! I'm glad I saw it too.
