The film was captured from start to finish and its b / w photography from the heart of America is stunning. We feel that we are with them when they cross a great country of heaven and then to Mexico and back to America. At the end of the film, Robert Blake's rain reflection looks like small sweat rivers and tears. Finally, we follow them up the stairs until the last minute. <br /> <br /> The two criminals of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, such as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, were visible on any street in any city. Hickock is a laughing boy and Smith, a man whose stars are on the wrong side of the city. This point is made in the movie and always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even the most whistle, is part of the human condition. These two misleading men are killing the whole family, looking for a safe that is not there. When they run, they start writing bad controls by deleting the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many great supporters. I like John Forsyth as a case detective, Alvin Dewey. Will Geer also looks like a short but excellent scene as a prosecutor. <br /> <br /> I've often wanted to see this movie all the time, just keeping it from short strikes; I finally got it after buying a DVD. The result is the best classic film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this brilliant movie. For me this is just the big film making.
