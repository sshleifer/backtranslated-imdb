An unusually straight-face maker, played by a director and directed by a filmmaker who apparently took the material seriously. Incomplete, as expected from a movie that is clearly delineated on a tight budget, but drama is involved - it's one of those movies that when Cinemax 2 or more Maxi repeats the ad or when they call it, you stop watching the 40-minute block, if you should go to work. W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault" recall that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low budget brethernians who have the real ability to accelerate the genre movie. when he is really interested in the material (ie don't worry about his Shannon Tweed clips 3 or 4 after the title!) Actors who have recently done too little (for Mancuso, Ford, even for Gary Sandy chrissakes) for years really did their best roles - like Griecole , he has the right look, though his action is a bit of a notebook - it's obvious that his character is a constantly self-destructive film, but Grieco doesn't know it quite well. I checked IMDB and I see that the writer also wrote to the director the "Corporate House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" - both of which are small classics in their rights, but probably "silly" like cinema Roger Cormon - it's more like some of the better Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B-pictures of the 70's that give you an element of exploitation, but at the same time offer drama involvement - a real step forward. Not the last moments of "Citizen Kane" and the comics are a bit distracting, but well written, characteristic, of the average direct-video actors. Such small achievements should not be neglected, which is quite rare (as I was reminded when I tried to sit through the Albert Pyun monster, called "Heavenly Wheel" on the second night - this low budget stuff is not so easy - but it's another one story!)
