I found a movie about "Holes", listening to people that it wasn't typical for Disney that both children and adults got the story. People, let me say that I wasn't disappointed. "Holes" is based on Louis Sachar's novel and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is sent away from the wilderness to a strange juvenile detention camp. He interacts with a boy whose nickname is Zero, and together they laid the foundation for an adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I didn't know what to expect when I looked at it. It was interesting to see that the story was put together as a puzzle. The boys who played juvenile offenders were all very funny and Jon Voight was just as fun as Mr Sir. Now that I saw the movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!
