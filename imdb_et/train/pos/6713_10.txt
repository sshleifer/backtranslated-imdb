I liked this TV show because it was her thing she finds with her sixteenth birthday that she is a witch and she lives with her aunts in the house and they are both witches. Well it took him a couple of weeks to get used to. When he used his powers for the first time, it was so funny because he turned his pineapple. He had to return and repeat. This series is really cool and it is a typical teen series, but she wore her apartment and her colleagues with her colleagues moved into the flat and then got bored and finished watching. I loved her letters that were so funny and the other was really ditzy. I loved Valerie and I hated Libra, the enemy of Sabrina, who was ugly.
