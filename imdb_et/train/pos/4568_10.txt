Seriously, can you imagine such a proliferation of talent in one movie without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor AND Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their prizes, but it would have been perfectly legitimate to see O'Conor (like Young Christie) and McAnally: the clich√© is true: they don't roles, live them. The Day-Lewis performance is a tour de force - a transformation that is frightening, but it was really a sign of the Academy's intelligence that, alongside this performance, they also respected Brenda Fricker's beautifully restrained, still and heartbreaking work like Christie's mother. By the way, if you have not seen this wonderful actor "Swann", this is another movie worth looking at for his contribution (and sublime Miranda Richardson).
