There are only two types of reviews online about this movie. Those who hate it and curse the name of Ralph Baksh and love them and call it generic work. I tend to be in the middle. I'm forced to agree with most of the criticism of this movie (such as the brutal cutting of the story, badly rotoscopic quarries, actors, etc.). Rotoscoping (if it is done properly) adds to the quarries of a lifelike and viable end of the scene is fantastic. Surreal scenes, when ninerider pursues Frodo, are stylish and well-executed and musical result ... magic. Unfortunately, the bad points are compelling movies, but if you can ignore them, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> (Undoubtedly hitting this angry mob who hates this movie after writing it review, ah well, this is life)
