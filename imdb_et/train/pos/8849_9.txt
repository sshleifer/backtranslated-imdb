Hanson's brothers - Andy (apparently his act together) and Hank (obviously not his act together) need money. Andy offers a scheme to get the dough that affects the whole Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This movie offers. It is a layered, full-blooded skateboard that knows exactly what it does. As a criminal / thriller I would happily compare it to the "old men's country". Although both films have enough character drama and excitement, the "devil" is on the thriller side because of its fast pace. "No Country" is a colder and brighter film that can really be admired while the "Devil" is a bit more enjoyable. The devil is definitely less violent than "No Country". Also work. Ethan Hawke, which is sometimes wooden, brings finite Hank, who are twilight, sweat and deer. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the most difficult scenes in the movie and is quickly becoming an actor who believes he can do something. It jumps back and forth without any confusion. The events are spirally controlled, but the film is never - writing (from the first days of Kelly Masterson), leadership (veteran Sidney Lumet) and editing remain as strict as drum. In many categories, this award is caliber, although films such as "The Departed" and "No Country" squeezed it unevenly. If you liked them, you like it.
