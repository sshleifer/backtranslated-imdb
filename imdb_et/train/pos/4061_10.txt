This is the best duble I've ever heard of Disney, and also the best adjustments, because the biggest abuse ever happened to music, themes, characters, Kiki delivery service dialogues. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> It has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the usual heroine. It has both a hero and a heroine (although I really disagree with the use of the hero and heroine here, because Miyazaki is out of the stereotype and common theme). As usual, after Spirited took off, Mononoke surprised, worried about the Fireflies grave and Majo no Takkyuubin deeply touched, this one seems to me a little doubt. I wonder if this is the first Ghibi. Well, finally, just like yesterday and whispering from my heart, I reached 10 ratings. I would give 9.8, but an additional 0.2 is to share a good feeling by encouraging people to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER I see it as a sad movie, people die in it, a lonely robot, an abandoned place and it ends with destruction. Just as humanity cannot really force too much. The collapsing scene gave me the end of the metropolis. It's just sad. The plot is also visible in most reviews and soundtrack rules (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber. People who can bring a movie, game, event to life, even with an amazing moment, with amazing composition. <br /> <br /> This is a good-looking movie that was part of the American cinema on a classic day (it's a great life, etc.). Well, things are changing.
