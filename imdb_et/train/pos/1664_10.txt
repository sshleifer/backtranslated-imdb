I thought this movie was stunning, with great performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi depicts Artemisia in such beautiful, original, but confident ways, his hands mapping the idea before moving his models to a place. The passion that Artemisia gives to her art is just a spectacular look. <br /> <br /> Although each character was not obviously beautiful, it made the film more realistic because the facial hair and clothes were perfect by that time. Overall, I thought this movie was fantastic.
