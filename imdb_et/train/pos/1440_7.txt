I liked the quiet part of the first part, showing Pacino and Cusaki, especially their scenes together. It was a match between mood and old poles and idealistic young people. I want Bridget Fondal to have more scenes in the movie; he was a serious and tempting character. The film passed me along the rails when the mayor's mayor struck the mafiao to get something his boss wouldn't want to confuse him. No one in their right sense would meet the mafioso in an abandoned dock. junkyard. Here the story became unlikely. Something I don't understand: why the policeman and Vito have conquered when the latter gave information that could bring down the corrupt judge?
