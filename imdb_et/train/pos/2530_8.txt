One of the joy of the recent Bela Lugos collection resurrection is to see pleasant movies like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi compete in a film that is different from meteorites and radiation, and if science is completely absurd (especially the camera technique of Karloff, as Janos Rukh uses to locate a meteorite) and downright ridiculous. does not care about the lease, because the film is very enjoyable. Effects are well done, the performance is excellent and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of the 1940s - 50s of cellulose sci-fi comics and novels that are combined with radiant and ridiculous science. You must watch this movie!
