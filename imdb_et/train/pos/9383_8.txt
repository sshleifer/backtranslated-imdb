The film "Last Seduction" and "Kill me again" comes in a new film noir style. John Dahl created a niche by making films about adultery, extortion in the early 1990s. Although I did not have much opinion on the last seduction. But nowadays, Mr Dahl has turned to television program management. It is a shame because he was talented. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ** This is a pretty impressive film that rotates around the trench). to Work in Wyoming City. But he is not happy and will be mistaken if the bar owner J.T Walsh hits a man hit by Texas. He has the task of killing his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to share it without making an advance payment. Upon leaving the city, he accidentally hits a man on the road, who then returns to the local hospital. At this point, Cage meets again with Walsh, who also seems to be a local sheriff. After that, Cage escapes from his clutches, but meets a real blow, which is Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl has written and directed this film. Therefore, it shows that the project can be decent if the director puts his thoughts on the screen. The direction is good, but while watching the movie, I got a TV to know the movie. There were too many busy frames. But this does not prevent the movie from being an enjoyable experience. The film had a good pace and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the script with length. <br /> <br /> Cage represented a real role as a drifter, although for me, his performance seemed somewhat modest. His facial expressions were on the label. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and treated her part perfectly as a femme fatale. Her hairstyle was far away and every guy could go on his knees. Hopper played his part well. But I feel he had failed for this role. He did not convince me that he had the characteristics of a knife. The role was not written with his personality in mind. <br /> <br /> While watching, Deja Vu comes from earlier movies like "The Hot Spot" and "Perfect Murder". Because some areas are similar. In general, if you are a fan of noir films, it is for you. It is worth recommending. 7/10
