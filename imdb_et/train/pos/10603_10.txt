I'm tired of my 4 and 5-year-old daughters who are constantly being watched by Nickelodeon, Disney, and so on. Everything seems to be the same old tired cartoons over and over again. If my daughters did not go fair this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to just relax and rest. I went into the TV and searched for something else, turned the channels. My finger stopped surfing the channel when I heard Harvey's voice. I adore all the individual things that this person has done and when I saw that he makes a voice for a small duck ... well, I couldn't change the channel! My daughters hit the cartoon instantly and the more we looked to show the QUESTION, the more I grew up to love it with the message that was displayed. It may not be a proponent of "gay rights", but rather for anyone who has ever been a child. I had friends who were chosen for one thing or another ... too fat, too skinny, too feminine, bully, not smart enough, just one parent .... you call it! As a rule, children may be very cruel to each other, so I was happy to see an entertaining comic that actually brought LIFE MESSAGE to their audience. My girls already accept others as they are and don't choose others to be different. My older daughter rises up against her friends when they are elected (one is one mother and this little girl is picked up quite often - it warms my heart when Kassie is standing for her!). <Br> So, those of you who condemn this exhibition because you feel it is a "proponent of" the law or are forced to "accept certain positions", you clearly and completely missed the point of this embarrassing little comic book br /> And if you need to explain it .... well, you need more help than any television show.
