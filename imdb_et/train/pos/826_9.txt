I'm sick of the people who are licking Ewoks! True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they won't happen, so deal with it! Besides, they are cute and I don't care if they are marketable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This film always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited about The Phantom Menace because it suddenly focuses on the story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is finally exposed - it would be otherwise unresolved. So think of those of you who complain that the Vader helmet has been removed. It is very effective. Vader, a man who hid behind the mask for 20 years, has finally emerged as a sick-looking man. He's not exactly a machine - he's vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the Managing Director happened to be such good players in New Hope. They all do it well. These are plausible signs. Hamill does an excellent job of developing his dramatic character. Fisher does a good job as a model for a woman (I mean, come! She killed Jabba even when so many others failed!). Harrison Ford - Need I Say More? <br /> <br /> Music is brilliant again. It is so touching and important if you can choose the theme of characters in different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and jumps out to fight your father in the final battle. John Williams is nothing about genius! What an amazing man! <br /> <br /> The film is so much more meaningful to me because of Episode I. I can't wait to see it finally in theaters (CAN I WAIT ???) and then look back at the trilogy. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
