OKAY. There are people who don't see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Don't look at it if you don't like satire or black humor. 2) Don't like when _The Watchmen_ is guilty. 3) Don't look at it if you want a serious superhero movie. <br /> <br /> Rest, run, don't walk to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's peculiar, it's a pleasant sender of every bad superhero clich√© that is known to man. From time to time, younger humor Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller, and Hank Azaria-speaking-in-cheek are having fun with a little fun, as well as a couple of fun-loving parts of Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Good thing that Louise Lasser will work.) I laughed all the time. Totally unpleasant, somewhat weird, but good.
