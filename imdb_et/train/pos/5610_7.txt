Roman Polanski masterfully masters such a variation on the same theme as Repulsion. I can't imagine that one honest filmmaker can't admit Le Locataire's fine director, but both parts of the dynamics may not be satisfactory for most people, I'm involved. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very pleased to feel the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataires), starting soon with self-confidence to gradually become a psychological anxiety that eventually flourishes as an irreversible physical paralysis. The shared challenge of symbols and audiences is really different from the horror and tension of horror movies, because there is no tangible supernatural element. Although horror films allow some catharsis (be it cheap or more complicated), Polanski tortures us sadistically, and when his last opus is dark humor, we are mostly on our nerves, not on the edge of our seats. <br /> <br /> Excitement, horror, all this is a question of playing with the audience's expectations (alternatively cheating and filling them), not literally with people's nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby, there is a much greater achievement because thin paranoia and common rationality are in constant struggle: the story relates to a couple moving in a strange apartment, while we are forced to identify with a unique character. What's more, if the fantasy elements are all in the mind of the hero, the situation is the most inconvenient, because we, the spectators, are forced to judge him, to reject him when we are masterfully attracted ("not" lure the color ") to him.
