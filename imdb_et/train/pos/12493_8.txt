After all, when Hollywood (and Indies) has climbed out, we finally get a movie that offers some scary moments. There are some moments of clich√©s, but I'm not sure it is possible to make a completely original movie today. There's not much new here ... it's just done. <br /> <br /> Make sure and pay attention, because "fine" fears come quickly and often. It's not a movie to watch while eating pizza. <br /> <br /> In this movie, one very well written red herring and, unfortunately, one very poorly cast role. Cheri Christian just doesn't make an effective Julie (wife / mother). First, it is totally atypical. I know, I know ... he's just gone through a traumatic experience. But the viewer never knows him when he is "usually" and his relationship with his wife is rather uncomfortable (involuntarily). I think the director wanted us to have some sympathy for him, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a thumbnail to the end that is both distracting and satisfying. At the beginning of the final credit, it could easily become cheaper with the effect of sound, but the director was wise. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece of any kind, but it is a good, old-fashioned scary movie ... something that is quite rare nowadays.
