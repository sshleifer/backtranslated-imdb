let me say that i love Adam Sandler looking at the dominance over me, paid great attention to his actions when he raises his voice, i can't help but i think lucky gilmore screams at the golf ball then back because Adam Sandler sucks me <br /> <br /> Reign We are a great movie, a movie that starts slowly and awaits emotions in every scene. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a good job and there are absolutely no really great lines here and it's worth in any movie he does. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler was amazing in so many ways, not only was it his most dramatic / best career film. but I remember laughing loudly in many parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting was also great for Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie with tremendous acting beautiful NYC great comedy drama And a new admiration for Adam sandler if you ever doubted him or how confident it is to Don Cheadle
