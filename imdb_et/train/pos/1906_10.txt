Unfortunately, there were 8 simple rules for my teenage girls, the last sitcom that John Ritter was working on in 2003 after his tragic death. He was one of my favorite actresses of all time. She had it all, comedy (who can forget her three companies), but she was also a great dramatic actor (unforgettable? Worth watching a television movie). So much I loved all the other participants in the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was a star, he was the big reason why I was first shown, and that was his perfect comedy that was able to break me every time. <br /> <br /> I loved how the show wasn't all sweet (as far as I loved the Cosby Show, they came too cool to each other), they typically portrayed family dynamics perfectly. It was quite realistic, with the rivalry of all the brothers and the parents, but they still kept it funny. Many American sitcoms are trying to fill samples with morality and not, and this exhibition didn't. Yes, there were some, like solving important issues such as drugs and bullying, but they didn't try to be anything but a fun family comedy. <br /> <br /> How they wrote John's death show was great, I still like a child every time I see it. You could feel how great the emotions were during their incredibly hard episodes. <br /> <br /> I am sad that the show has been canceled, I still have the pleasure to watch, and I never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you always have to remember this fun picture of this protective father who would lock his daughters in his room if he had a boyfriend =) Sa rock Ritter !!!
