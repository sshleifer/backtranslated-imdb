Rather annoying that reviewers compare it to planet Earth ... Course * Planet Earth is better - it has much more to do. Earth is like an expanded trailer on the planet Earth series and as such is inevitably inferior and easier. But this is not similar to a similar one. <br /> <br /> Like a full-length documentary (or indeed the length of the game), it goes far beyond what you see in your entire life (unless you choose to land on long-range cameras in helicopters for years to come and wait for the six most extreme environments to get a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings in the world - which face - is unlikely). <br /> <br /> Talking: Yes, everyone in Britain - very much, including me - adores David Attenborough and has a little excuse for not telling her here, but it deserves to be letters or three. He was not the performer of the planet Earth, but the narrator, and I am sure he is modest and intelligent enough to understand that everything that is more of a viewer is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Everyone who sees it is overwhelmed by its awe, greatness and glory. All reviewers agree. Those who love it (ie. All) must / should go to see the planet Earth. So three praise for your cinema and a big boooo for everyone who is cheap enough to buy it on a DVD, not in the Planet Earth box. But as works of art, they are not competing with people here. <br /> <br /> Earth is big enough for both.
