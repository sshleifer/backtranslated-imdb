Reading various external evaluations by Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this movie, although I only have this dubbed Japanese video version. <br /> <br /> Obviously, many critics seem to be taking this as a disadvantage that the story has been used before, most well in the great "It's a wonderful life". For me, the great prerequisite is a great prerequisite, no matter how many times it is used, and I would be happy to see more films with this particular premise - a dissatisfied man who gets a chance to get a new perspective on his life through "divine magic". <br /> <br /> I think people with intellectual curves and critics aren't drawn into the story, but I'm not in the movies to criticize the laptop - I'm going to the movies to throw myself at them and let them go there. <br /> <br /> If you are sentimental sorting like me, you can see this picture. The performances are very good and the film was very well cast. Also a great music choice. Michael Caine is great as a sympathetic bartender. Jim Belushi is doing a good job as an "average Joe" guy who wonders if his life is not as it should. Linda Hamilton, always great, is here here as a loving woman. Jon Lovitz amused as usual and even "Mr. Destiny" is even surprisingly moving moments. <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a wonderful life," but who says he must be? According to him, Mr. Destiny is an enjoyable, well-made, funny and moving film. I've seen my Japanese dubbed video several times and I'm sure I'll see it a few more times. If it would otherwise make me "low", be it! I'm just glad that before I saw it, I hadn't read any comments about Mr. Destiny. but I could not question myself after reading all the critical comments!
