Mitchell was the fifth director of Leisen, and she shows her versatility in directing music, and after her previous films, there were some serious dramas. He also plays as a master conductor. <br /> <br /> You can say that this is a pre-code movie, and something like that wasn't done in the US for some time (like 30+ years). Leisen released musical numbers to make them look like spectators - there are no widescreen techniques or Busby Berkeley. What I find it funny or interesting is that you don't see the viewer at all. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, leaders are quite characteristic and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan are playing their usual movie characters. Gertrude Michael, however, gives some sparks. Musical numbers are interesting and some good (especially rape rape is fun), but drama is not convincing and fake - three murders are too many and have too many minimal emotional effects on characters. This is where this film could have been much better.
