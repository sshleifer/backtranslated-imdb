When I saw it as a child, it answered all my questions and scattered all the fears or misconceptions I had. It's easy to see because it's animated, making it cautious. It has no moral or "preaching" aspect, so no one should resist it. This is a pleasant film that simply gives the menstrual facts in a soothing, "factual" exchange. I hope to show it to my daughter.
