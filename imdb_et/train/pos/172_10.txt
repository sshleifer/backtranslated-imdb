I saw this movie in the middle of comedy a couple of times. This movie was pretty good. This is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is arranged to marry the King of the Oder, so that the US will have a military base to balance the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate". I also loved the end topic. It gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten had my rating for this movie.
