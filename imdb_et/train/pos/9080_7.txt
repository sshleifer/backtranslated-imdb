Maybe I need to look into my head, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. CG is not too bad. I've seen the appearance of the worse beings (and the creatures I mean the good and the bad snake) pretty cool. Snakes-related scenes were really good, I thought sometimes the logic is outdated and the story doesn't always make sense. But it is much worse for the creature function. other creatures looked up from other movies, so it's not entirely original. I think the main content of the story is original, although it is a bit like Godzilla (a great American version of the budget) that I liked. I like this movie so much, but I still say it was pretty good. I liked the music too.all all I think Dragon Wars is about 7/10
