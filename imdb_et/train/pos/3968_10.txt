I saw this movie for the first time at a young age and recently bought it from a DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brings Chip Hardesty, a hardworking and dedicated FBI agent. His life on the board is related to his family life, which is not all rosy. His wife (the great imagination of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of her work, and they even spend time; Chip's best friend and fellow Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a bomb attack; Chip's son, Mike, is a Navy during World War II. Through this, the family continues its bravery and dignity. <br /> <br /> The sequences are quite exciting and the half-documentary style of the movie works effectively. And Max Steiner's music says it all; loyalty, courage and integrity. This country owes much to the FBI men and women, and yes to Mr Edgar Hoover. If Mr Hoover's vigilance had been observed, we would have been able to get rid of 9 September, crimes against children and many persuasive politicians who we have to do after passing.
