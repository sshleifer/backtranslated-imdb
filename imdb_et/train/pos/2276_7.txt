If you've read the mother's evening and enjoyed it so much (as I did) that you just see the movie, realize that you need to understand the main element of Vonngut's article - that his story is from Vonnegut himself and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. His whore and humor cannot be staged simply by the scenario or even the best exhibitions. I believe that this film outstrips the fundamental issues raised by Vonnegut in his book, but the frequent cyrillic moments on this page are not displayed on the satire. Does that mean the film was left unmarked? Of course not. I think the film will succeed because it does not try to read the book's reading experience again (it is not the media if they are too lazy to change the page). It succeeds because it builds on the basic elements of a story created by a true American artistic treasure and presents it without a pretentious framework. I've seen other versions of the movie in Vonnegut's books, where the director is probably trying to steer Vonnegut's brilliant channel and lose his own craft. I wouldn't put this movie in one of the best I've seen, but it stands on my feet, like what's worth seeing. Taking the "voice" movie out of narration or trying to add it, Ema Eve will tell her story perfectly and will keep the basic lessons of the story without any confusion, distraction or disappointment.
