Moe and Larry are newly-controlled spouses who married Shemp's demanding sisters. In her music studio, Shemp learns to suppress her fortune when she marries someone else! <br /> <br /> Husbands Beware is a remake of the 1947 Brideless Groom, which many consider to be one of Stooge's best films. Transformation contains most of the material from this film. The new scenes, shot on May 17, 1955, include the Moe and Larry events that marry the Shemps sisters, and their cooking with tertin, which is gently turpentine! There are also a couple of new scenes at the end of the movie (Dee Green used twice as if you were blinking, the monthly appearance would be out.) <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" would have done a good movie with only girls marrying. Budget-related considerations, along with the decline in the number of lesser comedies, had an impact on the use of older film material. <br /> <br /> Although Stooges still made completely new movies, most of their releases were in 1955-56. It consists of older films with a few new scenes. "Men hold," when one of these hybrids is observable and entertaining; we see most of the "bridesmaid groom" again and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer to the movie. This film is one of the latest Stooge comedies that offer Shempt's new material, and it appeared six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
