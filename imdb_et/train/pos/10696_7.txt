Every time I see Nicole, she likes more. I love such a movie. A woman you just don't give, but she's breaking your heart. The first movie I remember was like the version of The Human Bondage, Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey. The right beef in the Russian language spoken in this film is small, it was good enough to fool me or someone who can't speak Russian, I'm sure. It's funny how people don't leave this point. No-goodnik Russian boys were also well cast. Finally, I have to drop my hat on Ben Chaplin, as someone else said he was playing with great dignity, and there was definitely no heat between him and Nicole. I think the boys will be rewarded for this.
