I've just finished listening to the comments of the director of this movie, and I think one of the great things I got from it is that this movie, like Mann's The Insider, is completely subjective. This is Howard POV. So, any comment or attempt to think about how Ebert did this is actually Nolte in reality. If you feel like he did, "The movie doesn't work," you say I think Howard won't work. Frankly, you may be right. Howard's thinking and personality really do not correspond to professional mental treatment and analysis. <br /> <br /> Hey, it's human nature. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
