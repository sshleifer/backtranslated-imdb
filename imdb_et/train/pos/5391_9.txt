Life begins - and ends - at a typical maternity and recovery department of the 1930s, where we watch 48 hours in the lives of many high-risk pregnant women played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em ???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree and Gloria Shea as they are waiting for delivery. Although the film has plot devices that seem far beyond today, when pregnancy and childbirth are much more controlled and more limited, it gives us time to see what birth in 1932 was like a grandmother and a big hospital in a conventional hospital. grandmothers. I found the film to be exciting and exceptionally touching. What an actor! For the first time Dad, Jed is a paralyzed and restless hospital worker who seems to brush his worries on his wife because they can brush crumbs off the coffee table. I was very concerned about her. I'd like to see more of this actor's work. He had a very emotional voice accustomed to an unforgettable effect. In this movie, Eric played a young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who cried "Don't Cut! Don't Cut!" like Scarlett escaped from the hospital in horror. Cooling! Another great show is Aline MacMahon, the sister of Miss Bowers. His character is the type of salt that we all hope to receive during the stay in the hospital, which constantly interrupts hospital rules to show a more humane side in medicine. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young has also made another great show here, with very authentic and deeply sensitive achievements like Grace. For me, she's great in these precursors, I've really grown to appreciate her more than an actor in the last few months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played a role in the shrill of an unwanted mother just over the top of my taste (did anyone know in 1932 that a hot water bottle brand could be dangerous to the unborn child's health?) but its character will eventually recover. <br /> <br /> Gilbert Roland, a silent film star, was mourning as a mourning Italian spouse. His screen time was short but remarkable. <br /> <br /> The start of life is a must-see code, sometimes try to catch it on TCM, but remember to bring a few purchases. 9 out of 10
