This movie is the first of six notorious guinea pig films and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the film is fake. The story speaks of a woman who has been caught and tortured in many different ways. The man at the beginning of the story receives a letter that has no feedback and contains a manga video that shows torture. The men who catch her will test the boundaries of the man before they die. Some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking, as the girl strikes 100 times because you can see shocks in almost every movie. There is a lot of gore in this film to recommend to people aged 17 or older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
