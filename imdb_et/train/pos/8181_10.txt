Doctor Feinstone is a dentist. She has a beautiful woman and a big house with a pool. He discovers that his wife is preparing a basin transmitter - he realizes that everything is clean behind decay. ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant because the dentist has retreated - he is completely plausible.It is surprisingly a little gore, but the teeth of torture scenes are quite disgusting and grotesque. Highly recommended.
