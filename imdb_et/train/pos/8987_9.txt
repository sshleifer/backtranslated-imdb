Recently I rented this document, having remembered listening to it on IMDb.com and I was interested in this space. I knew very little about these ensembles, but I remember Dandy Warhols' age and I enjoyed hearing "Not if you were the last junkie on earth". That said, this is my perspective in the document: <br /> <br /> One thing I believed about this movie is that there is no prior knowledge of any of these bands. Director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste time on engaging the audience and getting to know the people of this movie. I quickly got to Anton and Courtney, as well as their respective ensembles, Brian Jonestown's massacre and Dandy Warholes. I think it's part of what makes this document so good and what makes Ondi Timoner such a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I also loved the "story" of these bands. Most of what you see are tours. Both bands start playing small places and fight in the field of recording. Throughout the film, each band tries to remain unique and uncontrollable. But this is what makes the two bands alike and therefore a brilliant perspective on how two interlining bands can go in such different directions. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it in principle to anyone who loves the movie in general. You don't have to have special love for a documentary or any ensemble. Music evaluation helps, but the music itself takes back the relationship between Brian Jonestown's massacre and Dandy Warhol.
