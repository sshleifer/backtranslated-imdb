The night listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat strange but very different movie. I can assure you that you have never seen such a movie ever. Some people may not like the slow pace of this movie, but I think it's a big plus for the movie. Certainly, this is one of the top films of 2006, which is a film of outstanding performance with great content, a dramatic feeling. It's not an American movie. Nor is it a predictable film. You just feel that it is a movie that has secrets that you find difficult to determine. It's not a great movie with everything but hell, it's a fucking good and very original movie.
