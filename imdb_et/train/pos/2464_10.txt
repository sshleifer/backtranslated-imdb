One of the best movie-dramas I've ever seen. We work a lot in the Church and can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that participants can do in their work. I recommend this especially, especially for those interested in acting like "must see". There are several notes. First, the graveyard scene where Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows the scene is just going to be in primary school), and his communication with the skull was very well done. The logic used in this scene was enormous - I think Shakespeare will be given more evidence than anything else. For the second time, I enjoyed this scene where the character played by Hamlet, Horatio and Robin Williams discussed the upcoming duel.
