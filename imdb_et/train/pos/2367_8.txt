I couldn't show it under the direction of this movie. Dialogue and costumes are most easily associated with soft core porn. In such a case, it is expedient to use a primer for a vehicle that is not for sex but for nunchuk. (Maybe also for sex, but not for Indian TV.) <br /> <br /> I was unable to place Jeff Wincot as a fan of the genre and there was no point to look for it. Only once, when Brigitte Nielsen sold her Beverly Hills Cop II monument in her futuristic sister coif (so mayor), I made a positive ID about her. <br /> <br /> This movie has no doubt that entertainer or papal Schlock Ã  la Paul Verhoeven will entertain in the early 90's. Can we add "so bad, good" to the genre label?
