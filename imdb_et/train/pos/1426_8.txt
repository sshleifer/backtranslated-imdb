I have to say that sometimes "look" is all that is important, as Jeremy Clarkson has pointed out on the BBC (not on our land, but it is still right). <br /> <br /> And when it comes to this movie, it's an incredibly stunning beauty that you love what your eyes see. <br /> <br /> Then the film's personality, interesting, fascinating narrator's voice and narrative stories that touch your soul when you watch these superbly filmed images. <br /> <br /> The film is unlikely to affect your lifestyle by destroying these beauty, but it will certainly remind you of how worthy our country lives in. This film deserves 10 stars because it is one of the few stylistic documentaries I really enjoyed .
