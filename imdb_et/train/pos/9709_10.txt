First of all, I accidentally shook TV over waching overnight at LoG: I've never had an episode ever since. <br /> <br /> This humor is very strange, like a cross from Brass Eye's social commentary, a super-lined one-liner and an amazing plot that seems to be evolving every week without ever having to go anywhere. The best example of this was Hillary's special stuff - what was it all about? <br /> <br /> Humor doesn't like everyone. Some say it's too sick and it's easy to see where they come from. However, try it. If you don't like it, don't look at it, but if you like it, you're very glad you took my advice.
