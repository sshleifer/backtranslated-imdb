This superb film is based on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of its form - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are completely at home in a story that Billy Wilder probably gave. I would like to know more about how much he was doing this because it is an exceptionally smart variation on a sterile master / fertile servant stage - an almost allegory of the entertainment industry run by dried bullies, but made by a lively art and gaming world used by nobles and non-WASP used subclass. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and film in the US, it is not difficult to see this film as a prophetic view.
