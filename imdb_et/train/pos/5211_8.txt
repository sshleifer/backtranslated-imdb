From their disgraceful divorce from the Disney Company (with Disney who holds the Miramax brand), it seems that Weinstein Company specializes in medium-sized movies that few have then underestimated and seen. FLOCK is a great example. <br /> <br /> The story of public officials who have been working with a criminal to track registered sex offenders, this picture speaks more about sex offenders than the entire law and season Order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere gives his best result when the task is worn. Claire Danes once has the chance to get a solid role (instead of the usual spam) and he does the best for a beginner. Cinematography, tempo, editing, all this is first-rate --- and I did not see any trace of a shift-off camera or excessive camera flicker that others complained about. The topic is restrained, but it is still a harsh subject and may be ill. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago, there was almost no problem with the types of sexual crimes that have been shown to be shocking even jaded. Then the Supreme Court rulings, which simultaneously linked the police to the "rights" of sexual exchanges, and America became a buyer paradise for sexual perversion, both ready and unwanted. All of these steps met with Liberal praise, celebrating Warren Court's bad deeds with glossy coatings over time and Newsweek. Daily liberals also praised the court and mocked those who disagreed. How many Americans know that pornography, which represents violent violence and torture of young women, can be ordered in 2007, then the US post office will be paid with discount periods. Just one part of the problem - a problem that can hide someone's family from splitting. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a liberal but he does his best here. Perhaps he has received a measure of wisdom during his maturity.
