I hit this movie from IFC and enjoyed it, although I felt the editing was a bit tough, although it may be intentional. It was a bit difficult for me to figure out what was going on at first, because they seemed to go a little bit of a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear plot presentation. However, it seemed a little forced. I definitely think it's worth a look at the movie, but I think it could have been a little cleaning. Some scenes do not seem to have a meaningful meaning. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see the rating as low as it is. It's not prominent, but it doesn't really have any serious problems. I gave him 7/10. The film showed at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants. They just had to say he didn't want to be in Matrix movies.
