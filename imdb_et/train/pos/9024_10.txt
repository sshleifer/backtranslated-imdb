Five years after Tenko's survivors return home and Marion's double-edged "Well this is". <br /> <br /> This is now the time of the 1950s reunion. Gang is all here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica and Latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that comes up is beauty: as perfectly written and acted and thought-provoking and touching as the original series. <br /> <br /> All questions at the end of the series are well answered here. From the Marion family to the Jossi health center, everything has changed over the last five years, not everything has become the best. <br /> <br /> The trip to the Dominica plant brings many shocks and some really extreme aspects. seat tension. It is a real tragedy and a disaster, because fate is over and women are fighting for their lives. Finally, Dominica shows her true colors and there are some drama moments in the drama. <br /> <br /> The location of Lush filming in Singapore and the chance to reach a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It's so shame that it's really the end. I can look at it again. Perfection.
