I missed almost the whole first season, but when the other shows went around, I started to watch. I had finally bought the whole first season out of iTunes. This is now one of my favorite music. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor is on me all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes Little Russell goes a long way. I enjoy more majority members (but don't say he doesn't show this exhibition). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you haven't checked it out, try it. If you get an episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good this show is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series is long-lasting.
