Every time you think you have a Deathtrap handle, there is another twist on the plot. It is best to just sit and enjoy it. Most of the above-mentioned kisses between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which, unfortunately, were cut from the television version I saw), this movie is still much recommended. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. As a successful playwright, his latest several examples have flopped from Broadway. And although his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon), is nothing but supportive, both in financial and emotional terms, Sidney does not do much better. To add insult to injury, the young playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) just sent Sidney to play. This is Anderson's first and Sidney sees a young man as a talented writer. He jokes with his wife that he should call Anderson, kill and play the game. He laughs at him at first, but when Sidney actually calls Anderson for dinner, he worries that he can really put his scheme into practice. And his fears may be justified ... <br /> <br /> This is a great script. The whole plot is twisted and reversible, and they get faster and fiercer when you get closer to the end. It's a movie that's on the edge of your seat from the start and keeps you all the time. An absolute temporary and mysterious masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Actress is great. Caine delivers its usual excellent performance and is challenged to play cultured, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an excellent picture of a man who is almost as wide-eyed or innocent as he seems. Cannon's Frenzy works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a nice performance as a ridiculous neighbor who is also psychic. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you never expect to end up with, and repetitive views will help you take away your views faster. An unknown classic that is unfortunately remembered only for a scene that felt somewhat over time, and that is a real shame.
