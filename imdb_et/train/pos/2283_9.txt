I have not read Kurt Vonnegut's book yet, but I know some of his other work and I was interested in how it translated into the screen. In general, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It concerns an American who lives in Germany and is recruited as a US spy. His mission is to attract himself to high-level Nazis and send American secret messages through his weekly radio program. But when the war ends, he will be condemned as a war criminal, but will flee to New York, where unexpectedly awaits a lot of strange parcels. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem on the evening, it's usually too sentimental. But for most movies, Schmaltz is kept to a minimum and a very strange plot is carried out with skill and aplomb. And there are some fabulous black comedies that include the three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and the highly-respected Nazis in prison. Highly recommended.
