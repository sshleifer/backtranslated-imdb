This is such a fantastic movie, west, associated with a self-afflicted person (Jimmy Stewart) who goes to gold for Klondike. On the way, he gets the local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a terrible bad result) he's doing back. McIntire threatens to be a dead man if he ever returns to his city, which is unfortunately the only way back to the countries. The main part of the story is the peaceful town of Klondike from Dawson, where new residents are turned back from McIntire. For example, Ruth Roman, who has come with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a salon (Hollywood front-runner) and tries to run the city's restaurant and venue. He also paves the way for McIntire and his gons. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the western genres of Naked Spur. The distance is only the smallest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made this movie so special, without of course feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, Far Country is a beautiful, on-site cinematography. The landscape is proud. Stewart performs one of the best performances (almost equal to his greatest success in 1954, the rear window). I think it could be considered a clich√© when he starts a selfish loner and learns how such existence ends. However, Stewart plays it so damn well, makes his character very human. And supportive performances are generally fantastic. In addition to those I mentioned, the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I should also bring out Walter Brennen. He seems to specialize in playing the best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching because he is the only character in the beginning who can bring mankind to the cynical person. The scenario is very well written and the Mani direction is perfect. Masterpiece. 10/10.
