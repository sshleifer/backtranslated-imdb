In the spring of 2002, The Rookie, Disney's live action movie, appeared to be the "best for last !!!!!" It happened here in Texas! In fact, the story began in West Texas, as evidenced by the regional code found on the sign there. It was about a high school coach who was so convincing with his high-level baseball team that he decided to go professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: It was so nice !!! !! It was a very good sports film, the area of ​​The Mighty Ducks trilogy. It was also taken over by Texas filmmakers, somewhere between Panhandle and El Paso to Metroplex (where I live). I can say because I know this ballpark (was "Ballpark in Arlington;" is now "Ameriquest Field")! It was nice to see Disney's "Golden Age" ending in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Disney's Golden Time <br /> <br /> 1920s -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with the mouse ... and it ended with baseball. " (sobs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
