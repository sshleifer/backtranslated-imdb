Be that movie, as I said, but you must definitely watch it. It's about two boys Mac and Sam who are big friends and work as fashion photographers, and the laugh begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts getting acquainted with 3 air partners while leaving his wife suspicious. Sam achieves happiness and forgets his friend, but not completely. But Mac thinks he's going to get acquainted with the hosts. every stage of the movie is garam masala, the songs are rock but nothing is missing. Comedy hasn't reached the mark and deserves a prize. Its nice but not all that great. Some people laughed until their stomachs hurt, but it doesn't deserve many laughs. But, of course, everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to watch this movie, you can do it.
