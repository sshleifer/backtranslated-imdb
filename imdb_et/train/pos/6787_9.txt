I stumbled this TCM late last night. <br /> <br /> It hadn't been seen because it had originally come out but had never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> I had completely forgotten how wonderful and talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young, for dithto Shelly Winters before she brought her out of the balloon. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman was, however, the main actor of his time in the country - I had read Othello in high school in English - and HATED it. After seeing "Double Life" I read it again and finally realized what the game was. <br /> <br /> The Gordon / Kanin writing team was the highest in making this script - <br /> <br /> A movie worth remembering and rewriting
