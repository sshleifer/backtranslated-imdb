The "Opening Night", published in 1977, seeks to be ambitious. It only succeeds in genuinely stunning Gena Rowlands. The character of his actor, Myrtle, is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. He is self-absorbing, often unpleasant, and makes life unhappy for the people around him - in other words, unlike some of the actors! Myrtle is also a woman on the brink of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she fights with are real or imaginative, even though we are early secret. Rowlands is obviously well loved by his talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also plays a role in the film. This movie is not without errors - it is too long and the last part of the movie, where Myrtle goes on stage, very drunk seems very drunk. Some "improvisation" of the dialogue - at least when it is on stage - goes too long. Some supportive characters have good results, especially Ben Gazarra, who play Myrtle's fool. Joan Blondell's character has never been fully developed and I never understood why he was in the movie except for Myrtle. Look at this movie only for Rowlands - it's an exciting collection - and it's hard to take your eyes off, though you want at times.
