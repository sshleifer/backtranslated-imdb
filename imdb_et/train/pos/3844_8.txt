If you read the summary of this movie, you may think that this is a strange film and in some ways is the primary character of this film with the vision and hallucination of Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé). Vision Gerard sees all (less or less) subtle clues about what happens to him when the story continues and it is fun for the viewer to try to figure out the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of insignia and a few suggestions to complete the film, the film retains great excitement and cannot be boring in one minute. This is mainly due to the great performance of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of Paul Verhoeven. His leadership style is clearly visible and can be said from a different perspective that De Vierde Man is a typical Verhoeven film. It doesn't seem to be typical for people who know their American movies because of nudity and graphical violent scenes, but it also seems typical for people who know their Dutch movies because the same things and talent are a great story. When people look at Verhoevens American movies, short-sighted people can say that they don't have a good talent for talent and focus only on blood and gender. Some people think this, but I think he is a very talented director who is trying to convey a deeper message about each film. Although Hollow Man (his last American film) is not a good movie, Verhoeven is an example of how he can do more than science fiction filmmakers and maybe companies should trust more and offer him more films. He needs it. Just look at your Dutch movies. Not only do they show that they need some freedom, but also show that they have a significant talent. De Vierde Man took him one step closer to Hollywood and is definitely one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
