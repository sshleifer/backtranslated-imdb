I didn't look at the movie before it was first viewed, as it was part of a recently purchased Welles box set. The box I got mainly because I wanted to have A Man For All Seasons and also to reassess Waterloo. So I have to play Orson and Rita and I have been treated equally with class and confusion. <br /> <br /> The story seemed simple, the man meets a great woman and rescues him from a couple of criminals, they immediately click and the man recruits his wife and his famous lawyer cruise, and then ............ <br /> <br /> ..This will become a mystery of murder drawn by fate and a lot of shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) himself does not really know what is going on, he is both confused and a spectator, and it is wonderful to watch because he is pulled up in the movie quite a bit. Probably the heartbeats are pulled by the beauty femme fatale like Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth), but you just know that things are going to be pear-shaped. <br /> <br /> With so many wonderful things in the movie, it is a visual visual style everywhere, see that there is a scene in the aquarium that is wonderful, and the fun of the end of the house is majestic. O'Hara's narration is cheerfully self-evident, and we get good light with a case in which Everett Sloane illuminates procedures considerably. <br /> <br /> But the movie is strange and it really is an uncomfortable viewing experience because {as I learned after that} studio bosses cut the movie for quite a whole hour and it's not just frustrating for us, but unfair to Welles's vision in relation to. I am positive that the complete original cutting of this movie would have been a commendable and respectable wholesale, because we have a very good and intriguing film, which is unfortunately just a clue of greatness, but it is still a strange film I am glad to yet to look again. 8.5 / 10
