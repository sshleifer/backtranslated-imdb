I love this movie, but music at all alumni gatherings is just stupid. <br /> <br /> A fatal game took place in 1972. This means that the main characters have finished in 1972. Dances etc. originate from the early 1950s and early 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having just attended my 30th high school meeting, I can assure you that the latest music played by former high school friends or dancers is the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it is to find relevant music from the 1970s - we all know what an empty time is musically. However, it was not completely lost and the film producers should have taken more care. I found these dance scenes to stop my otherwise unwanted belief in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> It was a bad director and / or manufacturer's decision.
