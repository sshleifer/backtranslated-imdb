It's one of those few Christmass for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that money is not enough, so he rents to a family who lives where he thought his family did. OKAY? This is a very small high school soap, PG-13, but the small sex sources are comedy, so if your child can't handle them, they can't live in the real world. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a hunk and traditionally walks through this fun, OMG, remember if we did ..., a piece of the band, as if it were at the end of some neuroinfective disease. But this is OK, because even this old Oracle hopes that if Ben is well proportioned, we still have hope. Luckily, the rest of the ensembles - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfin, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - enjoy the fun, comfort and warmth of the Shadow-Ozzie-and-Harriet Christmas. br /> <br /> This movie is one that can jump and get popcorn, and when you get back, everyone wants to back it up to show you what you forgot. <br /> <br /> This is a happy movie, after all, and it gives you a good feel for life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There is really something for everyone.
