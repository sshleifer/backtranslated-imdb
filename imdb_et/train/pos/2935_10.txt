Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the most fun thing you will ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I decide that you will decide that Delirious is a fun movie ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 min., And all this time was barely a moment when I didn't laugh. You're laughing for hours when it's over, repeating strokes over and over with your head. Eddie Murphy has given so many funny performances during her career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.) but it is by far her most important moment. I've seen this movie so many times and it's fun every time. It never loses its edge. From that day on, Delirious emulates every major challenge. ***** and two thumbs up!
