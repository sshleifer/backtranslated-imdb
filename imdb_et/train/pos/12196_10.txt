Orson Welles succeeds in knocking my ass with my vision. The Shanghai woman is at the same level as her other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Evil Touch, Trial and Chimes at Midnight. Sometimes the plot can be confusing and sometimes it seems too moving too fast (about an hour after the tests were badly done). But that doesn't matter. You can't watch Welles movies and put too much on the plot. His direction determines what the great direction is. Almost all of the scenes in this movie can stick to any other scene he directed. Check the scene in the courtroom. Typically, they are such stock scenes that I can't hold on to. Note, try to sit near the end of Welles' own speech at the end of Compulsion. In Lady, Shanghai, just pay attention to the detail of this courthouse. Watch this jury who always sneezes and stops the procedure. Or just look at the lighting of this scene. I know it's just a simple Venetian blind, and it was used consistently in the era of film folks and criminal films, but Welles gives it all its beauty. Dialogue is also significant. Welles had the skill, no one else knew to make a crime film that included examples of greatest poetry. Regardless of whether he spoke to Shakespeare or struck hard boiled lines, he had the right to stir the soul. 10/10.
