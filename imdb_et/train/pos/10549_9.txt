I just saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it will be widely released because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven film, and Andrew and David are more than a task. It is possible that some plot discussions are considered spoilers, so I just say that the story is clever, the actor is great and the effect is amazing. Well filmed and well worked. One of the best films I've ever seen, and very refreshing this summer's harsh <br /> <br /> movies. It was the audience's smile all the time. See if you can. (I especially liked the "Candy bar! Candy bar!" Scene.)
