Imagine that this is hampered by the bureaucracy that one person spends 8 years of his life and has a mental breakthrough that tries to resolve the mass destruction in practice! The murder technique is clear, but a government that does not want to admit the truth will let the monster destroy dozens of lives. When I think my work is stressful, I just remember the real story of this miracle. The main character's commitment to commitment was masterfully illustrated by Rea. The comic (and almost tragic) relationship between the Role and the character of Sutherland changed this favorite film of the last 5 years. One of the worst massacres of mass murderers in history was at the edge of my seat. Although it was not nearly as well advertised and spoken as "Silence of Lamb", the plot was just as tense.
