The film begins with Vincent Price to start his performance as a magician. But in the middle of a very successful show, the police have come and closed. His old boss seemed to have judged him - even the ones he did at home. As a result, the price rightly kills the evil person. The problem is that although the viewer realized why the price was killed and probably thought it was a good thing, because the price was a little crazy, he couldn't just stop (like Lay's potato chips). <br /> <br /> The film was full of very creative and remarkable magical tricks (including big round saws and crematorium exhibitions), excellent twisting and exciting action. One thing you can't say about this movie is that it's boring. Although it is far from fine, it is fun all the time, although it's worth checking out. <br /> <br /> If I had never seen Vincent Price version HOUSE OF WAX, I would have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN and threw it at 8 or 9. This is because while MAD MAGICIAN is a great movie, it reminds me very much a movie that preceded it (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since the HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula remained on the film. Both were made in 3-D, both have a plot where the price is all legitimate to kill, but he can't stop when he's done first and both are very fun to watch. The biggest difference and little is that the HOUSE OF WAX was colorful and was more of a horror film and MAD MAGICIAN was definitely a mystery. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to see this movie AND HOUSE (price version only). They are both terrible horror films of the 1950s.
