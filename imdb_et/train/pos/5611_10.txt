I saw this movie when I was playing with the idea of ​​moving to my apartment and starting my life. Maybe I took it so seriously. I fully believed that Paris had permanent construction sites, dust, dirty, selfishness, rude, malicious, and degrading poor psychological degradation. I give all the credit to Polanski's artistry towards him, his playing and his inevitable script, but I lost a terrible final scene, and the cognac must refresh it at the theater organizer. For me, my life was not as catastrophic as it was (so far), but I have always respected an artist who is capable of performing such illusions and trying to pass such a complete dive (fake) reality. Simply put, the man is the first-order genius and the credit for the human race. This film is the sum of many of the many big action and high casting cases. Since some of the performances took place in English (including the scenes of Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski duplicated in English and French, I strongly recommend bilingual to switch from French to English and vice versa , during suitable scenes, when you watch great transmissions on Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski's "apartment house trilogy", which includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" has still not made a proper DVD broadcast in the region 1. Needless to say, these three movies would make a great box.
