The third and final film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. This is a political film more than ordinary entertainment. Finally, Jason Bourne knows who he was, and he discovers and remembers the torture he was given to kill his old identity: he really killed one who got him dead. Ultimately, the film shows that all this was organized and planned by the CIA under the Blackfriars program, which is also clearly outlined in this film, with the aim of eliminating all American citizens who tried to obstruct the whole society by established and established society. a limited group of people. Who was one of the main CIA officials until 1980 when he became vice president? It is related to what is said on the Internet. Then the truth comes to Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who can bring this truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision about the CIA is the woman and the woman gets an investigation involving the Senate. Woman and Senate; read my lips. In the United States, politics in the media are fighting, and two media are important for each presidential campaign: music and cinema. At present, Hollywood and outside of intelligence, academia and intellectuals are using cinema in general and this film in particular to create the public idea that salvation is from a woman and a senate. So go and see the movie. It's a lot of fun and has an end-of-end smell and big changes that some are waiting for and others are waiting for, but no one can pretend it doesn't come: the only thing to know is how deep and serious it is. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
