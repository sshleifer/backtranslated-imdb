Great. I thought initially that Amrita Pritam's communist slope and dr. The Dwived nationalist film is more recent, but when I read the novel I was surprised that it was the opposite. <br /> <br /> Kudos to marita Pritam that he is not pseudo-sec and Dr Dwived objective. This film touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way. Every war is a disaster for women, as some poets said, and this film personalizes it. It is also a sad comment on the Hindu psyche because they cannot resist the kidnappers of those girls or the Hindu brother who can only burn their tormentors. On the other hand, it also shows the economic corner behind the partition or actually why the girls were abducted. I think that the kidnappers thought that by kidnapping the girls they would become the owners of the legal owners and thus the new governments. can't ask them to send the houses back. Moreover, it must welcome the courage of Puro and his Bhabhi characters who are two simple village girls who have come out of the outside world and are risking everyone because they are disappointed. Because there are many documented cases where such women were not accepted by their families in India. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women.
