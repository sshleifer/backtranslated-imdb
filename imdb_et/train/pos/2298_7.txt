I love the occult horror, and the great British Hammer Studios, who gave one of their biggest films, The Devil Rides Out (1968), are more than capable in this horror. This hidden decade episode of the Hammer House of Horror (1980), "The Gun Guard", is a terrible entrance to the series. Head Don Sharp, who had previously enriched Hammer's work with "Vampire Kiss" (1963) and "Rasputin: Mad Monk" (1966) and also directed two "Fu Machu" films starring Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly one of the HHH directors names and it also offers here. An antique dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles upon a mysterious old glass of glass. Glowing Glass is the object of the desire of a devil-worshiping cult who wants to use it for his satanic rites. When she hides a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who has to be sacrificed in culture, Michael gets into a deeper problem with the cult and their unhappy leader (John Carson) ... Although this is not my absolute "Hammer House of Horror" favorite episodes (best is clearly a great seventh episode, "Silent Scream"), it is very horrible and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting twists, and it remains intense and unpleasant throughout the film. Ray Lonnen is good at leadership, young Rosaly Landor is convincing as innocent beauty, and John Carson is really horrible as a satanist leader. All in all, the "abyss guard" is another interesting and horrible story of HHH and my companions Hammer fans should not miss it.
