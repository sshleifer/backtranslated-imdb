This is a big, ridiculous horror film that captures the essence of the supposed metamorphic music from the mid-80s to the end of detention. I remember the boy I was a metal teenager. It doesn't help me to find a ten-year-old dead grave in my home town cemetery. It turns out that this strange metal boy had dug some old bodies and used his bones for some strange sacrifice to Satan. So maybe the things that inhibited me for a while, but I love it now, at the age of 24. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD that was used for 6 bucks, and I was expecting it to suck because of the flat cover, but to the surprise he decided. It concerns the extreme demonic power of the metal. And you have to love a scene where the guitar lets the lazy and evaporate the crowd of the crowd. This movie is fantastic if you love 80s metal and bad movies, that's for you. 9/10!
