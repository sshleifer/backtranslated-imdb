Was Morgan Freeman more unusual than God than George Burns? This movie was definitely better than it was, "Oh, God". I was completely engrossed and LMAO all the time. Carrey was perfect because he was not an anchorman of his kind, and Aniston wore his usual well-played game as a disappointed girl. I, one, do not consider him as ugly or unpretentious. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened the file cabinet, I thought he could never keep his life history. See if you can see a file in your suitcase that keeps your bathroom humorous. Well-written and even better display, this comedy goes to one of the most funny things.
