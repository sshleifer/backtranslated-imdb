It was the most visually stunning, touching, amazing and incredible story I've ever experienced. Frankly, even these adjectives cannot describe it. I just can't choose one scene that looked out for me. I think if I had to list some, this firefighter's reaction would crash the jumping victims; the reaction of people involved in the lift, who did not know what was going on when they finally appeared in a terrible place; shock and disbelief of spectators; and finally silence. <br /> <br /> This day, and even now, is reminded of Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says, "I felt a violent force, as if millions of voices were terrified of fear and suddenly silenced." It is amazing how this description is so precise. There was indeed a disorder in force. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows good disturbances. Feelings are so incredibly visual. Anger, disappointment, shock, fear, exhaustion and realization of its size. It's all there. Nothing left. <br /> <br /> It's a powerful and the most mobile documentary, and that's what Emmy deserves. Not only because it documents 9/11, but because it is just what it should be. <br /> <br /> If you are planning to watch, be sure to grab the tissue. You need them. I know I did.
