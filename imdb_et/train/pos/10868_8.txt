I thought it would be a long and boring Talking Heads, full of static interiors, dude, I was wrong. "Elections" is a very exciting and thoroughly thriller drama that gives a deep and realistic insight into the origin of the Triad rituals. Characters are in constant motion, and although they always remain an observer, it is still possible to feel the decisions and ambitions of certain stars. In addition, Johnnie manages to create some truly rich images due to carefully constructed illumination and contrasts of the ambient light shade. Although there is hardly any action, this end is still a shocking depiction of brutality. A cool movie that deserves more attention, and I came like a minimalist acoustic guitar score quite a bit.
