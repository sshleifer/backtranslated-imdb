This is one of my favorite family movies. I loved it when I was little and it's still with me that I'm older. I still laugh at all old jokes and I can even tear. I never cared much about the animals that spoke, or at least about the UN animated animals, but what I do. It's a pretty old movie, but it's always in my heart. <br /> <br /> There are no other live animals that I currently mean to even compare, not to mention the same amount. I can congratulate too much for this movie, but I don't think it's showing. I really have a great message that "home is where the heart is." Or at least this is the message I got from it. Definitely recommended for the old old family evening.
