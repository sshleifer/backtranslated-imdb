When a rigid knockout occurs with pneumonia (a variant of bubble cancer), then a US public health service official Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) quarantined immediately anyone he knows was close to the body. Unfortunately, as a result of this murderous murder, there was a good chance that the murderer would start spreading the plague, causing an epidemic. Enter the police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is forced to chase the murderer as quickly as possible and avoid a possible national disaster. <br /> <br /> Although panic in the streets is a high-quality movie, it suffers from somewhat vague and a bit too sprawling (my reason for the score is eight). It travels genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedure, thriller and even romance. <br /> <br /> It's not Elia Kazan's best work, but saying it's a little unpleasant. The hairdresser is responsible for masterpieces such as A Streetcar called Desire (1951), On Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955). This film precedes them, but Kazan has said he was already "untethered" in the studio. Taking this freedom too far may partly take into account enlargement. The film was placed in New Orleans, where Kazan "drove around ... night and night, so I knew it well". He wanted to use the environment. "It's so terrible and colorful. I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz suites - all New Orleans." <br /> <br /> I work well with each street genre, but they can be better combined. Only one or two of these moods would have benefited the film. Setting up would still work. Part of the dilemma may have been due to the fact that the streets have panic attempts to connect two writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some like" Em Cold "stories. <br /> <br /> Probably the highlighted gangster material comes out firmly It is not surprising that Kazan has said he believes the villain is "more colorful - I have never been against the good boys anyway." I do not like the Puritans. "The close one is the only material that approaches the title" panic "- the discovery of the plague and the attempt to open, infect and get sick. While these two" moods "have a lot of tension, much of the movie is also quite a simple drama , whose temple is more typical for this genre. <br /> <br /> The whole dialogue is great, a stylish difference to many modern movies could no longer be pronounced. It is intelligent, shipped quickly and well for each character. "decisions, but smart moves; events and activities of the characters are chess games. If abnormal attitudes, such as Reed, are interrupted by newspapers, he gives his decisions a relatively long reasoning that other characters are challenging. <br /> <br /> In this light, it is interesting that Kazan believed that "We, murder, religion, ethics, and the middle class all kill us." through subsidies which are not covered by the aid. For example, the headgangster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) is offered the "Get Out of Jail Free" card when he works together to fight the plague. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of a movie are good, if not extraordinary, but the real reasons to watch are appearances, intriguing scenarios, and well-written dialogues.
