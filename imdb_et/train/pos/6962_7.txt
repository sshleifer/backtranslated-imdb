My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, I was really expecting a terrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this film had so many strange smiles and a fun plot that everyone got out of. I know it was a very cheesy movie, but Uma and Anna were just so cool and Steve was such a great add-on with great pain that looked like they had so much fun and made the movie really workable. <Br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, this is my best friend's real name) is not your usual central librarian who is looking for a woman when Matt, your middle man, asks him, he's more than he expected he asked G-Girl for a date, the world's super hero! But when he discovers what a jealous and crazy girl he really is, and decides that it might be a good idea for them to spend time with each other, but Jenny doesn't get it because she's fallen for another girl, Hannah, and she makes her Life's Hell, I mean, let's face it, he couldn't have chosen a better girl to break. <br /> <br /> The effect was brilliant, but you moved them quickly, the story and lamented that the story really worked and I loved Umma in this movie, this was a step from Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take, it's just a lovely romantic comedy that I think if I could laugh at it, everyone could do it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
