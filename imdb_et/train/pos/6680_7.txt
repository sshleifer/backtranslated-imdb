It was different, that's for sure. Just look cast! William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, though a number of actors who are almost superhero-wannabees in the farce share their attention. The most outrageous was Paul Reubens' fame of Pee Wee Herman. <br /> <br /> There are lots of humor, delicious colors and bangs. It's a fun, light comedy with only funny characters who all want to be heroes la Superman, Batman, Spiderman. But they have the abilities in strange regions that true heroes do not (and do not want!). It's stupid, but you know it's happening. <br /> <br /> This is also a movie that can be viewed in installments and no continuity. This is a long film for one so passionate, so here's a break and it's okay. The tongue was annoying so the kids could enjoy it. Actually, I don't remember any swearing here, except the man in the theater next to me, who said, "What a fool, movie." I thought it was fun for two hours, but I'd watch it on a DVD and take a few breaks.
