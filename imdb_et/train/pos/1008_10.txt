I got this great program around the 4th season and since then I've seen that all episodes got all DVD episodes and keep getting better and better with the 9th and 10th seasons. Now, Richard Dean may not be Anderson now, but adding Ben Browder and Claudie Black is still stronger and more original, even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, the sci-fi channel was freed from this amazing show without the hope relay for 11 seasons when two movies are made directly on DVD and hopefully more. Atlantis continues in its fourth season. And there is a third in the book, which is not near the star gate franchise. This TV show must be for all sci-fi fans and genres, because it has such a wide range of things that all age groups and people like. 10/10
