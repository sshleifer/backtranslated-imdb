Kali's tears are an original but false horror film that deepens into the acts of the Indian cult group, composed of German psychologists who have learned to control their will and body so that they can heal others. radical techniques (which can trigger horrible hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to release the demons within them. <br /> <br /> The film is shown as a set of vignettes for the Taylor-Eriksson group - the cult group mentioned above. The first segment is somewhat slower than the rest, but earns a fine for the rest of the movie. The rest plays like a mindf @ ck film, where some of the main clips are thrown into the mix (full length nudity, some holes) to keep you happy. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you this. It may not be remarkable, but it is quite understandable and offers the right place. 8/10
