A young woman who has been a successful model and has been married and has been attempted to suicide twice in the past, chooses the secret and distant connection of the Catholic priest to be the next "sentinel" to the gate that apparently passes through the creepy but well-maintained Brooklyn apartment building. Its tenants take the staircase and can rebuild themselves, but obviously they cannot escape if the sentinel is to block the road. The previous one (John Carradine) is about dead so he can become a fate or any other, and he must be killed to kill him so that they are free. There are a lot of interesting details beneath the surface, his relationship with his father, stories proclaimed, his fianc√©e so that it can be passed on as a horror of cheap exploitation, but given the set, the great lie and incredible, it is definitely worth it.
