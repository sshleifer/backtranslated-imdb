"Cinderella" is one of Disney's classics most loved. And it really deserves its status. According to the classical fairy tale, as Charles Perrault said, the film follows the Cinderella, the afflictions and misery of a good girl, whom her evil stepmother and equally unlikely step into. When royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: The king wants to get married to the prince), Cinderella is left home while her stepmother takes her terrible daughters. But there is Fairy Godmother ... <br /> <br /> The "Cinderella" story in itself is not capable of pulling out the property, but at the same time the story is different, rather random animals used by the fairy tale to get the ball in the title. Cinderella as a real conjuncture. Mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks and their own nemesis is Lucifer, a stepmother's cat. Their antics are generally intertwined with the main fairy tale and are largely wonderful. Indeed, the film slows down somewhat between the main characters and soon before the steps leave the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets over and over again (since "Cinderella" is the most worn story all the time, probably) one of the most involved Disney Lakes will reach. <br /> <br /> Animation and artistic direction are cute. All of the legendary nine old men are animated in this picture and Mary Blair's color style and concept art (she also made the design and color style "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "The Three Caballeros" and many others). ) succeeds on the screen. Colors and designs are beautiful, especially in the Fairy Godmother and Ball scenes, as well as in their very small moments. <br /> <br /> Generally, "Cinderella" is one of the best Disney managers. Stories and recommended for young people and anyone embodying Disney's philosophy that dreams really get.
