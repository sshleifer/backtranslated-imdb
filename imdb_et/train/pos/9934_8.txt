"Domino" on this site has been widely denounced for its cordial editing style and "ill" photography. Its detectors point to its superficiality and criticize the introduction of this "style over substance". I could no longer agree. I believe that "Domino" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's filmmaking career. <br /> <br /> After the dominant Hollywood action movie style was created in the late eighties and early nineties, Tony Scott has gradually moved towards a more subjective cinema style. For "Crimson Tide", Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters - the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on the nuclear ship have been embodied in the excellent use of long lenses with Dutch corner design. It was then transferred to "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game", which represented the world of monitoring and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> Man On Fire was an extreme departure, an expressionist movement, a more picturesque aesthetic. Here, Scott used an old hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage. Although not quite successful, it introduced techniques that found their full expression "Domino". <br /> <br /> The "Domino" featured in the FBI Interview Frame introduces the fragmented fragments of the legendary memory of the infamous generation hunter. He grabs the memories, as we all make fragments, flashes and briefly. As Domino transmits his story orally, Scott transmits it visually, not only for the events he describes, but also for their guidance. He has "mescalin traces" in his system, but his individual vision is anyway Unusual - that woman who gave up the luxury of life. <br /> <br /> Just as Domino begins to associate events that lead to his imprisonment, Scott can really rip. Together with Dan Mindel and the composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott, he is organizing a postmodern modern canvas. Gradually we begin to realize that the unusual, although it may be Domino, is no longer separated from the "90210" culture that it has rejected. As he crosses this cultural symbol, Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence he is destroying through the disadvantaged children introduced by the narrative. Ultimately, Scott depicts his salvation because it is the only escape we have from this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> Criticizing the over-styling of this film is similar to criticizing Picasso or Pollock for not representing what is recognizably human. Like any big painting, the meaning of "Domino" is on the surface and the surface is all. <br /> <br /> I am not in any way involved with Scott Free, but I have always been and still is a great admirer of Tony Scot's work
