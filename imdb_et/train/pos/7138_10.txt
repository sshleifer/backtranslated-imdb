If John Thaw has never played "Morse", "Kavanagh" or "The Sweeney" and other productions, then he will be remembered for his remarkably unforgettable action "Goodnight Mr Tom". <br /> <br /> Adapting Michelle Magoria's charming novel is a great support for her artistic monument, supported by her co-star (young Nick Robinson in her first role) and remarkable performance. When I read this story from an old widow of Norfolk who had to accommodate a young boy before and during Blitz in London, I found a fairly clear time out and the filmmakers had to go wrong with this credit. They must also be praised for not being too sentimental about the story and preventing what could easily have been confused. <br /> <br /> If you hold a CD or video library, this feeling for a good TV movie is an absolute inclusion.
