I love Sabrina! Its one of my fave shows !! My favorite episodes are; where he turns Libby's geek into the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest of the series. I think college episodes were not as good as high school students, but they were better than the latter, which was terrible. Valerie was a good character because he was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some great episode. Hilda and Zelda were amazing and didn't seem to have any explanation where they went! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just were not as good as other friends.
