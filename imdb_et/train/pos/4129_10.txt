This is a cooking contest that is American. This is not a Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I could care less about cooking, but this show is just entertaining to look at the intensity of the community's chef's glowing chair. A really good way to spend time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show as a judge like Marc Ecko ... But ... Meh. It's fun enough to watch and the winner deserves an award. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah and I'm bitter John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> The area's kitchen!
