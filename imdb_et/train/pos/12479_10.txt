What is "Mermaid" helium balloon traveling from Yuba City on November 8, 1993 and landing 4 days later (November 12) in MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada. miles). This is a great movie. It is based on a real story. This film not only helps children cope with losses, but also older people. I hope everyone will enjoy it! Rhonda
