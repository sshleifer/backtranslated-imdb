I'm not a normal comment on this website, but I see how this movie is underestimated. I will try to write some comments and comments on this. I was fun to watch this movie, maybe because the cat is all I want to be, I'm not going to post a spoiler or reveal the plots, but there are things that I really found amazingly how he manipulates people is just so divine . this is a very underrated movie, there are no arguments here, I usually enjoy it and then I will talk a little if you go to the movies to have fun, and I really enjoyed 1h53 i stayed in the dark room. must see again and again until joy disappears. Try not to be so critical. thank you for reading.
