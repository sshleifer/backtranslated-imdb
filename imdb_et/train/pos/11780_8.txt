This is a documentary that I came to the UK's More4 randomly and I have to say that I found it very interesting and thought-provoking. I'm also looking for a book that was the source material for this documentary. Basically, this is Professor Jared Diamond's theory of why some parts of the rural community flourished and others did not. The argument he put forward was new to me and claimed that the happiness of the right cultures and the right animals, capable of homing, is certainly convincing. The documentary is well-spoken and well-told about many re-created scenes that violate a lot of modern documentary. The diamond also helps not to force what is the fault of many intellectuals when they try to get the message to the masses. People have argued that his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy it or see it as a socio-geologist. It was also refreshing to hear the theory of a society that was not based on religion. Highly recommended viewing.
