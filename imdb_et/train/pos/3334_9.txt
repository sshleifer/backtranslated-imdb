I liked this movie because I have a man who is the same movie man. This film is about Lindse, who will meet Ben in the middle of winter if there is no baseball season. He falls in love, but when the spring comes, he gets his life out of shock when he is one step lower than Ben This is a funny film with all the baseball obsessions Ben has. She does not get part of what she loves the most, it makes it so funny and why so many women can be in real life with Lindsey. The people with whom he plays baseball are also as obsessed as he is. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie and you won't kick out if you rent it.
