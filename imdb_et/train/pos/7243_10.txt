Stylish Russian emigrant draws Stanislavski's system to win a contract bridge, making her and her beautiful husband, America, a GRAND SLAM sweetheart. <br /> <br /> What could have been another silly soap opera? fine production values ​​and excellent enjoyment with little comedy status. Some unexpected touch is thrown to keep the viewer's attention - the way the cast principle is put on the face. putting a subsidiary's acrobat on the plot for a reason other than a bit of madness; and the way it is shown that many different Americans have been transferred by listening to the final game broadcast. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas & Loretta Young do very well as Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas suave and complex, and Miss Young passionately loves and beautiful (even if the script keeps her cigarette a little too much). They are fun to watch, even if their behavior is not always the most credible or convincing. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh gives another good result like a reluctantly cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young. Pleasant Glenda Farrell casts her usual wisecracking person a small role in McHugh's ditsy gal pal. Roscoe Karns is engaged in a fast-paced dialogue as a fierce radio transmitter. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is great as a snobbish bridge expert. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers know Dewey Robinson as a patron of a military nightclub; Emma Dunn as reporter acting as a murderer; Paul Porcasi as owner of a Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as the ultimate bridge game kibitzer - not all credited. <br /> <br /> The film takes advantage of the contract bridge that developed throughout the country in the 1920s. This requires the viewer to have a basic understanding of the complexity of the game and not to try to explain to the uninformed.
