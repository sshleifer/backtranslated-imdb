This movie has all the action films you want. Explosions, shootouts, bad guys and worse guys. It is fun to see that James Belushi uses his humor to get out of trouble because he has himself, because he stole $ 12 million from the very big boss "The Skipper. Does it sound like a hair. Of course it is. movie, it is much better than the direct DVD garbage you make today if you get over the stupid plot if you find that there are quite a lot of surprises in this movie. You can claim that twists can be predicted, but the fast pace of this movie doesn't give you too much a lot of time because it's not a blessing, because this movie doesn't mean final twisting, only the title is a bit misleading and it can be the reason why so many people hated this movie.
