"Green of Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), Medieval siblings living with Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island, decide to receive a son from a nursery home to help on your farm. But the orphan sent to them is a 14-year-old girl named Anne Shirley (short pants of Dawn Evelyn Paris - Disney's "Alice", who later named her character). <br /> <br /> Anne was just 11 Lucy Maude Montgomery, but the same actor could not really go from 11 to college age. The film suffers somewhat from this concession because many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says is more entertaining than an eleven-year-old teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and fast, desires, but satisfied with her name, her construction, freckles and her long red hair. But as an imaginative child, Anne is full of joy and quickly adapts to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne's original "Teenage Drama Queen" and film screenwriter decided to focus on this aspect of her character. What made the main genre a mildly fun family drama for comedy. A change that delighted the audience and which continues to hit the reader's sails. <br /> <br /> Because comedy is in the spirit of the story of Montgomery, I see no reason to challenge the changes, but let this be a fair warning to anyone waiting for a completely faithful adaptation. Comedy is a film's strength because it is one of the first self-reflexive parodies of Hollywood conventions. Actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's all-time decorations and the film is black and white. So much entertainment is seen in the title character of endless sheep with its appearance and hair color, which is inconsistent with what appears on the screen. Anne regularly arranges her with melodramatic lines with her nonsense rural companions: "If you refuse, this is a lifelong sadness for me." Perhaps the most fun moment is when he corrects his name on the spell class board. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does a good job as Anne's love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steal all the scenes in which she appears as Cuthbert's pompo neighbor. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
