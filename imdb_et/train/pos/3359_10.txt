Una giornata particolare is a film that has used closed spaces perfectly. This is a dull, empty space that viewers see emotional instability and cautious discovery of two leading figures from Ettore Scola.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated people who decide to come together for some short moments of their hopeless life. makes us believe that people take half of the characters close to them. All men would really be sorry for Sophia Loren's character. All women will surely shout their hearts out of Marcello Mastroian's existential situation. Undoubtedly, movies are also one of the main issues. Most of the characters are involved in their sexuality issues. The giornata particolare cannot be called a pro gay movie, although it is nicely illustrated that homosexual cabbage mixes well with women. Ettore Scola has developed a pretty good mix of facts and fiction. His idea is to show how Hitler's arrival changed the fate of ordinary Italian people. The word about the brutal personality that was wonderfully played by magnificent Marcello Mastroianni. he does not love mercy. He rejoices in his destiny and faces the worst time of his short but meaningful life. Cinema's real masterpiece !!!
