**** The SPOILERS **** Powerhouse movie, showing how men in desperate situations can go so far as to sacrifice their best friends and family members and not understand what the monsters are doing. Like a bull like Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen, it's too late. <br /> <br /> This is the height of the 1922 and Black & Tan Irish rebellion against the British Empire with Denmark, British occupying troops who wanted the Irish Republican rebel Frankie McPhillip, Wallace Ford, to kill the Briish soldier. Gypo is a good, really best friend of the military, McPhillip, who is fortunate to have no job with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, to pay for their tricks in the Dublin Red Light area. /> <br /> After the outrageous Gypo working with a potential John who wants to spend a couple of hours with Katie, a shilling or two, angry Katie tells not so bright Gyro that she is holding her physical support to her only support. Katie also tells Gypo that she should wake up to reality and understand the desperate situation. Talking about the spiritual Gypo, it goes to only ten pounds to go to America and Gypo from Ireland's poverty suddenly remembers the poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip, which he just showed for Â£ 20. It's enough money for him and Kait to travel to America. <br /> <br /> Gypo goes to the local Dublin floppy and soup kitchen to get a free meal, surprised to get into his friend Frankie McPhillip. Frankie tells her that she hit Dublin to see both her mother, Mrs McPhillip, and her sister Mary, Una O'Connor & Heather Angel, and if she can make sure everything is safe for her to go home and later leave her Irish Republican unit outside the city. <br /> <br /> All Gypo You See Frankie is 20 pounds for her police! Without the same amount of thinking, after confirming to Frankie that everything is fine, Gypo goes to the police and informs his friend who was later shot and killed by the police and Tan shootout from their mother house. <br /> <Br /> When it came to the police chief, the police chief gave over 20 pounds, similar to thirty silver, almost emotional Gypo, who takes it and the back of the police station, so someone can see him. On the face and activities of the police chief, you see that he has nothing but contempt for the betrayal of Gypo's friend Frankie McPhillip. Even if he wanted murder and the British Empire for the enemy. So even those who work in secret are kept in the hands of low betrayers or informants. <br /> <br /> Gypo turns out to be his worst enemy after Frankie's betrayal when his conscience checks his mind. Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend Katie, showing her finger and accusing her of Frankie's betrayal and death with the British authorities. In Gypo's conviction, he has been royally and brilliantly drunk for paid money, so that by the time he is forced to admit his crime to his Irish army counterparts who had almost drunk and buggy Gypo in the trial, this money was any good, it is possible, for Gypo with a weak mind and a strong shoulder, it was completely destroyed when it was a complete despair. to stay out of the fire, he accuses the innocent man Mulligan, Donald Meek, of his crime that he informed his friend Frankie McPhillip. Each is quickly exhibited as the whole other than the guilt of Gypo himself. Then the color is painted when the straw is pulled out, who would put the bullet Gypo on top of this heart for the final intestinal burst and the unforgettable Crime & Punishment classic.
