In all my 60s I have learned that if we look at the film, there is identification (whether we want it or not) that has a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, because a character fills a certain gesture, sometimes because a character speaks a certain word or phrase? what do we use or what we would like to use? situation. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen in this perspective. Who can now find a parking place? in a mall, downtown or on the street - a car whose driver doesn't remember being the only driver in the world. <br /> <br /> Who doesn't want "rubber poisoning" bad poisoning? Haven said I was asking: - Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is: YES, don't try find the absurd details in the "relatively real life reality" movie, because you will surely find the movie ridiculously. <br /> <br /> Abstracts made, you will see that the film has moments of surprise, for example: the box contains a weapon and does it make use of the gut?); 2 - the order in which Terry dies in the fall; 3. In the order in which Della attracts Chuckie's "mermaid speech". <br /> <br /> If you've seen the movie or If you are planning to see, remember that there are "realistic" movies, "fiction" films, "political" movies and movies where you can "wash your soul"? To exemplify the last we can quote: "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to newspapers, BOPE's officials were unanimous (As I've seen a movie on a DVD, I couldn't identify the listener's response)? <br /> <br /> Interpretation by Susan Monford (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc.) Edition (William M. Anderson's "Dead Poets Society", "Green Card" Exceptional Edition, "Robocop 2", etc.) It is well in context. On a scale of 1 (large) to 10 (Captain Piece), I appreciate "When He Was Out" 7 (Regular).
