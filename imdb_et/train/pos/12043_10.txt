... There is a prominent ghost story on stage, on television, or in the book "Black Women". The other reviewers have almost all said about this movie, but I thought I'd add a little bit of a review too late. TV is deliberately slow in the first act that crowns the main character of Arthur when he acts as a lawyer in London in the 1920s. I understand why it may not turn to all tastes. Nonetheless, I love the British-style storytelling that resembles the BBC's "Ghost Story for Christmas" adaptation of the great work of M. James. In another book, the ghost story that Arthur sends to his provincial provinces is dead to deal with the client's affairs. The third act consistently relies on the conclusion of spinal pruritus ... Like a Londoner, I've seen this game. I have this book, DVD-R, and I also have an unlimited audiobook on my iPod. I am sure that women on any medium in black are a spiritual story with little equal. It's time for us to have a legitimate area on 2 DVDs.
