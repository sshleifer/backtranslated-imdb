This is a direct-video movie, so it should say no, it doesn't rival the first Lion King, but it said it was all right. <br /> <br /> My kids loved it, but it's given, they love something that is a comic. The big shock was that I liked the fact that in some places there was a ridiculous funny (even funny jokes *), they had many creative links with the first movie and even some jokes you had to watch out for parents to understand (but without Shrek) ["do you think he compensates for something?"])). <br /> <br /> A special note about jokes about jokes, I was surprised that no jokes were just toilet noise (in fact, there were almost no noise / images, the references were actually fine), they actually had setup / punchline etc and they were almost good taste. I would like my kids to think more about humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is good for them. <br /> <br /> Hmm what else? Music was so, not nearly as creative as the first or second film, but fun for kids. There are no painful moments that were a blessing for me. Little activity, but something too frightening (NIMH's secret gave my kids a nightmare, I'm not sure G-rating was right for it ...) <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great movie for children of all ages , one that is 100% safe for them to watch (I don't want to be too sensitive, but I had to jump and turn off the TV for some movies that were smaller than expected) - but you can leave the room at that time. I would say, though, though you can also enjoy it :)
