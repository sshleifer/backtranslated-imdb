John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone banker who lives in a small town near London. While on the Internet, he is contacting the Russian Bride Agency. She chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman, the guy can be lonely and shy, but he's definitely good at taste, isn't he?) And when they meet, he understands he's not talking English. Communicating with each other is basically a limited sex (again imagine what a terrible situation a boy, just with Nicolas Kidman!). On his birthday, two Russian friends will visit them. Then there will be many surprises. I liked this movie: First, it's almost impossible to be "tagged". Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? I believe all the choices are right. Nicole Kidman is proud as usual and I am very curious about her Russian: does she speak Russian in the right pressure or just kicks? Anyway, I found it an enjoyable movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Isca Perfeita" ("Perfect Bait")
