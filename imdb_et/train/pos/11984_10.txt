I've never seen as good as Full House. Full House puts all the latest exhibitions into shame for a long time! Anyone who has never seen it, what I do not see, how it is possible, should see it. This is a great show for everyone of every age. Full House makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it amazes you. True, some people feel that the show has some "cheesy" aspects, but the positive aspects weigh all the "cheesy" aspects. Full House ran his first episode on September 22, 1987, entitled "Our First Performance" and ran its last episode on May 23, 1995, entitled "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The plot plot is very plausible. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) loses his wife in a Pami accident, with a drunk driver. Danny has his brother's law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is Pami's younger brother, and Danny also brings his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are called DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse are planning a few months with Danny and his three girls to help and eventually live with them for eight years; which is the years when the show took place. <br /> <br /> Here are some characters and actress / actor who played him: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a big actor. He's playing Jesse. Jesse is a stone star waiting for her big break. At Full House, John Stamos is doing an excellent job of depicting his character. He saw and played music like his idol Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. She must raise three girls without her daughter's mother. Bob Saget does an excellent job of depicting a single parent working full-time and still having time to grow his three girls. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): One word can be described by Dave Coulier, funny. He's great. Playing Joey's character was perfect for him. He does a great job when playing a stand-up comedian who is waiting for his big break. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She is a huge actress. She plays the oldest sister, DJ, short Donna Jo. He's one of the best actors I've ever seen. His ability to act at Full House was very credible. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweet, incredibly amazing! I wish I could say all the things I would like to say about Jodie, but I would use up to 1000 words for him. She started with a children's show called Mother's Goose, and when she came to the plenary, she blew the audience and creator. His great appearance and the amazing ability to act helped to show that it was a success. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show. It was supposed to be where he was going to get his big break. Jodie, who was five years old when the show first appeared, could hit every line. He showed great enthusiasm. Most young children can't do it. I think I think Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite sign in plenary. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great Actress. Full House is where they got started. They took part in Michelle because they were the only kids who didn't cry in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> There are many more cast members who should be recognized. These are the initial characters from the first show in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is how Full House got to the end of Michelle's show. I think it was going to his end. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were doing much better. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the greatest things that can be taught to you is that everyone can live a great life, even if a tragedy occurs, such as losing a family member. Full House continues to attract new fans. All in all, there are only a few things left; Full House will never die and thank you, Full House, for giving you an exhibition that they can enjoy.
