A little funny movie. It's incredible, incredible, impossible. But it's funny how an introverted masochist can become totally addicted and mesmerized, even hypnotized by a girl he barely knows, but who was able to go into his fantasies. Of course, this is a denial of foolish transactions that you can get online. You must not believe that ten percent of what you have said there will never agree to hit your hands in some way or another, or to an organization you don't know personally. Most of these "businesses" are in one way or another to steal you and rob you. But here the captain deserves the sacrifice of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly silly. But then the film becomes funny because it comes to the victim of a twisted business with an upper hand and playing the same game with its victim and winning. One is sure too. Security at English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I think it is not better anywhere else in the world, and even now they have tightened up all the rules and regulations, it's just fun to go through their procedures and fix them systematically. Then they have vengeance, losing their luggage, with real plague at modern airports and not expecting fair compensation. Or even seizing a bottle opener or jar opener, as it can be dangerous. I see myself cutting my way through the plane opener. Funny, isn't it?
