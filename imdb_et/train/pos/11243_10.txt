I first saw "Breaking Glass" when it was released in 1980 in England. I loved it and started doing it just in August 2005 at a Canadian station that it was still great. The only thing I regret is that I can't find a sound track or a DVD in the stores? ... someone takes care of shedding light, or I have to order it from an overpriced internet company. But the film's return to music is a test of time, Hazel / Kate had said something about the 80s in the UK. In fact, it was the same decade when I moved to Canada for the same reasons, one of them was "Thatcher" and what he did with the country at that time. Please if you get the chance to watch this movie that you don't excuse!
