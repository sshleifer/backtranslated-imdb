One of the best three short pants from Stooges. A spooky house with evil boys and "The Goon" sets off the best men in the disarmament detective agency. Shemp is in the form of a famous dark scene. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in the role of Mr Goodrich in the plot of the murder plot. Before it is over, Shempt's "reliable small shovel" is used with great effect. This 16-minute pearl moves about as fast as any Stooge short and packs the wall twice. Highly recommended.
