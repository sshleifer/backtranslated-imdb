Alain Chabat argues that this film is his original idea, but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it is as old as not older than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is "vieux garcon", happily single and one. does not want a member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. She has a problem, a 5 sister and a matriarch mother - G7, who decides she should be married. Enter the charming, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what a simple plan should be. Charlotte has to put a girlfriend on Chabat and then doesn't come up on the wedding day. No longer talking about G7 marriage. Of course, the best plans have become customary. <br /> <br /> Lafont has very strong support roles as the mother and Osterman as Gainsbourne's relaxed brother. There are some fantastic scenes, like the first Charlotte has to admire, then the rebellion of the family. French farce in English.
