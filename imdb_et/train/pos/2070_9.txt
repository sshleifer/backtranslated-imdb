Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about the young man who is looking for answers to his brother's death. Mr Sheen, Mr Margolin and Mr Morrow first turn to their roles for the first time; Mrs Phillips has a slightly less enviable task of trying to create a television film (twenty-five years ago), offering "sexual interest" to an otherwise sexual film. However, the actual letter is "California Kid"; The 1934 Ford Coupe, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, was put in front of the camera and gave the trainer a friction, rubbing and holding the edge of the seat awake. <br /> <br /> Action scenes are remarkable (though some dialogs are a bit flat), which makes a good evening deviation. So all "car films" have to be done. <br /> <br /> Try to grab it on the late movie channel; it's worth a forgotten dream.
