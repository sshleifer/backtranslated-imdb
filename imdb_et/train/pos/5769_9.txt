Would you all put Todd Sheets out! Give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you came up with! Man got 735 zombies and regular cast work for FREE! Of course, it is ridiculous at times. Yes, make-up is not the greatest you will ever see. But it is not the worst if you want to see it, then check out Zombie Nation with the zombies of this raccoon. <br /> <br /> It's clean, good old-fashioned Guerilla movie making! Todd is a perfect professional and a nice guy. The plot has holes, yes. The plot seems far removed. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets would be hiding and doing what he was going to do. If someone has ever tried to make a movie, they know that ending it is an accomplishment in itself.
