Cecil B. De Mille, the master of the film, goes west. Using three old west legends as their main characters (apparently they have never met), Gary Cooper Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur make a beautiful accident at Jane. The story only serves De Mille to hang some wonderful sequences of action, such as the great Indian attack. Similar situations are very well done.If you do not remember that this is a somewhat general performance, it is very entertaining to the West.Create a very young Anthony Quinn, who will investigate India's brave role, who participated in the Little Big Horn battle. This part was noticed by him at least in Hollywood.
