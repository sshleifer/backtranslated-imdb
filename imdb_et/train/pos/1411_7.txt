Reiterates the darkness. Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and looks at the toughness of some of the animals in the desert. For all over the age of 40, Disney and Omaha Wild Kingdom gave their great conception of wild animals from our childhood ... back when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. What is always appealing is how complicated the circumstances are for many of these majestic beings. Watching the elephants for days that have almost disappeared due to water scarcity is so painful. But their nightly battle against the lions is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some underwater shots are breathtaking. Mama and baby humpbacks are beautiful and look at the great white shark attack, with the annual chilling as jaws. The most amazing landscape for me was the breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I had never seen such a detail in great detail. <br /> <br /> Don't think most of the young kids are too excited today, but this is definitely one of the most beautiful photographic materials I've ever seen.
