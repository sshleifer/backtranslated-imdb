This is one of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br /> If the film has an error, it is that it is in your hand like an angry pull. This will not allow the viewer to attack as much. '' Scarface '' is just as silly and stiff as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. Like the Greek tragedy, it is worshiping and clotting, horses and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's invincible fate. <br /> <br /> Not as much warning as the ongoing disaster, 'Scarface' is lurking across the screen when a robbed train is unstoppable.
