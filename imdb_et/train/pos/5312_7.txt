Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are great couples and showcasing their unique charisma highlighted in this film. really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average boy with an old camera and his main hobby is taking photos of the exotic inhabitants of this small town where he lives. work and hire him to reveal his work at some important festival and more. Even her sexy girlfriend gets crazy because now she doesn't pay her enough attention. <br /> <br /> Well, it's on an indie movie, but not for everyone. For some people, it may seem boring or pretentious, but I still think it's worth it because it offers something "different" than typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> Describe a few words: Ricci and John Waters movie. That's right. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that "Full Grace" lines are really annoying. Geez.
