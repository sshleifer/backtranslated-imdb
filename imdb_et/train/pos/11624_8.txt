Red Eye, a movie you wanted to see for a while ... Cillian Murphy plays Jack Ripner (ripper jack) in the lead position of Assassins and his literally killer is planning to give up a very profile man and his family. /> <br /> Everyday woman "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, going to work, home ... worries ... hates flying. <br /> <br /> His grandmother's death sends him on a flight that has been delayed several times. <br /> <br /> Flight where he meets Jack ... an ordinary seeming man until he reveals his profession and the plans that randomly involve him, he is the key to Keefe's (sp?) death. <br /> <br /> He manages to save them ... but almost his life costs are taken, Jack is beaten ... The Kefs are saved ... Oh, what story * laughs * just jokes, the movie is really good, last year's best ... there are little things you need to look out for in the movie before. .. (Frankenstein pencil) I w threw it several times before trying to catch all the little jokes and scammers ... <br /> <br /> Thriller is sexual for the fans, but there's an easy hint (bathroom scene) (jack ) "Thanks for quicky" and (female sender) "Ohhh ... it's going to be one of those flights" (second female sender) "Hey! It's not a motel," you get the idea ...
