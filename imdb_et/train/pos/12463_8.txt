Nora is a double mother who still wants to live the life of young artists in the 1970s, as well as her group of friends, writers, singers and actors. The philosophy of free love is not entirely out of the system? and Nora doesn't fall in love, especially with junkie. Hazlehurst won his first two AFI awards for four years for his excellent Nora depiction that takes care of his children, but also falls in love with Junki (Friels). Garner ?? who would later wear movies like LOVE and OTHER CATASTROFES and STRANGE PLANET? is good if Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps ready for her role in lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000?) appears as a bearded painter. The early effort of Director Cameron is the winner; He has awarded the award-winning mini-series MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But this is a stunning delivery from Hazlehurst, which brings a smart, searchable script based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
