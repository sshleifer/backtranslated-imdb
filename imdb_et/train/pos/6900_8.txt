"Fanfan la tulipe" is still the most popular part of Gerard Philippe, and it started with swashbuckler craze in French cinema from 1955 to 1965. It made Gina Lollobrigale stars (Lollobrigida and Philippe compete again with Ren√© Clairis) "Belles de nuit" in the same year. <br /> <br /> "Fanfan la tulipe" is completely crazy, sometimes absurd. Henri Jeanson's spiritual lines, full of dark irony, were probably influenced by Voltaire and "Candide." .The antimilitarism has often arisen: "these performers will radiate joy of joy and joy (the joy of life and the joy of death), if necessary." "Recruiting people is necessary if accidents exceed the number of" "survivors" without the thousands of deaths you promised, King Louis XV complains, but no matter what you are waiting for. "<br /> <br /> Vote for the comments at the beginning and at the end and history is a tough journey: the height of irony, this is a true historian who speaks! <br /> <br /> Christian-Jaque leads the movie with joy and knows only one pace: picked up. <br /> <br /> Transformation in 2003 with Vincent Perez and Penelope Cruz. I haven't seen it, but I don't think it should be done first.
