Late, big Robert Bloch (author of PSYCHO, for those who didn't pay attention) wrote this terrorist attack and it was absolutely one of the most frightening films I ever saw as a child. (I had to walk to MILES to see the movie, and usually when it came to the theater, it was dark when the horror movie was always nervous, but especially when it was done well.) If I had the chance to see it several years ago on a videotape (which should always to be the last resort), I was surprised how well it was held. Take the terror test: check it out at night, alone, and then tell me it's not scary ...
