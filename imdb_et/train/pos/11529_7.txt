The biography film "The Lady With Red Hair" (a story about how director / producer / playwright David Belasco transformed into a notorious social divorce as Mrs Leslie Carter's international star) is definitely not the same year in the Warner biogas league, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what? ), but "Lady" is an enjoyable movie independently - AND shares quite a few features that are common to Cagney's classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "Lady With Red Hair" is an outdated show-business flavor. (Of course, both films have delicious theater camps and unavoidable scenes set on the back and in the offices of theater directors.) Also in the "Lady", as in the Cohan bio-region, supportive cast acquaintance and beloved character actors are in the age; remember. <br /> <br /> Did I need to add that, like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "Lady with Red Hair" doesn't let you get a good story? But, like "Dandy", "Lady" is going to lead - brilliantly - to convey the essence of her life as a personality of a show-business-giant hero. Everyone knows that Cagney slipped Cohan all the time in his glorious and heartfelt imagery "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but few people realize that Claude Rains did a "The Red Lady with Red Hair" service like David Belasco - and did it with Panache is almost equal to Cagney. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures the legendary personality of this legendary showman with all its great glory. The rain brings tremendously enjoyable, superbly observed and remarkably viable performance when all the men called "The Wizard" by Broadway. To see Claude Rains in action (looking at each shot if he had a gentle time at the right time!), There is a "Red Lady with Red Hair" that David Belasco jumps into the movie if he can't wait to shake things back to the head . <br /> <br />
