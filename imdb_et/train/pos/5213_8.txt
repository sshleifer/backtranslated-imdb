This is the first review I've written for IMDb so it's very empty for me, but I hit HBO and I was sure I was watching it. Richard Gere is a passionate agent / detective in this film who bends the rules to get the job done. I think this story is great, and there is never a dull scene that slows down the movie's pace. Some parts of the film that are related to sex addicts with dementia are quite shocking, but if you've ever seen a criminal movie like Se7en, you can just scenes in the stomach. So, if you are looking for a good detective / splash screen, ignore this low rating for the IMDb movie and be sure to follow it.
