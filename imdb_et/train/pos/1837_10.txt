Just a great movie is not in doubt. Great story and great performances, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefal, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindi film industry is disgraceful with Mallika and Co, this film is completely vulgar and therefore it is bound to vulgarly depend on our Indian society to fail. But the film and the concept that this film carries is absolutely excellent. Anu Malik (boring copy-cat) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could have been used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should have given some touch to Gujarat in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and thinks he is a popstar, but this is not a film with the required presence. She sees Govinda-style songs only good. I felt some nice serious music with a couple of good Ghazal or sad songs that would make this movie more memorable.
