Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, so they have a tendency to come out with movies like movies that eventually reach the anime fans' hard drives and college student floors, but nobody really ignores anyone outside their country of origin. Cat Soup is one of the films that are being studied with the eyes of the West or deeply analyzed. Really, it's just a beautifully detailed surreal journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue that makes it easy for other interested parties who are not interested in subtitles. Cat and her half dead (brain dead?) The sister travels through various imaginations and associations of landscapes. There's a common water theme or lack of it (maybe because the cat is drowning in the beginning? Possibly the title is?). It is interesting to sort of Genesis. There's a pig that eats itself. Elephant is made of water. And it's proud, delightful, exciting, and fun - if you don't look at it around pharmacies that don't get anything uniquely unique, without going to the acid journey. Finally, the film itself turns off, adding another convincing level of self-sensitivity to the procedure. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
