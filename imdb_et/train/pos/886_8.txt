It was one of the DVDs I recently bought with the name "Frenchfilm" to educate French before our planned vacation in the beautiful Provence this year. So far, we have greatly enhanced the recognition of French cinema, in addition to improving our French language. <br /> <br /> What a fresh air momentum for a covert, predictable, unimaginable, crash burst that Hollywood rubs. . What is a good example for scriptwriters, actors, directors and cinematographers. It was also so stimulating to see two identifiable characters in the lead without having the glossy covers of the magazines. The other thing I liked about this film was the slow nature of the plot and the structure of the plot that keeps you from how it all ended. Is there a real good in this selfish gossip who constantly treats his seemingly na√Øve benefactor with the kind of contempt that the ex-con would see? Does our sexually disappointed bad little party deaf hero prove himself in answering his dreams and the situation that his fate has given him? Observers are interested in these issues, and the actors loose their answers slowly and convincingly because they are faced with events that set out and shape their feelings against each other. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen this movie like me, like I want to see it again. I still have to develop a director for the psychological motif of the subcombine as a password officer, and some of the fine nuances of the camera work are worth the second look. The plot does not ask for a little imagination when our hero is given the opportunity to help our misused and overworked heroine's office. You also need to be broad-based in order to believe in reading your glorious lip and how some activities will settle. But if you go to this exciting journey on the example of this French cinema, you will be more than happy. Four out of five out of five stars.
