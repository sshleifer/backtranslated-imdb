I can really say that I felt the movie in the right content, where the mind games from dreamy reality enter the surreal aspect of Tom Cruise's future. I didn't care about Tom Cruise's ability to act, but I have to say that he seems to be impressed with every point on the film ... not just because of the interesting story, but also because he himself is leading. .. they combine and talk and its beautiful. But I have to say that this movie is not part of the "midday weekly flick" that you randomly choose and watch out for; It carries strong feelings and signs, so do not wash it with your beer and pop-corn. It certainly needs more.
