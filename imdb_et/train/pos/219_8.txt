The carefully written dialogues of Simon have indeed been done by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the script. There are few movies that can develop such a relationship between the participants and the script. For example, famous reunion scenes may have been much more unpleasant when less quality participants were involved. Matthau seemed to be born to play Willie Clark (of course, the odd pair of Oscar moore) and all the small idiosyncrasies and motifs Matthau crashes into the character (line where he claims to be with him since he lives in the city while Lewis lives in a country where Lewis is "touched", its most important example) makes it one of the best performances I've seen in any role, regardless of comedian or drama or whatever. Period. Matthau and Burns work great together; The contrast they represent highlights Simon's excellent ability to create comic conflicts. This film is just one of the main "black visions" and requires a legitimate prestigious place on the film's history pages.
