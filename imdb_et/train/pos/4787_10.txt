David Lynch usually makes misconceptions about puzzles. They are interesting to watch and think, but they really don't gel in their minds. Perhaps art always means the creator the most. <br /> <br /> Straight story is not a typical David Lynch movie. Not that they have something typical anyway. It is odyssey through rural areas. The real way of life Alvin Straight took the lawnmower to his brothers. He drove 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin changes his sick brother for past offenses. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this movie is the sweet voice, Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight directly and honestly to us. The fact that the film is a slow pace corresponds to Alvin's slow journey towards realization. <br /> <br /> Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to leave her situation. After listening to Alvin, he talks about the family he is considering again. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin feels that a deliberate woman is killing his deer with his car. He complains that he has killed several and left. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to eat some nice meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin's lawnmower loses his brakes and almost kills. A nice man and his wife let him stay in his yard when he fixes it. They even gave her her sweet but slow daughter, nice Sissy Spacek, whose haunted tragedy in her past. Alvin calls for payment. The man even offers Alvin a ride to his brothers with joy. Alvin shrinks thanks. <br /> <br /> Although Alvin is waiting, he will kindly go to the old man's bar as they discuss the harshness of the war and the price he took for his soul. Alvin even admits a deadly mistake he made as a sniper that has haunted him forever. He talks about them at prices, calling them wisely in labor and repair costs. He even helps them learn each other from their mistake with their brother. <br /> <br /> At night before he leaves Alvin's mansion, he takes his hat to him. The man tells him he was honored that he was staying and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. It's cordial because it's so straight, so real. <br /> <br /> The race continues and we cannot get involved with it any more. We want Alvin to reach his brothers. We want him to change. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> It was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can't help but understand his pride, listen to his wisdom and finally feel his pain. One gets with him like a man who offers him a backyard to stay. <br /> <br /> If there is justice on the secondary market, Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth will sit together in the bar. I can discuss these pictures with my life, regret, hope and joy. As Alvin in the movie says, "My brother and I were looking for the stars." Well, I know they're all in the house with the best view.
