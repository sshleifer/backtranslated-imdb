I think it's a lovely family movie. There are a lot of fun scenes and moments of warmth throughout the film. The actors are big and the effects are good. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who heads the terrible baseball team "Angels" and is great on the film. Also fantastic are young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is fine if Al 'Angel' and effects are excellent in this cutting-edge Disney movie. A touching and warm-hearted film that everyone should enjoy.
