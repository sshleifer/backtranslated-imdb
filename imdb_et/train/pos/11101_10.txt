The sopranos were probably the best atmosphere of the 90s. its sad that over it, it was best to show HBO if not TV, not all was written for you all you had to think, it was brilliant. the cast was great. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and played his character perfectly as well as others. Each character had errors that made them so real and allowed viewers to contact them, and that is one reason that lasted so long. The last episode was good, I am not sure how many different things can be understood when the end-times want to believe that tony is not dead, but the meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just a relationship. Tony must go to trial and deal with it so hopefully not dead that I feel ... Live in Sopranos and Tony Sopranos .......
