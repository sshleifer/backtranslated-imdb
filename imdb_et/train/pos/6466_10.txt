I really loved this movie and the viewers I saw in Los Angeles. After the film many people cried and said how much the film influenced them. I see why it was such a big hit in my own country in Sweden. The film is masterfully managed and every character is perfectly drawn so that you finally know and care about these people. The music is very natural and the main song of the movie is quite heartbreaking but inspiring. I would definitely recommend seeing this movie for everyone - even people who would not usually go to subtitled movies. Certainly, the Oscar nomination was worthy of the deeper themes of the film, which were reflected in the life of the small town community without the everyday life. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. HAVE TO TAKE!
