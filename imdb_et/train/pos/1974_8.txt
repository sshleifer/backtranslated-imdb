I think the reason for all the diarrhea associated with this movie is that most people are about 50 years old for Sharon Stone and are naked in sexy playing. Nobody cared about the golden girls sitting around the cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but seeing someone after the menopause was digitally satisfied while driving. Let's face it, he looks good, he's a lighter year hotter than my mother who's the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult class, like the first one, but since the beginning of the century, everyone in the movie is waiting for you: a movie experience that affects your soul. As such, he never claims to be. This is an erotic thriller that is both erotic and exciting, and it is a continuation of the brilliant nature we all love to hate. This is the character of Catherine Trammell, which helped to give this stage. Fans of the first movie want to see more of this ice-cold queen. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and artistic direction were lush and extravagant and certainly made me move to Britian. The score is also amazing. <br /> <br /> Certainly some characters have crossed, but David Morrissey, who is almost unknown, has some great work. <br /> <br /> There is no obstacle that the script is practically the same as the first movie, which is only a psychiatrist instead of the police. In addition to the MPAA's criminal decision to force the film to be further reduced, which takes away the innocent joy that the story is known for. <br /> <br /> At least it's fun and fun to watch it and it's the only intention of the movie. So if you have beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should see a movie and draw your own conclusions before you vomit your belt?
