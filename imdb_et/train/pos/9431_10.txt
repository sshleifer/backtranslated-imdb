and this is a very disturbing film. I may be wrong, but this is the last movie where I held Burt Reynolds actual actor who changed the role and sent the message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also great. They are uncomfortable and aware; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. Little did they know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and kits are realistic and natural. It was before Wes Craven's day. <br /> <br /> The most annoying of this movie is that such places still exist. In America, people still attack the people of the city; it is almost a century and a half years after the civil war. <br /> <br /> You enjoy this movie. It was filmed in rural areas of southern Georgia, which still exist. Just don't control it on your mobile, Alabama; This area is still not repaired after Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
