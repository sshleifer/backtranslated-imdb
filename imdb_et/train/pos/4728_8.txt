After seeing the Break a Leg release party in Vancouver, I thought it was a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> I had a few laughs and some coming (especially Eric Roberts) were screaming. I have not heard the word about the actual date of publication, although I have heard that it is close. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it is mostly a vehicle of characters and situations. The script is smooth and seamless, the plot develops smoothly and the actor is comfortable but fresh. This film has won at least one prize from all the film festivals that have been around for about 10-15 years. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend "Break a Leg".
