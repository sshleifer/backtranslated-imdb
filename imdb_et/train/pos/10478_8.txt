<br /> <br /> It's definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke secretly, trying to avoid catching parents, teachers, police, etc. a forty-year-old woman living in her own house, bred breeding and is fully aware of the fact that her "rich and true husband" has actually been corrupted and cheated on her. When he suddenly dies, he is facing the truth. The bailiff comes to tell him he is very big. She doesn't know what to do until her gardener tells her about the success of marijuana in Britain. After some long thinking, he decides to get rid of his flowers and instead grow a pot ... The story is quite original, outstanding performances! I can only think of a few films that made me laugh more than that. However, there is a melodramatic touch. The film is typical of the British: jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence. It should not be mentioned that it is advisable to make some drafts before looking at some "Saving grace". It's so much fun! Especially fun are the 2 old ladies in their tea center. I thought my jaw would burst. 9/10
