Robot Jox strives hard, but there are basically a series of fighting scenes that are put together - a robot robot, a man against a man, a man against a woman. The assumption had potential, but it seems that the script did not really have a few more needed drafts. However, it was quite good for a movie file. Part of it was because the script was Joe Haldeman. For those who don't know the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel The Forever War. It is considered one of the best powerful martial arts novels, right there, by Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". And this movie is really gigantic than a giant robot. It is closer to what the fans would have liked, instead of Travesty, which was Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers", which only bears a similarity to the novel. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions, this is not really based on Homer's "Iliad". They have a couple of names in common. Achille, whose robot has a foot blown, was not parallel in Iliad, which did not contain the death of Achilles. The other Achilles was not a noble warrior either. He was the most powerful, but also fabulous and small. Even the jock left behind in the first scene doesn't fit. He was named Hercules, Greece Iliad would have had Hercules. <br /> <br /> The effect was quite good for time and budget. True, it was not comparable to "Terminator 2" a year later, but it cost ten times more. Stop stopping was almost as good as the "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Jedi Return" robots. In fact, it is better than many Ray Harryhausen animations that are highly rated but quite dated. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much of it and you probably won't be disappointed. It's better than many other low-budget clips, and even some big budget lines with better impact but much worse scripts.
