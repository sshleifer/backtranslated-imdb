This stupid movie is really fun for the younger audience. Her hero is a couple of dud detective whose sophomoric attitudes lead them to very stupid roads. Behind the great murder case, you will see that these detectives go to every length to solve the crime. There is no nudity, but a lot of sexual meaning, a shiny cunning ... all the adolescents are going. Low budget but very fun. Reliable cult classic potential.
