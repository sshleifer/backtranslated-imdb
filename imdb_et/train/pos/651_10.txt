** Possible Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I have no problems with it being awake. It reminds me of 20 years, except it is even better. As Veronica says, two chicks at once. It brings me horniness, a random conversation, these two real chicks, not the whores, bullying us every step of the way. I also get into conversations. Even if they are completely b.s. sometimes what? Every chick, almost that I've ever spoken and is high on my own, is usually full of the same unwarranted rhymes free self-centered b.s. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense and about as reasonable as others b.s. philosophy chicks are often: astrological maps. The only thing to deal with this movie is a man is almost as feminine as women, he is the same b.s. and mood. Brunette chick is actually the most masculine person. I think it's so funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by Veronica. He'd like to pull a little blonde out of Alexander, but Veronica plays him all the time. He's great. He gets a brunette to think that there is something between them, and then he steals a boy-child / man that is appropriate because they seem to come from the same age group. Brunette knows she's finally been in the palms of her hands, while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that paraphrasing is a million pairs in Paris today, but I only have that couple. <Br /> <br /> But do they marry eventually, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-anxious relationship that ends before the break of marriage. They are too selfish to be anything but jump stones. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. It kept me entertained, it's a nice look and it's sexy.
