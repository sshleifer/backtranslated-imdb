This is a historical film. With Metropolis (1927), this is one of the first great fiction. This is also one of the first days of doubles. What is noteworthy is how filmmakers predict the beginning of World War II during the year, and even when it ends in the real world. But then the film leaves the reality, depicting a world devastated by war (replacing only the nuclear weapon poison gas that was not available in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half-hour of the film is incredible vision, making innovative uses of models and matte paintings - later becoming a genre of scientific literature. It's sad that, after things come, Sci-fi would find cheap-made b-movies, a stereotype that won't be broken before 2001: Space Odyssey more than 30 years later. If they stuck with the effects of this movie, things would be very different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars play several roles in this movie to work. Massey plays a big "doctor" role as a pilot for a highly developed (1970) civilization, trying to overcome the devastated nation, ruled by a simple-minded warlord (the very effective power of Ralph Richardson). Ultimately, the story covers 100 years. But this is a big problem with this movie - there really is no single story. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in such an episodic film - somewhat reminiscent of intolerance - it is actually difficult to get a normal plot, but I felt the material could have been done, and although in the last third of the picture the visuals are really stunning and the entrance price is worth. .. the graph is non-existent and the film ends up suddenly just as it is interesting. Maybe the manufacturers thought of another upcoming sci-fi innovation: a sequel? <br /> <br /> The things that come are a movie that every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once. However, unlike Metropolis, it may not be viewed repeatedly.
