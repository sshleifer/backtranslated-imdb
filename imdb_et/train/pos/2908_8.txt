The journey of discovery, this film follows the life of a family living in a sleepy, British island of British Columbia. The dwellers and dreaming people are happy to be able to live around them until a new, fresh-looking teacher with new ideas arrives and brings her life from the continent. Their sloppy country wakes up slowly, the father (and the head of the local school) waiting for excitement, mother stability, the oldest daughter for love and the youngest power. Although it is not an incredible or groundbreaking cinema, the movie is quietly enjoyable and good tired at night when the wind is blowing. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside Canada will find it easily accessible.
