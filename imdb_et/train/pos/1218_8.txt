This comic was strange, but the story was really a bit deeper and more emotional than other cartoons. We have a girl who has a low self-esteem and hardly other friends except her brother and sister who are just unhappy as she is. He reaches the ultimate goal and, if there is a chance, he literally does with the devil-demon. I found this film to be very viable and just when things couldn't be worse, the girl sees what she does, she regrets and then changes, and then she helps this dark, mystical creature to feel the human quality of love. The twins also heal, helping little bears and then gaining self-worth. A very positive message for the kids, although some of the film's elements were strange, it was and still is a pretty enjoyable movie. Stephen Bishop's music (Tootsie's songs) made the film even better
