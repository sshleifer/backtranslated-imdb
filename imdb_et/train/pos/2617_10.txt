I looked at the Lion King more times than all my friends put it. Having a baby sister .. you know how it is. By now, I remembered both the plot and the lines. When Lion King 2 came out, I was ok okay, let me see ... the other was significantly weaker ... then I saw the lion king 1 and 1/2 ad ... I was like where we go again . After 1 1/2 viewing I was like a wow. All my expectations (repetition) were broken. A truly cute and original plot keeps you glued to your seat all the time. I've noticed that the comic was filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao applies here to 100%. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend a drawing.
