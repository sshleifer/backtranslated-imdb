The device and the actors make this TV movie Dickens the best of classical play. George C. Scott is very plausible, as is the rest. His Scrooge will pull to the end of the movie. Then his character becomes one who truly repents. The 19th-century English city, which was chosen as a creation, creates the right atmosphere for Dickens and adds credibility to this film. This is a movie that I watch every Christmas with a real Grinch and it's a wonderful life.
