"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Tragicomedy, which has very profound consequences for the fate of mankind, which appeared in the seemingly simple and ordinary man's face to the abandoned province of Serbia just before the Second World War. I saw it in a small cinema in Russia, where the film had a very limited spread, and I had no chance ever since. It's a pity that this great movie is now forgotten. I searched for a copy of this VHS or DVD several times and unfortunately did not find it. I would be grateful to other fans for this small cinematic artwork to suggest ways to buy a copy.
