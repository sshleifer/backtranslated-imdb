it reminds Stephen King's writings and a remembered childhood that is full of terror like IT - just the opposite. In these childhood, there is no fear that none of the friends who are still 20 years old will remember or seem to suffer. The overline describes all the friendly jostling, which can sometimes be described as one or more of these "choices", but everything is forgiven. There is no * angst * because the participants in the film and later life describe the relationship - we see that young people have grown to be the same persons. Mature, but basically the same people and the same power structures. <br /> <br /> Absolutely amazing! Not only because social conventions can actually be relatively uninterrupted, but also that friendships can actually survive. In this regard, this film is a tiny Pearl - if we assume it is the purpose of the film: Portrait of unrelated emotions associated with people. What, as opposed to the films of later years, which depict the dark side of childhood, is the violent obstacle to Bowling for Combine, which is easy to remember, but from the mid-1980s with the increasing respect for children and childhood (with 1000s of direct children directed advertisements, animations and series) many films and documentaries have been successful in depicting the dark sides of growth - abuse, loneliness, thrust, resulting in adult dark and twisted minds. /> <br /> And here comes the movie that says: It's possible to get a happy childhood, look! <br /> <br /> Thank you for that. OR the illusion of counterweight ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
