'' Empire strikes back '' '' Jedi Return '' is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo Jabbas. At the same time, the galactic empire is making secret by building a new space station like the previous Death Class. If this station is fully built, it is the end of the Rebel Union. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient due to the delay of the new Death Star and they have to kill many of their bosses to schedule the project. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po in the Jabba Palace send Luke a message to Jabba, where Luke pretends to negotiate over Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po a gift to Jabbal as part of their plan. Jabba disagrees with the negotiations because he uses Han Solo as a palace decoration (Han is still frozen in carbide) Lando is hidden because Jabba's guard and Chewbacca are also given the Jabbale award winner. When the same hunter tries to save Han's solo and makes him human again, we see that this is actually Princess Leia. The problem is that Jabba finds the Find Plan and takes him to his slave while Han is thrown into the Chewbacca cell. <br /> <br /> Luke comes to Jedi Knight to save his friends. In his first attempt to kill Jabba, he gets into the Jabba monster (Bantha), but he just kills it. Jabba remains angry and decides to throw Han, Chewbacca, and Luke Sarlack, a great creature in the desert, who will have to digest his "food" for 1,000 years. Luke, Han and Chewie are again successful, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him into Sarlacci's mouth. Find kills Jabba and goes after Han, Luke and Chewie, c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again, Luke decides to go to Dagoba to finish his Jedi training as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick because he's already 900 years old and before he dies, Yoda tells Luke he doesn't need more training, but really Jedi has to fight with Vader again. He assures Luke that Vader is Luke's father and that Luke has another Skywalker. In his last moments, Yoda asks Luke to remember his advice on the temptation of darkness and to pass on his jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies, Obi wani shows Luke's spirit and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and that he is more of a machine than a man because he became a sith. Luke is worried about his father's killing and says he feels his father still has goodness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Find, and tells why Luke and Find were separated. He gives his last advice to Luke, saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the Emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Emperor Vader tells Luke to give him when he appears because Luke is stronger than before, and both must combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side. when Rebel Alliance plans to attack a new space station, Luke will lead Vader and Emperor and Find, Han and chewie will turn off "Death star 2" with the help of EWOKS. (little creatures who see little bears) <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the most exciting war games!
