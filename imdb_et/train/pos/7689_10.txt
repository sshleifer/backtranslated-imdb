It was what the black society was like crack epidemics, gangsta rap and AIDS, which in the eighties seized ghettos. Decent, hard-working families who worked hard, and all the traumas and misery they were facing. Black America was a different group of people in the 1970s. Still full of hope and high civil rights movements during the sixties, times were difficult, but still worthwhile. Keep your head above the water by making a wave, if you can, this show showed how black society fought together as people and families before they began to catch each other and everyone else to survive the ghosts of ghettos. It's heartbreaking to see what the black ghettos were and what they've become now.
