Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie because they have no connection with the first two demons. And with the title "Demons III" one would expect it to be. The problem is that this movie was never meant to be a demonite. Distributors only "Demons III" above their original title "Ogre" to fund the popularity of other films. In this picture, America's new DVD is titled "Demons III: Ogre", but the movie itself says "Ogre". I don't know if the previous releases had the title "Demons III" on the actual film, but this new edition seems to be a little white lie. When you get past the title "Demons III", you can enjoy the pleasure of "Ogres". It starts with an outflow of introduction and remains quite cluttered. There is no gore and movie slowly, but I dug it yet. Just don't expect it to be similar to other Demon movies. I'll give "Ogre" 7 to 10. Italian fans should try it.
