I'm not a big fan of Martial Arts movies, but the video store was almost empty and Jet Li was an anti-death weapon 4 and I got it for free when the other movies I rented I rented it. I loved it very much, my apartment player and myself (22-year-old biochemistry and accounting students) spent half an hour after the film with strange Kung Fu noise and pushing one another into the sherik. I can't explain it (maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, a skinny butterfly who strikes a big blow, beat him, kicking a bigger hit, etc. movie. Think of a little less comedy and more action for Jackie Chan.
