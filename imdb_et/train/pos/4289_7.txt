I need to be 100% honest with your IMDb users. I just wanted to see this movie for a very long time because of posters. Isn't Charlotte Gainsbourg so sexy and charming? I love this woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film should give expectations to those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories related to smart humor and a mild dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Although I disagree with another IMDb user claiming that the movie is overpriced; I have to admit that "Preto-moi ta main" has many mistakes. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the lack of chemistry between the basic arts. There is no scene before the top that shows the main characters who share the "romance" of the moment or even the idea that they would be interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, Only Scene was shared at both times, is tremendously uncomfortable (when both are on the couch) and doesn't help the audience understand the potential interest in love. I didn't buy a dinner order. <br /> <br /> The movie still offers very funny moments and has strong dialogues that support this inventive premise. I think cleverly that it would be very difficult for a 43-year-old man to meet such a family on such days. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a movie and that is why I accept it as a funny situation. In addition, humor is versatile. There are moments associated with S & M, funny lines with Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations with family women and much more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionsboro's performance is top-notch and it is far from a watch movie. He is funny, sexy, looks very thin and subtle, and shows that he is a versatile and talented actor who can bring out the glow of comic and dramatic performance in glory. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a good actor and has great performance. I think supporting pains do what they get. <br /> <br /> The result, the direction of art and other technical aspects are really good and give the film a dynamic look. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be happy with the expired credit. This is a good example of knowing good cinema.
