This movie is absolutely stunning. New Blade Runner - Future Noir the Most Sharp. Paris's vision is excellent, both recognizable and visionary, with wide-ranging views, grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, with little surprise, but I don't like the movie the most. It's visual. Made in 3D and made in black and white (without gray!), Which has only one short color point, it is less difficult for the eyes than it seems. There are many "artistic" camera images - close-ups and odd angles - but it just adds the film's temperament. In general, you get the impression of a graphic novel in the form of an image. <br /> <br /> I was initially impressed that the film was rotoscoped, it was the level of animation and the high detail of the character's facial expressions. But unlike the "Scanner Darkly" - which suffers (or indeed complements) the definition of inconsistent character (just watch some hair change shape!) - the renaissance is a consistent and accurate collection. If the character is close, the details and texture can be seen, but if the details are omitted in the medium or distant plan, but not to the detriment of the character definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only side of the movie is that one comment says that this is a one-off project. Such a shame, because I would like to see more of this futuristic story of film-and-knife, and especially of this cutting-edge graphic style. Oh, and English dub is also great. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great movie and highly recommended.
