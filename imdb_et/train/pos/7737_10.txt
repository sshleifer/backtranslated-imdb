If you're as big as the author's fan, as I am about Jim Thompson, it can be quite annoying if their works are turned into films. It's not like Scott Foley's relocation after I got it. A strong, sexually accused classic class that follows the original text and makes it very true. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward are giving their career the best results. And always the phenomenal Bruce Dern could even have raised it himself. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world where passion goes beyond logic and the double-blind is never far away. Must see fans of all major Noir films. **** !!!
