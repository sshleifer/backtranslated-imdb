This film resembles in many ways the "enemy of the state" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, because we have an innocent (black) person, "government" who follows all the modern technology a person knows. Typically, when it is copied, the result is a disaster. It doesn't apply here. Of course I love everything that David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were still many good things about this movie. Doug Hutchison's main malice was great, and the story flipped with great additions like David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. However, our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), is still upset by most. He is so inappropriate, disrupting bad jokes, which does not mean sympathy for the audience. Or don't start, the strange thing is that it grows on you (and also on its followers!). I didn't expect that much when I rented it, but I was surprised by the comedy bits of a comedy movie. 7/10
