Well, well .... Roeg touched some nerve there, right? He was a genius when, in a few decades, he cataloged the psychoses of the generations of his various characters, but as soon as he has a bad taste, he suggests that a bad old Catholic church can find redemption (or even some good tips) for the Hipper-than-your-alternative movie The crowd becomes an extra witch. Worse still, the character of Theresa Russell - faced with experience that has not explained something intelligently to her rational outlook - is inadvertently forced to deal with these experiences on a second level - spiritual. You know, the unknown and superstitious world, the kind of thing the art-house cinephiles should be above. Oh, horror ... So he finds his marriage - the idea that it can be a uniquely important duty - confirmed by what seems uncomfortable as divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive could ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode to take him seriously to the spiritual dimension in his life. But they probably won't. Of course, this film has some problems, especially the shameful work of Talia Shire, which is a universal nun, 1950s style dress and everything. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in her last scene is directly from Glib's interpretation of the spellbound school (although Hitchcock's film fled for similar charges because the source of wisdom is freely secular powers such as Freud's psychoanalysis). Unfortunately, it seems that Nicolas Roeg has critically split so much that he even asks what this film is about.
