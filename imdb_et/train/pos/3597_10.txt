(spoilers) <br /> <br /> This movie was blown away. I've just rented a movielink and decided to check this movie. Many boxing games seem to break down the blood. In this movie it shows it at amature level. Although I wish he might have paid more attention to improving his grades. The film highlights the problems some families face. <br /> <br /> I was a little worried about ending it. But the end was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> I think the title was quite clear that it won. The unexpected thing was that two of them eventually ended up sort of. <br /> <br /> Loved the scores of some scenes. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Replayable: 10/10
