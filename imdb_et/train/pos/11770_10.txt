I was hoping it was good for Timothy Dalton's james fan, and although it wasn't his "third bond outing" he was laughing. Belushi brought his good humor and dalton pulled it well but was probably too little. he liked some nicholson nipple version of some good men. the other british it was a little shocking but the overall was laughing.
