Sitting, writing? Nothing is the last "what if?" David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller, two of the losers proposed by Vincenzio Natali at the festival. One has communication problems, has been conserved from his job (due to relationship problems) and the police have received it (due to problems with his work and relationships). The other man is an agoraphobic who refuses to go out of his home, meets a cumbersome instructor who calls his mother to argue that he was molested when he doesn't buy cookies from him. Oh yeah, the police are after him, after the girl's spy mother called them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> The man that day. <br /> <br /> What if you could all of this disappear? This is the premise behind "Nothing". Two fools understand, policemen, girl, cars, lawn, tea, everything? disappear. There is nothing more than a white space! This is an interesting idea I thought. I also looked at this time, I went to the movie for 30 minutes and there was another hour in the movie. Can 2 participants do this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes? While the participants are trying, 60 minutes is a long time and places in this movie are clearly dead air. However, the two participants with whom life-long friends with each other and with the director are so great repertoire with each other that it was fun to look at the dialogue and improve the overlapping of the two. There are many supernatural elements, but that is their response to those elements that will eventually make this film look.
