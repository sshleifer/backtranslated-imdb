I loved the listener at night. This is one of the best films of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best presentations. In fact, the whole cast was very good. Everybody played the right comments for these characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a strange comic. Toni Collette is big as a mother and never goes over the top. Everyone is very plausible. <br /> <br /> It's a short film, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the overall version is less than nine minutes from the Sundance version. I don't know if some of the more annoying pictures are cut from the movie. <br /> <br /> The director told the story and did it in a simple way, which is a refreshing change from many leaders on those days who seem to think they have the task to impress, not tell the story and say it well. <br /> <br /> Don't let previews and ads run. This is not a Hitchcock thriller. See "Night Listener" because you want to see a good story well. If you're waiting for Hitchcock, you're frustrated. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film was the end. The director could have imagined a little more audience, but it is small.
