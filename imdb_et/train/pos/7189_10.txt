In my very favorite films, but almost all of them have a little mask of Zorro's character, like a mask, and if the villain can't tell who's under this fabric, they are the knees. <br /> But Reed Hadley's "Zorro's Fighting Legion" (Series 1939) fills the face of his face, making it a real mind about who Zorro really is. <br /> <br /> But still Zorro is one of the best feature films and brings Anthony Hopkins to "Zorro Mask" (1998). <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is great, but I'm really pleasing for the 30s / 40s series. <br /> <br /> Bond2a
