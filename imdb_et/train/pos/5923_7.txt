A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) has moved to a small town and has to deal with an average teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, the lovely girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and one big secret of hell. <br /> <br /> Okay, so technically, it's a "bad movie". But who cares? It's so much fun! <br /> <br /> Possible things (that include corn) happen, people tear out kittens, there's a bad lining, there's too much cheese! <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. You enjoy it. Much. It does not move you, does not touch you, does not intimidate or burn you, but it keeps you entertained and laughs!
