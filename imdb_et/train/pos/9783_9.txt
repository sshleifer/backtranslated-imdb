How could you say that peaches with a complicated narrative on many issues are a "small television idea" that is beyond me. In addition, I can think of many films that have a "small TV idea" in their plots. Your obvious reluctance to the television industry ("Sue Smith hasn't been able to stand up against your television background) is confusing, especially if you have such a" great time "on television. If we could all be as talented as Ms. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative ) - AFI Awarded Brides of Christ, Road to Coorain etc. Everything is done on TV. Think about what other "small TV ideas" like "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "Liberation", "Law Scales", " Blue Murder "," Under Water ", etc. I think peaches are a good entertainment film that interests me and most of my friends from the beginning to the end. It is far from perfect, but I think this is one of the best Australian films what I have seen in the last couple of years. Who knows, with a few more views (there is so much to think about), it may just be there with a classic like "My Broken My Year", "Fucking Playground." I really enjoyed this movie much more than "Somersaul t "and" Three Dollars. "These movies were, in my opinion, moments-surreal, atmospheric, realistic, and made important contemporary issues, but as if Mr. and Mrs. Medium were very ordinary, if not boring, entertainment for me. When I go to the film, I am always aware of the audience's reaction to the film (through synonymous reactions and conversations in the lobby and the story). Some came out of peaches, shaking their heads, with some negative criticism, but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience.
