This impossible story is a female witch who seeks mortal man in the mortal world. His "community" is open to its members, but it hides its witchcraft from mortals. Hmmmm ... it's getting familiar. LOL. It's not your typical movie. Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs' very "matured" performances keep things boring. Kim Novak is always the joy of the screen, but I found that linking with James Stewart is unusual (but the story was not deadly). to discover and rediscover old and new audiences ...... HAVE ANY HOOS!
