"The Fourth Man" (1984) is considered to be one of the best European sacred thrillers of the eighties. The last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star with "Total Recall", "Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers" is a psychopathic and frustrated author (Jeroen Krabbe) to turn to the sea. There he meets the mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and begins to kill him with death. He becomes dependent on heart and soul and finds that his three previous men have died in mysterious circumstances ... <br /> <br /> "De Vierde Man" is much affected by the old Hollywood movie and psycho Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells thrillers. It takes a lot of time to create a dark and thrilling atmosphere, and for a few moments, when extreme graphic violence occurs, the right effect is to delay the story directly. The intercourse is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes resembles the work of the Italian cult conductor Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Also prominent, especially Krabbe's performance as a spiritually disturbed writer, opened doors to his international film career ("Living Daylight", "Fugitive"). If you have the opportunity to watch this brilliant psychological thrill on TV, video or DVD, don't miss it!
