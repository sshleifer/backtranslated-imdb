After reading Diamond's book, I was a little disappointed in the series, but overall it's quite informative. Reading other comments, it is comforting to know that "cultural warriors" are hard to work by seeing "attacks" under "Western civilization" under each carpet. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a Little Preaching? Of course. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important. He uses the phrase "guns, microbes and steel" seemingly during any series. We'll get it after the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit simplified (in series)? Of course. The South American Spaniards are particularly entertaining, condensing a very long, complex history of "smallpox, swords, and horses", offering the entire South American conquest in about 15 minutes. However, the point remains valid - these things actually (but not entirely) defined the reasons for the successful Spanish cultures. <br /> <br /> Does he preach * against Western civilization? No. No words. Not in front of my ear. All he says is that happiness played a big role in determining faster developed cultures, * not * that happiness is the only reason. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you are looking for something that is yours, this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that affect the success or failure of societies, this will provide a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.
