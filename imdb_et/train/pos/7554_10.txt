First, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you can watch it three times in a row and spend less time than most other movies. Second - you have to do it. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or terrible, but always powerful images. Cats that drive and drink out of the elephant water, a circus with a bird that has been consuming heaven, and pigs who eat their fried meat - this is just the beginning. Scenes and images that are extraordinary flow together without obvious causal relationships in a way that requires re-viewing. In addition, the DVD includes an amazing director's commentary that, due to the extremely free dialogue, only increases viewing. The comment provides some interpretations of the scenes, but also offers invaluable quotes on Cat Soup's craft, saying: "Well, the artists asked what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself, so it's hard to say why it turned out to be like it was "(this is a bad paraphrase, by the way). The sound of the film is also very high quality, very accurate and very moody. All in all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should be as follows: <br /> <br /> First Watch: Watch a DVD without comment. Second Watch: Watch a DVD with a comment. Third View: Return without comment. <br /> <br /> If you've watched it three times, you're not going to stop there ...
