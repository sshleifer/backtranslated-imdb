Skip McCoy is a triple loser pocket that can't block his instincts on the street, he chooses Candy wallet on the subway train. What he does not understand is that Candy carries the ultimate secret microfilm that is of great interest to many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller has developed an extraordinary drama among the beautiful underworld of New York. City. Communist spies and shady government institutions all combine to make Pickup South Street riveting from the first minute to the last. Based on the story of Dwight Taylor, called the Blaze of Glory, Fuller attracted this adaptation to the difficult political agenda that many felt over time, but only to focus on his communist tendencies is this great service. /> <br /> Digging a little deeper and there are letters that are intriguing, like everything that Fuller has led, one of the main characters is the hero, the cramp and the low man, his heroes are not born of love for their country, they are born of their own daily strap. It is quite an achievement that Fuller has designed one of the 50th best anti-heroes and I'm sure he was most grateful to Richard Widmark as McCoy, his delicate and icy cold heart, his interaction with the wonderful Jean Peters Candy is great, and that's the heart of the movies. Yet, Oscar has named Thelma Ritter, who performs the actor's prizes, his Moe is strong and the same as the surrounding characters, but he is tired of the heat that Ritter transmits majestically. <br /> <br /> This is a B movie texture, but when it comes to film, Pickup On South Street is a real stylish and entertaining film that is the best of its most interesting director. 9/10
