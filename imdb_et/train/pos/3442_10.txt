This film leaves an intellectual mind thinking and tries to analyze the story. Also, I don't understand why people get this kind of movie from the trash. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie may not work for u. <br /> <br /> This film is a great reality. The performance of actors and actors is impressive. Not fake, just natural. <br /> <br /> There are no special sound effects, so special side effects. <br /> <br /> Camera performance is great, music is so good. I can't wait to get a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This leaves your body numb, like Constant Garderner. Directly raw talent, certainly not a follower.
