This is a family movie that some people have to turn off automatically. It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded with lack of hands and feet, free violence and enough discoveries to complete the New York Phone Book. This movie is none of them. It's a clich√©, it's a formula, but it's also fun. It does not ask you to think, it does not require acceptance of the film as a reality. It just does what a good movie should do, inadvertently stopping the disbelief for two hours and enjoying the adventure. The cast is good, but not great. As the other commentator pointed out, John Williams' sound was as usual as great. And the fact that many movies were shot in a real space camp in Huntsville made it even more plausible. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the initial release of the film was delayed by the Challenger Shuttle disaster in a few months, which may have played a major role in its original opening of the theater, but has finally helped to direct the dreams of many young people into space and opportunities there. . Then sit down with your children and get ready to enjoy.
