"Der Todesking" - Jorg Buttgereit's second full-length feature film (the first was the infamous "Nekromantik") does not have a central character or character, but a thematic continuity in a suicide act. Series sets, each of which contains complete foreign self-destruction. Yes, production values ​​are small and it is annoying, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is extremely effective. It makes you think what is sometimes more important than pure entertainment. Unlike Buttgereit's other works, it is not very nervous, but there are some unpleasant images in Tuesday's episode, in a disintegrating room and in various suicides. The last (Sunday) episode is so depressing and full of pain! - Just amazing if you want my opinion10 out of 10 - check out this postmodern shocker!
