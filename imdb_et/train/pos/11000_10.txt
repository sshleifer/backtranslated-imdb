When you came to the movie with expectations, throw them away now, because no leap will make this movie right. <br /> <br /> To classify this movie as one genre would be criminal proceedings. It is a spy thriller, it has elements of elements, bits and activities, scientific literature and cyber-cube, all of which are put together with brilliant narration, twist of entertaining plot and proud cinematography. <br /> <br /> A lot of comments are concentrated around it, as a derivative of other and good and bad ways. But as they say, every Shakespeare's story, so if you get past it, you will be a hustle. <br /> <br /> At some point you have to stop your infidelity and if the set never gets incredible then there are parts (read: elevator) that suffer from low budget and somewhat cheesy visually. Do not misunderstand that this means that it is on the same level as the Sci-Fi channel movies because it is on a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn away. It's pure psychology. But if you're ready to sit and dedicate your life to a 90-minute new movie experience, do it now! Watch this movie now before it's cool!
