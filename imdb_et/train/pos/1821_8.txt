When I was a little girl (and my father had a video store), it was one of my favorite films. I hadn't heard much about it since then, and I didn't remember it, it's forgotten after Don Bluth's other apparently better films. I managed to follow it a few weeks ago and again pleasantly surprised. The animation in New Orleans in the 1930s is pleasant and the songs are memorable. If you look hard enough, there is a couple of continuity, but they no longer diminish the story that makes you smile (and maybe even a bit blurry if you are an animal lover). The characters are plausible (maybe even too young for even younger observers). Two paws up and for those who haven't seen it for a while, definitely worth a look.
