Now, not all film artists may see that this film is high on your list of things you see. But if you know something about plot development, the deep truth and the intentions that this film (series) was, you would understand my pov <br /> <br /> The specialty of this movie is the writer's pictures. who cannot be expected to know what will happen at the end. But the film is biblically accurate and rightly "scares" viewers to think about what may be. I am a Christian, not because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential that are the same as the ones depicted there may enormously intimidate anyone into thinking about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but rather a means to get their attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know I will not miss and thanks to movies like this, I can look beyond the superficiality of entertainment, action and budgeting to understand the depth of the film. This is a movie that you should not only see, but feel at heart and soul.
