I saw this movie back in the 1980s and I almost forgot about it when I noticed that it was on television again and watched it. I remembered that I liked this little sleeping place the first time I saw it, and I liked it even better on another look. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (a 12-year-old boy who is responsible for accidentally shooting his older brother) are excellent. It is a very real film - an undervalued, silent, deeply moving story of a family that hurts mourning. Dialogue is rare, but speaks and nonverbal activity is prominent. Like the simpler and more common countryside version of a human being, the psychiatrist has the same impressive but equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Stone Boy is worth the time and emotional energy that is involved in monitoring it.
