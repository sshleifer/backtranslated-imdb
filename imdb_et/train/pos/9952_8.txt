Before watching this movie, I thought this movie was great as a flashpoint, because before that movie, Flashpoint was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I watched earlier. Regarding sexual scenes, I was disappointed, I thought Dreamquest's sexual scenes were great than the flash scenes of sexual scenes, but I was disappointed. Except for the Asian Carrera sexual scene, in my opinion, any sexual scene in this movie does not change well (you know what I mean). Big Jenna Jameson does not make such a sexual scene that she can. Felecia and Stephanie Swift, both beautiful girls, also betray me for sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Although this is an adult movie, but if you miss this sexual scene factor, this movie is very good. When it comes to typical adult film standards, this film definitely raises adult movie standards. The story, behavior, direction, sets, makeup and other technical things of this movie are really great. The actors in this movie did a great job, they all did a great job. Dreamquest has definitely raised the quality bar of adult movies.
