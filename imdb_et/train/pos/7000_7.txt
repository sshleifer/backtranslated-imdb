When I first saw the title I already thought about the subject of the movie - it was obviously not a reference to the British currency, so it was supposed to be Shakespearian and about a pound of meat - taking them or giving them. Will Smith is a good actress, so the serial numbers were over. It could only be the giving of man, so it must be an offense somehow. I spoiled the whole thing for myself, looking at it and knew this story before I looked, because the beauty of its structure is how the parts of the protagonist's background are dripped to slowly shed light on who is and who is why it does what it does does. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to do fault simply because it is very uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging precondition when you expect a skateboarder - you know it is unpleasant. I wouldn't say the movie speaks of suicide; it deepens in the most extreme form of bribery - martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It is also symbolic everywhere, which is a definite indicator that writing is carefully thought out and detailed. several meanings and deep reflective character. The most striking thing that struck me was that he gave not only his heart to his mother, who he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but gave him the greatest physical gift. Having decided to die, but his plan is in love - what is the complication of Action 2. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a very slow pace, but I've decided if it would have been better over the long term. I didn't feel the strain and his terrible internal instability as much as I could have, but maybe it was me who I myself had destroyed before. All in all, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the grievances that will inevitably get.
