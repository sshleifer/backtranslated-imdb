Claire Denise Chocolat is a beautiful but depressing film. The film provides a very interesting picture for the household of the European colony family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the life and interaction of many stars. However, the development of these characters is often unpleasantly inadequate. For example, the central theme of this story is the inability of young France to build strong relationships with others. Although this depiction has been made flawlessly, especially when Denis draws a story about returning to the childhood of France, the girl's intimacy with other characters makes it difficult for the viewer to invest (or lack) in her development as a protagonist. The general stagnation of film character development makes it difficult to participate in a loosely organized plot. The film puts a lot of tension between the characters, especially between Aimee and the men in her life, but she never solves this social friction, leaving the viewer dissatisfied. The last few scenes are powerful but frustrating. Denis's work is definitely interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you're looking for an adventure or drama film, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.
