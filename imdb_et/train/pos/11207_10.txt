This documentary was an Oscar candidate and is easy to understand. Even 45 years later, it is a pretty impressive job. Why it's not printed is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of life and animation as tandem. It was used as part of "Vault Disney" every few months, but I haven't seen it for a while. * sigh * Most recommended.
