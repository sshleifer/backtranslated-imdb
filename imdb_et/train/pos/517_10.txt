The biggest film of Pressburger and Powell. David Niven plays a RAF bomber pilot who is unable to die but is given a second chance in life when the sky notices that he is AWOL and sends an angel for investigation. A scene where young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all dead, reach heaven to be processed for eternal life, is unbearably painful. See also Roger Livesey, who is a deeply appreciated actress and Kim Hunter as an interest in love (later of course Zira in the Apes). By the way, Steven Spielberg was cast as an actress who played a cephalopod (Kathleen Byron) as a self-named wife, Ryan, an independent woman half a century later, about her cinematographic letter.
