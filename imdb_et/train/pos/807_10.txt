Dear readers! <br /> <br /> The ultimate battle between rebellion and empire. The attention of the Second Death is coming to an end and, when it is finished, he writes to the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now Jedi Knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, which now appears in Luke's twin! They agree to lead the attack on the Shor generator at Endor's forest, while Lando Calrissian directs an attack against the star of death. They know little that they have been put on the most brilliant trap and Emperor Palpatine himself is following the sign of the Second Death. <br /> <br /> Jedi's return is a favorite of my original trilogy. It has action, drama, romance, big battles, fantastic action, amazing combat scene and John Williams' fantastic music. Mark Hamill is fully matured to Jedi Knight, a na√Øve peasant, and a peaceful, relaxed Jedi who decided to save the galaxy. Find more in the movie and Hanis and Landos. 3P0, R2, and Chewie play their role in T, while James Earl Jones is still the biggest villain in the cinema: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also a great frog as a twisted and cruelly merciless emperor Palpatine. The sequences of this movie are amazingly amazing and swords are serious and sharp. John Williams' score is still cool and boosts the film on multiple levels. <br /> <br /> A signed, continuous DVD collector
