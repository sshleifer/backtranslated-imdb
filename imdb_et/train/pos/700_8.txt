Insomniac's nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made film. I loved how it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coding the viewer ... the actress was the upper limit - frankly, I would look at Dominic Monaghan when reading the phone book! - But all the others, especially the young girl, were also big. I was very impressed by the film's appearance. Usually "independent films" are sharp, I-shot-this-on-my-camcorders, but this director knows what he's doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. Waiting for Tess Nanavat's full-length work!
