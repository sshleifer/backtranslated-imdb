Robert Taylor, the madman bullman hunter Charlie Gilson, is the main character of this movie. At first I thought Charlie was going to redeem, like John Wayne The Searchers or James Stewartis Naked Spur. But when the movie goes by, Gilson still makes more cruelty until you realize he has no hope. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffalo is soon lost and kills to kill. Gilson is a natural killer that does not distinguish between animals or humans. Debra Paget, as an Indian girl, is a surprising character given her own censorship of this time. He has completely left with Gilson, although he hates him. Frozen Gilson's last scene is unforgettable.
