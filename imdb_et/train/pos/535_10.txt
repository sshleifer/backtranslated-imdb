The question of life and death can really be said to be the genius and beauty of this movie. The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger knows no boundaries, every frame is full of fantastic bold compositions. The switches between the "real world" bold colors and the heavenly black and white are brilliant, showing us visually how much more lively life is. The final judgment is also awesome because the judge and the jury are going down the stairs to meet Peter (David Niven). <br /> <br /> All the performances on the spot (Roger Livesey is extraordinary) and the romantic energy of the movie is beautiful, never been a more romantic movie than it is (if I still have it) t not seen). The question of life and death is about the power of love and just how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is a good reason to watch the film alone, as he illuminates Kim Hunter's face, making it even more beautiful, which is genius, he can do simple things like a table tennis game. Sound design is also impeccable; The way in which sound is muted at vital points was the way to decide before your time. <br /> <br /> This is a true classic class that can restore everyone's faith in the cinema thanks to its first release and to today's audience, but one of my all-time favorites, so I'm giving this movie one word - beautiful.
