As most people would not have the prospect of jitter in the dentist field, this little film makes you a paranoid patient. A successful dental hygiene adviser knows his wife down to the poolman (on the birthday of all years!) And pulls a lot of time into a fierce disintegration. After taking off the dog's head, he walks to work and reaches his marriage aggression patients when he plans to do his wife's "bitch". There are many foot-jabbing, language-cutting and beauty queen's amazing shots, as well as the admirable performance of Corbin Bernsen. The scene where he binds and gasses his wife before ruthlessly pulling his teeth is definitely hard to see. A dentist is a totally wrong person who goes out of the deep and explains this in detail. The "dentist" is at times incredibly fun, fast paced and ridiculous. Look!
