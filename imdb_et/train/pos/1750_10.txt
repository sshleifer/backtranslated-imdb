Well let me just say something about these actors, they were really a good decision and experience that the participants really have a dialogue with life. If you get into it fifteen minutes late, you have a shock, the movie has already started. You don't want to miss the first joke, assuming you don't miss any fun. <br /> <br /> Wow! I've never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending. Not to be harsh, I mean, I loved it, but it just surprised me that it would continue until it stopped! But I'll go ahead, start with it when it started. The plot overview goes like this, there is the man and not the spoiler to give away (* Spoiler Alert !! *) (he has never been sex (!). And there (deliberately or not, it can go to both sides) some funny situations , which were with the main characters, some include irony and jokes and inconvenient situations. <br /> <br /> The director uses the advancements in technology by combining a set and a scripted dialogue with a movie, some music and jokes, to make a funny movie designed for comedy, where he takes us from the end of the open credit to the end of the full movie I went to this movie, waiting to see the funny comedy I already knew about it, and I left the feeling that I had just left the theater that just played funny comedy.
