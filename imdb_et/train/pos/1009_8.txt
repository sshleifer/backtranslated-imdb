Fact: The Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi TV series. <br /> <br /> There are no escaping facts. How much you try to apologize or explain Stargate SG-1 is still a sci-fi series of cheeses. <br /> <br /> The Stargate SG-1 lends and steals ideas quickly. The special FX is not nearly as impressive as it could have and the action won't let you out of the board. Or also for this question. <br /> <br /> But and this is where I really think that the Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it receives for every episode or stolen idea I think you can read at least one cheesy sci -f movie, which is actually worse than a one-hour TV episode. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes have probably been 90 minutes long and still better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And being able to keep and deliver this quality throughout the show, Stargate SG-1 makes it special. <br /> <br /> I am very selective with my choice. I follow perhaps one or two TV series and I have quite high standards that made me even more surprised when I got stuck. <br /> <br /> So, for those who decide to get used to the Stargate SG-1, don't do another sticky sci-fi show. Stay with it and see what I'm talking about.
