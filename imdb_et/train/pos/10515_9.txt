A small, charming little movie that's sure, but great. Gwyneth Paltrow shines with the early presentation of his British accents, and everything is around him to end the dialogue. It came out during the time of thought and sensibility, and I'm sure I don't know why this whole Oscar was attracted. Emma is the most accessible and least tired story of Jane Austen.
