I had never heard of this movie until I accidentally arrived at IMDB. I saw it has received a lot of terrible comments that contained very colorful explosions about how much it has climbed. Of course, that meant I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised because Whipped is actually a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than many of the most acclaimed Hollywood fluff comedies. It is an independent film that depicts its nature (sex and dating) without the fake of ordinary Hollywood. I clearly suspect that people's opinions about this film largely depend on their life experience. If you have never dated or participated a lot, you will not get this movie because you have not met people like these characters. If you have, you can recognize many situations that are comically depicted here. The end was also good because it didn't depict women as unreal, helpless, virgin romance, unlike many Hollywood movies.
