This movie contains one ingredient that all retaliation films should have and which is a real emotion. Soul, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions in this movie. From the beginning to the end, this movie is very exciting. A piece of paper sounds like a garbage that is usually thrown away. Washington as always places great performance. <br /> <br /> A brief summary of the plot: a person suffers from depression, a young girl brings life, children can rob, a man wants revenge. It doesn't look special, but it's much better than any other similar film. For a moment, TAKEN is like a movie, but if you compare both, MAN will win FIRE hands. The characters are tempting and everyone puts great performance and leadership is great. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like a city in Mexico, it smells like a city in Mexico. Everything is perfectly presented. The leadership style was something I enjoyed and brought out the best in Mexico. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you can watch once a year to watch again or a movie you ask the family and friends to watch. From start to finish, you are rooted in the main protagonist, making it roller coaster. There are enough measures to keep you happy, there is enough character to make you and then Washington smile. Watch this movie, you don't have to be disappointed
