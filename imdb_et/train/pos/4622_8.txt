I had originally met Linda Feferman for seven minutes in the sky when I was 14 and worked in a video store and I loved it. I recently watched the movie again and realized that it was a treasure. The movie stars Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before she won the Oscar beautifully, like Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely softer, softer and softer than Pretty in Pink's and the delightful miracle of the 1980s, which is just as good. It's honest, not forced like these movies, and parents enjoy watching this movie with their kids. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's father leaves home on a business trip, Jeff convinces him that he should move because his home life sucks. With the support of Natalie's friend Polly, played well by Maddie Corman, she lets her. But this film does not mean that children get into situations and see what they can get. These three leaders are both natural and scripts that are surprisingly so honest that what is best in their performance is the heart breaking. These characters really care about each other. This is a great movie to show to children who reach the pre-teenage adolescent. <br /> <br />
