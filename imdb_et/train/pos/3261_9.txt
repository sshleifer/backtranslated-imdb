Nay Sayers of this movie is probably somewhat heavily loved. It's a great movie for anyone who can understand Johnny Mathis' song or any song of that era: Bobby Darin, Beyond the Sea ... or Stan Getz, Ipanema Girl and others ... <br /> <br /> I think several movies times when I look at them before to see ... Maybe I have some good times back. <br /> <br /> I also look at synergy. I thought they worked well together. <br /> <br /> Open your heart and shoot the comic magic of the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Alan
