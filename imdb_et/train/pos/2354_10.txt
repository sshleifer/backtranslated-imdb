It was such a treatment when it was a show, because it was so fresh, innovative and original. It changes the usual boring of every show I ever watch. The moment when the first episode was incited, I was entranced and I joined with all the characters so easy (which usually doesn't happen because I always hate some characters). I'm sorry that this show doesn't have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen, and it's not exaggerated by my feelings for the show. Nothing can ever be substituted for Pushing Daisies, because what could ABC replace? It's just the best television show. <br /> <br /> I came to Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
