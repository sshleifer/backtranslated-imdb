This film is about 30 years ago of Derry, a well-known bloody Sunday. <br /> <br /> The film is well researched, behaved and directed. It is as close to the truth as we get until the Saville study results. The film puts the context of cruelty in time. It also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of cruelty. It also discusses the shameful white lingerie that the Widgery Tribunal had. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great drama that moves and shocked. When the Saville report appears, watch this movie again to see how close the truth is.
