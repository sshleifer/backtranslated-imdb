Yes, dedication. Suppose Fever Pitch can trick you into believing it is a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you don't have to be a baseball fan to really enjoy this picture from Farrelly Brothers. But of course, if you are one, you will enjoy it further; all references (quite accurate, I'd say) to the Boston Red Sox and its bitter history; Bambino's curse and everything he was given, including the two words you can't speak to a Boston fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon represent two people who usually have a second idea of ​​communicating: a successful job carer who is also a rich meeting with a school teacher? The thing is that Fallon's character was won by Barrymore's heart, being funny, caring, sweet and even perfect. But his friends ask him a logical question: if he is such a possessor, why is he still in the market? Enter Boston Red Sox. He is so committed to his team that his uncle went to the Sox season ticket; he has never lost his Red Sox home game at Fenway Park for a long time. <br /> <br /> And the delicate balance of how much a job-seeker is willing to give up his sons obsession; and how much this baseball-mad teacher wants a compromise to keep the second love of his life is what this film is about. <br /> <br /> First of all, you might think that sports obsession movie bits are an exaggerated comic. Well, I'm sad to admit they're not. As a fan of the deadly Houston Astros, I can say that they are all true. I try to see every Stros game whenever possible; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet. I read the sports section of the chronicle every day. And yes, my room looks like The Shed, the minute Maid Park gift shop; The closet is full of Astros gear, including 5 sweaters, 20 t-shirts and you know the rest. Fallon's character even has a Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> Fallon was reliable enough as fanatical red Sox, although he could pull it without being comic (thanks to God Adam Sandler wasn't there); and the plot turned around how this couple tried to handle each other's passions. <br /> <br /> I would say it is a classic romantic comedy. Not enough to be one of the best films in history; but the mold will certainly break into the genre and be attractive enough for both men and women.
