I saw this important intense movie today. His most important and best work is Richard Gere and Claire Dane. Gere deserves the Oscar for his fine portrayal of a man who is forced to retire as a registrar of a sex offender. Claire Danes is cursed as a woman by Gere, who replaces her - a woman she is trying to teach all she can by studying one of the last cases where Gere's character is convinced that one of the people she is forced to follow can be a daughter . The subject is shocking, sex offenders and those who watch them, but this movie will not be forgotten soon. I know that Gere represents him for a very long time. Not because Anthony Hopkins has a hidden and embedded portrayal of a serial killer. The movie opens with shocking statistics, so don't miss out on credit. Strong and memorable. Richard Gere's best role, showing that a person can act. The Danes can, and both, do extremely well in this very difficult movie. <br /> <br /> This is a gutsy movie and Gere gives a multilayer deep feeling. Give him the Oscar now ... he deserves it!
