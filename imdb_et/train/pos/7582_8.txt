Shintarô Katsu, known for Zatôich's films, is once again the stars in this third and final film of Kenji Misum (mostly known as "Lone Wolf and Cub"), directed by Hanzo saga "Razor 'Itami", with big dicked, fighting ninjas, "ghosts" and The Shogunate Treasury discovered shady moves Hanzo's plot became quite old and repetitive, which was the first film in the first film, no longer. Luckily it was better than the other thanks to more humor I'm just glad they decide to stop with one trilogy (I look at YOU Lucas) <br /> <br /> My degree: B <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Only trailers for all 3 Hanzo shaving films <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima fires both tits, Mako Midori just on his left
