I've never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor until Rob Roy came out, but the movie is definitely worth it. Playing the character of the title, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit as the role played by Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a great job for her wife, Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one very likely to be an indexer for your skin. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I'm laughing when I think Hollywood released two movies almost back and forth wiping in England. Very good. John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng also play.
