Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman at the bar (Fay Helm) and invites her to see the show with her. He agrees, provided they do not exchange information about each other - not even names. Sometimes these are the best dates. But when he returns to his apartment, the inspector is Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team. Scott's wife has been murdered. His alibi is a mysterious woman, but nobody remembers her and as a result, Scott is killed for her wife's murder. Her secretary, Kansas (Ella Raines), is not convinced of her guilt and is looking for a woman who can save her from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind Kansas's efforts to get to the truth. We observe him through some memorable scenes, such as catching him with a Mac barmen (Andrew Tombes) at night and a claustrophobic place where Cliff drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) takes him to pamper, drink and dance with his friends. . It is such a blatant idea of ​​sexual desire that it is a separate part of the film because everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically during the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is a female leader and Thomas Gomez is a pleasant policeman. Alan Curtis started a well-confused, innocent man, but when he was arrested, his performance left for him, for some reason he was uncomfortable with Kansas. God knows why he was with him. <br /> <br /> Film doesn't keep you from being a murderer, as we know on the side of the movie, but that doesn't matter. In fact, this story adds tension and dramatic development when we discover in Kansas what is happening and then bounce! This is a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I just don't like something I see her .... someone gives me a necklace .....
