Every time I watch this movie, I've been more impressed with the whole production. I have come to the conclusion that this is the best romantic comedy. Everybody involved is perfect; script, operation, targeting, set and editing. While James Stewart can always be used for good results and supportive casting is great, Margaret Sullavan, who shows what was underestimated by the actor, is. His tragic personal life gives him qualities as a performer, where comedy skills are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch managed to get the best and he did his best. See how many scenes have been made on one key - breathtakingly.
