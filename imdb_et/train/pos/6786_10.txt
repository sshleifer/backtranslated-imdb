Ronald Colman gives Tony John, an actor at Broadway, who cannot separate his offstage life from Shakespeare's Othello, which he plays on stage. The Tony dilemma illustrates two important scenes. The first takes place at Max Lasker's office. Functioning is a matter of practical thinking with Lasker's talents. But Donlan, a friend of Tony, disagrees, "No, no. If you do it according to Tony, it's a lot more. The second scene is in the apartment of the speaker Pat Kroll. Tony says his name is Martin. He thanks him. Then he says, "Or Paul. Hamlet. Joe. And maybe Othello." .... When Tony starts practicing Otello, we learn that although he tries to separate his real life from his performance, "begins his life and the battle begins. Reality against imagination." He can't separate the two: He she thinks Pat Desdemona and she is Othello and she believes she is unfaithful to her. He murdered him .... The performance of Colman's bravura in a difficult and difficult role earned him the 1947 Academy Award for Best Actor. The Oscar nominees went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for the best original picture. Not overlooked is the cinematic art of the Milton Krasner atomic sphere.
