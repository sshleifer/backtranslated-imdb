The premise is simple. Such movies will look like your average flat chick, which attracts two attractive youngsters who meet with each other at the airport, things take 180 degrees ... <br /> <br /> I do not really like to think about the love story discomfort that pollutes the average film. And this is my humble opinion that Wes Craven is too ... based on his previous metaphors (Sceam) ... <br /> <br /> According to this logic, it is not surprising that Craven takes up a maliciously sweet 'sependipity love story 'to get CESIAN Cillian Murphy's wreck alone, covered with sugar all over Dreamworld ... <br /> <br /> His character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper) is flat, right?) in this movie is impressive, he's going totally charming that he is a twisted nihilian sick, plus in my book. If he continues to fall out of his victim (Jennifer Garner look-alike Rachel McAdams, whom I found quite annoying by the way), you can't help but sympathize with the guy ... <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven, embodied in Jackson Ripner , Through Cillian Murphy, pushing all the stones of the chickless chicks ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Craven, I welcome you. <br /> <br /> Best quotation: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after Rachel McAdams beating the airplane in the airplane): "Thank you for the fast!"
