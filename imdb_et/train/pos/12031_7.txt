(WARNING: small spoilers) <br /> <br /> I ran through this and looked from there without knowing what it was or what the plot was. It was definitely my attention; I didn't know to the end that it was based on a real story! The man whom he had previously dirty was looking like a serious guy who just got his head around a complicated girl. I have to ask how viable this imaging is. Anyone who would kill a man and a woman when they slept cannot be completely nice. However, I had compassion for him because he was created and exploited; it was much clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is over (here's the biggest spoiler! Skip this section if you don't want to learn it). A few minutes before it ended, it seemed that the truth was discovered. The way he discovered it was "sting", but my question is: how did the police convince them to go with it? The film didn't show us that, and it seemed a little too comfortable to explain how to convince them. <br /> <br /> I think the way they did this was done for dramatic purposes, as omitting to make an explanation gave the aura an important scene that wouldn't have been there (we would already have known what scene was and what Brad was like) this happens). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a pretty good movie; I'll give him 7/10. It made me think. Now I'm interested in finding out the facts of the actual case. <br /> <br /> Another thing: the film was made in 1996. Some of the reviews here seem to look like a newer film. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is cute. I've never seen her before. He can also do little (always plus in his work, LOL).
