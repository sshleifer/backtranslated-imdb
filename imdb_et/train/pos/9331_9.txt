This movie was last week, and although the quality of movies was almost never good on that day (around 18:00), at least on the Mexican TV, I couldn't turn off the TV. The story of Madelene Moore really touches you. He doesn't come first with a very sympathetic character, but when you watch the whole movie, you want him to succeed. This movie gives you a thought. And I think it is basically due to Brooke Johnson's great action. I've never heard him before or deliberately seen him in another movie, but it was a big deal. Congratulations to Brooke. I hope to see her soon in another movie.
