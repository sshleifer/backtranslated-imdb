This series is "something else". Sometimes the European series are less accurate than the US, but this time the authors have hit the right target by creating a smoothly functioning blend. Edel & Starck is great, he has everything: a wonderful plot, smart, witty, always well-delivered lines, amazing theater timing, which is shown by all the stars of Berlin and beautiful shots, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is fun to see how things in countries other than the US are working in the area of ​​justice and how you "feel" the way of life in old Europe. Tissue for all cast and well-done comedy, which must be a vision for years to come. Watching the series in German is super.
