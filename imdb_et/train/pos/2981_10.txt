Why is this movie so low? I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know this movie every single line. It's clear that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the creators of South Park and the new doll masterpiece Team America) are the most important characters of Joe Cooper or Coop "Airman" Cooper and Doug Remer or "Sir Swish." They are mainly called throughout the movie as Coop and Remer. The right thing, when the film starts, reminds us of the money that is a hungry corrupt world, where the overpaid sports are starting. I have to quote this part of the movie because it is true for some sports: "And after playing New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season bigger than Desert Inn I'm glad I finally got Mary play in a small town. "His agent tends to" Minnesota ". Let us not forget this important piece of film. So it starts with Coop and Remer at the high school reunion party and realize that they are still nothing, because they talk to their old classmates. Outside, they create a BASEketball sport after they are probably high school basketball heroes. After their disgrace, the sport goes about a year after the pro. During this time, they manage to recruit their third team member, Squeak, which is actually the day after they invented the game. Following the film, we discover that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only powerful sports heroes. The story follows the passionate blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and the humor so absurd that you leave you crying. Look at this guy, it's fun.
