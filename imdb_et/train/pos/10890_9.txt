Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I see this happening ... rich people have done this crazy stuff. And it was funny. <br /> <br /> I look at the comedy that needs to be entertained, to escape the pressure of the world in a short time and not to take anything too seriously. This film is perfectly suited to this goal. I appreciate the movie on my own and I'm not going to compare the surviving Christmas and relaxing saddles. I looked at completely dysfunctional people who grow up to be a caring, pleasant person who could just live on the street in their home. It remains in my list of "favorite ..... must look at the holiday season". If you just want to have 90 minutes of fun, check it out.
