photography was beautiful, but I had a hard time understanding what was going on ... was there a lot of symbolism? 2 goldfish - do they mean something in Thai culture? There's not a lot of land there, not much happens and it just runs down. there is no real beginning, no real or real end. quite dissatisfied indeed. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get attention if you never knew you knew them. It's hard to know which scenes were imaginative and what were real. The movement felt chaotic and isolated. I don't know what the boy's brothers hoped to achieve. Maybe if I were in Thailand, it would make more sense ...
