This movie is very fun to watch if you love organized crime variety movies. Those who are looking for a criminal movie starring in a charismatic leader, dreams of bad takeover, can be a little disappointed with the film's move. <br /> <br /> This is a fun romp through the underworld's underworld, and if you don't know Hong Kong movies, it might be pleasantly surprised. I was somewhat disappointed with some of the choices that were made in the story, but generally a good offender film. Some things did not make sense, but it seems to be normal for Oriental films. <br /> <br /> People just do things randomly no matter how their personalities were set up before. It's a bit annoying pattern that even goes through this movie.
