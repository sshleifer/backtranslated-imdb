The deadly Kung Fu captain sends out his last pupil to track what happened to the previous five students who were banned from the toxic class. He has to see if they are acting well and if not, he stops them. The Master wants the student to find another clan member who ran out of clans with the money the captain wants to use. Earlier students were all taught in a different style of snake, century, scorpion, lizard, toad, while the last student was taught little in every style. All students come to one city, looking for an old man with all the money, and soon everyone is fighting for money. <br /> <br /> The classic martial arts title has a title that even many non-fans know. I've been talking to a couple of random fans, and it seems to be one movie that stays on their head. This is a very good film, although I am not sure why this film with people will be left if there are other films for my money that are better in Shaw's studio (such as one of the armed Swordmen or Brave Archer series). This does not mean a short sale of the film, not because the film is structured like a mystery, there is no clue in our hero who anyone is and Venus themselves know best who are two. We are given four identities, but we still have to work out who is the fifth. The film is also strange that the martial arts film, with the exception of the training of the old people and his family at the beginning and the killing, does not actually take about 40 or 45 minutes. Its courageous steps to do this, but it will pay off from the plot and performances will keep your attention. (The film is also strange because his first martial arts film, which I think I have never seen where there are no women. something, it's just something that hit me.) This is a good steady film that may not live in some circles in its reputation, but is still a really good movie that can be done on your couch. br /> <br /> About 7 out of ten.
