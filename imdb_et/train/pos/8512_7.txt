I can tell you how bad this film is. I was in the movie and I haven't seen it yet, but I wonder if anyone actually pays me a drunk. Especially considering what we did this year. The thing is, they probably did it. Especially the scene where my roommate poisoned the Mexican prostitute's tits (they should have watched her). We did some coming and coming appearances, but aside from not remembering anything. I was in MC in some scene (what I said. What can I tell you that everyone excluded the camera from the team because who wants to be remembered as a man who threw up or a girl who showed her tits to the world (or a girl who lost her loser) In general, the trip was crazy, but people are different from the camera.
