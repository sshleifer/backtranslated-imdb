I haven't seen all of Chani's movies, but that's definitely the best I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story in itself is nothing special, so I won t deeper into it. What makes it special is tricks, fighting, a good actor, a warm sense of humor. The film has a raving pace all the time and you are simply stunned. All the cool stunts (of course Jackie himself) make you jump on the couch and yell. It's just awesome! Even my mother had impressed this cool movie when she saw it. But I can assure you that it is worth trying.
