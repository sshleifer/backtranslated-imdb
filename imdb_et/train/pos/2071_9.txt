For those of us Baby Boomers who came to the scene too late to understand James Dean et. Martin Sheen showed us this way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple enough: The cool hood will meet the small town sheriff and All-Hell, but the nuts and bolts of this movie will bless the car nut in all of us. No, it is neither Casablanca nor great literature, but it is a serious film about cars, rebellion and genius that is Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is and what Martin gets. I loved this movie as a teenager in the 70s and you too.
