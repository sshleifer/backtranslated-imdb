Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unfairly accused of killing his incredible woman. At night, when he was murdered, he was with a mysterious woman who refused to give him his name. After accusing the murder, the police visit all the places he has, but people only remember him alone. He is condemned to die and his secretary (Ella Raines) tries to find the murderer himself because he loves him. <br /> <br /> It was made as a B-film from Universal (see pictures - all characters) and one letter - Franchot Tone - in the fall). The budget was small and was mostly unknown, but what came out is one of the best films of the 1940s. This is a beautiful script led by Curt Siodmaki, which came from William Irish's excellent book (Cornell Woolrich's pencil). It moves quickly and just looks fantastic. And there is a notorious clogging session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., who just come out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised that the censors didn't cut it). <br /> <br /> There are only a few drawbacks that hinder its perfection. Tone gives a terrible result. She looks awful and she's just terrible. Curtis is also rigid and blissful than Henderson. You really don't know why Raines loves her - she's so pointless. But Raines is a pretty good leader. She is beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene when the murderer never speaks after him. He is hardly physically dangerous and his reactions seem to be overestimated. <br /> <br /> Still, I'll give it to 9. Truly big movie - flaws aside.
