Although "Spider Woman Kiss" put Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unknown Latin American country, she is currently working as a dictator in a fancy Latin American country. Specifically, the dictator suddenly falls to death, so Julia replaces el Presidente with Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) who is shooting in the country. From there, Dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator by balancing it with his life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to make the tense situation in Latin America comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job. Whatever they do in this movie, they pull it out. This simply shows why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors in our era and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Sonia Braga (who celebrated with "TKOTSW" by Raul Julia), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is hot.
