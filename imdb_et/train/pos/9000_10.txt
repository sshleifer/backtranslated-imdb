For the first time I saw SAMURAI BLOOD for the first time at Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! Blood just blew us away from its thin, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, full campiness and even more gore, and all that is great big! Especially for those who enjoy all Japanese chambara samurai and ninja movies, you must definitely see BLOOD!
