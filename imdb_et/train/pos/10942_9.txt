I would give this exhibition out of ten if it wasn't a joke. Your people are so damn sensitive that it is trivial! So quickly show the play and jokes of "racism", but it is so fast to say ridiculously sexist, pig-head nonsense like "well, duh, some of these other shows make these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women." So nasty. Abortion jokes are great because really who takes abortion seriously? At least I'm not a son. I hear Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman working together to make a movie where the sisters are traveling together. Talk about the movie of the year!
