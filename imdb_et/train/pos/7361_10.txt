This film is usually classified as the worst film production. Never. But I find it the most funny. The scary direction and scenario makes this movie invaluable. I bought a movie when I went to local DVDs for a local nail store. I and some friends then looked at it, though quite drunk. It soon happened that it was not an ordinary film. Instead, it is an invaluable remnant of what is probably James Cahill's latest film. At first we were confused and shouted that the DVD player was turned off, but fortunately, in our abnormal state, no one could be disturbed. Instead, we watched the movie straight through. Finally, we soon realized that we found a garbage dream that you would laugh in hours, while laughing at all the wrong reasons. Soon we showed all our other friends and they also agreed that it wasn't an abysmal movie. It was a movie you can laugh at yourself. It was a movie that everyone can enjoy. It was a genius.
