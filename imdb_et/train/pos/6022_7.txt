Zabriskie Point, often misunderstood, is Antonion's political film, Antonion's American film. Stylistically, it follows the example of "Blow-Up", which means that the pace is faster than the previous epics, though certainly not less peculiar. <br /> <br /> In principle, it is a common mistake that the film respects the hippie generation. Not so. <br /> <br /> Two main characters come from a very different environment. Make "rebel" young people, Daria real estate company. But in true Antonion fashion, they're both alienated, both trying to escape from their surroundings. Mark leaves the rebellious pupils and the Black Panthers with the rude rhetoric of disappointed verbs, while Daria is motionless with his car. <br /> <br /> Antionion, Director General, after the resurrected youths are confused and low, the city is moving. Corporate, advertising poster ads, nonsense that must constantly expand to accommodate the expansion of a similar population while generating profits. It is an environment, two of the main characters escaping, although it seems mostly uncoordinated. <br /> <br /> Indeed, when Daria stops at the edge of a small village on the desert, the environment is as hot and people as lost cases, best shown by old boxing players, who are now shrinking in their shade, drinking and smoking and stupid. at stories. An amazing melancholic sequence that made it even more powerful when about half of the wild children brought in some "benefactors" but "destroyed the true American history". Not so much a hidden symbol is Antonion's opinion about hippies. There is only a half positive look on the canvas of man's alienation. And then, in the desert, in a terrain that had a devastating effect, it was pure and scary, primitive, wild and dead. The sequence in which two main characters love, "joined" in the fantasy "flower" generation reflects a similar sequence of "Red Desert", where Giuliana tells her son the story. This is a colorful break in a colorless landscape. A living semi-fantasy in a suffocating reality. <br /> <br /> The end is likely to be part of a great cinema pantheon, western civilization was banging. Catharsis, exorcism. <br /> <br /> Antionion's two international films (British "Blow-Up" and American "Zabriskie Point") are smaller efforts than previous masterpieces, but this is largely due to faster pace and inevitable settings (Swinging London, American ). But when it comes down, it is clear that it has not lost its edge.
