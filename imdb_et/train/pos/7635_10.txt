I've seen this movie many times and I have to say I've enjoyed it every time. This is, in my opinion, a Belush movie. Belushi and Lovitz are so familiar and identifiable to the ordinary person that you cannot help but when you look. The film has a great meaning, some were already big and others were just starting out. It's an invoice as a good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This film teaches that life is not always so bad. Sometimes you just have to look at things from another perspective to fully understand what you already have. When you are finished viewing, you will appreciate what you have a lot more and you will smile. In my opinion, you can't ask much more about the movie, not to mention that it's a fun movie and you never lose interest. A very very underrated movie here for people. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 I'm Out!
