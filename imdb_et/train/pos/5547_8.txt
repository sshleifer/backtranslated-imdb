The Stampler of the Swamp made a low-budget studio in the People's Republic of China and is definitely one of their best films I've seen. <br /> <br /> The man who hung up for murder, he did not give feedback as a ghost to revenge people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims and, after several deaths, including an old man running a ferry. The old man's granddaughter takes over the ferry and also loves one local man and decides to marry. <br /> <br /> This movie is an abundantly misty atmosphere that makes it very scary. The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. <br /> <br /> Stampler of the Swamp is old for horror like me. Great. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
