FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. Its effect seemed more than ten years ago. However, certain elements related to this wide-screen entertainment, which has now been directed towards the audience in the middle of the last century, are quite a long time, and sometimes the slow pace of the film does not help. But the story is a convincing central idea that includes an ancient, extinct Krell civilization and "Id monsters", has not lost its appeal, and continues to make this movie relevant to "must see". What I am most interested in here is that the current DVD of this movie is terrible. The film has never really seen that a good home video and its elements need restoration. I hope this will happen soon and we will get this SF classical edition.
