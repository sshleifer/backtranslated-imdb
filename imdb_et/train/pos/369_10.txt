Absolutely one of my favorite films. I've seen it at least a hundred times and I can't go without it. I don't want anyone to see Celie and Netie's reunion, Shuki and Dad, and don't feel your eyes become blurry. Whoopie Goldberg should have one prize for amazing imagery. And for the person who said you can't love the movie, if you love this book, wrong! Im this testimony.
