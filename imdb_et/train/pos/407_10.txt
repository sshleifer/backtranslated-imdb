Oh, my gosh ... Just give me a minute. This movie takes you on a fantastic journey and won't let you go until the end of the last face. This is a movie for Stormriders and their fans. Zu's legend was beautifully created, although I didn't like some things, they used a lot of views. I wanted to see the real person, but, though, some small guts, and I didn't like it much until I looked at it again, if you understand it more, it is A **! I encourage everyone who ever wanted to see a real Asian movie to watch this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings. Go and see it in America !!!
