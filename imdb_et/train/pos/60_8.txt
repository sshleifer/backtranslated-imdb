The "home room", such as "Zero Day" and "Elephant", is inspired by the recent wave of school shooting. Unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not shooters or killed) after shooting. Making it less exploitative and useful because little effort is wasted on asking questions that are not answered. <br /> <br /> Don't give up this little movie in the first 20 minutes. a real story, but plays like a rejected "Hill Street Blues" episode. It's flat, but bears it, at least it pulls the running length enough to recognize the movie. I advise you to skip it completely and just jump on to the hospital because there is nothing you can't take out of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like many good little films, this was one of the creative creators of the exhibition Paul F. Ryan was both a writer and a director. Although this agreement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign, because it means a certain unity of construction and execution, which is often absent from the big budget. As the "Home Room" script is its true strength, fortunately, the writer also produced the product and made sure that his vision put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan takes a great opportunity to finish testing the tolerance tolerance of the average viewer. He runs it up to the edge, but not all logic will let you cry. Why Ending Works is a combination that the viewer needs for a reward at the end of a trip, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's "Sweet Surrender") she goes out, and the last minute amazing editing. The second strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main characters. Though Phillips plays a standard with a stranger teen and Christensen with his good family intelligent daughter, they both bring more to their role than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and Ryan has little interest. What's going on here is about the two, despite the flat side story of the police detective thinking around the city, trying to tie Alicia to a single shooter. If they ever cut and cut the movie again, it must be compressed. <br /> <br /> The story of two extremely different girls that bind each other and help each other is hardly a novel idea, and Ryan could have just managed to control this movie in clich√©s and predictability. Instead, his script has interesting and convincing sparring games that slowly break apart and divide the moments of vulnerability, but retreat. Dean's "I'm Dying Inside" line just tears you off - I can't think of the moment in any other movie that I felt as intensely as it did. He desperately needs a connection that Alicia desperately deserves. Deanna is progressing only in retreat. The viewer is waiting for the group to hug, which never seems to happen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it will not only create a lot of tension, but will leave you with the characters and the two actors who brought them to life. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
