Artistically photographed, the actors show their exact role. You will get a real feeling that Lucienne will rise from poverty to the most beautiful girl. Tragedy to revive the tragedy. All in all, I've seen this movie at least 10 times. And it can be very well said that Prix De Beute (Miss Europe) is a favorite in my quiet movie collection MAJOR. Louise Brooks's expressiveness is perfect and I recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates artistic beauty and tragic story.
