Pakeezah has a very interesting history (well documented in the "trivia" section) about how it happened. It seems as if the fate of Kamal Amrohi (director) has agreed to test, while he wants him to see his masterpiece complete. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah rides on metaphors, poetry and visual elution. As a result, the dimension of emotion development, which may not be very real, is very effective and has an impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari is living with the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib John himself. In addition, other characters include Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p.). Their music and cinematography leave you spell bound. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic cinema in the world. It opens up new layers for you every time you watch it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare cinema poets and he left us with a gift.
