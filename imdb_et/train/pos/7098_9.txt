The "Twelve Monkeys" have all the elements that will become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. Outstanding Scenario, Permanent Rhythm, Sometimes Wisely Ironic Dialogues. What's more, he was cast around the nose. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film where Bruce Willis is back in the character he played in his previous films. Here, the imprisoned and hopeless character that the prisoner could take with his nickname was a fearless and invincible hero (as was the case with "Die Hard"). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of time. The film also has a very exciting ending. It has a real dramatic force. But this amazing film is also a reflection on a person, the dangers he is afraid of (especially those that can cause the end of the world and there is a virus that can cause diseases). No matter how long it lasts, "twelve monkeys" will be judged by their true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
