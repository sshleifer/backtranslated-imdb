Artemisia can be considered a betrayal or a true artistic license. <br /> <br /> What could be one? <br /> <br /> In documented history, Artemisia was subordinated to Gentilesch's small screw and further affirmed that he is r *** ed, as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem have clearly affirmed. <br /> <br /> He refused to condemn his lover / offender for a different torture in the film. <br /> <br /> How can a movie deviate so much from the inherited history of the film, still informing human hearts? <br /> <br /> The answer is not that hard to find. In the film, the director and the director were captured in a historic record with a wide-opening imagination. So be it. I think both the record and the movie are convincing. that vision, which is shaped in a sic film composition, is really grateful. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing a movie that forced my eyes. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
