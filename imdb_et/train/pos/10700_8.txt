This is undoubtedly a comedy based on national stereotypes. If you omit pretending to know or care about communism and how true Russians or Britons are, if you agree and have not hurt them, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is her best, sexy, touching and funny. Ben Chaplin manages to avoid Nicole's full shade, and the rest does a good job. The latter moves and of course logical - logic. It's worth checking out if you accept the rules of the game.
