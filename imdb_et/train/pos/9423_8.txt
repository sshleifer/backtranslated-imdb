I can't tell if the post-World War II British comedies produced by Ealing Studio have been tasted or not, but I'm totally addicted and the White Suit man is one of the best. There is no need to go to the unknown plot to endure the endangered, dirt-resistant fiber for both the textile industry and the textile alliances. Suffice it to say that the naively idealist Sidney Stratton tricks and arrows he was doing with his polymer vision are comedic joy. Many well-known faces from the world of British character actors - the nervous Cecil Parker, the incredibly frightening Michael Gough and the terribly merciless Ernest Thesinger - performed great performances. Guinness - as always and forever - is great, and Joan Greenwood is gratifying as Daphne (just as he says the word "Daddy" makes the whole movie worth seeing). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
