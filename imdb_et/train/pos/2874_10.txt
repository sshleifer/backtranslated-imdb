Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is cruelly treated by her godly mother and sister. One day the prince is honored with a ball, but Cinderella can't go because her stepmother and sister won't let her. Her fairy tale and her animal friends help her with the ball, warning her to go home until midnight. On the ball he meets Prince Charming. At midnight, he runs home, leaving behind one glass of slippers. With the help of his animal friends, his true identity is revealed. He and the prince will marry later and will live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The Cinderella, which appeared 56 years ago, was a great boxing success that continues to attract audiences to this day. It has a well written script. The characters are memorable. The story, including "A dream is the desire of your heart", "so it's love" and the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", will help tell the story. It was my favorite movie that grew and it didn't lose its charm. A real Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The latest DVD edition is the best way to rate this movie, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music videos, vintage radio programs, and movie reset printing!
