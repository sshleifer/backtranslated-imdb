An excellent film that only shows an unusual mix of genre in just eight minutes: mystery, thriller, musical. In short, we have a story to tell about this story: the girl comes to the European café and then ... The soft transit from the mystery of the nonsense to the narrative logic. At some point, Vigalondo was unable to enjoy the imaginative B / W and despite the (thanks) tighter budgets. <br /> <br /> Due to the time-space unity, the film reaches the intensity of the short poem (almost haiku). Spain, fast poetry in the country B / W (an remember early Buñuel?). <br /> <br /> You must see to convince our faith in the young cinema outside the country.
