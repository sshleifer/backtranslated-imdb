Great concept, great cast and what kind of damage wasn't the story more time to complete. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now there are some REAL women! However, Dench and his character still had enough material to transfer the script to a few moments. I have it on tape and continue to watch it, hoping that finally there is a clue that shows that there is a sequel. <br /> <br /> Top drawer! - There is no question! - There is no argument. <br /> <br />
