In the scene, the desperado is called Hawkeye's eye-catcher with a smooth forehead, but when she follows Johnny's pueblo, she has seen the scar over her fast-eyed eye. It is just one of the many continuities that expire in this nervous spaghetti-western part, but deviating from the picture adds a special flavor to the procedure. <br /> <br /> The second happens when Sanchez turns his three dead to be examined for their identity - "You just can't imagine how many of our lies are dead". Immediately afterwards, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) appears to collect his ball more than the poster he wants. <br /> <br /> In the film's main Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon), he has alternated with his bag on the right and left hips after the movie, exchanging arms with Carradine after a cabin strike. Johnny is bound to his Margo at the request of his uncle, but he must return his death to the deceptive wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and her nephew Pedro (Louis Vanner). It takes time, but it's a fun ride with one of the best music results. As for this cabin fight, I got the kung fu sound effects every time I hit the stroke. <br /> <br /> Take care of some story transmissions? After dueling for the first time with Pedro, Johnny wipes his lips with a small amount of blood that he can smear on Pedro's face. Similarly, when Pedro later smiles around Pepe in a movie he doesn't cut, but when Johnny arrives, Pepe's face is covered with blood. <br /> <br /> "Johnny Yuma" is probably one of the best genres that doesn't contain Clint Eastwood. Like Johnny, Mark Damon is reasonably fit to stand, but without the outside. Carradine seemed to replace the compulsory character of Lee Van Cleef without being a bad guy. Initially, the exchange of identity between Carradine and Johnny seemed pointless, but it all tied to the end of the movie. You knew that every henchman would finish his place; marking each time was part of the expectation. <br /> <br /> When you think, the title hero has nothing to do with Nick Adams's classic TV Western 'Rebel. In this film, Johnny got his armed forces, which he once had in Yumal. <br /> <br /> Maybe the story was the most unique element associated with how he tied things to evil Samantha, who pulled it behind the scenes. After Carradine is taken, he wins before Johnny gets revenge. Still alive, Carradine seems to be trying to shoot him down, but it won't take long for Johnny and Sanchez to watch him dessert where he died without water - Carradine was heading to his canteen.
