This wonderful martial arts fantasy is brought to you visually by stunning and eastern philosophy, master Tsui Hark, a man behind some of the best films in Hong Kong. Special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the brain, but there is a refreshing change in the movies that treat your audience as if they were moles. If thinking is not your forte, it may not be your movie. Maybe you should look at the latest Hollywood studio brain club, but if you are looking for something more, it is where you find it.
