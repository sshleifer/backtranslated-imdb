I saw this film and heard Juan-Gerard, the writer-director, at Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everything I knew was an 8-year history. An old boy during the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> This opening program reminds you of "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is full of references to classical films: Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), Rebel Without Cause, references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you will find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore, which often uses black men as a Greek choir. <br /> <br /> This movie is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's desire to respect his family and the film he loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people who live in it, as well as the depicted events. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and a passionate filmmaker), but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live in this dream, and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and celebrate. Keitel keeps the screen vigorously like a mysterious and secret grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) provide strong support for key roles. but stay with it. The last half is much better than the revolutionary events combined with the bittersweet and honestly at the top. This is Juan Gerard's first effort, but he is as honest as he is, and his passion and heart have really come through his first efforts. I would definitely see it again and I hope he will continue his career in film. <br /> <br />
