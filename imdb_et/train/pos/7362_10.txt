What a fun full of sexy movie! They no longer do them like that. 4 sexy couples arrive in London and have all kinds of sexual malformations. The tone is strangely innocent, as significant nudity evolves from stocky situations, rather than actual sexual desires. Only when actors accidentally lose their clothes will the men's characters become rampant. Richard O 'Sullivan gets the word "Randi" (sic). The film certainly provides the origin of the cushioning function, which is found in the old school nudie cuties and naturism films. My special interest in Au Pair Girls is that I am a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actor has ever seen the right naked (she is thin but wonderfully curvy) or dressed, come to it (I have loved her since the UFO's original run - who could still make a purple wig!), I'll eat my hat.
