This is a good movie. Looking at some fun money is blown with a super rate, especially from the child's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a child's dream and what a child can do for $ 1 million. What she dislikes, don't look at it. They make the film for observers, not for people who have nothing better to do, then complain in their lives.
