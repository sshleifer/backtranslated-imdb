Riget II is a good sequel, but not as good as the first. This series does not seem to be as serious as the first. There's also a lot of comedy in it, good. <br /> <br /> We are back in Denmark's Rigshospitalet, the Danish National Hospital. Mrs Drusse leaves the hospital when her job is done, but fate will otherwise. He will soon be haunted and Helmer will do everything crazy and will soon get much worse when black powers are triggered in the Kingdom. First of all, it means a lot of fun, but it makes you a little less serious about the series. The story has retained many elements from the last series and added new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are just stupid, but they save it, making it comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> Participants are the same as adding some to normal pain. They are all very good. It's a strange story and device. Some parts are a complete freak show and characters change during the exhibition to keep it serious and keep it real not easy work. However, these participants are perfectly working on the whole situation. <br /> <br /> Much of the first-class features are intact. Cinematography is one of these qualities. A hand-held camera that gave Trier a world-renowned tone gives the series tension and reality. This gives the camera a unique opportunity to move and follow the signs, and Trier uses these capabilities. Good, motion, big flash and good composition and editing make it a pleasant look. <br /> <br /> Get ready to see a better effect at the first step. Also be prepared to see more. I didn't think the green thing seemed too good. I thought it was original and didn't fit. Never less, effects like ghosts are really good. Non-digital effects also look good. The little brother just looks very strange, but you agree. All I would say is that the effects are OK. <br /> <br /> Music is also pretty good. Moody and nice. Some of this really concerns. It really is nice. Like the first, there are quite a few music scenes in the action scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> All of this makes a good move. If you had seen Rig, you can see it as disappointed. It has many of the same features as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing it. These two form a series that you don't want to miss.
