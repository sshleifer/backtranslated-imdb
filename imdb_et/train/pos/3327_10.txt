I love and admire Farrelly's brothers! How did I see this great movie only 3 years after its release? It made me laugh, made me cry and warmed my heart again. Great. My rotting English is hard to describe - but I still have to try: <br /> <br /> It's great - from leadership to supportive roles, the actor is great, the dialogues are great and the film is perfectly targeted and edited. <br /> <br /> I think Farrelly's brothers movies are often underestimated - they're not easy comedies - they're never! They talk about what life is (I won't tell you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this film confirmed to me what relationships are involved: <br /> <br /> you love someone: make them free, let them be - try to share passion and pain and always be one to the other true. <br /> <br /> I'm not an athlete, but definitely sporty. But in this movie - vibes to you. I can smell the Baseball atmosphere. Finally, this film explained to me what a sports fan means to you and what cool fans have to be there. <br /> <br /> Thanks so much, Pete & Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you haven't seen it - please check out KINGPIN!
