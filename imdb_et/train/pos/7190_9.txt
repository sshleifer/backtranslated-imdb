Best of Zorro series and one of my favorite series. This is a periodic series set right after the birth of Mexico. The new nation reads this gold produced by one city to keep the Republic's solvent. But the gold god, Don del Oro, Indians stir and steal gold for themselves. His Zorro and his band were rescued. Reed Hadley has won Zorro, and he cuts a fearsome figure when he gets into a nice selection of scraps (most of which were used later by Zorro and others). The story moves and its nicely not clear who is the real bad guy. There is a reason I have seen it most in the series, just a great adventure movie. The only thing I can compare is Zorro Mark with Tyrone Power or some other time. Its super and highly recommended.
