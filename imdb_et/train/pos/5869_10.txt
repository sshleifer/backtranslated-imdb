After watching Deer Hunter, a masterpiece, Jacknife had big shoes to fill. That's the same topics as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effect on a man after the Vietnam War. is very good, like Kathy Baker. But this film belongs to Ed Harris, who gives powerful, emotional and influential performance. The film is based on a stage game, and there are one or two scenes where it seemed to me obvious that I just thought that for one or two scenes I seemed to be watching the stage playing. It wasn't such a big deal, and it doesn't really reduce the movie. this movie is not epic like The Deer Hunter.the is about a similar era and has similar themes but they have two very different movies.I thought Deer Hunter was great, and I think this movie was great.it is an actress that makes it so big is Jacknife 10/10
