What an exciting ride! Twisted and thought provocative. What's more, Sharon Stone pulls her Catherine Tramelli's sliding, proud and enchanting character impeccably. The original main problem is in San Francisco. The sequel is in London, where Catherine is now relocated. Both exciting cities, known for excitement, haute couture, and a great place to live like Catherine Trammel. David Morrisey ("Derailed") plays the smooth role of Dr. Michael Glas, a psychiatrist. The character David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, is a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Bright cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension, - all "basic instincts". The mind bends all over. Great scenario. From climatic opening to surprise, this movie is nothing but boring! All the people in the theater were glued to the screen.
