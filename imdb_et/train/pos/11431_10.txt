My third year of French classes always enjoyed this movie very much. In a multicultural downtown high school, the film offered a wide range of topics (in French in the classroom, but I know that a lot of discussion took place after the discussion in English). The most obvious link between Protée and Aimée, compared to Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I've always mentioned that I felt this film had one of the "sexiest" scenes I've ever seen in the movie. . A year, a 17-year-old Afro-American shouted: "Yes!" when he understood: the place where Protée Aiméele helps keeps his evening dress, while both are looking at reflection in the other's mirror. Directors use "mirror technique" if they want to focus on an internal conflict that is part of one or more of the characters in the scene: this is an excellent example of technology and is "sexy." <br /> <br /> Most students had difficulty understanding the end of the movie. One suggested that one film theme was "Africa" ​​and that no matter how much Africa or Africans loved, "Africa" ​​(as the leader tried) could not "get": one must be Africa.
