I remember this movie for the first time - I was in the office that worked at the weekend and the TV was for background noise. But I found myself gradually more and more engaged in this film that I never saw or heard until I completely absorbed it. The question of life and death (British title - Stairway to Heaven in the US) is delightful, convincing, lively and moving, all in one well-written, well-functioning, fully targeted package. This is a classic class that really rises right into Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, windless, citizen Kane and fire. Why has he never received the same public announcement and video shop highlighting? Fortunately, some knowledgeable critics have put it in their "Top 100 All Time" lists. There is hope - Fantasy of the 1940s was not hit in the 1960s, and Oz's wizard was in the box office, but hit the TV. Buy it - rent it - look at it - demand it! You don't have to be disappointed!
