Having worked in the center of Manhattan and often having lunch on summer days in a park near the Town Hall, I would see that the mayor is coming and going. It was a great way to go beyond the City Hall doors and see what it was in the lobby and out of the building. Al Pacino (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", 03, gave an excellent result throughout the picture and especially when he spoke to a small boy in an African American church who was killed. John Cusack (deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury", 03, was a dedicated servant mayor and worshiped him in everything he was trying to achieve. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Cogan) begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and plays an excellent supporting role. Last but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", played "01" mobile mail, had very difficult choices at the end of the picture! A great movie with a great actor and fantastic photography in NYC!
