if you have the chance to see this movie, look at it. it is quite shocking in some parts, and really does make so many important questions, but it is not didactic. in my opinion, this work of art ... beautifully filmed, fine music of many styles, typical impressive levels the BBC Drama has been waiting for. Nathalie Press (settled as "Natalie Press") is convincing her role as a depressed teenager who is used by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has this beautifully soothing quality that sometimes gives you the stability of the irritating activity and the comfort of the viewer, knowing that someone there is actually "normal" but a real star like always Timothy Spall - definitely one of the greatest actors of our time!
