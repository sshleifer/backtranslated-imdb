a movie about the cruelty of this world. I found this liberating because only truth can be. It also contains pretty funny bits. Part of the operation is extraordinary, see for example Maria Hofstätter. The director has tried to imagine life as realistically as possible, successful. Consistently, sex scenes are clear and no longer counterfeit than in a hard chamber. Although I hardly understood the sentence, I found the film's vision in the original language much more rewarding with subtitles, because in the case of duplication, half of the actors' great work is lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to copy in a duplicate. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
