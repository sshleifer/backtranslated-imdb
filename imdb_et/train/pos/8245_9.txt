Even without a word, Billy Connely is great as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mother"? Zombie Girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "... My dad is eating me ... I never tried Timmy eating." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's like Airplane meets (Meat?) Lively Night of the Dead, supported by Zomcom. <br /> <br /> And don't forget my main box <br /> <br /> And the Fido Aloha shirt is just so cool! <br /> <br /> And yes, social comment is just too much to even comment. <br /> <br /> Is it right, it all really works!
