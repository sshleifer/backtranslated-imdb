Joel Schumacher made this choice and decided on this script. The story is well-written and well-featured, and this brand new 10 or 12 central brand was absolutely brilliant. It seems there were 6 "drivers" and about half a dozen support, and this is the best movie, fresh young face tomorrow. It has been a long time since Hollywood has been touching controversial Vietnamese films that say something about the "story to be talked about" (as Schumacher has said) and Tigerland lands for a couple of high-war movies. However, it cannot be labeled as a war movie because it seemed more based on the spirit of Bozz and other people. I think anyone who just wants to see a good movie with all the special FX, but just a good, sharp drama should go to Tigerland, probably Shumachers Best's work for the last 8 years.
