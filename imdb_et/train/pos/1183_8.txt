Man regulates 45 years after marriage alone. He must also solve the problem of family cow, Tulip, which does not allow milking. Until he visualizes his wife, who was firewood. <br /> <br /> Tulip is based on the Griffith family, his grandparents' generation. The film is a nostalgic look at the disappearing lifestyle, where people still felt a sense of responsibility, a lush green Victorian (Australian state, not an era) country. <br /> <br /> The writer and director Griffiths has obviously further ambitions in both areas, and this multiple award-winning 15-minute short is a good start for his roll.
