If you're like me, you'll love this great age-old teen movie. I think it is there in the innocence / love book / high school USA / cheats / calendar girl / crybaby / all big movies that are placed in lat 50's and early 60's and this is a great soundtrack.not as many songs as some of this type movies, but still great.it is all so funny at times and has great love of interest. There were more of these wonderful movies. My favorite movie has come back all the time, when Marty rebounds well in 1955 in the wonderful movies he's in the 50's (early 60s), but it's better than that.
