I didn't feel that this movie was pretty smart, because it seemed like it was, but still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This is original, although it reminded me of another French film, Vidocq and the city of lost children, mostly for coloring, but also for the fine quality of close relatives of symbols. /> <br /> Placed in a prison, but don't let it down, this film looks seemingly beyond many multi-level blocks. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting because the perennial "Black Arts" well into the foreground and a very good characterization that makes some just too plausible! <br /> <br /> Scary is some gore that you should watch.
