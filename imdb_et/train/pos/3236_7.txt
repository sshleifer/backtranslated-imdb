Half a dozen different stories tell us about life in Finland. These stories are intertwined and each contains a scene where sound is heard. This shows that the displayed events take place at the same time. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a bungy jump that allows some excitement, but early stories are rather low keys. The film fixes it so much. The two broken stories in the marriage, which follow, give a lot of drama, while the hospital scene gives us a desperately ill patient who asks for pain relief. The last moments with the husband are both convincing and moving. <br /> <br /> Although different family scenes take place in Finland, themes are of a general nature wherever you live. <br /> <br /> Short story collections are rarely satisfactory as a good tense 90-minute drama.
