Oliver Hardy, who is under the sound of horns, bells, telephones, and thrombones, has been advised by his physician Finlayson for peace and quiet, and for goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution that lives on a docked boat so that the sea of ​​saltwater can help Ollie get the rest of his needs. This is a great prerequisite for all the mad hats coming, because the boat is pulled alongside the hungry goat and the escaped convict (Richard Cramer) keeps on driving. <br /> <br /> I got a kick from all of the film lines, starting with this label at the crazing factory - "Silence when men work". The early story of the boys' apartment includes a number of mixed piping and equipment failures where Stan makes a banana banana. Laurel has a couple of big lines in the picture, such as "We have to be disconnected", but the one who ran me was his answer to the on-board offender - "Self-preservation is the last law of average laws" so many movies on this board, but I know that I enjoyed them as a child and I find them as fun today as they were back in my youth. In this census, "Saps At Sea" offers a decent hornophobic hour, well for hornomania.
