Kubrick once again presents his stunning ability to treat the perfect atmosphere for the film. Mainly through cinematography, but also through brilliant scores, he creates a frosty and ominous tone that lives throughout the film, and from the outset, gets my backbone pounding. This is the perfect atmosphere that makes The Shining a masterpiece that it is in my eyes. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. Frightening authentic images of madness. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial to be nice, but it's easy to look at these two when the rest of the movie is so brilliant. It also includes an actress whose biggest name is Scatman Crothers.
