Every film in the early years of Orson Welles is a triumph for the third person with Joseph Cotton. He's also a great touch of evil. Please see them all! He tends to get pompous and self-serving movies like F on Fake, really a stupid waste of movies. Don't waste your time looking at it. it's really unknown. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone who is studying a movie must see everything he's filmed. All of her leading women are enormously large, but eventually Welles became drunk in fat as her character was evil evil! For some reason, Orson was a woman with Welles, I see her as attractive to her youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on and on, but I was wrong ... and because I'm woman, I see her interesting. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers, and if you don't read today's filmmakers: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most filmmakers don't just measure the forties of filmmakers! I know there are many more great filmmakers today, but in such a short time I can't name them all. Not offensive to the great filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please remember some current and future filmmakers, I do not want to stay in the past! I love some movies now, but rarely do I have a list of "100 best". "Hustle and Flow" was great, so was "Fargo" and "Oh, brother, where are you," from Sullivan's travel line; another forty thin film! Can anyone give the best list in the 90's and up to 2006? I would like to know who to watch! Thanks! It also brings the website! Where else can you connect a movie or boo! i love ranting and raving regular people like me who can say what i want and i promise not to spoil the movie for someone who hasn't seen it yet!
