I was so surprised how big The Moon In The Moon really was. I mean at the outset that I was expecting a cheesy and predictable movie, but I decided to leave it away. Drunken (mostly tears) how big The Moon In the Moon turned out to be. This movie is so fun and so aware of its tone and its just a fabulous movie. Reception was great, especially Reece Witherspoon (who was so cute and lovable) and all others. I didn't like anything that bothered me, I felt that the glove was predictable but very well done. I also felt that some things were simple or as if they were done before, but still a big movie. Overall, I have to say that I don't want to say much about this movie, not that it was bad, but just a movie you like or do not like. And all, even if you don't like this type of movie, it's still an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
