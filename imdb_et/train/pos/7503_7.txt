The film was okay, quite fun. The cast was pretty good, and I noticed what the comment I mentioned before - Glenn Quinn was outstanding and he alone is a good reason to watch this movie. He played the band's selfish "evil" friend and manager perfectly! <br /> <br /> In this movie, "Beyond Gravity" has a lot of songs, but it doesn't really come as a surprise in terms of film production of VH1. However, if soft rock / pop music doesn't like anyone, the flash of these scenes can go on. <br /> <br /> The cell band that tries to put it to the top of LA but has to overcome many obstacles on the road is not too original, but quite entertaining, some surprising plots are turning here and there.
