It surprised me because I was previously disappointed by Adrian Pasdari, but he achieved the perfect balance of this performance, avoiding both the farce and the sin, while providing humor and true emotions. Always Wonderful Julie Waters is terrible here, and anyone who hasn't staged yet in 1983 should rent it right away (wonderful movie). The rest of the supporting characters are well played, many are super-eccentric without moving over. This is fun.
