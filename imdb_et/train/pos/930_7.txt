I'm sure most people already know this story - sad Ebenezer Scrooge visits three spirits (Santa Claus, present and still a ghost) who highlight some of their lives in the hope of saving their soul and changing their way. Dickens' classic story in one form or another has over time tried to be a loved holiday. <br /> <br /> Although I grew up looking at the version of Alastair Sims in 1951, and I believe he is the final Scrooge, I have impressed this version that appeared during high school. George C. Scott plays convincing and meaningful Ebenezer Scroog, and the ghosts are quite frightening and intimidating. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratch. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern movie styles (1980s) that make my kids more tasty than the 1951 black and white version <br /> <br /> This is a worthy customization of the story and what I look at every year at Christmas almost every year.
