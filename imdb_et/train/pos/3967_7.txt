It's not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films - I know it quickly. While some are watching their film as pure propaganda, I don't know what's wrong? Yes, sure, like the TV show FBI, is the obvious case where the board is doing PR work to try and support. But when it comes to entertainment, it does a good job. Plus, surprisingly enough, the time it was done focuses more on crime than espionage and "commies". Instead, it is a fiction of the earliest agents and the career he chose. Now that Agent Jimmy Stewart is playing, it's pretty sure that the act and writing was good - because it was a real budget and a studio that didn't intend to chew with a star at the third rate. It is generally worth seeing, but not particularly large.
