Pretty "race" prerequisite - murdered John Doe has been found to have a pneumonic plague, so if a health care institution and NOPD are fighting everyone and each other trying to find their water contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's cousin is holding the victim stick them. <br /> <br /> This movie is freely available from the Internet archive and is worth downloading. A lot of this movie (all?) Was filmed in genuine New Orleans venues, so it's interesting to see what is now a detail, although it seems to me that it is not open enough, even a noir - or mobile lighting devices they weren't the ones they are . There's also a lot of location background noise that is a bit annoying - car horns in the love scene, anyone? People's representations have many non-professional artists, and this can explain why getting the movie up front is a bit dirty - not many ways to restart or recast, although the final chase is worth it. There is not much wrong with the main actors: Jack Palance is really scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - a later scene when he alternates between comfort and threatening a sick cousin, while Widmark, as he often did, puts a fair hatred on the mission at a credible level - most often . <br /> <br /> Someone should do it - not supernatural, no mystery, no special FX, but good yarn that is full of character conflict, and topical issue. Another reviewer mentioned John Kennedy O'Toole as a writer, and it is on-site in an odd, dark, dark, clock-time drama of the New Orleans type. There's even a dwarf newspaper seller. <br /> <br /> "Community? What kind of community? Do you think you live in the Middle Ages?"
