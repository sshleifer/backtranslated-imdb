This movie was amazing. This is an inspiring cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth in which director Lucy Walker brings the film. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for this special movie that shows humanity in a human situation. Lucy Wlaker introduces the beauty of the landscape. This film is a real example of man and nature, and sometimes of man and man. The internal instability and the triumph are tremendous in his subject. It is interesting to know how Tiebtans sees the vision of darkness as a sign of demons. This film illuminates a particular culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker has given Erik Weihenmayer a voice if he hadn't usually heard. Thank you Lucy for being a filmmaker for her vison.
