This, Prodigal Son and Eastern Condors are my favorite Sammo Hung movies. The fat dragon is thicker at this trip than he was in "Condors", but he is no less sure he is a director or actor. In fact, she is at the top of her form and offers a devastating, brutal creator with half a dozen amazing sequences and a compassionate and lovely story. Love and romance are not the priorities of the director here, but they act as curiosities for action and ensure that viewers do not hit the fast back and forth button between the physical collision. <br /> <br /> Opening that includes a funny white tail duel sets a firm but deceptive tone. The step where the car is driven by Sammo's bike is decorated and sweetened with a sharp, comical tone. The fast and furious struggle between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is dazzling choreography and sharp, superb direction and easily one of the best models. The film's violence is slowly expanding until the climatic showdown finally appears that we have been subjected to some brutal confusion that has ever been seen in Sammo's production. The director / actor attack on Billy Chow and a house full of anger, intimidating opponents, is cracking, physically punishing joy. <br /> <br /> Any terrible and one of the best martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> A great result too.
