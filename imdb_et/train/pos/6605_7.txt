2054. Paris is a drawing by Escher with people and vehicles that are apparently burning on many levels as a tribute to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Paris is as ultramodern as decaying. And at the glance between the wiping of tracking, a young medical researcher was robbed after he left his sister at night. The tough police captain is investigating. The harsh black-and-white, dark corridors, shady sidewalks and single source illumination that are characteristic of the strangest film noir, comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But this story is more of a debt to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than Frank Miller, because high-tech surveillance, almost invisible hidden costumes and ruthless super companies are as much a part of the landscape as weapons and cars. The film will never create a devastating atmosphere of Gibson's cyber-vision, whose tech-heavy marginal characters come into contact with the industrial types of companies that all have their own ministry of fear, but the viewer will surely think that future Paris is no utopia and future science is no less good than benevolent. And when the line of police procedures opens, we will be taken to the darker recesses of individual ambitions under the shiny plywood of Avalon's cultured PR image. The motion capture process used here is a bit between the B & W comics and the next generation of rotoscopes and is addictive or intrusive depending on your taste. However, there is a great visual feeling here and the future Paris will be filled with tiny details, giving the picture a unique look that is both spartal and baroque. Worth a look.
