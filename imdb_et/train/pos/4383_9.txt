** Attention Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 90s. It was an amazing achievement for all involved, especially Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of honor and dishonesty that men can represent themselves. But unfortunately ... <br /> <br /> this is unjustly compared to "Braveheart". These are two completely different films, probably just similar to the fact that both are Scottish historians in Scotland. But this comparison often disturbs me because it seems almost "Braveheart" is supposed to be a better film than "Rob Roy". I like "Braveheart" a lot, but the idea of ​​comparing it with "Rob Roy" is a bit offensive to me. Simply put, I love "Braveheart", but it's a pale shadow of how much I love "Rob Roy". Here are my specific reasons ... <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" is about real people. Let's face it, William Wallace "Braveheart" is not a real person. He's a legend, martyr, bigger than life. Because of this image, he is also the perfect person who never does wrong and basically shows his Scottish land to the land. When he finally fails, it is not his fault. Like Jesus, he also misleads the most trusted people. He even goes through the worst torture because he wants so much freedom. <br /> <br /> Wallace's image is very well done and effective. But it doesn't inspire or intrigue me. I find that human uncertainty is much better than human perfection. That is why "the last temptation of Christ" is a better film than "King of Kings" and this is also one of the reasons why I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart". Rob Roy can be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He makes a number of mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. Now, for sure that there is no wrong claim against the Duke of Argyll, it was nobility and courage, but it was also an act of egoism and self-centeredness. Let us not forget that the detention he had allegedly defended was made homeless at the end of the film because of this act. But Rob did the best he could, and that was all you asked him. <br /> <br /> Robi's husband Mary is also a normal, ambitious person. Let's start with how he sees in this movie. Of course, she is beautiful, but she does not wear makeup and she promises to show her natural beauty. Compare it with two love (or one, depending on your perspective) from William Wallace's "Braveheart". Now these two ladies are hot, but hardly show how women looked at this time (especially those in place). Perhaps not a fair comparison, but another example of how Rob Roy has tried to achieve more precision. <br /> <br /> Throughout Rob Roy, Mary must live with her rogue rape with Cunningham's filthy felling. . He feels compelled to talk to Rob about his struggle, but he doesn't, because he knows Rob is revenge for his rape. Such vengeance would definitely mean Robi's death and Mary is not ready for such sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy's villains are equally weighty. Although "Braveheart" enemies are well written, they are hardly original. Robert Bruce, a man, both brave and coward, is troubled by moral judgments that are known in the fictional field. Should he take his claim as King of Scotland or should he betray Wallace to secure his surname? Bruce is the most ambitious sign of "Braveheart", but Brutusest "Julius Ceasar" in Freds "The Godfather Part II" is hardly original. Although Longshanks is quite one-dimensional, it is a convincing villain. He is an evil epidemic and his tyrants are in direct contradiction with Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy has three villains that are admirable. First we start with Montrose Marquis. He is a man who is so confident in his self-esteem that he is ready to let an innocent man suffer for it. "See that I'm not mocked" is the favorite names of his "factor". He is a man who is overwhelmed, upset that a great noble suffering man, the Duke of Argyll, can be considered a larger province. He is shamefully confident and insecure. He is an evil aristocrat, but in a way that makes him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are "Rob Royis" conspirators and are also Roy's direct attackers. Callarn is so cowardly crazy that he is almost comic. He does something to maintain the awesome will of the awning, which also includes upside down and trick. Cunningham is convincing that he seems to have been raised to do what he can to gain Marquis status and affection. He needs a father, little to know that Marquis is his true father. So if the opportunity to get wealth comes from Callarn, he grabs it without even being asked. He is very similar to today's man's evil, both self-centered and in vain, because he does not care about the consequences of his actions to others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized Tim Roth's action in this film as excessive. Hogwash I say. It is clear that Cunningham is not just all evil, but also a psychopath. In a world where a man and his stepfather can take random people to have fun, is Cunningham too much of an incredible character? We live in a society where people seem to have reduced the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this fallen value have changed. The problem with human history is that human conscience does not allow compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that goodness prevails, but the snakes are always there in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character that I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman and his values ​​of honesty and courtesy are in direct contradiction with Marquis. He appreciates the courage of Rob Roy and Mary and has a direct outrage against Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for powerful people. Hopefully, people like Marquis have an exception and not a rule. <br /> <br /> Rob Rob's final duel is more exciting than the 10 battle scenes "Braveheart". One thing I get tired of is people who tell me that "Braveheart" is a better movie because of the scenes in the battle. First, the battle scenes are almost original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has had historical scenes of European battle. "Braveheart" is some of the best battle scenes ever put on film, but they suffer from one major problem. These battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong, twins are hardly original. In fact, there are probably ten times more movies than a double game, like battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is to see beauty. This is one of the greatest scenes in the film history. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, fighting style and wearing two characters in this duel perfectly. Cunningham is effette and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham uses a fence sword, while Rob uses broad words. Cunningham struggles with quick, complex movements, while Roy's fighting style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The whole movie, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting other side, will bring it to the moment. It is a powerful stuff, and it is clear that Rob must destroy the threatening evil that has plagued the whole world. When Rob finally arrives (literally and figuratively), it is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more to live with, and his glory is more powerful than 10 Cunningham. The use of music in this scene is completely chilling. Dominating good real evil is more powerful for me than seeing the guy get rid of, so he can punish "FREEDOM". But hey, maybe it's just me. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I don't know that people in aristocracy or Scotsmen were talking like "Rob Roy" people, but I feel that there is clearly an attempt to catch their speech patterns. I feel "Rob Roy" is bored because they don't understand what characters are saying. If this is the case, read some Shakesphere or put a title. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the biggest writable films of the 90s. Many of the dialogues in this movie are clever, but you may have to watch the movie sometimes to understand it. <br /> <br /> In contrast, Braveheart is hardly interesting. Of course, what are you waiting for when the main character is Australian-played Scotsman? It's a legend and it wasn't obviously trying to talk. This film takes several centuries before Rob Roy, but they speak like people today. So that's why many people like it. Today's audiences have become increasingly lazy, and they do not want time or patience to understand complex things. So, as with many epic films, they expect the villagers to speak of a recognizable English accent, while heroes speak a native language that is not too far from our American language. Of course, it is clear that Wallace is Scotish, but apart from being acclaimed by Stary Trek Scotty and a couple of "Aye", the Scots of this film fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we believe the Scots should sound. br /> <br /> So, do these descriptions prove that "Rob Roy" is a better movie than "Braveheart"? Hardly. But if this proves one thing, it shows that it is hardly known that "Braveheart" is a better film than "Rob Roy". Simply put, "Rob Roy" is a movie that has many topics in today's world. "Braveheart" is a film legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. You can make a decision about what you think is better ... <br /> <br /> Rating - A score - 9
