And I'm not saying this in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie in the cinema when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousin it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, even though we knew he didn't know about it. <br /> <br /> Over the years I saw this movie a few times, but I always changed the channel. Even after a few seconds, it would be a warm feeling for magic and heart. And I liked it that way. <br /> <br /> So I saw this movie only once and I believe it was a good decision not to watch it again. When I saw it today, I know I couldn't criticize MJ's behavior, the plot (if it existed) and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings about it are the child's parents 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see my adults intervening in my rating and giving it 8 memories and wonderful music. For this small child who looked at it 20 years ago, it is definitely 10.
