When I watched this movie last night on the video, I got those fools that said it was going to last. I feel like I'm looking at it over and over again for years. <br /> <br /> It has all the timeless qualities you could ask in the story / movie. And while some cultural references are not clear to me for the western viewer, it is at the heart of the general story.
