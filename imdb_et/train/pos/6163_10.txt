This is one of the few films where I think the movie is a correction of the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and interesting, and the musical number is undoubtedly exceptional. I admired the cyclical "old home guard" and the charming "Portobello Road" transfer, which is a great combination of early animations and real makers that inhibit but do not diminish the charm of the work. The background of World War II worked well and it was not left when the film began, which often happens in the stories of 'evacuation'. <br /> <br /> Often an over-appreciated film does not end the enjoyment of people of all ages. The performers' performances are exceptionally well done and the entire text is well connected and well designed. Guaranteed smile on the face!
