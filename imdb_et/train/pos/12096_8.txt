I watched this movie several times and found it to be very good. This movie is also known as "The Terror of the Terror", "The Sharp Coffin" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele is her ordinary beautiful / horrible self. The man leader George Riviere does a good job with his work. The whole film's drop is in the atmosphere and there is a lot of tension. Camera corners are good and work mostly are not bad. This movie is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have an uncut version of a DVD that is much better than a modified TV version. Grab some popcorn, turn off lights, get back and enjoy. John R. Tracy
