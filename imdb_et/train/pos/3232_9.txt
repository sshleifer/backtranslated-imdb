I went to this Finnish film and I have to say that this is one of the best films I've seen this year. The intrigue consists of 5-6 different stories, all of which take place on the same day in a small Finnish city. At the end, the stories gather very well, remembering a bit of tarantino. Most of the participants worked very well, which is definitely needed in this type of realistic drama. I especially liked the act of leading actress Sanna Hietala and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that IMDB got the wrong information about Sanna. His name, as you noticed in my review, is NOT Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
