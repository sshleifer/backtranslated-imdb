This film was hysterical. I haven't laughed at it for a long time. I mean, it's not "Goodwill," but was it supposed to be? I actually went to the advanced screening, waiting much less and was pleasantly surprised. Comedy hits hard and is quite constant. Amanda Beet is hot and awesome. The whole audience I looked at was as much as I enjoyed the movie.
