Richard Linklater's beautiful mix of youth romance and Paris travel arrangements is one of the 90's best-thinking romantic films. Julie Delpy turns to one of the most interesting performances of a decade, like a Parisian girl who spends the day on a stranger train with Ethan Hawke. Dialogue (and there are surprises there) is sometimes prone and too valuable, but the portrait of two young wannabe lovers, which makes a romantic, intellectual and spiritual bond with each other, is full of strange, moving and attentive moments.
