If you like Cleese and the whole British Pythonesque humor, this little pearl is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real pampering! <br /> <br /> I saw it on TV with friends when it first came out, and its classic quotes have been part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever! I have it on tape and it is constantly being evaluated. <br /> <br /> Maybe some reviewers take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> I can't believe it is only available in the US (of course NTSC), but not in the UK, where it should be an important part of British humor history !!
