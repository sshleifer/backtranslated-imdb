First, this movie wasn't published in theaters (TESTED POORLY THEY SAY), I say they thought the slippery police, politicians and dedicated newspapers were dead, just send it to DVD and Cable TV> Money and Running. <br /> <br /> When I say that, I usually like this type of film, especially the one it is cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard & Distaff, Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The plot and story are dead, but the above casting will bring this violent movie to life, and it's actually traceable. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake It is good if a young journalist devoted to the newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman is either crooked policemen and politicians or somewhat decent boys, 2 women are friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE girls and need it, this is quite violent, many killings, etc., not for children. Under no circumstances is this a great movie, but HOW what it is and cast It is definitely good, <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out) 10)
