I have not read the novel, although I understand that it is different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed it with the fact that it is not really my genre leads me to the decision not to read the book. Having read a letter from Austen, I can't compare it to my work. I can say that almost every line of dialogue in it is smart, witty and well communicated, as well as the greatest source of comedy in it. It made me laugh with perfect British and verbal material. Every actor is perfect, and Paltrow's full role as an opponent. The characters are well written, reliable, and consistent. However, I found a few of them extremely irritating, and although I think that at least some of them were funny, it was repeatedly repeated, and frankly it wasn't for the first time. Editing and cinematography are wonderful and everything looks absolutely proud. The plot and the pace are great, you are never bored. It really ends up * obviously, but maybe their preferences. I can't claim that it didn't entertain me, it started to the end and I'll look at it again. It has a short language. I recommend this novel to a fan of stories. 7/10
