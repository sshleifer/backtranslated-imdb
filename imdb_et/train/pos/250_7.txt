Those who know Kelly's "legend" and expect this film to be the exact image of his life can be disappointed with the creative license made by this film (for example, Naomi Watt's character never existed), but if you look at it purely as entertainment, it rises quite well. Ledgers performance title role is pretty sure, taking mantle cinema best Ned (not difficult considering previous Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian football) Bob Chitty, great soccer player but poor actor. For some locations in movies in a lively area, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne and Clunes & Ballarat.
