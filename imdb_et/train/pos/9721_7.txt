How to lose friends and dispose of people is a decent comedy with a little romantic approach. <br /> <br /> This is actually a story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) punching a journalist and journal writing business, interpreted as a funny way. Simon Pegg made a look that was a little worse than usual. The film is not funny or funny, but it has its moments and these moments are very fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and worth seeing English comedy American people for all the people who just want to sit, relax and enjoy the movie that it is. If you look at this film's critical approach, you should go through if you don't want to be disappointed and start filming it.
