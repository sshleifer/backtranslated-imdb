yeah, of course. Sammo Hung was already in 1983 "Zu Warrios Magic Mountain". Now, 2001, he does it again with Zu Warriors. But this time he does it right. You rarely see him in wuxi, more often in classical eastern or criminal. But this role just fits it! The ancient Chinese legend of Zu Hill is often not represented in films (as far as I know about films translated to the West). Although the legend contains many interesting stories and opportunities. Straight said: You haven't seen any story in today's movie! And that makes it so big! And wow: all the colors and the tremendously deep, heart-to-heart story will make you the movie for a moment. The first time I looked at it, I had to watch it right away and I did. Okay, I didn't understand it for the first time. But it makes it better! You know you didn't understand it because there is so much spice! That's why it is a pleasure to see one for yourself again and again. And yes, it grows deeper in your heart, the more often you look at it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The story of love, the characters you cry with, and really: a movie you will never forget! - Editors: Well, I think I have to look at it again: D
