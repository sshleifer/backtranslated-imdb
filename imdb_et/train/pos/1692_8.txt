Like the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this film has humor on different levels. I just introduced it to my 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. Both enjoyed the movie - laughing quite a few times ... and my daughter is not a science fiction fan. The film was a laugh for me, even though I've seen a couple of times ... the humor of adults (that is, the humor that adults get simply because of the greater life experience, no band or R-rated stuff here) keeps the film equally enjoyable for adults. For example, in the case of adult humor, Mars' voices are based on characters from different films / actors. Mars pilot Blazne has Jack Nicholson's voice and ways; scientist, Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The absence of the 10 best players actually works for the film, and the actors / actors play their part well - in fact, I would say that the producers chose the actors and their skills to meet the needs of the roles, as this is a great example of Wayne Alexander's "Vern" badge). I had to write this review ... the kids play it for the third time during the dinner for 4 days. On a good rainy day or late night weekend, there's nothing-and-dull movie.
