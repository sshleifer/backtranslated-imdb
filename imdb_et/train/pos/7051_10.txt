Let me start by saying that "War, Inc" is not a cup of everyone. However, it is very enjoyable (and thinks "Oh, crap"). The comedy involved in the film is not at all obvious - it is quite fine (Tamerlas containers, dry cleaning service, etc.) and it changes with the twists of the plot. <br /> <br /> There may only be one, but I will not compare it with Grosse Point Blank because it is different. John Cusack - I wouldn't say he was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible when giving his lines and comic - although he was barely in the movie (I would say the same about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tome has a convincing reporter and can pull it out. Hilary Duff is highly praised for his role in the Central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actor is very noticeable in the film and he does a very good job (although his accent is unrealistic). <br /> <br /> In general, this is a movie I would call entertaining. It has no specific story, and it is sometimes silly, but it has a fine message. I'd say it's worth a look.
