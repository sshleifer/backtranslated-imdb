It is a refreshing air air when the film gives you the beginning of a line, in the middle and at the end, with a nice, clever mystery with a tempting hero of all ages winning us with our spirit and charm. Indeed, Andrew Fleming's film is a modern admiration, a return to an old-fashioned reliable storytelling that was normal in Hollywood. She is losing her addiction to special effects, which is now entertaining and gives us an excellent movie with very capable young actors and talented support. <br /> <br /> The film is based on old books, but it has been updated sufficiently in this century; however, the props may be different, the heart is still a good mystery, and here are the wise, linking the nuances of old and traditional youth. Emma Roberts is an old-fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that are missing from today's movies. He's still good enough to get the boys attentive, but he also knows when the current boy and self-esteem are. She earns her medals by working hard and not afraid to show little cunning when it is needed to achieve her goals. <br /> <br /> While on California vacation, our heroine will shrink the Hollywood secretary who was the victim of fraud; Suddenly he is "worshiped" by his ghost and it creates a series of events that can solve the mystery or cause something terrible. What makes the movie quite fun is the little detail because he discovers that his usual world is nothing compared to the California scene, and it is well presented without using unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or publicly sexual. Ultimately, the director has enough control to make it very pleasing to all listeners, from young to adults. This is a film that deserves visibility, appreciation and enjoyment, a film that is rare and delicate, and it's not afraid to be fun! Five stars
