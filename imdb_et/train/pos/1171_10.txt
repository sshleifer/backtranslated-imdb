I found this episode to be one of the most fun I've seen for a long time. The creators of the South Park have made the best Romero movie I've ever seen. They have really touched Romero's basic social commentary on each of his films. I would like to know what George Romero's opinion was about in this episode. I'm sure it was purely positive! Keeping your true vision of your zombie stick completely healed! Most spoofs deal with pure guru without the viewer thinking of Romero trying to make his films. I think if we had a zombie outbreak, maybe we really worried about the value of our property before our life, as shown in this episode!
