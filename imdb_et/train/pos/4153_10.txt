it was a fantastic episode. I saw this clip on YouTube and I promised that if it was ever shown on a TV, I'd stick myself with the set to watch. I finished watching it with my friend, who is gay, and we two shouted at the end. it was a truly well written, cordial episode of forbidden love between the two police, who felt they were actually (in Coop's words) "Lucky Ones". this is an episode that really makes Cold Case CBS one of the most exciting and loved television magic. I'm eagerly looking forward to more episodes and "Forever Blue" replay because I look at it again and again.
