I must say that the events of September 11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to cope with the destruction. I was the one who changed the radio and the channel on the TV when talking about the pipes. I had heard about it. When it was incited on TV for a year and one day, I was excited. It was the first time I called after the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I look at it now on TV, 5 years later, and I'm still crying for tragedies. The fact that it contains one sliding plane in one tower is amazing. It was an accident and see where it is. These two brothers make me want to help there.
