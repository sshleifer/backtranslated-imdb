I looked at the nanny as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (which includes Crown International Pictures) on DVD. I think it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, cyclists, lesbians, sexual abuse, blackmail and murder, all in one place! The main actors are doing reliable work. And I found that a complex piece of woven plot is plausible and interesting. <br /> <br /> But supportive cast first cyclists give a strong result, especially if you are asked to provide more than a few lines of words. Maybe they used real cyclists instead of actors. Especially a few characters were extraordinarily plausible. <br /> <br /> The music point is absolutely on the move, moving the times, tempo and story forward. I found the music for real treatment. From the discovery discovery I noticed that the movie had the music "The Food", I googled them; but could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and celebrated in this film, was so much (trials of a married man who was redeemed) trials and misery, and little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and celebrated "the weekend with a babysitter".
