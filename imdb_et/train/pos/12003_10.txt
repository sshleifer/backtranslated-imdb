By converting to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to accept as much as possible the history of my new religion. I was invited to participate in this film exhibition with my sons and other young men and women, and with our church families. On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio, the historic village that is there. In order to watch this movie, we had reservations in the center of Vistori. Since watching my movie was limited to just a few church documentaries, I was interesting. The only "full-length films" I had seen were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", both of which I thought were very well written and preformed. <br /> <br /> Initially, missionary interpreters went out of the tissue, noting that several films have become tears by this film. I thought "OK ... but it takes a lot to move the tears." Imagine your surprise when I scared myself! This is a very moving and inspiring will for the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> Look at this and believe it is a powerful message!
