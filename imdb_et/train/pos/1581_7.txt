Goebbels motivation was not supported. After Stalingrad, Reich decided to go to "complete war". It's called in the movie. Part of this was to use women in war-struggles that Germany had not done before. The SS massacre would have faced the massive share of Goebbels in a public relations catastrophe. His preference was for the problem to disappear as quietly as possible, given that Jewish men could always be rounded up. I understand that most lived in war. <br /> <br /> His second problem was that "Red" Berlin had never been very keen on the Nazis and had to be treated with caution. Again, the Nazis could have been paid a massacre of women, which was, on average, high in their capital. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that most SS uniforms showed patches that showed that men wearing them were not from Germany but were from other countries, such as Lithuania or Latvia
