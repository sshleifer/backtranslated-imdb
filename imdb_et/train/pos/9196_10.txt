Kimi wa petto is a lovely story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box outside her apartment one day. He decides to bring him in and confirm his cuts. He then leaves him signaling that he is eating what he did, then going home because he had to go to work. When he comes home, he finds he's still there. He tells him he wants to live there like a brother or cousin. Desperate to leave, she tells her that if she gets her pet she can stay. As a pet, he says he has no rights and does what he said to him. (not in such a perverse manner!) To his surprise he agrees and since then he is known as Momo, his pet.
