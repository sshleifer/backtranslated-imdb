If it were possible to distill the heart and soul of sport - not, pure lifestyle - surfing on its perfect form, then this documentary has done it. This documentary shows life not only from waves, but more people, pioneers, and the modern foreground, pushing a large wave envelope further than ever. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - the virtual legend of my 80's roller days in SoCal's ministry - has edited the amazing stock and interview material by nature and created not only a documentary but a genre in a masterpiece. When his heart and soul are within the subject - and this is clearly here - his genius is full of pure vision that neither glamorizes, leaps nor knows his subject. She respects surfers and surfing / beach lifestyle but doesn't reflect it. Sport is also a serious reality. <br /> <br /> With this documentary, surfers, the early history of sport and wild-type surfers, there's so much to say. . Greg Noll, the first big wave personality who allegedly started sports; Jeff Carter, an amazing man who drove for almost 15 years in the extremely dangerous Mavericki surf in Northern California; and documentary, Laird Hamliton, a big wave of surfing in today's messiah, is central. <br /> <br /> There is a huge heart and warmth among all these boys and some girls who appear in the camera - and a deep and powerful love for surfing and every word of ocean. I found a story about how Hamilton's adopted father met him and how Hamilton, as a small 4 or 5-year-old boy, forced him to practically warm his father, especially from the heart (and again removed from the syrup-like sentimentality). <br /> <br /> If you like surfing - or not - it's a great documentary that needs to be looked at, just because you are a form of student or someone who simply appreciates the art of incredibly well-made works.
