After riding a bicycle on this day, next to a lake in a nature reserve, you spend half an hour feeding and talking to a fellow who lived in this beautiful area of ​​small wood, this film is absolutely reasonable for me. br /> <br /> The film's images were beautiful and all you need. Turn your mind and work conscious knob off. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of Baraka (1992) but an extra lesson from my previous paragraph. <br /> <br /> This comment needs at least ten lines, ten rows at least 9 lines, but ten. After counting all the rows, you understand that there are less than ten, although less than ten lines are required to make my comments.
