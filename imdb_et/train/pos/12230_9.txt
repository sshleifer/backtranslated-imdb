MELTING MAN ... a tragic victim of space, he died in MELTING ... ever understood the competition, was LONG GONE BY ...! <br /> <br /> The man (Burr DeBenning) burns a hand in a kitchen stove. But instead of screaming, NORMAL screams, shouting something that sounds like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" This movie you have turned on is not a regular movie. You've just taken the first step to GETTING OUT, the famous 70's gore film, with Rick Baker's wonderful makeup. Baker was just becoming a superstar and did it at the same time as his famous "Cantina aliens" at STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS became a household name and INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN was not. <br /> <br /> It may have something to do with the fact that this movie is simply daunting. From opening credits ("Celebrating Alex Rebar as an incredible man" ... it really is what he says!), A lean sister who runs through the glass doors, the fisherman's head goes over the waterfall and graphically crushes one another. stones, this film offers many, many misunderstanding moments. "Why do they ... but how do they ... why do they ...?" After a while, you give up thinking about why and see what it is - a very fun garbage. <br /> <br /> Astronaut returns to Earth's melting and radioactive state; he escapes and breaks down in his mind, and his body begins to kill the crazy alloy. Authorities quickly decide that the melting man should be stopped, but (apparently he doesn't want to "panic") want him to stay as quiet as possible. So they send a boy with a geiger counter. Wow. <br /> <br /> Of course surprisingly little happens during the movie. The melting boy travels by killing people. The doctor is looking for him with a Geiger counter. Introducing different characters, asking questions and leaving. Finally, the doctor arrives at the melting man, but the security guard fires it without reason when he explains that he is "Dr. Ted Nelson." The melting man drives down and eventually dissolves into a big slug. End. <br /> <br /> It is so pointless that it gets somehow fun, even though it ends quite slowly. You probably plan a widescreen DVD. Very special movie.
