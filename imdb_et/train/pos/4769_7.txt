I am sure this is an exhibition that nobody knows and may not think about well; After that, it is near Baywatch Hawaii. What cast, location, style management and its advertising? shows women walking on the beach and all that. No wonder people have a misconception and they decide not to look at it. <br /> <br /> They were wrong to do. The reason why I decide to watch is actually more of a thing going on, a real juicy story and a conflict that's really exciting to look at and pretty much? addicting. <br /> <br /> The story of hotel secretaries, manager, owner and their complicated love life. Also, enter a cumbersome hotel visitor and a powerful man trying to steal the hotel. In fact, it's more exciting than it sounds here. <br /> <br /> I don't deny the actress to suck, but it's not so bad that you look away. The story is not so consistent, but good enough. The music suits the scenario quite well and the action is all the time. I took a few episodes before actually doing something firmly to be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really enjoy it. The Zillion Times is better than expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Rating: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my review after reading it, thank you.
