I saw this movie first in my game and drama course in Tulane. I was awed how beautiful and raw this documentary was. This is a sincere look at the reality of loneliness without changing reality. The family is exciting and I thought it was a small Edie from her heart. ** Unsolicited My professor even told me that during the filming, Little Edie was captivated by a camera with a man. ** I find that beauty comes from the natural dysfunction of the family. In the relationship between mother and daughter, it is obvious that society cannot act alone and want to have a small Edie rehabilitation society. All in all, the film captures its aesthetic quality and represents a surprising beauty. Two thumbs up!
