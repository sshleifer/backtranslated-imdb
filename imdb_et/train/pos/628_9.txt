This movie is fun. The actors really make the movie far away. Without giving up the plot, I would describe it as a new princess bride's cult favorite, which should remain the test of time. You see a completely different aspect of Robert DeNiro in this movie! (It's worth the entrance price for that!) All the elements are from adventure to romance and well-placed comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages can enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects can be scary for small ones. Good date movie. Excellent for some escapades. <br /> <br /> Worth the A. (I hope this will also happen at the cashier)
