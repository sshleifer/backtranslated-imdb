This film never received the attention it deserves, even though it is one of the best objects of the band's actors and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on the screen. Clear filming with low budget real V.A. The hospital, the center of the story is Joel, played very well by Eric Stoltz. Joel is paralyzed by a motorcycle accident and arrives at the hospital with other men with spinal cord injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, her married lover, Helen Hunt, who shows the early signs of her previous academic award. many other well-developed individuals. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job like angry Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe's bitter and racist Bloss. I think Forsythe's two best scenes are when he gets frustrated and angry at the square dancers, and later when he knows the empathy of a young Korean man who has been taken down in the castle shop. My favorite scene with snips is a round table discussion about post-injury sexual opportunities. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong and has two very intimate but not free events. The orgasm of the department is both sexy and fun. There is also one more memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take a specially equipped bath bar. It is indeed a comedy of flaws because they make their weak attempts to get the van to smile neighbors. <br /> <br /> The story is even more irritating because the director Neal Jimenez is paralyzed in real life. It's basically his story. This film is real, not shiny or flashy. The amount of talent in such a small budget movie is amazing. I recommend this movie to anyone I see because it is one of those films that even improves even on the second look. It is a disgrace that such a great job is not forgotten, but perhaps video can earn so much attention.
