I like this movie. Bozz is a very cool, not frightening soldier who doesn't want to go to war. His personality is similar to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel Men and War. However, this film is not in the war zone, but in the pre-war battle. This wonderful film is a hesitant notion that the Vietnam War was a mistake and those men who were involved in the victimization. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is great like Bozz, a soldier who showed that he had a lot of true love and compassion for his soldier because he didn't want and carelessly deal with the body that was trying to kill him. Bozz is completely cool and non-plus, testing and pinching your military superiors, getting your goat at every opportunity. He is a figure of Jesus Christ who has a psychological degree, "saving" his fellow citizens and showing those who have a real need to get out of this man's army. <br /> <br /> Operation and action are crisp and plausible, and "Sleeper," Tigerland goes down to Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the top three Vietnamese films in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FOUR STARS, top pick.
