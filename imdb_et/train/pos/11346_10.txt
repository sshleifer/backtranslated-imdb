I grew up in H.R. Pufnstuffi and disgracefully talented Jack Wild, and now my daughters have adored Jack Wild's fans. This movie is exactly what movies should be: fun and fun. This film is also not limited to children. Many dialogues are aimed at adults, and Witch's performance is something you don't want to miss. The music of this movie fit nicely with Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a Jack Wild fan, I never miss the opportunity to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life Jack is doing now makes this film even more wonderful, especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me stop for loving respect because she gave me the wonderful childhood memories I now give to my children. Let's all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive when you make Pufnstuff for others.
