It was one of the best films I've seen. The film is about real life and how drugs can play an important role. Although this film seems to have been produced with a low budget, I found it exhilarating to watch. <br /> <br /> Some may not have the story and say that the script has no direction. But if a person gets these symbols so deep, there is no direction in life. I feel that this film is an accurate picture of what can happen to a person when faced with extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast is industry newcomers. But they pulled it out very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get the character appropriately. <br /> <br /> I think this movie can be a good tool to use when dealing with a drug-related person or a loved one who seems to be out of control. This movie can just frighten them to make their way.
