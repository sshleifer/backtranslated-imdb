If you want to see a different movie when you love love in your heart, even if you forget the Lord, this film will make you think. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, at the end you see the ultimate goal when love gives way to the brain. I'm not emotional, but this film makes you feel like a person. I think the film is as good as Forrest Gump. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but advertising is not popular enough. "Rang-e khoda" (the color of God) is Majid Majid's second example of foreign films with almost the same taste.
