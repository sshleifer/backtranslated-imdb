A great story based on the real story of a young black man and all the difficulties along the way. Being that this is Denzel Washington's first film, which he directed directly, I have to admit that I was skeptical, but who wouldn't ..? But then again, he is a great actor with many years of experience and the end result turned out to be great. The story is said to be excellent, making you who have had difficulties in your childhood and young adulthood see yourself in such situations. So, it will hit you hard, letting you know that you are not the only one who goes to hell. All in all, the story of young men trying to do this in this new world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born on August 3, 1959, in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, also a writer of this film). 8/10
