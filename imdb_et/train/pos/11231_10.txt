I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier, this is a great series of fiction films, and I can't wait to see more of what I've just watched this week, and I'm just not getting enough of it. I've already suggested that other people look at it because it's worth the effort. I've already watched each episode several times and look forward to more episodes. I appreciated it for ten, but I think it deserves to be 12 fools for the staff at Hidden Borders of Star Trek in a great workplace. If u like Star Trek, then I recommend this star to watch a fiction film. The details of the series of such films are excellent, especially the ships and planets used in it
