Very small thriller. I had been waiting for some silly horror film, but what I got was a tight short thriller that didn't waste our time. Most of these films have to go into the stories of the rear signs, so we know their compassion or hatred when people start killing. o Such stupidity here. Yes, you see some signs, but they only communicate with principals. Like her husband's wife in a motel whose room was canceled. We saw them so that we just got to know how Lisa's character was, and how ineffective the new hotel manager was. We see a little girl just because she has a very small but important role in the film when everything bounces out. Flying lovers because we have to move forward first and foremost. A bad boy especially needs him at the beginning of the flight. The rude man at the airport was also important for the film. Only two characters, which were only 5 liners, did not use two planes on the plot. It was wise because I thought they had something to do with the plot. From the first scene to the last woman's symbol, the young hotel manager is called Lisa. Even if Jackson shows his true colors, he doesn't panic. He thinks what he can do to stop the time. All other movies that smart leading women would act like idiots. But not that. It was a very short film and I was expecting conventional plot equipment because the film seemed to be coming soon. Thank you for not using any of them. The new hotel secretary did not make a normal call and told him what to do, what the panic had fallen out of the phone and the hotel without saying anything, or ask your superior and tell him he had to drink a lot and just stop. Should Craven do more than this type of film. Also one last comment. Brian Cox is in the movie, but I had no idea who he was. I had to come here to see he was Lisa's father. He's totally recognizable.
