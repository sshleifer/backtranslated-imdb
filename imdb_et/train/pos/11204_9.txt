Symbolic use of objects, form editing, placement of characters in the scene ... they were used with Hitchcock's joyful renunciation that you really see what a fertile genius he had. The way a woman moves from one corner of the circle to another when the struggle progresses is editing when the wedding ring is placed on the finger ... although these may seem a bit obvious in today's silent era when they spoke the story without telling the story. Even the title has at least four meanings that I see; boxing ring, wedding ring, bracelet, lover buys, and love triangle in the heart of the story.
