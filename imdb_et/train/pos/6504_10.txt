My wife and I have been following this series at least three times. I can't imagine how it could be better. This is not a "complete" history of World War II. There is no library to have such a history, but it is the best summary of this history. Lots of details, lots of personal stories and still a general picture. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narration is perfectly written and, of course, excellent. Interviews are from all sides except Russian, because the producers could not speak to many Russians. Having this complete program on a DVD is very worthwhile. We appreciate your copy. <br /> <br /> The manufacturer does an excellent job of delivering images and activities where almost no archives existed: for example, convoys and underwater battles are almost non-existent, but still the episode is very well done.
