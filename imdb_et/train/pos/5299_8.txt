When you get past the title of the movie, "Pecker" is a great movie, maybe the best of John Johns. The wonderful cast, led by the strong performances of Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes this story very fun and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for babies, but they are for that purpose. Unfortunately, this movie was not mass production and most of the public can't watch it. If the opportunity knocks, look at this movie.
