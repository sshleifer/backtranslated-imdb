I saw Bourne's ultimatum last summer with a friend and wow! I had already seen the first two films and I liked them, but I loved this Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays with Jason Bourn, an American who carries a CIA agent trying to find out who he is. br /> <br /> As I already said, I loved this movie from start to finish, no plot holes, slow scene, everything was right and it fits well with other movies, but in all respects it was much better. <br /> <br /> The best stunts, cars, actors and effects I've seen in the movie all summer (surprisingly thanks to Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.). t just action in this movie, Jason doesn't just kill or run. He has a soul and the audience knows him, so there is drama too. But it does not slow it down. <br /> <br /> Of all the triple games that came out last summer, it was the best.
