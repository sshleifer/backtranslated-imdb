Eric Stoltz gives an extraordinary result as a successful young novelist Joel Garcia, who falls into a bad and recently disabled private clinic after breaking his neck in a hike. By learning to cope with and adapting to his new level of physical difficulty, Joel interacts with a slick, fast-talking, charming Raymond (amazing Wesley snipes) and a hungry, silly biker Bloss (terrible William Forsythe) who feels threatened by the diversity of ethnic groups he's is forced to share. Joel also gets significant support from her loyal and loving but married girlfriend (a ringtone played by Helen Hunt). But she must still understand her disability independently. <br /> <br /> This remarkable victory in the film is his gratifyingly stubborn refusal to disinfect and sentimentally understand what these men are going through. Director Neil Jimenez (who also wrote a thoughtful and incomprehensible script) and Micheal Steinberg associate the story with extraordinary taste, thinking and warmth, paying special attention to disarming the customs and the factual question of how irreversibly changes people's lifestyle, including your sex life (this point is the most powerful) when Joel and Anna try not to love the motel room). In addition to the expected generation, the film offers a surprisingly ridiculous funny funny reputation for humor, highlighted in a terrifying sequence where Joel and Bloss made a secret night expedition to the striptease club. Another important plus to qualify for excellent performance is: Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding, Grace Zabriskie as Bloss's potty, friendly mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as hospitalized. Despite the gloomy theme, the film ultimately proves to be a very moving, positive and uplifting kinematic testimony of the amazing strength and endurance of the human spirit. Just a wonderful little pearl drama.
