I've never seen a quiet movie until July 24, 2005. I've never seen a movie with Mary Pickford. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. I found the latter to be Mohicans and unforgettable (Ray Liotta) hypnotic, so check out the source if you read it. I started watching Tess from the hurricane of TCM to see who Mary Pickford had been credited by many to start Hollywood. I had no idea what I was. Two hours later I broke it out and realized that I was looking at one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen playing a suitable role. Imagine a fan of the film in 1922, having ever seen someone who was beautiful and expressive before that. You should see her again and again. The device was perfect for a girl who was expressive. He was poor, the king could not speak English, but you had to admire him. What movie ... it's time to start your Mary Pickford movie collection!
