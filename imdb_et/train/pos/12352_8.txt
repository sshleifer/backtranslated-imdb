My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the movie very much. The viewer is wiped out of modern life in Japan, while exhibiting very current themes. The characters are realistic and detailed; it has an unpredictable end and a story that is very refreshing. The story consists of small plots located in the lives of many poor geisha living in the poor neighborhood. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in realistic romance or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
