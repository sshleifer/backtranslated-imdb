I enjoy this movie whenever it appears on television. <br /> <br /> One scene that always stands out for me is Myrna Loy and the painter, where she gives her very clear instructions on colors and as soon as she goes away, she turns her boys and says, "Is you get it, it's yellow, blue, green and white "
