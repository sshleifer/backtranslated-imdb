This is probably one of Brian De Palma's best-known films, but it's not his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very much affected by Hitchcock and this movie has been taken off Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a boring housewife who thinks she has a thing and after her psychiatrist Michael Caine plays, Dickinson leaves a man in the art gallery and runs to sleep with him. After that, it is best if you don't know what is going on, but there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a girl who looks at the killer. Dennis Franz is a detective who doesn't trust Allen and has to find the killer himself. It's a pretty good movie, but that's not one of De Palma's best.
