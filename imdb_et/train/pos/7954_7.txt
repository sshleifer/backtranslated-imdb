Great voice, a lot of adventure and smart dialogue make it a very good movie. Adding the "character" of the three guiding animals gives a much deeper meaning and meaning, especially between the older man Shadow and the young hellstar, Chance. Earlier versions of this film could not give the animals any real personality or motif that is perfectly made here. Sally Field is any lover, but really shines in this movie with proud cats, Sassy. Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives in life and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzze to make the plot and resolution excellent. There's even an uplifting score and a beautiful mountain range. Definitely an ideal evening alone or with children. Hats to Disney.
