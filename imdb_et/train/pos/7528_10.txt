If this film strikes you (as it did us and probably others leave the theater) so disappointingly thin, it may be because the subject itself is a little disappointing. The film gives us the Bettie Page, which was probably: a playful almost innocent in the South-South countryside, whose career as a "queen of the universe" was simply silly, natural fun for her. His possible moral characteristics, religious transformation, and unexpected departure from naked and serfdom are biographically accurate, but hard to understand when he knew his livelihood unknown. <br /> <br /> There are many reasons to watch this movie, which is at least W. Mott Hopfel III's amazing binary artist (with old-fashioned napkins and dissolution), the astonishing behavior of the 1950s under Mary Harron's leadership, some of our least appreciated supporters ( including Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak), not to mention the Oscar-worthy and technically difficult Gretchen Mol performance. <br /> <br /> Ms. Mol makes many lingerie and "specialty" lingerie and "specialty" costumes (put together by costume designer John A. Dunni), but he surprisingly preserves the unforgettable pleasure of Bettie's leaf in his lush body. To see that Mrs. Mol is pr. Page, an aspiring actor who is gradually moving to less "bad" hearings and student shows, is seeing a truly beautiful actor in complete control of his craft. <br /> <br /> The script makes us effective in the 1950s in America, where sexual abuse of childhood, illegal robbery and rape, and the legal suppression of pornographic brands, which today seem ridiculous, are a reality. In the 50's in New York, an intermediate news reel footage is being created smoothly. The 50's Miami is overflowing, 16mm in style. The actual Bettie page seems to be disgusting, smiling and depicting us, but this effect is strangely light, barely lewd and not at all dangerous. <br /> <br /> It is strange that the slave's largest icon should be poisonous and that this technically excellent biopsy should be so small.
