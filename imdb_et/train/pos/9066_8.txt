~ ~ I saw this movie yesterday morning by early viewing ~ ~ <br /> <br /> I'm a mother of two, ranging from 11 to 6. So I'm sure a lot of parents can be involved in watching a lot of "movies". It was refreshing for me. I haven't read this particular book so I don't know if it was a book or not. But it certainly took the size. This is the story of a "new" child in the city and it happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of varieties and love for children. Have we not suffered it at one time or another. He has a little brother whom he can't stand and his parents are embarrassed. It was most pleasant to see how each character was completely different from the other they were all. The bully (why do they always make the red head a bully? My daughter's red hair! And she's not a bully! .. lol) is a great big tempter who finds herself screaming at her own big brother. Spun turns and well if you love them all and really find yourself for all the characters. Even parents, a great relationship between father and son. Everything is enjoyable, sweet, funny, gross, etc. You will enjoy it as much as they do!
