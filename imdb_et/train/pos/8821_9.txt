The question is, is the movie that this entertainment is really a "bad" movie? My husband and I took it 99 cents in a used video store just because of the title and the fact that the box had the words "Vestron Pictures" (Vestron is a highly regarded quality label since I first recorded the legendary "Suburbia" and "1984 class "). We didn't expect a movie full of victory, as it was. Your basic piece, as follows: Grange, the thug of planet Earth planet, robs the "moon of the moon" and condemns the colony on a distant planet (I don't even remember the name of the planet) for bauxite and other minerals. The "Governor" of this colony and the owner of the mine use the work of the prisoners. The Earring Player Walker (probably one of the three whole planets) reminds the detainees that there is no escape, because there is only one truck on the planet and they should deal with it. Then it is called "Colonel", a pensioner who suffers from a haunted repeating nightmare. A large part of the film centers are surrounded by an explosion of "futuristic" car ties (plywood with side plywood). The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of those other dusty inland empires. But what makes the film truly shining is the surprisingly awesome soundtrack that includes many of the punk punk ensembles from the mid-1980s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was once pressed on vinyl, but it is definitely worth buying a movie for just the soundtrack. I can't even commemorate the names of these bands (these are in the list of credits) after Exploding White Mice, because that was the only thing I saw in the movie before, but I've definitely explored. better to enjoy 12-seat beer and some of your closest friends.
