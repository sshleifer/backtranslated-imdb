I must say that it was not very exciting, but talked about fashion and strange ways to solve the mystery. A bit too easy, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) is using IMDb ... it's awesome! I liked this part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) is still a lot of fun ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed hopeless ... he should have been more angry with him how he has treated him ... <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie is an excursion and a vogue. Anyway, I recommend this movie just in the summer. Encore Nancy, just for fun. Emma Robert's more teenage spy films. Spymate ... remember? He is doing well in this complex detective work.
