Have you ever been or are a pet who has been with you through the thick and thin ones you would lose, and who do you love anything? Betcha never thought they would feel the same way! <br /> <br /> A wonderful, wonderful family film. If you have a soft place for animals, it is guaranteed that you will be killed regardless of your age. I watched this movie all the time when I was a little boy, and I find that, at the age of sixteen, I love it as much as I did. Then I could never decide on a favorite mark and I don't think I can! I love all three animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but weak family. I love the opportunity, and how he finally says he finally has a family. Nice, yes, but we have to remember that it is meant for family film and it fulfills this role perfectly. Sassy has the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect leader / role model for young, adventurous opportunities. <br /> <br /> Animals are passing through humans, but of course most are tears. communicating with them (ie saving and ending Molly). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives even more emotions and associated heart-swelling to every moment. I'll give it 9/10. They are compared (and even better) to cats and dogs and babe.
