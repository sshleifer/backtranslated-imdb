I testify that I had first seen the previews of this movie. Was VH-1 running on hollow soil here? I mean, Harris and Quinn don't really look like John or Paul. But I have to admit that this movie really surprised me. This is far from the expected movie. Instead, it is a character-study, a low-key, lively and ultimately a look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn: it's hard, if not impossible, to capture what we once had, and what has passed us.
