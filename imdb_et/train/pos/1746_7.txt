Bela Lugosi will play one of his rare good roles in the series based on the long running radio (which was also the source of the feature film where Lugosi played the cable). did not get more roles where he could be a good commanded man. Then Chandu will return from the East to help Princess Nadji, who is hunted by the leaders of the Ubastian cult, who need her to bring the high priest of her cult back from the dead. It's a good looking series that is very fun. To make sure that this pace is a bit weak, one of the principals (producing studios) is more like a hanging adventure, but it's still enjoyable. It plays better than two of the cut movies because it allows things to happen at their own pace, instead of feeling rushed or in the sense that "hey I miss something." One of the three good series of trilogy made by Lugos, others were SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
