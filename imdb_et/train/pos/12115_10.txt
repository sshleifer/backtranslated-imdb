Another comment on this movie gave it a twilight. Given that the pictures you were talking about were so new - I think the script and the action were good. Davis was so young and fresh. He had not yet found his own style that we expected. But it's great to see her in this way - still learning this craft. <br /> <br /> With so many movies, so many clich√©s came out and it seems that this movie created some paths for 70 years. My voice is to see it and I remember how young this film was. Keep and open your mind, and maybe you are shocked at how pleased the characters are in this picture, because in 1934 and how we look at the beginning of the last century. I love it and I hope you do your mind about what it does not affect others negative and one comment.
