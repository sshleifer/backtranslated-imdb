One of the most sensible comedies to hit the Hindi film screenings. The award-winning Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 60s Hollywoon hit. proved that he is one of the best stars of the Hindi cinema who can do comedy. He has well combined a new hunk with John Abraham. However, John remains in the Akshays shadows and does not rise to the times. <br /> <br /> The new galaxies are cute and fulfill their roles with complete justice. <br /> <br /> Must look at comedy. Leave the brain off and laugh 2 hours !!!! After all, laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
