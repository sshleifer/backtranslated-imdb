There is a bit of trivia that should be highlighted early on in the movie, where Homer follows the experiment of 6 December 1957 (at least that used by the television he was watching), which showed Vangard's launch attempt. He has subsequently shown a letter to Dr. Von Braun or dictation that gives him condolences. <br /> <br /> Von Braun was at the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville. The Vanguard project was made by the early NASA team, which was soon to be the Goddard Space Flight Center. <br /> <br /> The army rushed to Jupiter-C, which was essentially US-made V2 technology, but worked to launch the satellite by responding to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This mistake can actually be made by Homer because of Von Braun's reputation, but his team did not try to do so. In fact, Redstone only flew out of 52 and was the first US man-valued enhancer used for Shepard's orbital flight, as well as Grissom. <br /> <br /> Therefore, such a movie is as good as hopefully inspiring people to read and watch these trivia and see what has been done and inspired to do more in this process.
