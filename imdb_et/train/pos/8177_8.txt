I'm surprised that no one has ever thought about such a movie. Horror is often the most effective when using the subject as a real nuisance. And someone (except Steve Martin's small shop of horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Teeth torture has been done in the past (see, for example, Marathan's man), but it brings terror to suburbia. <br /> <br /> The plot rotates around the dentist Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who goes into madness. Now our dear doctor did not start with a full deck, but prompted jealousy and obsessive compulsive disorder that would devastate the people around him. Doctors for spiraling the mental state are close to what we see in Michal Douglas's character at Falling Down, but with the edge of horror. <br /> <br /> Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna have written and directed the horror stuwart. big stream. Also played by police players, is always welcome to Ken Foree. <br /> <br /> Now I believe that this movie will not work without absolutely fantastic performance from Corbin Bernsen. After seeing her before LA, she bounced off her behavior. <br /> <br /> Further dentist 2 is also worth, but slightly lower than the original. <br /> <br /> TTKK Bottomline - a fun movie with some scenes that make you brighter, finite (red) by Bernsen's great performance
