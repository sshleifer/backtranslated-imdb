Finally, we have a category III movie for the summer 2006 season. Created from Equal Brutality, Crime and Passion, Dog Bite Dog not only supports the most appropriate title, but also the flexible direction, excellent cinematography and respectable performances. Of course, there must be a harvest that manifests itself here in the form of a number of outstanding contradictions, but everyone said that DBD represents a mature spirit that we would like to see more in HK mainstream. <br /> <br /> Edison also marks Chen's return, which has been around for a long time since the beginning of the year. The reserved mechanism of Chen is a miracle for the film, but should have been without hair without Sam Lee, whose ability to alternate between physical comedy (Crazy 'N' City, No Problem 2) and mad threat has culminated in the strongest role. He has seen him since Made in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Together, the duet will bite the dog and hopefully Edison will start to break it easier: the projects he touches will turn from Princess D to Infernala's stuff, and he will rarely stay. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, DBD will start showing some mesmerizing images by playing great tricks with light, shadow and perspective. Soundtrack enhances this atmosphere by adding a movie to the general unrealistic mood. Much of the resulting combination is likely to be related to the writer Matt Chow, who has been involved in three extremes. Dog Bite Dog retains a number of features that are reminiscent of this horror project, namely lost city spaces and round-the-corner air that is around the corner. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not a fear film, but instead of Mongkok, the classic One Nite has gone before, albeit at an angle. Replacing Daniel Wu's reluctant character of the continent's assassin, we have Edison, who plays an unnamed killing machine from the Cambodian underworld. The Hong Kong Way of One Target was Sent, an almost silent assassin takes care of the business immediately after arriving, which is politely polite to the film's ingenious visualism. <br /> <br /> Although childhood weaned as a killer, a wild dog named Edison still has weaknesses and leaves a trail that the CID team sent for investigation has grown. This assembly includes a nice movie that is a mob-movie stalwart Lam Suet, and a good support for the TV star Wayne Lai. At the same time, the prosecution is led by Sam Lee's Renate Officer Wai, revealing himself as a very disrupted person, but as an excellent police officer. We are gradually learning about Wai's internal conflict, which is due to his father's police corruption background, creating demons in a handy pursuit that arises. <br /> <br /> A small body number appears as Edison seems to be considering not taking prisoners. The recording has a rather violent division, although gore itself seems to be toned and adult language only symbolizes. Once again, the nudity that is leading to the conclusion of the 3rd cat is given a bit of haste these days. However, DBD is a relatively mature theater release, and we praise its arrival. <br /> <br /> In combat, stapling, hacking and shooting, even a career murderer needs romance, and as Daniel Wu had on Cecilia Cheung One Nite, the scary Mr. Chen also makes a sweetheart by the new comer Pei Pei. His unnamed character (a lot of anonymity in this) responds to Edison's strangely abandoned landfill, which his father abuses to relieve madness and longing to escape. When a killer scratches HK, he agrees to take him along, and they go running together, loving prosperity on the journey. Although the film does not love the love-dwarfing stuff, our hearts go to the tragic character of Pei Pei and his endless suffering. He makes a terrifying but brave protagonist amazingly well, proving that there are no good and bad guys, which is proved by a very amazing finale. <br /> <br /> Director Cheang Soi's portfolio includes Home Sweet Home, a recently stopped thriller, and Eason Chan, a love for Battlefield, two numbers likely to have exceeded the threatening behavior of Dog Bite Dog on most accounts. Cheang is able to keep the DBD under a flowing stream and considering the parts that can be played here, he faces critical standards set by people like Johnny To in his water at The Mission at night. A couple of trouble will not come to Edison's wonderfully shrugging off the chest, but they are very forgiving. <br /> <br /> A remarkable return to the two young talented Hong Kong performers, if we want the city's film bloom to come back, the dog's biting dog doesn't look like a story. This forte lies in strong images and styles that are built on the strength of their muscles and their outstanding visual and audible eyes. <br /> <br /> HK has a long-standing and respectable tradition. The city's night-changing ego, something dog biting dog supports lovingly, reaching a certain run, if not as a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
