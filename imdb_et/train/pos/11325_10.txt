When I heard about this series from AnimeTV, I have to say that all of the exhibitions I've seen have all been turned off. I had to see this show and I really did. When I got the first volume of this exhibition, it was the best. I liked the animation and all the fighting scenes were fantastic. I have to say that my favorite characters were Saber and Archer and of course I also like Illya. And, of course, all the episodes of the volumes were interesting and very cool. Another thing I say about this series is Michael McConnohie (famous Transformers and others) who play Berserker's voice. He has a cool character. And I also looked at the whole series again before I look at the final volume. So if you see something good, look at this show, it's the best.
