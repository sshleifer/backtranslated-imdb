Green Eyes is a great movie. In today's context, it is interesting to support our troops that this film showed during the time that there were no respectable soldiers who had their responsibilities. From the historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam War was remembered and learned by all of us. The gene was very proud of this film and he earned the credit he received for writing "green eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often or at all. This movie is a movie that should be shown on television every year, like the Oz wizard. The commitment of one person to his missing son moves completely. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky
