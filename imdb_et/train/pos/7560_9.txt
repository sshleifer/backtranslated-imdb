Starfucker (which reads my box Starstrucki) was the most amazing film I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen. Why not 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why she is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look on the dark side of Hollywood. I've been forced to watch some other movie and they all agreed it was an outstanding flick.
