When you get it, it's great. <br /> <br /> If you don't, it's okay. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean that you have gone through school photography. There is so much more to this film that sometimes getting into school becomes irrelevant. <br /> <br /> In particular, it is a film about accepting a traumatic event both superficially and from people who are different for any reason. <br /> <br /> This is also a film about painless pain and how different people suffer from it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's rage and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of sensitive anxiety that, halfway through the film, thinks of how the director could draw a happy ending from his hat. Fortunately, the audience is given a person; our intelligence is not offensive, an incredibly moral end. <br /> <br /> Over and over, I'll try to keep a clear head for movies that are fiction and all that. But I have to admit that I screamed at this movie like a lost little child. There were certain things that hit * very * near the home and opened some old wounds that had never really healed. But this is not necessarily bad.
