This is a great movie - esp, compared to the sometimes tiring misery of the current politically minded filmmakers. The film, which can easily combine gender, gender, politics and art, is a rarity these days. Although the optimism of the 1960s cannot be restored, I think we can at least learn the dull energy and charm of the film. I don't know what those who tagged the movie "boring" looked - there is so much packed that it will never stay the same movie for more than 15 minutes at a time.
