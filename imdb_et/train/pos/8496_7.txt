Wow, this has been the last time this movie has been seen since. Looking at it in 2008 is definitely different from that seen in 1986. Initially, I didn't think I'd get this movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so unpleasant, arrogant and disrespectful that I had a hard time watching him. He embodies all the negative stereotypes of the Americans. If it wasn't bad enough, when the best workers in small American cities were shown, the picture worsened. On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese language was emotionally robotic to the workplace. The film wasn't all funny, I just hung it because of its nostalgic value. And I'm glad I went on the watch. <br /> <br /> Just like boxing, the judges will succeed in how you finish. This movie went from about three to seven, which I appreciated for its end. The end was great. You always want a harmonious ending, and that was exactly what it was. It was great that the city had to hold jobs and keep the factory there, but the most special was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a mediocre film that ended with a high note.
