Just one of the most recent movies I've ever seen. It is a parody of crime life, a parody of everything that represents Chicago in the 1930s. - There really is no need to underestimate this movie because the rating is below 5. His opinion of mass and mass is hypnotized. Who decides to look at it - he regrets to decide not to look at it - regrets more.
