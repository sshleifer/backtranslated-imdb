This is a well-directed film by John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but made some fine films, including the 1937 version of The Zeus prsoner. In London, where only Hollywood can manage its atmosphere, but nothing real, it is a story of obsession and broken love, the Somerset Maughan novel. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing it on the DVD, as I never saw it before, and Bette Davis' great admirer, wanted to see her as a big one. So I bought it. Well, he looked good, but I'm sorry that his London cockney accent made me just laugh. Bette Davis was one of the biggest filmmakers, made no mistake, but here he made one. It was impossible to take his character seriously. It wasn't as tough as Dick Van Dyke's 'Mary Poppins' summary accent, but close. <br /> <br /> Another important role was Leslie Howard and she did it great. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. It is worth watching, despite Mrs Davis' vocal training.
