It is a rarity of rarity, a film of ideas. Many movies will give a vision for the future, but few will try to show us how this future was. The first part of the film, when war comes to Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, in the year of his release, he smiled at the release of reports that enemy planes attacked England. Par model work is the most effective. Explanatory titles are strongly resembling German expressionist graphic design. The artistic director was big William Cameron Menzies and his set of Everytown ruins is his best work. Margaretta Scott very attractive when the capital's mistress is in the 21st century Everytown has the same striking design - the story of the 21st century is not convincing - maybe it was the wrong attempt to resist the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of the 1970s. This is particularly acute because the scenes of giant aircraft are very convincing, and this is redeemed by Raymond Massey's excellent film, which ends the film - rarely is the ideal of scientific development so good. Massey's last question is now more important than ever, seriously demarcated manned The scene is supported by Sir Arthur Bliss music that I am proud to share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are totally terrible, serious technical issues. Most versions have edited quite interesting assembly of futuristic workers and machines, which takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD from the whole movie.
