In my opinion, this is a good example of a film that could have been much better than it would have been ten years earlier. I doubt it would be in favor of modern technologies, but it would have seemed much better than it would be at least 90 minutes from 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and the animated did a good job. In my opinion, this film can be the best background art and one of the best shapes. Animation is extremely smooth and realistic. The duration of the movie that you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a good job. You can also be proud to be one of the sexiest women animated characters, if not the sexiest, to keep the usual anime girls easily. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has a couple of bad thin that doesn't make it so appealing. First, the plot and implementation are comparable to modern adventure films and are indeed outdated with modern standards. Secondly, due to the duration, it would take much more than 20 minutes of dialogues. Finally, the device is not so popular right now. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A great alternative to another short description of Conan in Barbar but not for the novel.
