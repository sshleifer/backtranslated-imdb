"Citizen X" is a wonderfully talked-about story about killing one of the worst serums in history. What makes this story even more important is where and when it happened; Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Light Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Viktor Burakov (perfectly played by Stephen Rea) has recently been a forensic investigator at the Rostov Oblast. He discovers earlier and current unsolved murders, apparently the same person. Murder is unresolved because no one has ever studied the evidence enough. He drives to find and stop the killer. His only tool is his dedication, skill and honesty. His obstacles are corruption in the Soviet system and political ideology that prevents the search for truth. His naive would have led to failure, if not his boss, Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically clever cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with Soviet bureaucracy. At the same time, he shares Burakov's desire to bring the murderer to justice, even if the official party is "no successive killers in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> Cast is outstanding. Locations and kits are the perfect restorations of last day Soviet life. Randy Edelman's score is particularly good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a blind and disturbing criminal phenomenon that has both intensity and strength. It was a cable film made by HBO Films and they have become a great resource for movies that would not otherwise be done.
