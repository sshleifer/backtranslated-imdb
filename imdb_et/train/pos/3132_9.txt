I watched it last night with low expectations. The reasons are that I don't usually like "making movies" for movies, and rarely have I liked "cast reunion" movies. But the Los Angeles Times critic seemed like that, so I gave him a chance. I'm glad I did. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward connect themselves. But in some ways they acted on their "Batman and Robin" themselves. They were campy and did not take themselves or this movie too seriously. The film begins with them, looking for George Barris for Batmobile, so that someone stole it before it was sold at the orphan home auction. Although they are looking for a car, they also recall the series they did together. This is about feedback. It was well done. The actors they got because the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead. And for the TV movie, it went down to the actual behavior on and off the screen. I give it 9/10, I liked it so much.
