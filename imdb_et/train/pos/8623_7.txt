DER TODESKING is not my favorite film Jorg Buttgereit - but it is still an interesting film about suicide and its causes and consequences. Those who are looking for a gore festival or NEKROMANTIK film or SCHRAMM style are probably disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an art-house-style movie, so those who need linear, explainable narratives do not have to ... <br /> <br /> DER TODESKING's basic concept is that there is an episode every day of the week that revolves around with a strange chain letter, apparently causing people to commit suicide, mixed with slowly decaying body scenes ... <br /> <br /> There are some very well done and thought-provoking scenes, including a man who speaks of "problems" with his wife, and a massacre of a concert ( which unfortunately lost some of my "power" because I was too busy laughing at a band like SCORPIONS on stage ...). But seriously - this is sometimes beautiful (a scene that shows the different angles of this huge bridge is especially effective - especially if you understand the importance of the scene and the names shown are people who tagged the tag actually committed suicide) ...), sometimes confused, sometimes silly (SS-OUT SS-hanging is quite amusing), sometimes harassing (I found a very effective movie about a woman's talking scene with a girl in the park). it is rather an "experience" but simply an entertainment, because many of these "art" films are meant to be. But I didn't find DER TODESKING as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and I would probably put it on a relatively equal footing with NEKROMANTIK 2 in my personal "enjoyment". Be sure to check out all the Buttgereit or "art" films. If you dig this type of movie - see SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - I think the BEST art-house / horror movie I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
