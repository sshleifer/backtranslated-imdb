Otto Preminger's classic work is almost the same as LAURA ... although this film was bright and has a high flawless Clifton Webb, this film is a sailor. Dana Andrews is less than a good policeman who accidentally kills one man only to potentially be his beloved girl's father. Preminger keeps things busy, so logic expiration is easily overlooked. Andrews is pretty good (much less wood than in the past) and the amazingly beautiful Gene Tierney is amazingly beautiful! Terrible Craig Stevens plays an unhappy victim. WHERE SIDEWALK ENDS is a black-sighted and terrible companion to Preminger's equally passionate WHIRLPOOL (also starring in Tierney).
