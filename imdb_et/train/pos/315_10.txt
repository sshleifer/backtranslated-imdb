I loved this soap. It's been one of my favorites. I highly recommend :) ... I just love Brazilian soaps, they are dealing with real events. I'm really sad that the soap ended, but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those who haven't seen it, look at it. I loved the characters, the plot and how the fun stuff finally came out for the villain. The only thing I would have changed is the end of Xica and its long life. I can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it. Xica is by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. I hope everyone likes it as well.
