When I rented this movie I took a flyer, but I have to say that it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography and high product values, etc. Eva Longoria Parker proves bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston who wear and call to act on her head and shoulders. Who is that? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in this class and should try to keep the projects as good as "over his dead body". Bell Bell is also great, and it's the first time I saw him. And finally, Paul Rudd shines with a very good movie instead of movies. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie never gets its fees from men in the neighborhood. Too bad. As other IMDb reviewers have noted here, this pearl is not going to write or act - something flat. <br /> <br /> And its today's L.A. and the portrayal of California makes all the scenes bright, beautiful, clean and otherwise outstanding. Never before has film in LA been so good. Ah, what a little talent and a lot of care can do for the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't have a plot, but for a long time and as a hard core, I was ready to stop unreliable and supernatural buying to enjoy great and lightweight entertainment. It reminds me a lot of old "Topper" movies, which were also so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> This movie is a popular but otherwise creepy movie, like "Ghost" for a mediocre and too sentimental devil. is. We already know that public taste tends to be mediocre. Some of us save our praise for truly worthy ones. <br /> <br /> If you have Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum, and Clu Gulager other precious gems like "Into the Night" Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, " Chances Are "with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard," Mr. Right "with John Malkovich, etc. <br /> <br /> First-class work everywhere (even if it's hard to believe that a straight boy can pretend he's gay for more than five years.) But even this plot device doesn't diminish the overall film excellence.
