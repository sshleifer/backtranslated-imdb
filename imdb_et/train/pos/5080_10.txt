If ever the Mel Ferrer film is produced or staged, you can bet your life if any of his pictures appear to a generation of generations. Just Claudette Colbert (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", 47 appearing and starring in the movies, makes it an even bigger classic film. In this film, Ellen Ewing marries and then she encounters all kinds of mental problems and even murder. The mystery is very involved and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of Battle", 65, will help Ellen and sometimes you even know that David is up and up. When you look at this picture, you just find that you start to understand who is the real nutty person and suddenly you start to change your mind about how the movie ends. Great works by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, who played a completely different role than he usually plays on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to a big movie star Audrey Hepburn. A great classic movie with great classical actors!
