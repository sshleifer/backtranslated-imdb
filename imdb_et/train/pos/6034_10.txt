Last November I had the opportunity to see this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a lot of fun. Some technical errors were left aside, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially the leading man. There are many hearts in this movie, many. I was able to talk to some filmmaker after it was done, and they looked really nice. All in all, the whole movie was only a positive experience and one that I would definitely recommend. The story was entertaining and cool, because the woman is going through many of the same problems as the leading man, and I could really understand her problems. The film gives us an excellent job by giving us the people we know. The friends in the movie are really well written, they are realistic. I know people like me, I just want Imy's friends and I could sound as cool as these people. The whole movie is really cool, I want there to be more movies. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
