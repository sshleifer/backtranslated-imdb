No day goes without a new animated computer movie, so now we really have the chance to see more than a few nice effects. After seeing the ice age, I felt that it was not as much of an impact on me as some of the other films in this genre. <br /> <br /> But that's because I'm a big guy now and I'm pretty sure it's a very enjoyable movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple and "actors" are cute in a funny way, with no raw or complicated humor. Even "bad" is a cute, fluffy big cat with these funny teeth. And the story is lucky, which was a little disappointing to me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to death), but it's a big deal for kids. And besides some struggles, no one dies (not even when he mammoth, how many times he gets), which made the comic lesson. <br /> <br /> The computer animation section is nice, but nothing special except for some really nice cartoony feeling scenes when you feel like walking a nice painting or pages of comics. [What a lot of work to do!] <br /> <br /> There were some gags that made me smile - I agree, the creators tried to satisfy those adults - but they are hard to see and (in my opinion) better noticed because it don't feel like it would fit the story. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a nice movie, but it is more like an ideal world and a fluffy Disney cliche for animals and children. If you don't hate cute animals, do it at least once.
