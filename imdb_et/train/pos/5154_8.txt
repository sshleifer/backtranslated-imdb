Like WW2 / Nazi German amateur historian, I couldn't wait to appear on the DVD. When I first passed it in 2003, I didn't want to repeat what has been said about the previous 8 pages of historical inaccuracies. Better work could have been done by showing "charming" Hitler. I also had a small problem with some of the election choices, not so much with their actions, but also with their performance. Peter Stormare doesn't look like Rohm, why didn't they make Babson when Hess wears a wig? And my biggest complaint ... so much has always been done by Hitler's eye-catching eyes, why didn't they make Carlyle's blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought that the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked pretty good. Again, as long as people watching it realize that it should be entertainment in the 1st, 2nd history, I don't think much damage will be caused.
