Frailty - 8/10 - This is a non-sensitive title and "Bill Paxton redirects" next to the title, it's a pretty good old-fashioned hanging biblical horrorist. Finally, it can only be Kubrick's "The Shining" --- inbred Southern Gothic cousin, but hey, this is a pretty fucking entertaining concept. It also has a familiar plot twist ... and a very vague moral message. This is a film that people are now catching with the main cable by the late evening and scare the beeys for themselves. Too bad director Bill Paxton was supposed to be a descendant.
