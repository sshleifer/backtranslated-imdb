Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie, especially considering the first time the bad advertisement was released. Ben Affleck is a funny as an unpleasant millionaire who pays for a family living at his childhood to be his family for Christmas. He then goes to the family for a crazy Christmas holiday. I have not been a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (although I liked Daredev and Paycheck), but here he is well cast in this role. I also like Christina Applegate, the daughter of the family, who can't make Affleck's character at first. Of course you can see where this movie is going, but you don't care. Ignore what critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than many Christmas movies.
