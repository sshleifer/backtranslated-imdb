Almost the entire film takes place in a public sauna in China. There are no fancy sets, explosions or glamorous people - just good writing, acting and direction (Hollywood, please note!). <br /> <br /> An alienated son returns to his home when he believes his father is dying. He is surprised that his father looks good and usually goes through a family business. In fact, he points out that his father and his brother brother have indeed forged a close and caring relationship and it soon turns out that he is out of the loop! The father is very traditional and this visiting son is from a big city and does not really see the value of an old bath. How their relationships change and where the plot goes there is extraordinary and plausible. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see that not every Chinese film is an act of action (such as those starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) because I don't care particularly about these frenetic films. Both the shower and the small town of spring are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films.
