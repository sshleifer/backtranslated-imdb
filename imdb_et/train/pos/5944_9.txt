I say this first: ... Why, no, why can't WB do what these short film directors do? Sandy is probably an amazing director and deserves no credit from WB and DC. But I think they're sure if a $ 12,000 person can make super-hero fans. The best in the world is one of the best short films I've ever seen, Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think that choosing a bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a gene choice. Let's be honest, Superman is not a super-model. He may be beautiful, but he is not GQ Stud. And I don't know what this man was saying, but Superman is actually pretty weird (have you ever seen Superman comics?). I think this fact alone will floor me ... It seems like an obvious choice to get someone's real muscle mass to play the Super Hero, not the face. The same thing for Batman, Bartram has an incredible shape and great Batman ... I don't know the guys ... If he gets a bigger budget and his own movie ... I think Bale and Bartram would be neck and neck. The bottom line, this is one of the few Super-Hero movies that participants are actually looking for. <br /> <br /> Action is also pretty nice. I don't know what everyone is saying, O'Hearn is not that bad. He's fucking convincing like Superman and Bartram ... Well, he's Batman. I mean, come on people, this movie was a $ 12,000 budget that you were expecting? Everybody else is also great, except Two-Face seems to be sharper than usual ... But we only have Tommy-Lee Jones. Oh, Lois is too hot. <br /> <br /> SFX is also sweet. Seeing Superman lifting up the car ... MAN !, how cool it is. Compared to the "Tank" scene in Grayson, maybe I need it above, because Mike looks like he is driving and easily. Flying sequences continued with something unwanted, but again with a bigger budget ... Oh, and he even used Batmobile! (It was probably a model, but it seemed convincingly convincing). <br /> <br /> Overall, this trailer's only downfall was the lack of a serious budget. And WB refuses to acknowledge that Collora is a trustworthy director, and NEED to be separate from some kind of project ... But no, they (like most of Marvel's projects) just hold those hackers who show almost no attention to the fans and the ones they look out for them and keep them out. God thanks Superman Returns for being hit or being serious about it. The best in the world is great and my book is considered superhero.
