Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you laugh out loud at the wrong time; and at the very moment you realize that you should not laugh, you have already reached the top of the voice; and if you look around on the white faces of the clergy with your wide open mouth and glaze eyes, you will feel the piercing pain that begins in the stomach well and suddenly sticks to your throat and ... well, you get the point <br /> <br /> But for all this inconvenience and faces, Frownland, is indeed a remarkable work that, after watching the main character and all his pathetic worries and bad ailments, makes you want to scratch your eyes and feel sad at the same time. <br /> <br /> It would have been much easier for me to step out of Ronald Bronstein's movie, but for some crazy reason I felt the unwavering determination to stay on the course and experience the whole grain of irritation the film offers. If someone makes you burn, you usually want to put it out: Stop! Drop! And roll! But with this film, you want to see how the flame slowly grabs the whole body. You are suffering from pain - maybe despite some or some unknown masochistic curiosity that I can't even explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the mainstream cinema will never let this movie go to a nearby theater. But if you have the chance to get it, prepare yourself: in a dog bag.
