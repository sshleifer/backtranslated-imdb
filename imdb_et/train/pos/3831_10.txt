It's a free customization of Clarence Mulford's novels; The fans of Willaim Boyd's films feel little at sea (and still reflect reviews of it). But first I knew the novels of Hopalong and never cared about those Boyd movies when I came to them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola has made a reasonable choice - he has not made a nostalgic "West"; instead, he has turned to Cassidy's story of what we called "Americana"; or what older critics ever called "home". When I discovered the film, I was increasingly reminded of Mark Twain's "Roughing It" from the "Hallmark Theater" version of James Garner's story. <br /> <br /> Both films remind us that, although movies about the "old west" are probably always mythical to Americans, they do not have to be "western peoples"; they can very well be the kind of movies he had to be at this place in America. <br /> <br /> I never feel like watching this movie; Boyd-Cassidy's legacy does not need to pull our throat, irony, camp. As a result, I feel those characters as I have walked - or cycling - over some of the true West American that I could have walked a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Considering that the simplicity of a movie - it positively avoids everything we have called "style" - everything is in its favor; and the usual activities of performers fit well with it; Gosh, it really feels like some story told the campfire on a cattle ride - no visual touch, just quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect good narration adventure yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie and when the viewer sets aside complicated expectations, he finds it very happy. <br /> <br /> I would have given the 9 stars of this movie, but I'll give it ten just because most of the comments here have completely disappeared; and I invite them to set aside Boyd's memories and give this film another chance. <br /> <br /> Note 1: The reviewer complained that Hopalong let people die in this movie, not shoot weapons from them (Boyd's Cassidy area); First, Cassidy shoots people into novels; secondly, if Cassidy were a true cowboy, he would have let people die - the problem of shooting weapons from people is that they always get another weapon - what happens to some of this very movie. <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the copola family that they have their "godfather" director who will get them all the opportunity to make movies that I can't; but a good movie is a good movie; and it's a good movie. If this is someone called "Coppola" then it's just the same. America is a land of opportunity (or was up until Bush's appointment).
