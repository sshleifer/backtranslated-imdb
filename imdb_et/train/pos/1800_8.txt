All dogs go to heaven in parallel with Watership Down's scary kiddies. Both were blind and quite embarrassing, but at the same time the child's most enjoyable experience. It was one of my favorite films as a child. I was in love with Charli, and at a dinner of about five or six, I admitted that I had the impression of a dog dog. All dogs talk about the love story of Charlie and his partner in crime. The story begins with Charlie fleeing from death and going to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course, I do not understand the concept of this film as a child's idea. I loved songs and animations, but when I get old I start thinking about why I didn't disturb this movie as a teenager. It deals with pretty adult topics - gambling, murder, hell and prison, but in the world of good Disney movies, what every child should look at once. Yes, there's a crazy transvestite crocodile scene, and hell scenes scare me more than I was a little, but it gives such a joyful message that parents shouldn't ignore!
