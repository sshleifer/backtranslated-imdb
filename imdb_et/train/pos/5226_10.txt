What's with all the comments from Europe (especially England)? All I have to say is that when I first saw this movie when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course, it's stupid. That's the thing. You have to see Dr Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come to the people you saw? I can think of many movies that are much worse than this, and they were expensive Hollwood films with their real participants. What's worth, men in a white film are a very stupid-funny look. And all the foolish funny things that England has done over the past half century have been shocked by all the negative comments. We are stupid Americans, like our stupid humor. P.S., see 'Team America: World Police' to really laugh at what Europeans like.
