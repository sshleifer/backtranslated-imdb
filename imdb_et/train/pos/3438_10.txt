The film was very prominent despite the NC-17 rating and the disturbing scenes. In reality, such things are happening and that's why this movie shows a lot. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson's excellent stage), whose recent college has all been well for him. She meets Jared (Chad Faust is an amazing force) frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. She calls her for dinner. They look at the bridge bridges and they go to their apartment. They talk and bring him to the basement when they become flirtatious with each other. She tries to stop it, but she rapes her. This case scares him. He goes to a club where barman / DJ Adrian (who played great Marcus Patrick) who sees he's drunk and helps before he goes far, meets. They are looking for friendship. He's also taking drugs, and Maya is going to use it. In other words, he introduces him to another world. She will go back to school and work as a TA (teaching assistant) and one Jared student. When pupils take a mid-term review, he tries to trick Jaredi. Jared tries to talk to Maya, but he still has an upper hand who decides to invite him. Does history repeat? Or is there a surprise to Jared for Maya? You're watching a movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson represents the role of focus and durability. Chad Faust doesn't like being a rapist, but he's doing terrible work like Jared. Marcus Patrick is a very brilliant man who rescues Maya and instructs him in a new world. This film deserves a prize.
