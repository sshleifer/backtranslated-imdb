Although Kris Kristofferson is good in this role, who doesn't want to see Elvis Pressli? With the addiction and the fall of the highest celebrity could have undoubtedly the Elvis agent to be in the movie, it was a mistake. It would have been an ideal movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from terrible, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job of creating this time / musical original soundtrack. A bit of a love story, it's more about the grace of drama and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero of the story was dying. Also, Gary Busey is once again perfect not in such a perfect role.
