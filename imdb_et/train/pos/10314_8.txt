This and "His Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new Twilight Zone version. As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, there is something missing in this new series. Maybe they emphasize too much lessons to be learned. It's a bit mawkish and sentimental than the Serling version. But this episode can be considered quite sentimental. I think the appeal is that whatever they do, lovers can never join. I remember that Korean film "Il Mare" was not surprised (later renamed "Lake House." I think this is because I saw this episode first, so it destroyed the effect of the later film.
