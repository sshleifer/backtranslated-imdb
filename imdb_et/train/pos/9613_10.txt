It is difficult to describe the error in words, it is one of the films that really needs to be understood. That's the result of a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything I've seen in the Hollywood edition lately. Because his characters react differently to the chain of events, and when events dictate different ways to track characters, the audience is simply an observer. Almost Proust's narrative thinking flow that the script's spontaneity is glued to you, waiting eagerly to see how it all works. As for the thematic elements, the film has a sequence that extends from melancholy, to light and beautiful, and then to tragic, all in about a minute. It works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. This reminds us why an independent film is probably the brightest star that the film industry currently owns. Maybe more Bug quality movies, people are starting to notice.
