There wasn't a lot of movies from the lighter and thinner (LTA) aspect of the flight, but that's one of them and it's fucking good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most movies take place in Navy blimp operations on NAS Lakehurst (NAS Tustin plays a role). Wallace Beery plays a pleasing, but Munchausen-like senior director Ned Trumpet, a painted pilot whose high stories are so often that nobody believes in him. Half of the entertainment is near the end of the film, when the events begin to prove that most of his extreme stories are really true. <br /> <br /> During World War II, the main plot relocation with a trumpet, who comfort the local widow only, is the father-son relationship with the widowed son of Jess. He said the doctors would never drive without crutches, the Chief Trumpet pulls some strings and the naval flight surgeon will help restore the boy's exhausted leg. Jess goes to the Navy to become a flight crew who flies back to Lakehurst and faces completely new challenges. <br /> <br /> A very well done film, though not without some kind of technical advisers to the Hollywood dialogue, and Beery's obvious inability to take a step. Otherwise, this movie will receive good marks for technical accuracy and will provide a rare overview of naval LTA operations. The money-register scene, the exchange between Trumpet and Jessi's future love interests, is an absolute momentum.
