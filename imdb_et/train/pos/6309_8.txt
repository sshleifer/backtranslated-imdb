I saw a pearl of the Cannes movie, where it was part of the directors within two weeks. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is not very good. Very fun all the time, where all the strong cast members leave their socks behind. Sometimes it is a laugh out loud comedy about a small salmon (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who is trying to steal and send to the car. While in prison, he meets a "living" who tells him that it is a "final bellini"? what are you and me? is a solid scheme of fire. It turns out that an abandoned building has an urban jewelers shop? that can bring millions. Seems easy? ? well throw all kinds of unpleasant signs and incidents and you have become one of the components of a natural ride !! ? the word goes from one low-loser to the next, and their team will soon be pooled to try and cash under Cosimos `bellini 'led by the failed boxer Pero (played well by Sam Rockwell?). crook Riley (William H. Macy), who is forced to bring his child with him because his wife was locked up for fraud !!. <br /> <br /> The Italian movie I Soliti ignot (Big Deal is Madonna Street), which also inspired a similar movie "Collinwood"? "For the fire". It strikes the spots of the last effort, and although his writers and directors are Russian brothers, it definitely has Coen Brothers tones. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who have a small but fun part as a struck safe breaker.
