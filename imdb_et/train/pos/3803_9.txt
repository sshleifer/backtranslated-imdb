What people do not understand about this film is that it is not the beginning, the middle and the end, but the end of long TV series of 26 episodes. So remember that if you all talk about how the world was not researched enough. It was all done in the TV show. <br /> <br /> As big and stunning as the visuals are, I think the *** SPOILERS *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo at the end of the movie was what really made me love this movie. Seeing that I saw the characters with 26 episodes, it was so frightening and saw Gwizdo walking sadly in floating ruins, while Lian-Chu sharpened his blade almost tearfully. <br /> <br /> Then we got full contrast with Lian-Chu, who fights with their madly fantastic dragons (previously featured in the series), while Gwizdo threatens to kill Zoe intimidatingly and indirectly. * Shudder * I am surprised that this particular scene has not been mentioned more in the warnings. Any child with meaningless jokes can see that Gwizdo was not himself and he was going to strangle that little girl. It was enough to distract me and I'm 15. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is much better than most of the many million explosives, and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters going. Look at it. :)
