The only remarkable thing about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first major role. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is inadequate and raw, but refreshingly honest in this infant sci-fi horror. Steve shows himself as an anti-agency, hot rod car-loving actor, who would only become a polished icon in the film industry in just five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen would say he hated this movie and he was stained. But everyone has to start somewhere and Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. Would we all have been so. <br /> <br /> The plot is fast paced and, although predictable, still a fun time. And it's really nice to see Steve McQue before he got to School King (and Anita Corsau before he became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). One close friend sent me back to the DVD and this is a valuable addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection.
