I grew up looking at Scooby and I've been a fan forever. This cartoon moves from the same old routine that is boring for viewers. The Crooks in Mask routine is getting old and this comic has changed. It is not intended to replace Scooby gang, but it is just the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers. The copy focuses on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherit a large sum of money and use this money to block the plans of the mad scientist and his gons to conquer. From time to time, little respect for gangs and gangs occurs. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can still appreciate how big a bond is between the boy and the dog he is talking to, along with the accompanying jokes. Just Enjoythe Cartoon and support creators / writers and manufacturers so it wouldn't be the last Scooby Cartoon.
