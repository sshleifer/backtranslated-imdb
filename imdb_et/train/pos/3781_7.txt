I dare not say that this movie is better than the original, but it is very good. The comedy of this movie is just as good as the original, but there are so many scenes that just make me laugh. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is even more strange than the original, but it makes it so big. Peter Hewitt does a great job of directing this film with great pain. The primary light of the original film returns to the characters of this movie and everyone does a fantastic job with their roles. I don't care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both films, as did Alex Winter's Bill. I was very happy that George Carlin will return to Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays the role of Ted Logan's father, is doing a great job. The style in which Ted has his father's body and Hal London Jr. is going to act as Ted has a great scene, and he pulls it impressively well. I will not forget William Sadler's mention of death, he made the film completely for me. The rest of the cast is also quite good. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, I hope you also want this movie. But don't expect it to be as good as the original. I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading. <br /> <br /> Crisis
