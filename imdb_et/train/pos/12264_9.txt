If you have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin, do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary, Hergus and his life, that creates Tintin. I'm so brilliant and very cool manufacturing. Herg√© and all the background information of the people, and the many different situations that he influenced, are good and worse. There is a very good and obvious relationship between comic books and this. I'm definitely digging Tintin's albums again in my basement. The film itself is also very well-known and has a great surrounding sound. I really hope people will find it as intriguing as I did!
