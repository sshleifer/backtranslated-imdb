Deathtrap is not combined. He who starts to do it first. It is so difficult to describe this film without giving away anything, so I wouldn't mention anything about the plot. As far as acting, this is Cris Reeves's greatest role as a young feature film Clifford. In fact, in this film, you can see the range of your ability to "breathe out of the exhaled cheeses" directly scary. Clifford plays such a difficult role and I have never seen Clifford playing well at both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays him as a small puppy or as a murder maniac. Reeves is the only person I've ever seen who is right by nature. Like Michael Caine, he is ... Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and this movie is as good as it has ever been.
