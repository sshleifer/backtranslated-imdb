I caught a cable over the last half of this movie and it just got sick of it. Even when one of the two victims is in its worst situation, the camera continues. his body shots remain open and his concentration-bearing shape, drawn into bag bags, is both moving and depressing. Don't look at this movie if you are already depressed. Then again, don't look at it if your feeling is really good.
