I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and emotional. <br /> <br /> The actor is amazing, which is hard to believe because it is Daniel Day Lewis, an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker, however, is a surprise wonder. He strikes your heart as the mother of a physically disabled child who cannot walk or talk until he is in his later teen. <br /> <br /> I can't say good enough about the movie, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies based on real events, or just enjoy good dramas in general.
