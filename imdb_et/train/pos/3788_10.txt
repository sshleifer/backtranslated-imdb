This movie is great. It's real and in the heart, but at the same time completely crazy. Characters are easy to fall in love because they have so many different thoughts, but each of us could at least refer to it. In Canada, we don't have many movies from Eastern Europe, and for the few I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, look at Loners.
