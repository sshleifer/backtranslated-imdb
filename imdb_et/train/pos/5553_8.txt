Slow but beautifully fitted story of the American Revolution. Griffith's story speaks much less than his earlier historical epic and his work on tables is fully integrated into action. Lionel Barrymore is the perfect pig, Neil Hamilton is poor, but the sad and Carol Dempster is .... well, Carol Dempster is the majority of what Griffith is wrong with this period, but he's not slow enough to slow down and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that cancellations in this movie say it originally appeared just over 2 hours when it was first released, but that the paragraph does not exist for more than 90 minutes. However, DVD playback has been slower at fps, increasing tension and bringing it back for just over two hours. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's much better than sound versions like PATRIOT. While it is not quite Griffith's best, like WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, it is a great way to spend a few hours.
