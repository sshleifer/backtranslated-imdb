These three stories tend to coincide with my second favorite film, "Disturbance in Court". This is a laugh for every three Stooges fans. <br /> <br /> The boys are gifted in the studio when they hear the lovely Christine McIntyre, who sings a great version of Spring Voices of Spring. She has a plan offer, but she is in love with her father regarding her career choice and to prove herself a true singer. When she and others leave the studio, the kids decide to have fun and play their disc and dress up Curly like Christine. The contract lady who can make Christine's career sees Curly and carries her for Christine and calls Curly to sing for her party. Of course, there is a man who has annoyed the party and destroys his solo before the crowd, so he finds a way to get them back. <br /> <br /> The big stooge flick shouldn't be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
