"Comedies" are today mostly 100 minutes of toilet, unpleasant language and groin. Modern comedies turn to the smallest common denominator, the required and the slow brain. Of course, good comedy comes from time to time, but they are becoming less frequent. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings buildings in his dream house" shows what the 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it's just funny funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the suburb of Connecticut. The film follows their story, starting from the hut of the hunting lodge, the peaceful construction of the house until finished home - with its "zuzz-zuzz water softener". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy naturally fit their roles naturally (Grant is especially funny when he watches the house is out of control). But the film has been stolen by Blandings' wise lawyer played by Melvyn Douglas. Managing the theft of all scenes, Douglas is surprisingly fun when he looks at Blandings falling out of the crisis. Reginald Denny is a Blandings' harried architect and Harry Shannon, who is a tough old water well drill, as well as great. <br /> <br /> I've been watching this movie many times and always laughing at me. I think it's a good movie to watch if you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not.
