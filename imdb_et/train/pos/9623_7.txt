Hmmmm, do you want some romance with your mystery? That's it. I think this romance would have made it a better film. But how to force romance when a story is borrowed from something called the Harlequin Romance novel, whatever it is. If romance were broken, the story would have been too weak. The secret here was not too bad, quite interesting, but nothing mission impossible on the level of international espionage. Oh well. I thought Mel Harris was pretty good; I think her short skirts added a sexual complaint ... but this Rob Stewart man could have probably been better cast, maybe even more known as a television actor. Leadership was decent and writing could have been improved - both could have been a little edgier, a little darker, more adventurous. One of the great things about it was the use of genuine European places. It would have changed easily so it could have been filmed in Canada, but they were really great in beautiful places like Budapest. Possibly the disadvantage was the choice of the director and / or the operator to capture certain frames. Not good. If it were a more dramatic film for the big screen, the perfect scenes of the postcards of the images should really be on the back and just be a nice part of the background. But it was just a television film, so they had to add some Ummmph to the picture and some Ummmph came from the landscape. In general, it is not really a bad film. I'm telling you what was the best Canadian-Hungarian production I've ever seen! (and the only thing I know.) Here I declare this as a central film, giving him a C-Class movie.
