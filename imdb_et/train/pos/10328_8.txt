The compilers have chosen the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully. Every interior is full of details that tell you about all the people who live there. Whether this period is 20s (first story), current (ie 1950s) for middle class or 1910s (last), costumes and settings have been carefully monitored and created. I love two old ladies in the costume sanatorium - fine lace, covered with the best Shetland scarves. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very tempting, but never forget the young lovers, that is Raymond Huntley as a man who upset his wife's health and independence, which undermines our emotions. He usually played comic, pompo types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The Chinese seas (big 30-year-olds starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from Mr. Know All's episode (and also hit the Kipling story). I wish we saw Naunton Wayne more than a jealous husband - although he has good moments in a Mexican hat. I love this long bird that also plays with my wife.
