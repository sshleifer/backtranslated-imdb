Tea Leon plays a serious photographer Nora Wilde, who goes through a bad divorce. He wants his freedom, but it will cost. He wants legitimate photography, but hired for paid employment. His superior is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The exhibition was well written most of the time. Te Nora started to develop into a rather memorable character, but the network just didn't support comedy and they still don't. Even if they bring George Wendy out of Cheers, they made unnecessary changes in casting and marking. The exhibition was good at first and the audience got used to it, but then it pulled the net like bad plastic surgery.
