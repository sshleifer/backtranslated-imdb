Although the film seems a bit long, it is worth it. Gordon controls the style that reminds you of Vonnego's writing style. Wrong, thoughtful, ironic, peculiar and dark, this is a movie that will stay with you for quite some time, asking for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are all incredible. Sheryl Lee is also wonderful in the role that reminds us of Lynch fans of her Laura / Maddy days. Don't miss it!
