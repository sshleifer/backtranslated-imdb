... so those missing 10 minutes that were so terrible had to cut them out of the original movie? We were in the movie production for three years ... Barbara Stanwyck had played in the original game, but here is Carole Lombard Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacMurray is probably best known as "Double Indemnity", with Stanwyck, as well as his hit TV show "My Three Sons". Keep an eye out for the young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope's films) and the fabulous Franklin Pangborn who spiced up almost every film on the tape. Of course he works on a ship in a beauty salon! Add the noble Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and smart beating at the beginning. Maggie's friend Ella plays Jean Dixon, the best friend of "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In "Swing High", the tourist player Maggie meets a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie leaves her boat when she leaves the harbor and comes in contact with a soldier. Exciting 20-something Quinn has a small scene at Panama's local bar, where Johnson (MacMurray) has played trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid band together and trying to find out how to come back to the countries. Lamouri is a good song. Cecil Cunningham's Good (but Short) Presentation "Murph", a smart and helpful owner of a local salon in Panama. While others have lied about how bad it is, it was not so terrible and even a little exotic, where the first half of the movie is a fake Central American locality.
