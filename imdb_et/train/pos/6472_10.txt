One of the TV shows of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, their insights and sympathies are constantly being challenged because of the many facets of modern British society. David Morrisey is as usual, great. First, he reaches into the harsh hands of the hero, but then turned out to be smart and caring when he works with him to discover the truth. I've never seen Surrane Jones. I believe he comes from the world of television showers. His performance was excellent because he retains his humor and tenderness, trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for the mother. I could go on and talk about all the cast members who contribute to this great drama, but their efforts would mean little without a absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any character. Such are programs that restore their faith in television drama, while at the same time making it almost impossible to solve most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the waves.
