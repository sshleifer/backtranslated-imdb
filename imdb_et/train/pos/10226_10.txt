I was about 7 years old when I first saw this movie. Then it wasn't that special, but a few years later I saw it again and at that time fun, a lot :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the movie are: Yeti body language and "special effects" too. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, don't wait until Hollywood has blocked it, even if it is made about. $ 1,000 :) <br /> <br /> I'm a copy of it. Also video and video version (but I don't think it would ever be shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> Watch it, enjoy it! Yeti forever !!!
