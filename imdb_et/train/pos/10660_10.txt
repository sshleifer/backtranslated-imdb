I found that this movie was almost finished. When Miss Stanwyck starts her story, it's just a few minutes until you realize there are problems. An abandoned area, a locked abandoned gas station door, all makes you wait for it ... here comes. First of all, you think this is a little boy, but too soon you start to hold your breath by watching the ascents. I found this movie really stressful, even though I was watching it before and was ready to abandon it. Now, a movie that can keep you informed, even if you've seen it before, deserves a special rating, maybe a white knuckle prize?
