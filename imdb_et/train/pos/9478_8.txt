This is a nice story with a nice story that plays the most important role in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a rather intriguing dramatic story that includes romance. The story is spoken slowly, but it works too well to build it. The characters are nice and beautiful actors. Usually I am not a fan of the Asian actress's style, but it was just a good thing to do that. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is completely different from other genres. in the west. In some ways, this film has already evolved compared to Western films of the same era. <br /> <br /> I just wished the film's visual style a little better. In the case of a film that is considered to be a kind of art-house film, this film is definitely missing from some kind. It was obviously quite cheap to make a movie and it was done quite generally. Not that it is a bad thing, it just prevents the film from really differentiating itself and raises itself over the genre. <br /> <br /> But this movie is all about this well-built story and symbols that have it. In this regard, this film is certainly not disappointing. <br /> <br /> 8/10
