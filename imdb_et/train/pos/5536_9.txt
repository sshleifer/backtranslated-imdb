I really enjoyed this show. Even as a youngster, I was interested in all sports and horse racing. Production of a race-based series was always difficult and at the same time the competition track was allowed to film on this controversial topic. One episode I remember especially in the middle of a horse that hopes to win a big race that seemed a little color. A stable syringe was found on the floor and everyone thought it was a drug, but there was nothing in the blood tests. Too late they realized that the horse was not doped, but it was removed in the knee joint. Like a passenger car without seizing the oil and engine, the horse broke with tragic consequences.
