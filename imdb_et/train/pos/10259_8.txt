There are many unfair people in this series, but many Guinea pig videos are quite fun. In particular, Devil's Experiment has some truly fantastic effects - not only the notorious eyeball, but also the very real skin slice of the foot and the hand that is very real with the shredder - especially the video with vintage and low budget. <br /> <br /> Let me start at the beginning for those who don't know: This movie is an "extreme" torture / fake snuff movie that appeared in Japan in the mid-80s. It's a simple simple thing: a young girl is in the hands of a man and is forced to go through a number of brutal tortures to see where her break is. This leads to brutal violence - all the really realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as the painful application of hot oil to a captured girl and the placement of hinds in the subsequent flaky wound. > The least effective sequences are at the beginning of the video and consist of an unbelievable blow, where three men alternate with a hell girl when her head falls down and another sequence where three men turn the girl in turns and push her to the ground. These two scenes are clearly staged and reduce the realism of the rest of the procedure. <br /> <br /> An actor who is an "experiment" victim is quite convincing that it is painful and takes a good deal of abuse and harsh things on the camera. His reactions, when he has earphones attached to his ear and loud noises at the end of the hours, are chilling. Some of the other abuses he takes are on the net when he is alone at the time. There is also a disturbing scene where the prisoners are strangled inside and one other nasty buggy scene where she is twisted in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle from Jack Daniels to <br /> <br /> you haven't seen this series, I hope I've helped you decide if you want to give this episode. 8.5 / 10 to Devil's Experiment.
