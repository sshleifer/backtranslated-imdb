I really disagree with the guy-yardley raids who, if he had to watch the whole movie, would have seen some absolutely stunning Scottish landscapes (some of the best photos in Skye) and found a hard-start movie. a really poignant whole. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie. Rather, it is a film with a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can't say how many "normal" movies I wore - pushing the same polished stuff over and over again. Seachd doesn't look like that at all. It seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film. <br /> <br /> OK, so the actor is not style. This is because the actors are seemingly real people. I actually thought the main roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes unusually beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd really has a different view because there are many topics that will become clearer a second time - which really ends. <br /> <br /> In general, combining music and (at times) stunning visions and communal approach to action and non-normal structure has made Seachd a rather distinctive and memorable film. More of them please!
