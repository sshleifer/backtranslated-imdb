When the scriptwriter and the director intended to open the film when the musician wanted to work with their music, they managed to do it for me. Conventional human situations became original, personal and immediate, so I personally touched every situation. I believe I would credit the power of music with the position of the person who wrote the film. Without a violation, I can say that the film's approach to life was very touching. Have you really rejoiced? empathy? just a deep emotion? for a very long time. I'd like to find a way to show it to others. I saw it at Seattle International Film Festival.
