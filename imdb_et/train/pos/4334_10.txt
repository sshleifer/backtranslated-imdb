Who wouldn't want to travel with Peter Falk? This man's right eye has more character than most of today's participants. It is such a funny and moving film that we all look for in contrast to all the bombastic special effects. Women love it for all men with male romance advice and men love this father / son character study - one great little scene after another. And that's just enough to be a real indie find. Obviously, this love is for Paul Reiser, who understands what it is like to be a father and a son, as well as to be laughing and tears as you live through. The most fun part, however, was looking at Reich Falk. You could say that both his character and his other actresses, who actually enjoy Peter Falki's special handicrafts, have gained new recognition. Really delightful. We hope that this film will sometimes change the theaters of the whole country so that everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and people.
