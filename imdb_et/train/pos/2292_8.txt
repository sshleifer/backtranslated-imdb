I just watched it early on Bugs Bunny (here for the first time) and Elmer Fudd's comic on ThadBlog, which is linked from YouTube. It was Chuck Jones for the first time directing "wascally wabbit" and as a result Bugs has a different voice from Mel Blanc than Brooklyn / Bronx, whom we know more. In fact, according to Thad, Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" type personality) directs. Anyway, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs goes all out for him, turning the radio really loud, pretending to die after his master throws him out of the shower and says, "Turn those lights off!" when Elmer puts her in bed. Even with different voices, Bugs is definitely his naughty self and I laughed at you all the time! According to Thad, at the end of Elmer, there was another scene that gave the house to Bugs after the hell, but it was probably too sad because it suffers from a mental breakdown, so it is just as good as it has been lost. Anyway, I recommend Elmer's pet rabbit.
