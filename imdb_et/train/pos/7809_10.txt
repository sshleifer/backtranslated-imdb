This movie changed me without understanding, it is and remains my favorite movie all the time, mainly because it is almost every emotion that all rolls in its 157 minutes. What is most difficult for me to do is that if I want to hear amazing music and songs from the movie, I have to put it on my DVD player, so I was wondering if anyone knows who sings the songs on the film and where they can to find it because I've been looking anywhere I can sporadically think in the last five years. My favorite quote from the film is when the lawyer says, "But your own words require direct confrontation, is it not a direct call to violence?" Biko replies, "Well, you and I are now in confrontation, but I don't see any violence!" CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
