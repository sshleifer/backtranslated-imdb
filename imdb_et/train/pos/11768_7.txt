This movie surprised me well. From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too funny to be a thriller, although it was somewhat exciting. <br /> <br /> This film and James Belushi were born to make Bill Manucci, he does a great job. The rest is not so bad, especially Timothy Dalton is curative. <br /> <br /> The story can be quite confusing when new characters appear during the movie. Things become more complicated if nobody really talks about things. If you don't pay attention, things might end up getting a little confused, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not all well-known, but he has done a perfectly perfect job and I have never grown impatiently while watching a movie.
