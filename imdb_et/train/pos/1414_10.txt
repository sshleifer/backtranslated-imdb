First of all, the date of publication of this document is 2009, not 2007. This should be better mentioned: "Earth, 2009". Secondly, let me deal with the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the 2006 Planet Earth TV series. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this TV series, but learned here that this movie is full of this 2006 TV series. I appreciate every movie of my own, not its source. I value the results independently and the results of "Earth 2009" are really great. I disagree with the trivial appeal of some reviewers: this is just an extended version of the 2006 "Planet Earth" TV series. So what? This is not really important. This is the debut of Disney's new "DisneyNature" distribution and follows the traces of Walt Disney's pioneer and Academy Award winning documentaries in the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, movie editing, music score, sound and narration are all great. Other natural documentaries have also emerged in these categories. What actually means "Earth 2009" is its scope. It literally covers the whole planet, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> Three amazing documentaries had to be produced by three production companies. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly tells four species of stories about their great migration, as it lasts one year from December starting from December and ends in the North Pole on the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two new high-tech cameras were used for this movie: one camera has a 360 degree computer-controlled motor rotating lens and the other HD camera is an amazing 1000 frames per second. This method of filming really proved the drama and beauty of some of the "Earth, 2009" scenes, especially the cheetah's chase and the big white sharks that jumped out of the water to catch the sea lion and the air view of the highest waterfall in the world. This documentary has many amazingly beautiful photos. <br /> <br /> Through this movie, music score and storyline, this documentary is a drama, sadness, humor and great beauty. With the superb music scores of the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic, excellent creative and technical cinematography, and James Earl Jones narrative, I consider "Earth 2009" as the longest documentary film ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent, and commitment paid very well. This film should be viewed in all schools around the world. Among other things, I predict the best documentary Academy Award. Really, amazing, amazing, exhilarating and wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Very highly recommended
