This low budget digital video has the right places - in writing and acting. In addition, digital photography is still the best. In low light conditions, a characteristic video signal tone dominates, but it is surprising that it rivals the shade, clarity and saturation of the film in brightly lit situations. This is a grassroots film that does the best to hide the Midnight Cowboy, which talks about griffons that do everything to survive in the San Francisco district.
