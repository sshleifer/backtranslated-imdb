Who says the pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is ultimate. I even had a knee tear when Celebei died. I don't care much! This movie is a touching animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth part of Pokemon, the ashes and friends must stop bad jerks from making Celebe with his blind ball. At the same time, Sam and Celebei drive through time and are constantly hunted by hunters. I like having a double battle and Sam has apricot pokeball (if you've played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> I also liked Miramax, responsible for Warner Brothers. The mini movie at the end was a great idea. The Pokemon of this movie lives more than ever.
