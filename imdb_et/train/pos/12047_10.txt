The first and only time I saw a black woman I thought was the only time I knew it was in 1989 on television. It was Christmas Eve and my dad and I watched it in the living room just before we all went to the midnight service in the village church. I was pretty young at this time, but I'm not sure who walked more fiercely through the evening to the entrance to the church yard, which was my or my father's night! <br /> <br /> There are many factors in this film that make it so horrible, but I think 0 of them is that there are not so many tracks on almost every Hollywood movie, so every head, bump and the bang is more amplified by your head because there is no alarm. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories is not related to a jump factor like things that bounce out of the closet, so it may not be what you see, but what you hear and what you think is going on. This is a smart tool because nothing scares you more than your mind, who runs around the corner or the door with thoughtful robbery. <br /> <br /> Great ghost story, I've never seen anything that fit with it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over again TV i cant believe the BBC has deleted it after (my knowledge) only one shows!
