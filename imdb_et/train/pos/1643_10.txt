This is a movie that everyone should see if you want to see great action. Mr Torn and Mrs Farrel are doing an outstanding job. I think they should have it on television again so that the new audience can enjoy it. Wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> This gives you a real sense of what the pioneers had to go through physically and emotionally. Great movie wind. <br /> <br /> It happened when Mrs Farrel was very young. I had always thought of him as a comedian, but it is definitely not a comedy and he is just wonderful. There are very few dialogues, but it just makes it more real. Mr. Torn as always has a great presence and just his breathing is a great feeling. I have to see a movie.
