I know it's crude oil and I know it's not a computer at all, but it's so funny. If you can think of it as being from the beginning of the 80s and carrying all the stereotypes of that time - and the film still makes a laugh, it is really good comedy. The subject of this film is surprised by the traditions that comedies have been for thousands of years. If you can stop your political correctness for an hour and a half, but just to laugh at everything, please look at it. <br /> <br /> P.S. Whether someone should put it on a DVD, VHS is so hard to find.
