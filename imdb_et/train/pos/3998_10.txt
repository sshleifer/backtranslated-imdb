I was somehow left behind when the movie came out and discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend's suggestion. I can honestly say I don't remember another intimate dramatic movie that does so much. Writing is crisp, realistic, nuanced and even restrained. Cinematic art and editing are underestimated, but inspired by the ability to imitate close-ups and image design, capturing loneliness and alienation in the most memorable way, by dominating visual storytelling. Action is also great because all the characters become painfully real and vulnerable in the most urgent ways the movie offers. They show their innermost weaknesses with unprotected and raw vulnerabilities. A true triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureish and the rest of the team. Must watch serious film students.
