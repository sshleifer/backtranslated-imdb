Yes, it's a very low budget movie. So the actor is not an award-winning material, and sometimes it is a slow pace because filmmakers take pictures of longer sequences and not millions of things that are then delivered to the movie. This movie does this with an outstanding script that takes vampire seriously, explains it and develops it completely. In addition to the vampire, we have detailed genetic information, legal and law enforcement, martial arts, philosophical music, and some good metal music. Kudos goes to Dylan O'Leary, Director / Writer / Main Window. It doesn't matter to me how this man would have been able to perform all these roles and do them so well. I think I appreciate this movie, you have to be well versed with all kinds of topics to see that the writer has done a lot of research and knows all these things. The camera works great, camera angles and one underwater vampire attack - something I've never seen before, but respecting the underwater zombie attack in Fulci Zomb. Casting is good, as a sexy woman is really sexy. The main vampire also looks perfect. A female victim seems vulnerable. My only complaint is that there should have been more nudity with a low budget horror boost. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, it's a flick for you. Looking forward to O'Leary's future projects.
