It must be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine the breathtaking cinematic stunning and thrilling plot and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog I was in some scenes grabbing the edge of my seat, frightening with others and left my own tears drowning after the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The film left me with a deep impression. It is a shockingly violent scene that is sharply contrasted with poignants and delicate "love" scenes. The film is a category III (nudity) rating undesirable; There are no nude scenes and "love" scenes do not even mean kissing or "display". <br /> <br /> The message that this movie presented to me? All people, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a gentle side. Edison Chen is doing an excellent job of playing a part of the murder of Pang. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie 10/10. It's a must-watch.
