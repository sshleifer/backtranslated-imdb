Braveheart released the same year, two costumes compare drama. I testify to my bias against Mel Gibson, but I keep a rational preference for "Rob Roy". Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" cordially depict Scot's history in a bloody, romantic fashion. "Braveheart" is an epic break for individual glory and courage and a fine revenge for fantasy. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Note that it uses slow motion filming. His violence is so ugly and glorious. This is the last quality that makes it more appealing to the adolescent. Although "Braveheart" transcends Rob Roy's balance in carnage (not to mention his pampering time), the last film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. His actions are more underestimated, but more surprising and wiser. His sex is less obvious, but more erotic. Rob Roy is also a more understandable romantic interest. Its dialogue tries to bring the period closer to poetry. His rat teeth in the mouth of the actors try to bring the age closer to the dentist. And Tim Roth is a superpower villain. Also recommended: "The Last of the Mohikans" and "Patriot". You may find that the latter is similar to "Braveheart", with an emphasis on blood lust, the former being similar to "Rob Roy". All the above films deserve R-ratings for violence.
