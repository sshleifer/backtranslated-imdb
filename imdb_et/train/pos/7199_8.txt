Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) has had several flops after a big hit. He is receiving an article by his student Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) which is fantastic. It's so good, Sidney says she's gonna kill her. Does he think? It was originally a game ... and it shows. This is usually one set and all talks, but I was never bored. It is very well written with lots of twists and good casting. Caine is just as brilliant as Bruhl - her second great performances. Reeve is surprisingly very good. I've never thought of him as an actor, but he's very good in this role. Dyan Cannon is doing a miracle with Bruhls. Irene Worth is also good (and quite funny), like Helga ten Drop, psychic. But his accent got on my nerves. Director Sidney Lumet does his job very well. The camera always moves and keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two homosexual characters in the movie turn out to be inflammatory sociopaths, and it also includes one of the most unhealthy kisses I've ever seen, but these are mild complaints. <br /> <br /> Very good thriller. Critics hate this film (for some reason) and seem to have performed for the first time in 1982. It's too bad - it deserves better.
