This is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s. Not only does it contain great light but also full of natural shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is a Vietnamese vet (Kris Kristofferson) recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up a small town's criminal element and what happens when Kris starts using his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired. This is a great vision that Kris is playing with. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal offer as much help as the two female stars for women. Jan-Michael shows a real movie star in this movie. I don't think Vigilante Force is on video, but it occasionally appears on TV. It's a big movie that likes movies.
