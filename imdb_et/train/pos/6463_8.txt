This is one of the films you wake up next morning. It gives you a warm, blurry feeling and leaves a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Of course, we feed typical stereotypical characters and stories, but it does trick: entertainment. <Br /> <br /> Being from Sweden and living in the US for a while, it's funny how we react. "The deadly husband kills him," "He (Gabriella) begins to die and then the heartbreaking bigger than life ends". We know how these things work, everything ends. And it did. The characters were somewhat simple, they were so detailed that you didn't think about it twice, nothing was really your imagination. The closest one would probably be Siv, he would ask you to ask if he really loved Daniel, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> But the movie is beautiful in the Norrland countryside, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are loved. Michael Nyqvist is truly a genius, his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and accessible. Maybe a little too nice. <br /> <br /> But most of this movie you know and it is the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you feel. I don't know about you, but it doesn't happen so often.
