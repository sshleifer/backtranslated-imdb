My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with this story, reading it for many of her classes. It was never interesting to me, and I bought a DVD that suggests it would be a movie that wouldn't really be my alley. <br /> <br /> In the first half of the movie, I thought I was right. It starts a bit slow and I have to admit that I was a little bored - but curious to stay with it. Boy, I'm glad I did because it was a very satisfying and rewarding film. Surely I would look at it again! <br /> <br /> The casting was very good. Since I haven't read the book, I can't guarantee accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was really happy. You liked characters that you liked to love, hated those you had to hate, and laughed at those who were supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I see some people dislike this movie. It's occasionally annoying, especially at the beginning. All setbacks can interfere (although they are important for the story). When the story finally comes together, I think you've put it back for patience. When all is said and done, I think it's a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
