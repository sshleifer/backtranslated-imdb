It was my childhood favorite - I remember it on television and every time I was excited. Now that I've grown up and I have my boyfriend, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We watched it on Friday and liked it. In both struggles with a giant spider, my son's hand was busy and grabbed me - he was really scared. "Will he hit the spider, Poppa?" Just look, you see. He has no historical reference framework to talk about (eight years old), so Baghdad Harou al-Raschid's grandchild may also be Ozma Oz. <br /> <br /> I think she liked how many heroes and robberies took place in the boy-thief, not the adult king. In fact, if you deconstruct a bit of the film's narrative, the king is a thief, not a hero, which must be very satisfying for imaginative and adventurous young boys. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a periodic piece - I suspect that by the time he is eleven or twelve years old, my son will find it "horny" or any word the next generation will have by then uses. The love story is hardly one-dimensional - as the cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because the narrative requires it." Likewise, it is unlikely that Abu wants to be safe (repeatedly) safe, loved. However, in order to leave such things by accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty feet of genies and the All-Seeing Eye temple would be extreme. The satisfaction of the prophecy reached at the culmination of the film is enormous, as is the last strike of Abu, which triumphs with its (stolen) magic, eventually seeking "fun and adventure!".
