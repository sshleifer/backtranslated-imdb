in contrast to the above person, I felt that this film was especially funny, especially in scenes with a lot of mixing. I don't want to give people on the plot and the story who haven't watched it yet, but I say Paresh Rawal doesn't have an extensive role, such as Priyadarshan's films, such as Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal makes his amazing role in his small role, John Abraham does just as well, Akshay Kumar has shown that he is no longer in the movie as he had Waqt and almost all of his films after Andaa. Although all three of the heroines in this movie were debut, they did a good job, especially in Nargis, who is very good looking and hot. I would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pher, this movie must be black.
