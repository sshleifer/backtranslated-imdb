This is a very interesting project that could have been quite brilliant. 11 outstanding international leaders gathering and each taking 11 minutes, 9 seconds, and 1 frame separation to create your own selected segment; every short time to explore the 11th September tribute. Without using a spoiler, I would like to say that Ken Loach's piece is a crown residue and Mira Nair's short (segment "India") based on a real story deserves a full-length feature film. Also, during a short look, why does Alejandro González Iñárritu be one of the best directors in today's world? he is just a media who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts have been made. Youssef Chahine, in his "Egypt" segment, carries the Arabic attitude of the collective guilt that he might have been most interesting. He fails. The short description of Chahine is poorly written and poorly performed, at least enough to distinguish the film from other higher chapters. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would give the film a 7/10 concept, if not to fulfill.
