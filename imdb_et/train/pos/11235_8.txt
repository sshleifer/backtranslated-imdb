Well done and with "New Trips" it's a great success! Fab sees James Cawley in his last episode "Vigil". <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization and I think we have good substitutes for TV manufacturers in the fan product. This shows you succeeding well as they claim to have improved over the years, and I hope to have some more experience, strong script editor and timing, and CGI, which is more and more remarkable for HF than it really is! <br /> <br /> Good work for all involved! <br /> <br /> (I have a huge soft spot for Lefler & McFarland (GREAT works), although I'm a bit tired of "Lefler's laws." ENOUGH already! Shelby is great (if a little bit a bit) and that's cool when he got the ship, Commodore Ian nice (like Fred Flintstone), but he doesn't have a messy edge and seems Doc, Counselor and Rawlins in my eyes, like WONDERFUL Nechayev (which is a beautiful accent - REAL Russian! I think Rene is from the Czech Republic.) <br /> <br /> It gets my voice and CGI is kewl Some greenscreen is obvious, but on small budgets <br /> <br /> Really glad I and that! <br /> <br /> (OK, some are not big, but it's fanatic and it's allowed to be variable - sorry Cmm. Cole) <br /> <br /> The gay material is too thick ( Graham Norton would be embarrassed. ‚ÄùTrek doesn't pay so much attention to hetero-couples, so why does the journey miss everything? Be Sexual - I hope they bring it down and let Aster & Zen have people who aren't signs - I don't treat my gay friends differently, they're just ordinary guys. <br /> <br /> Musically, it's a mixed bag. I can tell all my stocks of Trek OST stuff and work most of the time, but the timing may fall now and then (finally "Worst Fears Part 2" captures the crisis and editing. Love what they use in Galaxy Quest music! > <br /> Surely you can't wait any more! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never give up, never blame!" <br /> <br /> Viva les frontieres
