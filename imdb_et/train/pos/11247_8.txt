I saw the movie for the first time when it landed in the US cable a year after its release. It flew my little head, I was only 16 years old and it was the first new wave of music I heard, being strictly folk, a classic child who grew up. I liked the music, like Hazel O'Connor's amazing looks and charismatic song games, and Phil Daniels' tough but soft Cockney driver just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's stunned scissor. He was so inappropriate in the band and so harmless and pathetic that he simply asked for compassion. Favorite scenes, lights when the lights came out, and the love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the movie isn't Rose! But it was very good for his limited budget and for the depiction of Britain in the early 1980s, exploding with rebellious youth, looking for a queue for exit. I went to the UK only a few years later and found that the atmosphere reflecting the film reflected. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, look at it. This is a great movie that has some great performances and the music beats you. <br /> <br />
