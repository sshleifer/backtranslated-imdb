More like a psychological analysis of a movie, but Psycho sounds better with a headline. The person responsible for the film (narrator, if you wish) depicts the films here in their own way. Most of them are classic, but all of them are listed in IMDbis and I suggest you see them (especially Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, chat and Lynch movies) because Slavoj Zizek refers to them! <br /> <br /> In other words, he can spoil them for you. I don't remember if he broke more than what I have read (I think Chaplin's movies), but as I wrote it would be better if you look at them all in advance! In the IMDb list, the film is missing, which I have reported to them, so it can go quite soon. This is Meg Ryan's movie, but it's just a short excerpt, which is still not a big deal. <br /> <br /> Zizek's views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to when you're open to see things from a different perspective (even if it destroys your favorite movie ... it doesn't mean it does, but it could)!
