If you like adult comedy comics such as South Park, it's almost the same format as the three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like females, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also few stories with school teachers. There's an idiotic principle, Mr. Bip, a nervous math teacher and many others. Also fantastic is Lenny Henry Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder Nina Conti. I didn't know it came from Canada, but it is very good. Very good!
