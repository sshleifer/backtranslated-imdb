I have often wondered how much CASPER was meant for children ... with all of his or her identity problems (in this movie we believe he is the spirit of a dead child because his home is the plot of a cemetery), as well as the disturbing message of this particular film. Perhaps Casper meant more moral play, or the famous studios felt they were breaking up with a new reality in cup competitions. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION TONIGHT is a well animated project, no doubt there. But the hero's development, which includes the fox (who becomes Casper's friend but meets the tragic end), is worrying. <br /> <br /> Give credit to famous studios - they are committed to death ... but the tough Casper mourning is rather graphic and distracting for children (although the rash offers a happy ending, but I'm not giving up), and the violence is quite steep, even the standards of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> It might be a good comic for parents to help children explain death - but I wouldn't get into a video game between surprising cartoons.
