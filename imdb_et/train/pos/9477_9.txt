It is a film about deep and unspoken interpersonal relationships. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is said, but is it possible to change something. <br /> <br /> Originally in Shanghai in 1948 and completely free of propaganda, the film introduces the Dai family. There is still some weight on the history surrounding the family. History is usually weighted in Chinese literature and serious film. <br /> <br /> Young couple - Liyan, invalid, and his wife, Yuwen, lives with a one-time family compound that has been partially destroyed. The bright contrast is Liyan's young sister, who can't really remember the family's past, but takes everything in a natural way. His spirit is as bright as the other two. <br /> <br /> In this apparently stable world, there will be an unexpected visitor ... <br /> <br /> I felt pretty sad, but definitely a good movie.
