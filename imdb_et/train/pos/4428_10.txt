I have to comment a second time on this movie. Visual effects complement the film's supernatural themes and do not lose the plot. I loved the trick of this move differently, because this time no sword was added to the sword and most of the time was close to the action. I think the western audience is confused between the two scenes, one of which includes a monk who tries to burn himself alive and the other is a villager who sings that it is the end of the world. These scenes come from certain interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea, and Japan), and the second scene concerns the confusion of the Japanese calendar ... people thought the world would come to an end ... Gojo has action, story and visuals, to hold any viewers. I firmly believe that with some skilful editing it can be sold in the US. My one complaint is in the last fight (I can't give anything - sorry).
