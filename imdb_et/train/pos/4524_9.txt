This is a very rare example of a film about the transvestite of heterosexuals. The film discusses the subject of taboo so that a general audience who does not know the transvestite at all knows their main character strongly. Adrian Pasdar is very confident as Gerald / Geraldine and must not be forgotten about this brilliant behavior. The leadership of Christopher Monger is very sensitive, treating such a difficult problem quite well, offering a good story. Not a big movie, not an "art" movie, but a small, cute movie!
