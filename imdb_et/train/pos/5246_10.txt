This film deserves 10 for portraying its great world that was experienced in the playboy mind. Although I found the world morally repelled, the film did the best for what narration should do, and it takes us through an experience that we would never have gone through. Tim Meadows depicts so convincingly Leon Phelps and the story pulled me into Leon's reckless world to forget for a moment that I was looking at a playboy world parody and I was forced to rebel against it. Here is the recall of the film, because its great and courageous storytelling achieves its own success. Understanding that the overwhelming majority of filmmakers react only to the story of the film that is on the surface and rejects this story, I doubt they misunderstand them and admit that I love it. I loved it not only for my fascinating insights into a playboy frustrated mind, not only for the amusing image that represents the human sex idiot, but also for its courage to fear the heterosexuality. Besides, it's just funny.
