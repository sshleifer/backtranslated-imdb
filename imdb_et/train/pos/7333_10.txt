Thsi is one big movie. probably the best movie I've ever seen. I look at it over and over again. I have to give the 10/10 stars, because, as I said, it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. This movie + Popcorn + Coke = The best blend you can imagine. If you want to watch a movie, I recommend it clearly. First of all, I got it, I liked it so I bought it and now I own it and I will probably watch it every day. my sons like it and i think this is the best movie I've ever seen. This movie is in Guy In Fantasy World. I don't want to ruin the whole movie so you can enjoy it after reading the text. Lovely movie, cute character, cute story and just great stuff. must watch a movie. I hope you enjoyed my comment Cya <br /> <br /> Jim Make
