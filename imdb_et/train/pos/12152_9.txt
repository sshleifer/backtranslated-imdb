I just saw this movie on HBO and it was really good ... tragic love story! I really appreciated the fact that the man in the heart of the story had lost the use of his feet in an accident. It is rare to see a love story that physically covers a disabled person. The love that was well established between this character and the woman who entered her life well illustrated how I would like to think that love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27 when she made this movie was great when she was so full of life that she could revive that man's heart. Unfortunately, because his family is rich and he is not, the problem is "." <br /> <br /> It plays HBO several times this month.
