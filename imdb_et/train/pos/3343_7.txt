My daughter really puts me out when I refer to Drew Barrymore if she was looking for a hit with a pan, not to mention her Dudley Dooright jaw for which Jay Leno would die. How wonderful when I discovered "Fever Pitch" that I like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and Red Sox; and Boston! This movie is probably characterized by sweet, light comedy. Being absolutely stereotypical, girls like this romantic charm and the vulnerability of Jimmy Fallon and the boys love this all-male and sports manic image. <br /> <br /> Woman, my teenage daughter, and I found something nice in the movie. It says something about itself. It's a pleasant five hours and so, and it's probably also a good day.
