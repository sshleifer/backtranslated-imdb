I enjoyed this movie pretty much. I've always been a Whoop Goldberg fan and this movie only emphasizes it. She depicts a housewife in an African-American family moving towards the social chain because of her husband's (Danny Glover) success as a lawyer. He moves to all the white neighborhoods where people are friendly, but a little uncomfortable. Various events that occur during the film make SOME laugh, but mostly like other emotions. This film is not so much a comedy as a drama. I'll give her a strong 8/10. I suggest you catch it on TV or rent it soon.
