There are so many reasons why I appreciate sopranos so much that one of its greatest triumphs is a cast and characteristic building. Each symbol is increasingly present in each series. Each series also has many different "small deadlines" and key ones. A good example of a character (who was just three episodes) you know is David's compulsive gambler who played Robert Patrick perfectly. Every little detail builds a perfect TV series. The exhibition revolves around a circular mobile phone boss, Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who tries to balance his life with crime with his father's father. The exhibition is not afraid to be courageous and powerful in its dialogue and design and it makes it so plausible. Although Tony runs with Capo Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) is looking for promotion. Every episode has another Tony family in some way, including her children and her carmela soprano (Edie Falco). Besides these problems, he also has his Uncle Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) who is trying to get Tony out of business despite being under house arrest. All the actors are powerful and the characters are complex, but the ones who seem the most are; James Gandolfini, Tony Soprano. Also Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, who represents the younger (20-30) generation in crime. If David Chase has not created this masterpiece, there may not be such a caliber TV drama such as The Wire and Dexter. So the Sopranos are definitely the godfather of the TV, Goodfellad and Pulp
