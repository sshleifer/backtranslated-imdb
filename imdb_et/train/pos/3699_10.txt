"Who loves the sun" makes its way through some prickly subject, wisely and intelligently, so that the story not only involves but often fun. It has been a while since I found such a thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The film is proud to draw beautiful landscapes and tranquil landscapes. Peaceful images are in great contradiction with the tension between the very human, the very bad and the very pleasant characters. Thanks to excellent pain, all five major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who Loves Sun". This is a really funny film that takes a strange look at the patients we are generating and the amazingly complex but equally rewarding process.
