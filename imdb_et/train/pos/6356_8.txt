I thought how Grinch stole Christmas was a pretty good movie. It wasn't terrible nor was it great, but it was enjoyable to watch. I felt Jim Carrey at times somewhat annoying. a person with special education, if all he had to be was bad and sad, but he turned out to be like that. I thought the landscape, if it wasn't a Grinch cave, was beautiful and there were some parts where I laughed, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This film could have been much better if they had changed Grinch's personality, and they had added some more laughing scenes because most humor wasn't funny. I liked how Grinch stole Christmas, but that's nothing to see.
