This is an incredible movie. I don't remember the last time I saw this layered film. It's funny, it's tragic, it's convincing and most important is the life of a small town in Sweden. It crushes clichés and lives deeper. It makes you feel connected, not just to the main characters, but to all the characters. <br /> <br /> A big city girl who watches her roots, a small hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing the way people she hasn't met for several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. At the heart of the story is the relationship between the three sisters (at different stages of life) who are not very close. Or at least do not understand how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons for making this movie easy to connect with people is flawlessly cast. First of all, I am more pleased that there is absolutely no so-called A-list Swedish actor in this film. Usually there are a handful of participants who are able to find their way to almost every major product in Sweden. This time, the manufacturing company managed to keep it real, by giving actors who actually seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actor from Eva Röse to prove that you do not need to pass on emotions. <br /> <br /> Writing is also very tempting. The dialogue is more than plausible, and it is miles ahead of last year's or two other Swedish films. Maria Blom checks everything from the start and if you don't know, you never think it's her first time writing and directing a feature film. I can't wait to wait for her next. <br /> <br /> If you look at it, you really want to see it.
