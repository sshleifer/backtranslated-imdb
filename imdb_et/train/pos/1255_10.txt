This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why so many of you are knocking on this movie? I'll tell you. In this movie, you have a black criminal who crosses a white professor. The black policeman, who tells the white professor that he has wrongly defended the black criminal and the black policeman, is right. Seeing a white professor is stupid. It always comes to race. This is a great movie. Pay attention to racists. If you get over the fact that there are black people in this movie who cross white characters, you shouldn't enjoy this movie. I suggested everyone to see this movie.
