I give nothing more than to describe the plot of this movie as it begins with the return of Israel from a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It opens up as a detective story when a blind woman tries to find out why her friend ended her life. If he continues to investigate and the information accumulates, it will inevitably lead to a devastating conclusion. The film is lively and active, especially by Talia Sharon, because the dark woman Ya'ara is great. Israeli film is definitely outdated and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the US.
