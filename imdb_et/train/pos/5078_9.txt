It seemed out of this originality. I'm really tired of seeing Hindi movies that are a hotch-potch of a whole range of Hollywood and British films. Some bugs were inevitable, but this movie is a must-have. Surya's idea of ​​a clean, conscientious policeman (unlike the troubled, money-hungry from conventional vision) was fantastic. He's far from his job at Nerukku Neris. I liked this movie so much that I had it. I am not usually pointless in the type of violence, somehow I felt it for every character and therefore I cannot call it "pointless" violence. I don't understand excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil films. I loved this movie completely because of the lack of it. The reaction of the ACP Anbuselvani to the loss of his wife is not superfluous, it is heartfelt and makes me want to lose my eyes. Sometimes when you press the FF button while watching a movie, it is a certain time. Many times I have wanted to do it in the cinema hall. Looking at this movie, he never wanted to do it. I hope Ghajini will appear soon.
