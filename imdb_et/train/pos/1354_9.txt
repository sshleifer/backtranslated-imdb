For people interested in the business and business world, this exhibition is just the best of the best. As one of the former contestants wrote in his blog about this innovative exhibition, "People in Business" was finally the audience. The whole idea is perfect; a group of businessmen competing with each other for business-related tasks placed in the best position in the world in New York. Donald Trump is perfect as a boss, although his ego is greater than the infinity of the whole universe. He also makes many questionable decisions about who the fire, one of the negative causes of the exhibition. <br /> <br /> Season 1: The overall big season, the best of the "regular" season. This season had the most real business skills. Later, too many product placements were killed in a series of marketing tasks. Big and interesting contestants in general, the most enjoyable character in this series: Troy. I know I am not the only person who suspects that the Trump World Tower episode where he was fired was Amy and Nick to win this particular task. <br /> <br /> Season 2: It's also a great season. The tasks were still quite a lot and had many interesting competitors. Jen M was terrible and would never have considered it final, IMO. Also this season was the most difficult firing (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Terrible. In fact, I liked the concept of intelligent ideas and street games in the book, but it was so terrible (it turned out that Trump also hated that during the season) the whole season was a complete disaster. The best moments were the second episode (motel renovation) where PM Brian fired a man who did not add anything other than the huge value of comedy. <br /> <br /> Season 4: A great season, a lot of interesting and entertaining rivals this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and the entire disaster called Toral). The episode "Remove me to the board" is one of the absolute classics of this exhibition, ending with a well-remembered fourfold burning. Unfortunately, I think we have been abducted against the Randall and Alla finals. I think Trump was afraid he could have won and prevented it from happening. <br /> <br /> Season 5: A boring season with no really special things. Brent was just embarrassing and probably only there to create a drama. The tasks were terribly general (how about business at all?). I think the best man won, but personally I don't care less. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I see why they wanted to try LA as a new spot, but he looked back at the mistake. New York is always the place. This season, so many new things were added, most of them terrible (like losing a team who has to sleep outside of a tent, winning PM is like PM). The tasks were terrible and Trump chose the wrong winner. James deserved it. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity. Best season. Completely different rules (like the use of rolodexes) but all fun and entertaining. The biggest problem was that many contestants were not at all true celebrities, especially women, all of whom were unknown to me, except for Omarosa, who is completely disgraceful to everyone he participates. It seemed to be Gene Simmon's season, but after he made himself completely stupid during Kodak's task, another man appeared in the shadows: Piers Morgan. Never has anyone dominated this season as he did. He shattered his opponents and also met a good sense of humor (though some harsh Americans (of course not all Americans don't take me wrong), unfortunately, had no social skills to understand it). WITH MEMBER STATES! <br /> <br /> For fans of this user, I highly recommend the British version, starring Sir Alan Sugar. In fact, the British version is better and it says something because America (and the original) is really a great show. One version of the UK is that competitors tend to behave decently as decent people, as opposed to the constant shouting and rude behavior in the US version.
