Charming romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated - I tried to fold it three times and I can't do it. Suffice it to say it's worth. The movie is funny, beautiful - the plot is completely unrealistic, but it works. Everything in the movie is so nice and everything seems so great - it creates the whole movie through a sweet and romantic feeling. <br /> <br /> Actress is great - Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepherd are up and enjoying every second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just fine, but well. If you're a good baby, sweet sentimental movies like myself, try to catch it. Downey also looks great in her underwear! <br /> <br /> Extra bonuses - Johnny Mathis song and the second big song "After All" by Cher and Peter Cetera.
