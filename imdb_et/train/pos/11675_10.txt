I always follow Dakar, so when my husband bought Charlie 'Race Dakar DVD home, I couldn't watch it! Of course, we saw the competition when the actual competition was, but it never gives the background and specific teams. <br /> <br /> If you look at the Long Way Round, you won't be surprised by the language that, frankly, looks more fun than offensive. <br /> <br /> I think Charlie's hair was the only thing that irritated me, but she had shaped it before Dakar, so my feminine need for purity was a mistake; If I could have lived without "flame" panties, as with LWR, the preparation was as interesting as the competition itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his hand and hurt every bruise he held during training, and of course Andy Caldicott's death ... it was a terrible tragedy, but then there is something every year. <br /> <br /> Russ rides me with the nuts, although his attitude has improved a thousand times with the arguing candle of the LWR. It's nice to see that he's doing so well with Charlie. <br /> <br /> Learned from this odyssey - 1. Never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle NO! They had time to prepare X5 and one day before the team left for Lisbon, Scorpion had only done half of the things that had to be done and the vehicle was in pain throughout the race; 2. Dakar organizers have to do much more work on their driver / driver search plan - leaving Matt (and probably a large number of other riders / drivers to dry as they did, there was nothing to blame; 3. Charlie has a pleasant enthusiasm for "harsh and harsh" "With adventures, but he has to make a lot of effort to really perform as he wants, and finally, 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning another one of these epics called Long Way Down in 2007, and I can't wait to get my hands on get !: D If you love bicycles and / or really nice pictures to walk on, you have to watch it, guarantee you that love. Finally, for Simon Pavey - sir is a hero, I was so enthusiastic about your "quiet achiever" and the fact that you really stopped ..... just incredible, bearing in mind that the monumentally difficult race for Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - complete signs of pulling it. You're all wonderful.
