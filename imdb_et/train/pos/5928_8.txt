It's not a good movie, but I still like it. Cat Clovis is gold on the jar and also the assumption of the cats - in essence contradicts the evil Sleepwalker. I think this movie is more than people understand, basically it is very tough, but this brusqueness can sometimes be good. It has harsh lines, a steep end, and a comedy element worshiped by police officers. <br /> <br /> Did anyone find the force majeure a little disturbing? Ultimately, this film is randomly and randomly scary, which is quite effective, I compare it to Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, the exchange of main characters. I think the steep works well, it's not a movie you want to extend them, it only works when it's short. <br /> <br /> I am still not sure if the director had a depth or did it make these things meaningful, we know that Stephen King has the ability, but I haven't even read his books, only seen some of him movies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you like the 80's tough movies, check it out. but don't wait too much. It's really so bad for your good.
