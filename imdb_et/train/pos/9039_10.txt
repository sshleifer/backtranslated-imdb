I grew up in South West Virginia; I am about as old as (or maybe a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys", a book that is the real story of this warming film. <br /> <br /> And so I am closely related to the West Virginia coal mining issue and the stunning effect Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on all of us. The Rocket boys themselves went to great life. I went to my degree in physics and computer engineering. All because Sputnik woke up a lot of young people to U.S.R. "Science Gap", they were on the Cold War days in the United States ... <br /> <br /> It's a great movie for everyone of all ages. But when you grew up in West Virginia at the end of the 1950s, you touch the core of your being. <br /> <br /> All: Get it; Look out; we recommend it to your friends ... who thank you many times.
