I saw the happiness of this movie, just because I went through a phase where I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his latest films and thank God! This movie is stuck with me and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who start a dramatic journey abroad, where they learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene tried to rest together before going to college. but their journey ended up much more complicated. The struggle they go through when they are arrested in Thailand and imprisoned is very moving and intense. The action is amazing, the pictures are extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and so powerful for the right movie and the message you send. I can't even find the right words to describe how this film makes me feel. I know some people have not appreciated the film as much as I do, but I swear it is! I promise it will stay with you!
