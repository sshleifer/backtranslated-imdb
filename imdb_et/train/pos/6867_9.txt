I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the late 80's and 90's. I was watching Groove Tube for the first time in 2001 when I was 19. <br /> <br /> And I found it fun. <br /> <br /> So anyone who thinks that something can be "dated" 30 years later is not really funny .... think again! It's funny even if you have no idea what the 70s were, and the idea of ​​watch-based trousers makes you ignite. Who can claim the type of Bozo clown who reads adult literature? There's a lot of laugh. The best is the chef's exhibition at the end.
