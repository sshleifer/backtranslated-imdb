DO NOT evaluate this production with a 2-hour version that appeared in the US for VHS, a messy and incomprehensible confusion. I was delighted to see the full-length 6-hour version available from DVD in the UK, and it was fascinated. The deliberate pace and growing threat of threat is amazing, as is the amazing visual and phonetic landscape; it is an ancient Rome that we have never seen before and much more authentic than most. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi was fairly celebrated in his 1968 Odyssey mini series and this mini-series is equally powerful. Just as Bekim Fehmiu became the best Ulysses, Klaus Maria Brandauer could be the best Nero on the screen. Now, one day, I hope to see Rossi's version of The Aeneid (Eneide) sent in 1971 on Italian television. <br /> <br /> I have not decided which version of QUO VADIS is more powerful, this one or the Polish mini series since 2001; each has different virtues and they complement each other in many ways. Certainly, one of the towers over the Hollywood camp rebellion, starring Peter Ustinov.
