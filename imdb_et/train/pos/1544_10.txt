It's great, but hard to find trippy World War I spy thriller is an incredible 60 Italian style. Introductory Psychedelic Graphics Graphics and Ennio Morricone's Big Score with Lesbian Love Scene Capucine and Precisely Produced Apocalyptic Man's Land-Battle Scenes with Venom and German Cavalry Gasproof “Storm Guard”, a movie that shouldn't be missed. It is a film that hits the horror and cruelty of war and the mercy of players on the battlefield and field. In addition to the battle scenes, some of the production and special effects are primitive, because most of the budget is probably saved for battle scenes from the budget, but it shouldn't be a problem for 60's cinema lovers. I saw this movie for the first time on television years ago and saw how it was recorded on VHS. I still have a tape and I have to watch it from time to time.
