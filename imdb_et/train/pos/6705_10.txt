And this is not because his days "Clarissa explains all this" that I have Melissa Joan Hart somewhat split, who during this exhibition was already in her 20s well, but was still capable of teenage roles. "Sabrina, a teenage witch" was Hart's next big leap after her "Clarissa" days. Comic-based Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - A teenage witch trying to balance her witchcraft and the daily demands of teenage life. Her assistant is her two aunts and wise black cat when she goes to high school, college and finally her career in the press. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart is the heart and soul. "Sabrina, a teenage witch" is quite touching and very funny, and it is a shame that she took so long to understand how big it was. I just want to have some newer episodes we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
