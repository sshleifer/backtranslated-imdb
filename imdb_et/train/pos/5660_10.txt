I could see an episode or 2 when the show was originally broadcast, but when I watched 1 episode on netflix, I was hooked. I looked the whole series like 2 days. :) I really liked the character of Gary Cole. First of all, he is deeply condemned, then you start to symbolize ("These things have a thousand uses")! His popular Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson, who meets Satan. Charming, charismatic, smarmy and uh dangerous and "kind" I mean "really". I want to be like Him when I grow up. Lucas Black is also great. Accents are also great. Anyway, I thought it was one of the best TV shows and you can see it yourself.
