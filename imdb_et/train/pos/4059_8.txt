The first official film by Ghibli, Laputa, is most similar to his predecessor, Nausica, but Nausicaa was an epic of SF, a comedy adventure with a relatively weak SF assumption. <br /> <br /> The first half hour of the movie I thought I loved it. Once again, you will find yourself in Miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to imagine the imaginary world carefully and beautifully. Animation, though not yet in Ghibli's latest film, is a bit better than Nausica. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in Nausica's review that one character is drawn more in "Lupinesque" anime. style. Here's a whole lot of them: pirates. They offer a comic in the movie, but that's why it needs a comic that I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausica and I think it was better. Still. Having said that, pirate leader Dola is just the most memorable character of a movie (even though it is mostly female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised when you are sometimes reminded of Treasure Planet) and well expressed in the Cloris Leachman American dub. <br /> <br /> Voice in English is mostly acquired correctly. But something started with a pear-shaped mark about this film about halfway. I think the best way I can describe it is that the wide range of characters is absorbed by these characters. I'll come back to it later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire Laputas, and so many people will probably love the fact that I almost feel like giving only eight out of ten, but the operative word here is “admire”. It was more impressive than personally influential and over two hours it just dragged. <br /> <br /> It was important to me that I really found that I didn't like any character. Disney would have taken care of the development of the characters, would make you really fall for them instead of leaving them in the relatively two-dimensional pieces that you need to move around when you shoot in amazing views. Even that would have been acceptable if the story had been difficult to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of prussesses and magical crystals. From there, Laputa falls as far as I am concerned and keeps it back from 10 out of 10 movies. Having said this, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was in Disney in 1986 before the leagues in general, if you think that their film of the same year was a terrible "Big Mouse Detective". <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie in some sense, and you should definitely see it, but I feel it is overpriced. I definitely prefer the earlier "Nausica of the Wind". <br /> <br /> BTW, if you manage to view them in chronological order, make sure that Nausica's Fox squirrel appears briefly in Laputa.
