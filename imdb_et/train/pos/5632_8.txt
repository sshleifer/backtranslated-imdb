Funny drama written by William Mastrosimone on his performance, where Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, was attacked by a rape by Joe (James Russo) in his car. He succeeds, but the police tell him he can't do anything. However, he understands that Joe got his wallet and knows where he lives. When his households Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) have been at work, Joe will pay a visit to finish what he started. After he has been humiliated and worsened by Joe in many different ways, he can capture him and impress him. Knowing well that he was in another "against his word" and that no raping was technically, he had no intention of accepting him easily until he acknowledged Pat and Terry's intentions. > The end result of the movie is to miss two opponents. Marjorie shows such ruthlessness that she does not know whether she has changed like her nemesis. Fawcett does enough work, while Russo is really great because he is paralyzed, doing his best to manipulate the situation. There are only two characters in the film, most of the working time, so the film has an intimate character that shows that it works even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young is not ashamed of the worst and exploiting elements of the situation; the film becomes uncomfortable at times. And by the time Marjorie has the upper hand, things will change enough so that it will not become so easy to encourage him to go to the blood, and hopes that Pat can justify him. <br /> <br /> "Extreme" I felt that it was a pretty good movie that kept at least interest and relatively high intensity. Woodard and Scarwid support both (Scarwid has a great moment when Terry reveals himself as a victim of rape) and the pace is consistent. The dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material is convincing at every step. <br /> <br /> 8/10
