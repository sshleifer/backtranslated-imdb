This movie was charming. The Accountant wants more than life than approved normal success. What makes it so well-functioning and so different from its traditional dance film is that it is not really "big", but just how to find your own way of expressing. The end result is not the victory of the competition, not the discovery of a completely new lifestyle, but the simple pleasure of doing what you want to do in other parts of your life. No one knows their passion, they find their quiet soul. <br /> <br /> The Japanese background makes dance dancing a subtle oppression and "secret life" both understandable and personal. We all see ourselves forever.
