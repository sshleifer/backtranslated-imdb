This movie is great. I found it very interesting. I thought Wendigo's legend was pretty cool. The action was also excellent, as well as costumes, production, photography, management and scripting. A very happy family, on vacation, somewhere in the middle of the middle when they are caught in a deer. The hunter then appears and is very angry and outraged that one of the deer horns is broken. Then he starts lurking in the family and things are going to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It's worth it. Kudos cast, for team and filmmakers. Two thumb paths up!
