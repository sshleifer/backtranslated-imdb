Teenage Eddie spends her life because of temptation and humiliation as her obsession with heavy metal music. One day he finds his hero, Sammi Curr, dead, allegedly burned by a company that wanted to stop their music. But Edd has his last record, which has never been released and when he plays it, he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors. Before long, Sammi has shown that he is going to return to life on the local Halloween side to get the exact revenge of the city that was once gloomy for him. <br /> <br /> Filling with humor and jokes, this is a very fun movie. Sammi himself is an original horror film villain, who plays in the upheavals of 80's rock music. Worth a look.
