Yes, Shakespeare would have been really proud. Laurence Fishburne wasn't his best, but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh, on the other hand, was great. His scheme was wonderful as he played with the audience. Very nice work. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there was too little drama where more would be expected. For example, killing Cassio was too far too far since the spectator turned his head all in order to understand it. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His madness Roderigo was unusual; even irritating. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Othello before, look at it. If you haven't read Othello, look at it. If you haven't heard of Othello, look at it. On the other hand, you do your job by reading it, seeing that it worked on the stage and heard it singing.
