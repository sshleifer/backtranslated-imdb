This movie is fun to watch, it doesn't have a lot of land (well, there's no plot), but there are good jokes and situations you laugh at. The main story is Cheech's catching up for a nice date, while Chong is festive with Cheech's cousin (they smoke the dope, go to the music shop, massage parlor, comedy club and even go to where they don't even go) Rated R
