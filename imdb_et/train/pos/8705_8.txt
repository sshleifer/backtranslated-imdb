Despite the title The Sword Bearer and Action / Herioc The Sword Bearer, this is not a super hero. <br /> <br /> (Small spoilers) It follows the story of Sasha, the Sword keeper, who is cursed with his own arm's retractable sword. Yes, you say, but no, it's a real life. If you had such a power as a child, could you guide it if you said it before a mad man or if your mother's boy beats him. And if you don't check it out, then how are you going to be a double killer at the age of 12? This is essentially where Sasha is when we meet him. Impatiently after the second killing (like A Bout de Souffle). Then she meets Katja and the couple falls instantly in love, giving Sasa a real reason to live and try and change her way. But his past continues in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a story, and practically no action is taken on the screen, much more than desired. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. Unlike many of Hollywood's "super heroes" movies, we get very little feedback, not a bad boy (if you don't read Sword Bearer himself), there's a lot of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out if you find it.
