I am not a big fan of Tim Matheson, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. It was dark and a bit annoying with some scenes a little nervous, I don't know that this movie would be a bit SF and a bit of a horror for the Slash thriller. 2.00 or so on my local channel was nothing else, so I decided to watch it. If you haven't seen this movie id recommend it not really so bad, the characters are interesting enough, but really didn't explore their full potential that could have make this movie even better. I don't know if this movie went into the cinema, but it seemed to be made for television or went straight to the video because one would buy it if it is on a DVD, it fits well with my movie type and has a little X-FILES story that Government Companies or Shifty Corporations Involved in Shady Shadow Transactions. In general, it's a good movie.
