I love this movie. Noir pictures with Spillane's nonsense nature Mike Hammer works wonderfully to create a mood and rarely find what has been found in the low budget detective films of the early fifties. It may not be "Malta Falcon," but this film makes a strong contribution to its genre. The Spillan is often criticized for alleged misogenes, etc., but his "dames" are above their men in terms of visas and intelligence. The bad old Mike Hammer, actually played by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the mystery of a mysterious psychiatrist he meets to investigate the death of a military friend. When the penny finally ends, it's a picture. It is good to see that the censorship of the 50s did not force filmmakers to leave the famous last line. Bona fide low budget classic.
