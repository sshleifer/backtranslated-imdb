That was a great movie! Although there were only about 15 people, it was great! My friend and we laughed a lot. My mother even enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women there and 20 years old in the middle and they seemed to enjoy it. I love the part where Corky and Ned are like Nancy and their lovely lol. And when he gets his roadster and Ned is there. Yes It was a great movie, even when people underestimated it. Go See that I can enjoy it! I really enjoyed it and so my friend. <br /> <br /> People were so harsh on the film and they didn't even see it. I bet the next time they give the film and the actors an opportunity. They all did a good job in my opinion. But if you have young children, it's still appropriate. I think my 7-year-old niece is watching it.
