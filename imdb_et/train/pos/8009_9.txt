Ah, real memories. I lived in the Netherlands at that time and was looking forward to every Sunday night and later on Tuesdays. I saw it in my 14-16 years. Very good in English (at school) in English, as Dutch television offers subtitles for other languages ​​except children today. So you would hear the original voices and language. - The best series were the first three and then after the third series, a large number of characters, Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a terrifying enemy, (I don't think they ever seized him, he always escaped) left the room to get him back in the next story to show again) because the series was probably distributed to Germany and the Nazi enemy did not go very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderfully convincing job to portray an intelligent Nazi aristocrat who considered this revenge to revenge in England. It was a real pleasure to see such a high-quality performance in the youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good partner and the youth were so common. They were very believers at that time and, as a child, I could imagine that I was part of those young people who were about four years old at that time. It was a very exciting series for me, being a special "prisoner" exhibition in the memory of these times. I hope they will publish a series of good quality DVDs that would be great. Even bad copies are still enjoyable to watch. The later series were not as good, inclined, or just as fun as the first three. Hopefully, they will find another series where Von Gelb can put on a DVD.
