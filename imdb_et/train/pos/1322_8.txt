With an exciting movie. Even if it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was an exciting artist in his element. And just such film psychology students can learn to learn compulsive liars. <br /> <br /> The author of the forbidden love, Norma, was discovered in the media as a scam, but this step really gives her a lot of opportunities to delete her name. <br /> <br /> But the twists he's making on the documentary are amazing. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I haven't read the book, but just heard good comments and went to the boring rainy afternoon. The journey that this film takes to you is smart, interesting, and completely enticing.
