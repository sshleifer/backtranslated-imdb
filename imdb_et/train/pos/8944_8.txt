Bell Book and Candle were released in December 1958 and feature James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Hard. This movie was James Stewart and Kim Novak on their second screen pair (after Alfred Hitchcock's classic Vertigo, which was released earlier that year). It was Stewart's last film as a romantic leader because he was too old at the age of 50 to play that part. The film is related to the witch played by Kim Novak, attracted by the mortal played by James Stewart. He puts his spell on him and he falls with his head in the heels that fall in love with him. I enjoyed the movie and cast it. This film was at this time a modest success, nominated for Golden Globe for the best film comedy. GimmeClassics
