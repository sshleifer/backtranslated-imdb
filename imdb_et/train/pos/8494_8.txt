I saw this movie again in my classroom. We should mainly comment on the different driving styles and ideas about quality (product). I rented it back in the eighties and I remember it's a good (but not big) movie. I've always liked Michael Keaton's style and delivery. He was very suitable for the film. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some of the low ratings on this movie. I will give you yes, it is not an Oscar winner, but it has a decent comedy value. It is a fine comedy rather than an all-out-comedy farce. I also find some of those who felt it was an inaccurate film about cultural and commercial differences. I ask you to differ. I will tell you once again that there are many generosities and dramatures, but then again this is a Hollywood film, not a documentary. Since I have read about the differences between Automakers on both sides of the Pacific, many fundamental ideas were accurate for the time. <br /> <br /> Some of the main differences were that Japanese employees felt like part of the business as a whole. Teamwork was emphasized. They probably did this business. When American workers had more senior employees, they had an employment relationship. The individual was more important than the company. I think I will definitely get an e-mail of hate with this comment, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Another difference was how quality was viewed and whose job was to improve it. Many Japanese plants investigate and fix defects or problems during its discovery. Instead of one movie character being "it was a deal for dealers (ie a car dealer)". <br /> <br /> Many of these things are probably dated, but I'm sure some of them are still about the same as US car makers still keep up with Japan. If you are more interested in the topic of the American, European and Japanese automotive industry, I can recommend a book that explores this topic in more detail and made during the same time. The book is called "The Machine That Changed the World" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roose. This is the case with car manufacturers during and before this film. Some are a bit dry, but I think you'll find that he's backing up a lot of movies.
