Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I finished it again. I couldn't become emotional in my final scene. He didn't get an Oscar. That's why you shouldn't believe too much in the Oscar. Richard Widmark never had a better part, and it was perfect casting as a 3-D, faulty person. Jean Peters was great as ever as a tough modern girl. And Richard Kiley must be very good; why else would I hate him so much. Yes, patriotism was hard; but without it, you don't have a lot of movies. Look at your face! The first three letters do not need much scripting. I would like them to see this movie without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam's "The Thief," you may know what I mean. When I was a child in 1956 for my first trip to NYC, I made my Bronx Uncle ride us to South Street, looking for No. 66. It was when I knew that Hollywood couldn't be trusted. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I don't give a lot of story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it myself. If you have seen it, no explanation is needed. Perhaps someone who reads these comments has not seen "Pickup On South Street". You like it; just don't look for 66 South Street in New York.
