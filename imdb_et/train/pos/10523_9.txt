Emma is a real romance. If you love funny things that are charged wisely and foolishly, then you love this movie! This is true for the novel, which is very important because some of the twists are joy. Gwen is not one of my fave actors, but he justifies the role that needed everything he had in the spades. He seems to be in his role, which I think no other actor would have done correctly. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam is a hero. how shocked are you? I didn't see him as obviously beautiful, but fucking! What is the right role for you! He looks as good as reasonable, rally Mr K, so I look at him literally in a new light. She does and excellent romantic lead. The old charm and character he brings to his role is wonderful! good pain. Good movie. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie with Pride and Prejudice - AND NOW to buy books. This increases the film's height to extraordinary
