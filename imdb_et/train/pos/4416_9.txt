Harvey Keital is the best result ever so far. Very nicely captured, beautiful snap-shot before Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the brother-in-law of a local juvenile offender who develops a friendship with America and Hollywood. This is actually the moment when the boy wakes up to the fact that the small people he knows are actually living in a much larger, more complex world that he does not yet understand. The script is strong and full of humor, the direction is crisp. First of all, there is really a professional job that fits well with the Latin American cinema tradition. One weakness is decision in English rather than in Spanish - probably in the US to improve sales. Unfortunately, it makes the film a little less convincing. But when you see beyond, you will find a cordial journey to another world. Recommended.
