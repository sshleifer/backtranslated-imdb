This is a movie that should be seen by someone who is interested in eating disorder, suffering from it or suffering from it. It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive depiction of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and symptoms. The girl is playing a cinema today, working in the cinema, Alison Lohman, who was so remarkable "Where is the truth". I recommend that this movie be shown in all schools because you never see better on this. Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding and one is surprised at his ability to transmit the distress of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. When the barometers tell us the pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the same emotional pressure. His emotional range is so precise that each scene can be measured microscopically against the trauma scale, with a growing hysteria and despair that reaches intolerable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice for mother to play, and she does so with enormous compassion and many emotions that are just as precise as Lohman's. Together they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators that vibrate with each other in resonance. This movie is really an amazing achievement and the director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason not to see it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like nature movies, it is on the sharp edge of the animals' behavior. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tortured soul can destroy the madness of its body's despair. And if we don't feel like people with despair, we're dead inside.
