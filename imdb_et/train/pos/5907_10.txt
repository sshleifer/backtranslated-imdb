This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and somewhat have seen the lives of the villagers. The peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects exactly the same. Full credit for director and actor. They have done an excellent job. I just don't know how to go to movies like Lagan and Pahel to the Oscar and not to Dogh. I do not understand the criteria for selecting the films. Whether the difference that makes the difference or has big names in the movie changes the difference. <br /> <br /> I hope you'll see more such movies in the future.
