It's very short. I think every voice makes jason steele. (You can just say little if you have heard his normal voice so don't worry that they sound the same. They're not.) It's about 15 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Edward spatula fights against spoons and meets some strange. In fact, everyone he knows knows really crazy. <br /> <br /> "Edward!" "General peterson, we have to take you to a medical unit!" "No, I'm not doing it back." "Don't talk so, I'm sure you're fine." "im goner edward, and you know it. before i go" "yes?" "Do I just ... one kiss?" "umm, no." "Come on, one, little, peck on the lip?" "Im walking now sir." <br /> <br /> The movie will be coming soon. its date is in september, but probably comes down.
