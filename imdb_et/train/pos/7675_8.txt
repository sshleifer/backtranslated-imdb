After seeing the film last night, I had the feeling that the film-making organizations were trying to solve the problem. The extent of prostitution seems so great that it is hard to understand how to fight it without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with an overview. <br /> <br /> Although this is an inconvenient central relationship, it is a very impressive film, and I would even go so far as to say it was enjoyable. The film was a good time to work and Thuy Nguyen's performance was great. I also felt that Ron Livingston had a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice to have a little more information about why Patrick feels he has to help Holly, but perhaps the reason is as simple as explaining Chris Penn's character. I don't explain it here - look at the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good, thought-provoking movie with obviously good intentions. I hope that it will have a sufficiently large display to reach a decent audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
