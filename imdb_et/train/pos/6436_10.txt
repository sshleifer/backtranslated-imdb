Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished 19th century Parisian county who finds himself the most popular general and glamorous list in France - and it is a shoe-magnet. This is an unsuccessful assumption that leads to one of the most disgraceful plots in the history of a movie. General handlers have backward political mechanisms, fallen balloon and ecstatic Bastille days, but the heart of this superbly captured movie is the insanely upstairs / bottom floor, which includes randy-servants and only slightly more modest aristocrats. Yes, this is the rules of the game. Before Gaston Modot, a jealous gamer of the rules, looks like - like a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a bit too thick and fast to the end, which results in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the hell - Elena and Her Men is another deeply humane masterpiece of Renoir.
