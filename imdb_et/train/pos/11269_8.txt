Ever wanted to know how much Hollywood could get off before the Hayes code was officially enforced? Well, unfortunately the "City of the Convention" has also disappeared, so just look at "Tarzan and his companion" to find out. In 1934 there was a significant number of sexual furnishings and even exhibited meat. Just look at Jane's naked swim. Although Tarzan is often regarded as a b-adventure movie for young boys and someone else, this picture proves that the series was originally a very adult. Seventy years later it is as sexy as it was when it came out. <br /> <br /> In addition to the wrapper that pushes the taboo style, it is a great and exciting adventure story. I've always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood created in the 30's and 40's, but there are few in the genre I would call a big movie. "Tarzan and his companion" is far from being the long-lived movie of this long period. The sequences of attacks against both the monkeys and the natives safari today can create tension. Animals are also too cool (especially monkeys throw boulder). The actor will not win the main prizes soon, but it is certainly enough for this type of picture. The film is once again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the funniest examples of Hollywood pre-code.
