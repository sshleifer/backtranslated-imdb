This is my favorite classic. It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia, PA when I was 13, 1957, and was released next year. Then, in 1970, I found myself working as the same county with a new PA national soldier. I've always enjoyed the different places where the scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of Downingtown Diner well and had a way out, telling all the riding drivers that it was a "blob" home. The theater show was in Phoenixville near the Valley Forge Park and it still shows movies!
