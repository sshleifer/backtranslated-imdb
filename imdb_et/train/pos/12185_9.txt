SHANGHAI LADY is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could direct the "mainstream" movie if he so wished. Compared to his other, more artistic works, this film has only moderate craft and almost all esoteric elements. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ultimate scene in the Mirror Hall is, of course, widely agreed that this is one of the greatest scenes in film history. The cost of rent alone is worth it. <br /> <br /> Lovely surprise was the wonderful action of Rita Hayworth. His action at the beginning and the middle of the film is so great that other actors appeared as caricatures instead of characters. Even a great Mr. Welles.
