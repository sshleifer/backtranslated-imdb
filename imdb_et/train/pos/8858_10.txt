I have to admit that this is just a movie I would normally miss, but I rented it basically because of the stars. I was certainly not sorry. In fact, as you can see, I rated this five stars. This film is the perfect combination of sharp leadership and ultra-strong action. Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to rob their parents' jewelry store. Crime is terribly wrong, thus starting with the study of the three men of the Hanson family. Through several setbacks, we look at Charles Hanson and understand the tense relationship between father and son. <br /> <br /> The younger brother Hank is basically screwed. She has always had trouble keeping her job and pretty much going in the direction of the wind. Hank is insecure, cowardly and under the influence of a very big brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank, which is nailed to T and gives what is probably his best power. He shows us a man who is basically with a good heart, but it is influenced by external forces that he cannot perform any important task. <br /> <br /> Andy - on the surface - seems to be a successful businessman, but we will soon discover that he is drug addicted and has forced his company to pay for his habits. Andy puts the scheme on the robbery of his parents' shop, and he can do a weak will to commit. Philip Seymour Hoffman - definitely the best actor of our time - is played by Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who is a pleasing business man under his familiar but real mucus ball. He is absolutely perfect for Andy's part, or it can be said that he made Andy a perfect part of his superior skill. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays his generation's common father. Charles Hanson is not a bad or unknown man, but he has a bad relationship with his sons because he never realized what was necessary to grow a positive bond between the sons and himself. He has always criticized and warned too quickly. He always made it clear that he preferred his younger son for his parent, causing a wide emotional gap between himself and Andy. In learning about Charles and Andy, Andy's plan for his father's robbery plan is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> From a personal note I can't believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my father and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my brother and me. Perhaps this may be one of the reasons why I enjoyed the movie so much that this story of a distant, critical father, a more successful older brother, and a less successful younger brother hit home so close. Luckily, my brother and I never reached a crime situation against my parents because we were doing more rigorous and moral things. <br /> <br /> This personality and action complex is compiled by a professional director, Sidney Lumet. Eighty-three days he still has boxes that give the audience attractive signs and hypnotize the edge of the seat. 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years before the devil knew that you were dead, but he hadn't lost a bit of his magical touch, showing us the signs that we remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> Events and characters before the devil's knowledge that you are dead are harsh and unpleasant, and this is definitely not a good self-conscious film. However, there are two hours of ultimate entertainment that I strongly recommend.
