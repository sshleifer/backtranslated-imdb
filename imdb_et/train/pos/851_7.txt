Pierce Brosnan has smiled with his last Martin and ridiculous self-parody as an obsessive cozy assassin Julian Noble, especially fond of teenage girls, bullfighting and sticky clothes. During his work in Mexico, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a straight-forward Denver suburban businessman who is in town to make his base in his hotel bar during his lifetime. Despite their totally different people and Julian's raw and unknown comments, they get friends. <br /> <br /> Director Richard Shepard showed that Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear's performances have largely been recorded as not writing with Pierce Brosnan but I can't imagine it without him. He proves that he has a real comedy talent and he can be more than just James Bond or Cold War spies. The scene where two meet in a shiny hotel bar (stunning kits and beautifully photographed) is really a skill in bravura. The scene takes almost fifteen minutes, and although it was probably carefully written, the two participants are largely improvising, but they are great! It almost seems like this is a new standard for running the screen. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel as improvising at MEAN STEETS and add one of the most subtle basics of many genre cliches and actors writing (especially Brosnani James Bond) and you have one of the most pleasing pairs in the last Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story will be thin after a while. After an hour, the film just ends with steam. Nonetheless, and I can't put it on my finger, I enjoyed it very much. It just looks very fresh and original, using some imaginative set and lighting, and some hints for Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. There is not much to do with the rest of the characters, but this movie offers something new, in which it is quite fun to mix with almost all conventional genres. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 7/10
