Other than Susan Hayward's wood delivery throughout this film was as good as every biblical film. Henry King deals with this film with ethical respect in all the small scenes, and Peck is, as always, impeccable. Mixing Alfred Newman's sound, stirring twenty-thirds of the psalm, is unforgettable even after these years. The Goliath scene is a bit on the hockey side, but not all that has been badly done in the era of making this film. It goes well with the lesser biblical command of the day, "Rutti's Songs" and "Ester and King". It is worth seeing and Raymond Massy is a great prophet Nathan. The film is always rounded off by perfect James Robertson justice, like Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's alienated first woman.
