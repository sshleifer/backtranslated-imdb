When the movies are to be believed, Chinese ghosts are much more beautiful and stupid than their western counterparts. The story of the three "Chinese Ghost" films is largely identical, but the direction is great and the detail and color are such that it is not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, with, of course, a lot of looting. For those who have not yet encountered "Chinese GhostStory" trilogy, this film offers an interesting departure from the Western horror / ghost genre; for those who are, another enjoyable romp in the Chinese ghost world.
