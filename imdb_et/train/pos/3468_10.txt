I loved this movie completely! I was hesitant to see it for the first time because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard John was putting. However, looking at "Two of us", I took a happier time when he was still alive and had hope and opportunity. I think the writer did an amazing job of representing what "could have been." Aidan Quinn was as divine as Paul and met the challenge head. I was impressed with his accent and motives. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable John. My favorite items were the scene in the park and the roof area that was so amazing. The film left me with sadness and satisfaction, both of which I feel fit in the circumstances.
