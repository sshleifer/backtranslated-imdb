I heard a friend one day saying "Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to put another godfather in the early 80s." Now, I'm usually listening to idiots / watching CNN, so I decided to stay away from it. Then my companion gave me a DVD and said, "This is with pelicans" # 1, confused I tried it. This is the best film ever. This is more realistic than all this nasty racing cars that are too expensive for this area (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *). However, what is better than Al Pacino, who uses m203? I'll give this ***** field ****, perfect for Al or GTA fans: Vice City.
