Edward D. Wood's Haunted World, Jr. is not a very good documentary. Aesthetically, it is weak and inexpensive when looking at it, people are triggered by tactics that make it very purposeful and consistent, but it adds to its charm. I say this because it is a documentary about an odd picture that made odd pictures and surrounded by other oddballs, and as such there is no other way of documenting the life and career of a man and his team. There are some glimpses of both the genius and the failure of wood, and depicting both qualities is a credit for the reality of the documentary. Generally it is worth looking at a wooden fan and cinema in general, but don't wait for the shine here. Wait for a documentary made from Wood's own heart.
