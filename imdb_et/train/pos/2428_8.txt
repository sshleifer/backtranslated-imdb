As an old white housewife, however, I can understand that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates their work, such as Deep Cover, can enjoy this actor's incredible selection. Since I think it's his debut, it may be even more interesting. All actors are pretty good. If you can't take the lower Manhattan junk worlds or the life of crime (not glorified action shoot-em ups) then this is not the movie you would enjoy. This is Mr Fishburne's usual contribution to an incredibly fine relationship. I would like to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go to each other in a movie one day.
