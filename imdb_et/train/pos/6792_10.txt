I remember this game. It always sat on the shelves alone, until one day I decided to try something new and got this game. I was watching this awe because it was the first game for PS1 that I had 4 discs. When I played it, I couldn't take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The story of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as Final Fantasy VII and it's hard to achieve. While playing the game, these characters are so incredibly engaging that it's just a PS1 game because it seems like a movie. And I believe it should be made into a movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad this game is a very unheard of game and hardly anyone has played it or liked it because it is one of those games that sit on the shelves with a 50% discount that sells it. Well I am one of those people who always look for those who are out and try them out and most of them are really good. Heck, this is how I got into the final Fantasy VII, looking for a directory and found it. But it is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG that is surprisingly surprising than most Square Enix games. I would not be surprised if it was made by Square Enix, but it is not. Hardly the games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series or Dragon Quest series, but that is. But what is really wrong with me is why it is very little known and it is not what it should be. <br /> <br /> Graphics are pretty good for PS1, but what to expect? This is a PS1 man made in 1999. I've already mentioned that the story is amazing, almost hits VII. The characters are amazing, you involve so much with them and with their actions. <br /> <br /> Definitely 10 out of 10. Certainly worth more praise and a very well done RPG made by a company other than Square Enix.
