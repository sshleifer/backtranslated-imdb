Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are a great adventure of Bill and Ted. Their fake journey follower almost immediately after the first movie and does the same good job, if not better to attract the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot is a future evil man trying to kill Bill and Ted uses evil robots that look just like Bill and Ted. When the robots kill Bill and Tedi, they have to compete with the birthplace (death) and return their life to normal. <br /> <br /> Playing a movie is a top-notch and even thought it was a bit weird sometimes, especially in the Bill and Tedi conversations, this is a great movie. Wannabe rockers has definitely made another great movie. Pick it up the next time you miss it!
