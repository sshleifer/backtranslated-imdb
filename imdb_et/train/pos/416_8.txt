Plainsman is an entertaining western, undoubtedly classic, even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, an ideal role with John Wayne and James Stewart; they were the best actors who played Western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, someone I know played better than him. Even though it may not be historically accurate, the film can capture the most important Hickok and its time. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that's what DeMille does here. Hickok's Friendship with Buffalo Bill, selling big-sold guns to Indians to compensate for the inconvenience that Buffalo Bill's wife would suffer as a result of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn. a religious woman, a man with Hickok, who had killed a lot, as well as an unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity, which makes Plainsman a regular and interesting film. Anthony Quinn has a very short look that already shows her great actor. A lot of care was given to the guns of this time.
