Frankly, I didn't like this movie when I first saw it. But I think the problem is that I haven't seen it in the theater. Big mistake! Because # 1 in Cliffhanger is settings and # 2 is cinematography. Try to see this movie on the largest possible television and a great sound system. Music is good and puts the film on a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of Renny Harlin's best films. This man knows about action. Die Hard 2, Long Kiss is good, and it's especially good in this movie. The special effect is great and remarkable. Stallone needed this movie successfully. More good to see her!
