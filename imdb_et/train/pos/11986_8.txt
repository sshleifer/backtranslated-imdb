I looked at "just talk" one night and thought it was o. Maybe Buster Keaton strangely threw me away or lost the lead of a leading woman. The next day, however, I was thinking about the film. I didn't get the Durante song out of my head, I tried to remember Thelma Todd's first scene better, I thought maybe Keaton made funny falls and physical comedy. The next night, I watched a scene with Thelma Todd, where he impressed Buster and Jimmy with his sex appeal. Very funny scene, actors great, their faces, eyes, foolish expressions. So I watched the second scene, their show opens in Broadway. Buster in his blissful innocence bounces on every act. Again, I smiled loudly, appreciating Keaton's clowning and drumming. So next night I watched the whole movie again and this time I see it for the first time: it's amazing! It's sensational! This is Sublime! Three great comedies! Todd dances! Durante sings! Keaton is talking! Of course it is not ... but there is a lot of laugh in this picture.
