It is the feeling of a good film, the motivation of one person's dreams and their realization. This is a beautiful and inspiring film. Why some people have to try and light up every film they show, especially the good ones. Dennis Quaid gives this solid story to Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach, pushed by his team to take another professional baseball career. With great support, including Brian Cox, an old naval officer who has given so many of his son's achievements without his support. It was good to see her as something other than a villain in the movie. If I have one complaint with this movie, it is not: Never let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. Seriously, this movie belongs to a handful of big baseball films such as "Field of Dreams" and "Natural". It sets the two thumbs up and the big "well done".
