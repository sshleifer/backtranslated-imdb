I saw this movie first about 5 years ago and I couldn't finish laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to be clicked, story, characters, setting. As for the film, I wouldn't call it a big movie, but what it should be fantastic. It gets its meaning. The cast is perhaps as good as ever in a comedy film. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are fun. For those who haven't seen it, I'll give you a brief summary: four criminals meet in Montana's small town after they have received a letter from their friend about the bank's heir. But when their friend is arrested by two police officers behind him in New Jersey, they try to figure out what's going on and all the hell is broken. The movie is a really big bank's comedy and it's sort of like a hostile version of Oceans Eleven, just four criminals who can't stand each other, and Las Vegas instead of Montana. All in all, I would recommend watching this movie if I wanted to laugh.
