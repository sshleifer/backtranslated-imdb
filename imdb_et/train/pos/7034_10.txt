when you add all aspects of the film --- dancing, singing, acting --- the only one who stands out as the best is Vanessa Williams ... her commitment, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie a perfect role. I've never seen anyone depict Rose in such a viability! Vanessa's singing talent shows beautifully all the songs she performs when Rose and her acting skills don't cease to amaze me! His dance is so incredible, even if some people say choreography was bad --- his dance skills were better than ever! I recommend this version on '63 just because I find that although Vanessa's action is long-lasting - not to mention that Jason Alexander and the rest cast is also very impressive (with the exception of Chynna Philips ... what the hell did they think when they put it?) <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that this version is great and I recommend everyone to see this version!
