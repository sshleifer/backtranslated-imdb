This film is enchanting in its beauty and creativity. The artist's deep vision, his art that comes intuitively from his natural source, brings us inspiring Hosanna, mixing his creations with disability, stones, squares and rain against white water ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer alive, aware that we are all made of this glorious land clay. He does not save us from his accidental disappointment, but as a whole, we see miracles in combining art with nature. Of course, the credit goes to filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredibly sensitive and perfect timing. <br /> <br /> If you are feeling beauty, nature and art ... don't forget this fantastic movie!
