This is a movie everyone should look at. In addition to raising huge points (although South Africa has many similar situations on the road to recovery), it is perfectly targeted, while Denzel Washington, in my opinion, is the best in his career. Kline also gives a good result, though not as stunning as Washington. John Thaw is also making a good move to the police chief. <br /> <br /> There are so many ways in which apartheid film could fall, but they are all avoided. It would be easy to simply portray white people as bad and black people as good men, but Attenborough has not done so. Of course, there were some white characters that seemed evil in nature, like Captain Soweto's uprising, but adding extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film intolerably long. Some people complain about the length of the movie, but I think it needs two and a half hours to tell the whole story because it's really incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is Steve Biko's funeral. If the whole crowd starts to sing the South African hymn, it is probably one if not the most mobile scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie before, look at it. It may not be convenient to look at, but it is definitely worth it.
