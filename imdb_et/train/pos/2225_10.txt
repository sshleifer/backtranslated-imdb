I am totally shocked that this show was canceled.Ity lasted only one year.I recently started to watch it and I love it.It shows that could go as far as Friends went.It was humor and was very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> This is about 2 brothers and 2 sisters who live under one roof without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the oldest sister and plays more in the role of father. <br /> <br It should last much more than a year because it was fantastic. An amazing show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
