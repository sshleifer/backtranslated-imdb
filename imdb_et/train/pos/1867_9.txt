it is a movie about life, fighting accidents and wonders of the human spirit. I don't want to tear anyone at the end of the movie. It's more than just a tear-jerker, an interesting, thought-provoking drama that has great performances from all the pains, but especially Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years later I am surprised that Luke is still a virtual unknown and only one other film was directed by Washington. However, apart from slow accumulation, this is the story of the child's experiments and misery, and how it is affected by adulthood is a movie that will stay with you long after you have seen it. Like many fox photos, it was more like a bedtime blow and did not get the massive critical praise it deserves. The scene where Antwone finally meets his mother took a movie about me, there were so many options that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or could have been unrealistic, but Washington hit the right tone, mother never said a word and can only tear, while antowne just asked why. His overwhelming guilt prevented him from saying what he could say to defend himself? One of the most mobile cinematic scenes I've seen.
