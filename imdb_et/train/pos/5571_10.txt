After watching the "Whipped" distributor screening on AFM the second evening, I have to say that I had a profound impression. Audience laughed all the time. Unfortunately, every territory was already sold, so I had no opportunity to buy a movie, but I really believe it is a big blow both nationally and at sea. I agree with the comment that "whipped" should not be a man "Sex and City", mainly because, unlike "Sex and City", "Foamed" satire, which deals with dating, which does not take itself too seriously. "Whipping" amuses relationships so that most sex comedies don't dare. The AFM also featured more plot and storyline than "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and the City". "Whipped" has never beaten and gave the audience non-stop comedy. The productions by Amanda Peet and the rest were all hardened, making the film more impressive, taking into account the budget.
