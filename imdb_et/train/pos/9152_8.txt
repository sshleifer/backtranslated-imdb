This is a good movie of 99% duration. I feel the end ended with the higher praise of this film. <br /> <br /> This is being done in a rather naive way. This is clearly done to create a more cool feeling for the film - because of this shooting technique, the feeling of isolation will soon become apparent. <br /> <br /> The stigma has worked very well and presents especially "nuts" "called Joe. But healthy (normal) characters are a bit too pathetic for me - they should respond to such pity, but this is done a little bit. /> <br /> The film starts slowly (and the naive camera starts with the smell of B-film) and very usual, but soon comes the feeling of the impending brutality that is happening, which is one of the most complicated films of cold-hearted violence. br /> After a sudden and incredibly lazy end I was disappointed I would have given a movie 9 when the end ended with the rest of the movie, but it is only 7, which is stronger than the scenes of eeriness and nail brushing. give him the clock and excuse the end!
