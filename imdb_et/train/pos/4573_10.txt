Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he throws himself into every character he's playing to be real. <br /> <br /> I remember that many years ago our house had a party - friends came, we sat behind the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - good time. The TV was on - there was a movie we didn't turn. Then suddenly, we all stopped talking and smiled. The glasses didn't mix, the forks didn't move, the food was cold on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen when a young dirty man, whose whole body was against him and who had only control over his left foot, got a piece of chalk with his foot and what seemed forever was just trying to write one word on the floor. When he finished writing one word, we all knew we weren't witnessing one, but three triumphs - the triumph of the will and spirit of man, the triumph of the cinema, who was able to catch such a moment on the film, and the actor who didn't act, but who got him as a character, won. <br /> <br /> Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot" is a riveting, uneven bio-drama about Christy Brown, born with cerebral palsy. Dublin Slum; who became an artist and writer and who found the love of his life. <br /> <br /> I like Lewis performances every day (I have mixed feelings of confusion in GONY), but I believe his biggest role was "My Left Foot" by Christy Brown
