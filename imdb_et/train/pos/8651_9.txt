California came out in 1993 as if three of the four leading figures were up and coming to the level of celebrities they currently have in 2006. This is a nice psycho-thriller, which, for its dry and intelligent users, should turn all David Duchovny fans into narratives that will find their way into their work, like most of its X-files, God's playing and red shoe plans. People who were shot by Brad Pitt's heavy south accent and Juliette Lewis's characters have probably never spent much time in the south. Every "Brian and Carrie" in the southern part is "Adele and early", and in 2006, this exclusion is a flick. <br /> <br /> Besides, I think the film is written with the purpose of a cult film - like Carrie's photography, not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of it in your personal library, I think it says something that is cheerful to your taste.
