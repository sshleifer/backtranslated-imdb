This movie was great. It describes in detail the struggle against a committed detective, directed at the ignorant ignorance of Russia's corrupt communist regime in the 1980s. I'm giving this movie high marks for not keeping the forensic science of birth and development globally isolated (thanks to "Regime") community. This is a graphic film. It is excessive violence and is tragic. Nothing is "covered with candy" with superfluous blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality of the screen. This film is based on the Russian serialist Andrei Chikatilol. I know with a real story that I have a very deep evaluation of how they really kept the movie. It's not comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this film is black-and-white.
