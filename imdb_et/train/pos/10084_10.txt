This remarkable movie is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. It shows China, which I have never seen or imagined, and I believe it will show China in the 1930s in the most real light ever seen in the film. In so many situations, it is absolutely heart-breaking, seeing how hard life was for the characters, but the story and end are incredibly joyful. You really see the depth and height of human life in this film. The actors are all perfect, so you feel that you have actually entered another world. <br /> <br /> I just can't recommend this movie just enough. It can just change you forever if you have seen it.
