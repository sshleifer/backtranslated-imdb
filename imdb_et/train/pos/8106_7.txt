This movie is hard to see in the fast-paced culture of the 21st century, but it is worth it if the messages it conveys are mainly the consequences of the technology and its consequences for society, especially when used for warfare. /> <br /> This film is a complete cycle of dehumanization and rehabization, influenced by the emergence of technology and subsequent deconstruction of civilization, and so it is a deterrent to the abuse of technology, but when it comes to completion, familiar themes and feelings appear again to present rather self-serving than the self-destructive ways in which mankind can use technology. <br /> <br /> For this time, the quality of the picture and sound is great for some, but in the history, development and development of the Sci-fi genre, this black is a landmark. Finally, humankind once again brings free will and free choice as a means of controlling our own destiny, instead of being delivered by us or indeed by the society itself, shaped by the events of the world. <br /> <br /> Those who are discouraged by life sometimes have a tendency to remain so, but there is still hope and continuity as the film is. br /> <br /> Sci-fi is one of the greatest common demonizers of this genre, this speculative character. It asks us questions, what if these events happen and what would be the impact on society or its individuals? How do we respond? <br /> <br /> As far as impact is concerned, this film deals with those speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and keep us in touch with these important issues.
