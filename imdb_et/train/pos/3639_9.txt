This film is a family for me. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself but also for his family. I can't tell you how to tell my little girl that Dad is going to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and Kansas City Chiefs. He thought it was the coolest thing, like Morris's son. Living dreams with family are what it is. I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really understand what Jimmy Morris did.
