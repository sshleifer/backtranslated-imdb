I also saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was a great film about the family relationship between adults. Paul Reiser wrote the film and contained some similarities with his family. It was funny, warm, terrible and moving and fun. Such a film would work very well with oral comments. I would definitely say this to my friends and family. We only hope they have the opportunity. I would appreciate this movie as one of the best films I've seen during the year. It does not include violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so obviously distributors have questioned whether or not to get it. Believe me, there are people who would like to see a movie like the one that has redeemed the value, rather than the blockers of many typical large boxes that we usually give.
