I think this movie is a masterpiece, but it looked at least 4 times 5 times to see what a big movie was. First, he describes the face of WW2, which we usually don't see in Hollywood movies. Above all, more "humanized" German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are shown. One of the facts that most impressed me was the murder in the woods of the last 20s mentioned at the end of the film ... that the forest is where the last chapters of Alexanderplatz Berlin take place: these are forests where Reinhold kills Miez. One more clue for those who like it is the presentation of the doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with changing people every time they go behind the door or opening the door. Many doors are displayed on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their actions, etc. Have you noticed it?
