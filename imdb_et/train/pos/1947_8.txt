SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the end was a bit steep. I would have liked the crew to adapt to life after their return to earth. I think the writers saw this problem with "loading Voyager" on the ground sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, this timeline has been lost, so it's all controversial.) I liked how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager team. As fans, we get our cake and eat it when Janeway is so much sacrificing and living. I admit that the scenes of Janeway's and his parents' own conversations were strange and so easily overcome in the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) pulled it away.
