I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in 1994 and looked at it recently and it's still funny. I don't know if you have to understand hip hop in the 90s, but it helps when you do that. In the 90s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, the groups and members had left (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There were also banners, rappers who started the scene (Vanilla Ice, C&C Music Factor, Freedom Williams, etc.). This movie makes it all fun in a way that seems to be really a documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spends the year on the name of the fictitious rap group N.W. The members of the group are the Rusty Condieff / director, the tasty taste (Larry B Scott / Nerds revenge and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are coming rap groups whose politics make them controversial. that this is the imagination of the 80s hip-hop industry and that it is fun, but if you know the 80s / 90s oilseed rape, then you know how much it is true. a funny funny movie, and for all those who ask, Spinal Tap is the first, but Spinal Tap is not the first as well as the funny and in some ways better than the Spinal Tap. And the songs are out of the hook, excellent performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
