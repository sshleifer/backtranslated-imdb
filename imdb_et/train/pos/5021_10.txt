I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before I put it back. Bill Paxton hired some first-rate talent to make a good thrill with some interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both deliver good results. The story is spoken in an interesting way, so both setbacks are 20 years ago, then the spots in the current, alternating back and forth. This storytelling style makes a good thriller that doesn't get dull. Bill Paxton, please make more horror films, he has talent for that!
