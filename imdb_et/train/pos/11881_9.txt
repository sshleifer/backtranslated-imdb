Every big gangster has downstream human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, punishment, and despair from the "Scarface". This is the story of wild greed, corruption and power. The darker side of the "American dream". <br /> <br /> Anyone who complains about this "cheesy" movie is missing. Superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashion further increase the cruel criticism of this life. Nothing in the lives of these characters really means any human level. In fact, the film practically limits the ironic satire with all the gangsta rappers who were positively inspired by Tony Montana's lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This is not Brian DePalan's strongest staging power, it is sometimes excellent and well handled (especially the catchy finale), but often it drops sloppy and misleading. Fortunately, this is supported by a very strong Oliver Stone script (probably a good treatment for him, considering the coke habit he is doing at this time). The themes are consistent, focusing mainly on Tony Montana's life and the development of his character, when greedy and power consumed. Dialogue is also great, seeing a sense of humor and drama comfortably. There are many stagnant lines that have since arrived in one or another form of popular culture. <br /> <br /> Cast helps to do what it is, but it's really Pacino's movie. One of his less subtle performances (which is much more common nowadays), this is a world that is completely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as guarded as ever, in a very fun (and deliberately upward) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, which is probably one of the most imitated performances. Pfeiffer was striking and uncomfortable at first sight, but I have understood how he plays the part of an eternal little woman. Not an extraordinary effort, but an unfairly wrong assessment. Supporting players are also very good, especially Paul Shenar as Aavey Sosa. <br /> <br /> Powerful, sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking and constantly controversial. "Scarface" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever it means to you). An important and accessible gangster strike and a pop culture landmark. 9/10
