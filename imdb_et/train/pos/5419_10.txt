It's ripnorting, old-fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that, according to today's political standards, the treatment of the Indians was unacceptable. But it does not move from politics. It is about action, dialogue, comradery, acting, direction, music and photography, and it's wonderful for all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are electric and Jaffe is great. This is the ultimate friend movie.
