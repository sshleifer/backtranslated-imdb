Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture that is not easy to forget. Al Pacino is strikingly revealing the Cuban refugee Tony Montana as becoming a powerful drug player in the world as he runs the kingdom of self-esteemed crime in Florida. This gangster flick is harsh, violent, picky, harsh, unpleasant, and must record the word "f - k" most often. Almost three hours, and yes, it can be repulsive. Stout's cordial constitution keeps you in your seat, rejoicing at the death of a ruthless criminal master. Also interesting are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastranton, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino is one of the biggest in its generation. He can bring reality to his character, which leaves a strong impression. This is not a movie for anyone you think you think you went away from the disaster. Is it powerful enough for you? The crime doesn't cost long!
