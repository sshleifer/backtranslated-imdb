Unknown Michelle Rodriguez when Diana was casting was a genius. He's perfect. His inexperienced inexperience actually works for him. We have never seen her so it seems to be her story. It also brings true strength. But it works against him because we never doubt him. You will never have to rejoice at him because he will never oppose any fighter whom we do not believe he will win. Just like a boxing film, it won't work. <br /> <br /> Then it's not really a poker movie. How to make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxer? You don't. But Karyn Kusama is anyway. Like many indie films, "Girlfight" is forbidden by classification or genre and stands independently as a folklore that can occur in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is doing bad at school. She wins people she doesn't like (all other girls in her school). She doesn't fit in. His father forces his child's brother Tiny to study in the box so he can protect himself when things are tough. He gives tiny to his boxing sessions and gives Diana something he does not need to defend, or something that would benefit his life. Tiny wants to go to an art school (clich√©, yuck) so he gives up his boxing support to Diana, who really wants a box. Things become complicated when Diana falls to another boxer, Adriani (Santiago Douglas), who wants a pro. That's where the story goes inevitably ... the two meet to fight for the title of amateurs. <br /> <br /> What I missed was that I couldn't find anything interesting about it. It's all just too plausible. Children living in harsh urban areas fall back on sports. Many professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The spiritual and physical toughness that this upbringing requires is like a boxing game where anger is your friend. So this time this girl. Great deal. <br /> <br /> Or there is another position: finally, a movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around for a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced by a discussion of human life and their feelings. The whole way of fighting is used as a platform to paint a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming responses. Self-discovery. I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example for the first time the director's great work. The dialogue never rises above the quality of the soap opera, but the story itself changed my opinion on some things. Yes, the world seems to be a better place. The film did it. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
