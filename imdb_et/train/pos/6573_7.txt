The film has a lot of gameplay from the beginning - I think it would make the film better because the set and dramatization make the film version a bit too artificial. But still, it happens quite well and the story and especially the dialogue are interesting. They have taken the dialogue in exactly the same way as the real game. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's games. <br /> <br /> The main character, Raina, is in the clouds of her head and has a dramatic look and Helena Bonham Carter is doing well here. His fianc√© Serges is a bit too comic when he really needs to have a very beautiful face. Her parents are fun enough.
