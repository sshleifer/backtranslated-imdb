Charming won't even describe "Preservation Grace"; it is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who participates in this movie leaves their spirits high (haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her problems are getting worse. His precious departure has left him money and outstanding debts. Faced with losing everyone, he has to find a way to get a lot of money ... fast! He gets an idea when his gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asks the city's famous gardener to give him advice on a secret growing plant. Grace immediately realizes that her plant is marijuana, so they decide to use their horticultural skills to grow a lot of top quality weeds and then sell it to pay off their debts. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable quality about "Saving Grace" is its probability. Every character is extremely sympathetic and the movie, except for the first 20 minutes, is endlessly happy. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means sticking to some illegal activity. <br /> <br /> Actress is top-notch. Brenda Blethyn is one of Britain's finest actors and here's the reason. He revolves around what could have been a caricature of a living and breathing person. She's a nice lady, but she's not stupid. Craig Ferguson is as pleasing as Matthew. He's a dead loser, but he's so happy that it's not important. The rest of the ensemble is also suitable for this category, but special attention should be paid to Tcheky Karyo. The French actress always has an aura that threatens her well, but she also has great comedy skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for "Grass Save". It's all about charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy looks out of the movie. Not so here. The film is very pleasant and always fun. This does not mean that "Saving Grace" is just a pleasant movie that leaves you with a smile and a good feeling. Although this film is not out and out of comedy, it has two or three scenes that are not hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the movie, the climax is a bit confusing. However, the questions are answered and the end is unexpected twisting. <br /> <br /> See "Grace Saving", especially if you have a bad day.
