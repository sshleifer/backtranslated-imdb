This movie is good. It's not the best CG kung fu flick, but it's pretty good. The first thing is that the story is actually good. The idea of ​​all gods and fallen gods dealing with superpowers is pretty cool. My problem is too many signs! It was very confusing when changing scenes! Special effects were POSSIBLE! Fighting scenes were very fast paced and challenging. This movie is virtually all the computer you create. Action is great, as always expected from such high-level players. Ekin Cheng makes a great character, lonely character. Zhang Ziyi didn't do anything about this movie. I thought he had a big part, but he did one stroke and a series of strokes. The bad guy, the whole skull and the whole blood cloud is very scary. Music is also great. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series and not just one movie. There's too much story in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the letters and details. This film sacrifices the integrity of action. I recommend Storm Riders every day.
