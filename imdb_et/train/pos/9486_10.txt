Finally, a thriller that leaves the car in ropes, explosions and other eye catching effects. The film combines a simple plot (attribution of the French President) with an excellent background. It takes a look at the behavior of the authorities with the authorities and explains why we would follow almost every order (even murder) that is given to us. <br /> <br /> It also shows us how the secret services can manipulate historically and how little they can be controlled. The best thing about this movie is that the classic "Hollywood End" cannot be simply predicted.
