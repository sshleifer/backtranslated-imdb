There have been recent surfing films that seem to get randomly without notice. During this week I got the treasure of this digital cable and what a pleasant surprise it was! The focus is on surfing the 60's Greg Noll's big wave to our current Laird Hamilton, from the Waimea Bay to the Mavericks' jaws. Hell, I can watch Laird Hamilton - one of the great athletes of this generation - so the rest is just in the sauce. A pleasant, relaxed and modest fashion mix of good surfing mixed with past and current surfing star interviews. Of all the surfing films I've seen, this story of the bigger wave works best and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
