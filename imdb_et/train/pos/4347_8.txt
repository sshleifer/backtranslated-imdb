I'm not moving too much into the plot of this movie because other reviewers have covered a lot of the same areas. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the movie very much. The only reason for watching the movie is just Peter Falk's performance. <br /> <br /> Most of the film's action is a small-scale ride with Falk & Paul Reiser up NY. . <br /> <br /> Very well written adult target audience. A lot of reality-based humor and some well-played drama make the film feel like it's your family. <br /> <br /> You can't really say enough about this movie, except that it's a shame shame that a cute movie like this won't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see Falki, who once again has a big, leading man-role and makes the most of it. This proves that John Casavettes, his famous friend and writer / director, was right in showing Falki in many 60s and 70s.
