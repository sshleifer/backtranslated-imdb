This show is awesome! I've been a fan because it has been for the first time, and it only keeps me looking ... I'm here to see the terrible things I would like it to be, but really shows you how addiction affects everyone, not just the addict. You'll see all the different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to a trade dependent or addicted addict. And really, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through. We've seen accomplished musicians, NBA players and even young people who need help. And since they have started to show some follow-up, it has also been fantastic. Now you can see how they are for a long time after their episode. If you haven't checked it, please do. It's A&E and it's awesome! New eps are on Sunday evening at 10:00 am EST, if I remember correctly ... so set your TiVo!
