If you are under the age of 13 or over 13 and are quite intoxicated, you will enjoy the D war. If you are a seriously committed fan of all kinds of nonsense movies, you will enjoy D War. Otherwise, don't worry! I saw this movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it and it made me feel good. After the movie ended, all the kids (my brothers and their friends) couldn't thank me for going to the theater. <br /> <br /> CG is good. Action and management are terrible. Storyline is extremely simple. But as half of the audience were kids, they shouted, shouted and rejoiced every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to bring your kids, but with the exception of the final battles, D-War is disappointing. I give this film 10 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much.
