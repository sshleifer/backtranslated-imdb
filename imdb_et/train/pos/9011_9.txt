I found this movie quite random, but I'm happy I did. Kenneth Branag's staging came to steal this film from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry made a much more enjoyable film. This movie reminded me of the great movies Branagh did with Emma Thompson. Carter's star is turning here because young women with disabilities who want to quit were so good as I have seen for a long time. Impressing a person with disabilities is difficult to pull out, but basically only his eyes to show his pain in his life situation made him so credible. If this film had come out after a wave of current movies with beautiful women who attacked themselves (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I was sure Carter would have taken the Oscar very hard. If you ran this movie through the cable late at night, trust me, it's worth the lost sleep.
