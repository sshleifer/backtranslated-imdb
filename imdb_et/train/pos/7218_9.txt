Deathtrap works like a play in a movie that did what it is because it takes place mainly in one set. It is a prerequisite that the playwright whose star falls will receive the exemplary manuscript of a former student, and so he will take his defense and his game, his wife's (loud) protests. Or so you think the first half of the movie. Deathtrap begins to go halfway to the throbbing of the twists and surprises, which in turn changes this assumption on the head, then right and then crazy spin, keeping the headline all the time. This is a great mystery film that has seized. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, an older playwright, plays himself in this movie - a bit natural and very dramatic with Brit. There are no surprises here - he does his usual good job. He gets the best Deathtrap line he perfectly fulfills: "What is the definition of your success, being a gang-banged in a state prison?" <br /> <br /> But Christopher Reeve transforms comedy and drama into a surprisingly strong performance playing an ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He also gets his very toned body, which he needs to keep from Superman films. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve have collaborated on another movie, one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It also revolves around games, although this time Caine is director and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate accidents that play in the choice of bed and crew. On the surface it seems that the film is mostly sliding, but when you look at it, you see that they are a lot of fine jokes that require more than one viewing. I want this underrated movie to be available on DVD.
