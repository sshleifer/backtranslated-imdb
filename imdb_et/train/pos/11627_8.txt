Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and he gets a flight to Miami. Next to the sitting, he comes to an assassination named Jackson, who tells him that he needs to change his family or his father dies. The reason he needs to change space is because Jackson wants to let that air. <br /> <br /> This is a great stop movie because Lisa is trying to escape in many ways what Jackson has created. The whole story is great and I thought they could have spent more time on the plane. There may be more on the platform, but besides, the whole movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> This was especially the end because it was a cardiac arrest. I didn't know what was going on and I was surprised. For me, this movie just went off.
