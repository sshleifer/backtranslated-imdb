John Waters has made the most robust, heartfelt, darkest, personal, small film that I think I've ever seen (maybe Fast Food Fast Women ranks second) Directors' vision is unpainted ... narrative is vivid, characters are personal and strange reflections about the family and his own inner life ... the tone is never forced or stylistically over the arc. <br /> <br /> There is no pretentious shooting, no hit or magazine evaluation ... Martha Plimpton is amazing because the sister .. Eddie furlong is inspired by pain. Grandma, who speaks to Mary, a pack of tea, recycled clothes, yesterday's garbage becomes contemporary art - and the film's lesson is that the most important thing we can value is family ... and humble life.
