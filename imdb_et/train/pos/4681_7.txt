In general, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to indie lovers. <br /> <br /> But I really want to point out similarities to parts of this movie and Nichols. One scene where Adrian Grenier's character in Rosario Dawson's interviews about his sexual life is far away is very similar to the Closer scenario, where Clive Owen's character asks Julia Roberts, although it is less harsh and intense in "Love". Also note that Anna is the name of both Dawson and Robert. There can be no coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's game and supposedly this film is based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Rigen", so I'm not sure how that connection was made. <br /> <br /> Everyone has an idea?
