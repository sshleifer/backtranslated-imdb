I saw The Saint Strikes for the first time and found it pretty good. It was George Sanders' first appearance in place of Saint, where he replaced Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> This is where the saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate shooting at a nightclub. With the help of his familiar inspector Fernack, who has come down from New York, they are helping the daughter of the offender. <br /> <br /> The joints of the moldings are cast by Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> Not bad Holy movie. It's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
