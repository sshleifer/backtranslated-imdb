George and Kim travel with their son Miles to a distant cabin in New York when their car hits a deer and swells. But what seems to be just a misfortune is the start of a frightening journey where myth becomes a reality and eating meat is a spirit, a half-life and a half-man Wendigo, haunted by a small town ... Larry Fessenden's "Wendigo" is a thought-provoking horror movie that is often a delicate family drama. The characters are well-developed and have some bone-cooling moments. Wendigo's subtle glances are dealt with effectively and it is never clear what is real and what is being portrayed, or even if the story is entirely in Miles's head. "Wendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and certainly not the last one. Give this movie a chance if you don't mind anything unusual.8 from 10.
