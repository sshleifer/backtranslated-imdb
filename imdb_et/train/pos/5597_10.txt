"Le Locataire" ("Tenant") is undoubtedly one of the most important fear films ever made.Polanski celebrates Trelkovsky, who is a terrible file adviser in Paris, who responds to the advertisement of the apartment to find only that the previous tenant tried to suicide by jumping from the apartment window.Relkovski is forced to visit him and he meets with Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trkkovski moves as soon as the previous tenant dies and at first is satisfied with finding such a nice apartment. His happiness will soon be replaced by the waves of Paranoia because he is becoming more and more suspicious of his neighbors who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat his previous tenant suicide. This film is great. Polanski is able to create an atmosphere of surreal fear and paranoia. Wonder great moments, such as the classic scene, where Trelkovsky discovers the hole of the previous tenant's tooth wall, or the dream of a fever where he travels to the building Sven Nykvist's photography is truly beautiful. "Tenant" is a neglected pearl. It can be difficult to follow, but it's more than a hassle.
