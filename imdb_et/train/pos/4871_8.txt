Knowledge of Serbia and at least the Balkans is necessary to understand and enjoy the situations, signs and jokes of Zavet and many other Kusturica films. See, for example, the opening scenes with the low technological equipment in the village of Serbian villages that protect the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of communist rule, and the young brother looks at his naked teacher at the sounds of the Soviet anthem. Kusturica not only tries to leave the tragic history of Serbia described in its earlier films, but creates the whole world in the process. <br /> <br /> This is neither a political film nor a clear political film in any case. It's a fun movie before everyone. Kusturica creates a number of signs we care about. Music plays an active role in this film as in all other films. His style is direct and grotesque, now what he knows about his character and we know he wants us to feel the same. The space he currently represents, history and magic, and colors seem to be a contemporary cinema from Douanier Rousseau. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie either. The main mistake is length, some edits and shortcuts would have been useful because sometimes it seems that the director has run out of ideas and repetitions appear. This is one of the most catching, fun and moving movies I've seen lately.
