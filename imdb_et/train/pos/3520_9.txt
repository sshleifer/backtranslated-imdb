This is the "B series" movie Noir and my voice reflects its membership in this genre. I saw this movie last night at the left cinema in Paris, where he opened a two-week movie noir. The film has some drawbacks, yes, but too many delicious elements to ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer said, the drum scene is incredible! (B-movies can go where A-films were forbidden to enter!) And the plot is intriguing. As for Franchot Tone, I ask you to disagree: for me it is suitably mysterious; just the right scary scary. It should be remembered that there is some German expressionism here (director Robert Siodmark was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), which makes it all too exaggerated. At least that's for me. <br /> <br /> But this is great for Ella Raines, who only kept this viewer in her third-credited performance. On Friday, girls who have a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, it is a miracle that she did not become a household name. But he's so good here that I just ordered one more movie ("Impact") from the Internet and I can't wait for it.
