MacArthur begins and ends with General Douglas MacArthur Gregory Peck, Alma Mata, US Military Academy, West Point, Hudson. We are seeing a weak 82-year-old Gen.MacArthur, who ended his speech in 1962, the honor of serving his country. The film then goes into almost two hours of rebound in the great and controversial career of Gen MacArthur, beginning in the darker hours of World War II on the delineated Corregidor Island in the Philippines in early spring 1942. He said he was leaving the island to Australia before the Japanese army invaded General MacArthur for the first time in his military career, almost no direct order from his superior US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihylt. Feeling that he was giving up his men during his greatest need, MacArthur reluctantly did with his wife and son what he had just said to haunt him to remind him of wars. It is for this reason that he drove a fire or imprisonment by Japan, which was driven by General MacArthur to use all his influence to get the FDR two years later to launch a major invasion of the island of Formosa on the island of Philippines. back up your promise to both the Philippine people and thousands of US POWS. That she returns and returns with the US Army and Navy's ability to back up her promise! <br /> <br /> Within two years until the Philippine Islands invasion gen. South Pafific in several superbly created island hopla battles that isolated and hungered hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops for surrender. The General made much less of US military losses, then all other Allied troops in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> It was in the 1950/51 Korean War that General MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory and his worst military victory. After the advanced North Korean army's brilliant and perfectly executed soldiers, with the invading US Navy suffering less than 100 victims, the back door or the left-hooked invasion of Inchon's General MacArther, the US and UN troops sent the troops under him at the very Communist Red China border River Yalu. He told his subordinates that he was facing a massive attack on Communist Chinese forces by General MacArthur until this attack made US and UN troops cut. The unstoppable wave after the wave of the Chinese Red Army attack forced US / UN troops to live with the Big Bug Out of 1950, leaving all their equipment along the entire North Korean border, even abandoning South Korea's capital Seoul! It turned out to be one of the biggest military catastrophes in US history when US soldiers lost their record in the Korean War, on the first day of the first 1000 days of life in November. 29/30 1950 - Communist Chinese invasion! <br /> <br /> MacArthur went to attack and lowered what he promised, mainly because of his arrogance. only his own commander and commander. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, does not have the spin or the courage to do what to do: Introduce a full-scale invasion of nuclear weapons with Communist China to prevent its troops from crossing the Korean Peninsula! Pres for. Truman, who had taken almost enough garbage from his home in MacArthur to get out of his mouth, how he did not go wrong with his war, as MacArthur wanted, was his last shoulder against the red Chinese! April 11, 1951, Pres. Truman unintentionally released General MacArthur from his commanding US and UN Commander in Korea! Pres. Truman's bold but very unpopular decision, which did not go with MacArthur's complete war strategy, ruled out the Third World War to break the Soviet-Communist Chinese ally who, like the US, was a atom bomb! Pres. Truman's controversial decision to appeal to the very popular Lieutenant General MacArthur also paid him for his re-election in 1952, when his number of polls was so low - in the mid-20th century - that he returned from the US presidential campaign in March this year In general, General MacArthur was in trouble when the world political and military climate change changed in the behavior of future wars. Now that the horrors of the nuclear war were in 1950/51, reality would have been a national suicide when it wanted, like General MacArthur, against the Red China, because it was very likely to touch the nuclear Holocaust, which is not only the USSR and the Red China, but the whole world. ! It was this reality of the future war that had never been taught to General MacArthur because the A and H bombs were not yet invented at West Point. <br /> <br /> Back in 1962, we now see that Gen. MacArthur had become an older and smarter soldier after he had finished speaking at West Point, and after he had retired from the US military, he was a senior statesman who knew war and its total nullity. One of the things that General MacArthur was taught at an early age, from the head of his civil war, Douglas MacArthur Sri, who had been stuck in his entire life, was that a soldier, like himself, would be a war, not the first resort between peoples. There are soldiers who have to fight and die in it. With the emergence of a nuclear arena, it took a lifetime for General MacArthur to finally realize how true and wise his father's Congress Prize winner, as himself, was!
