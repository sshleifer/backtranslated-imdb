It was the first "Walking Tall" movie I saw, I think the $ 2 cinema is Hollywood Blvd. , so I had no reference to Joe Don Baker's first part. I remember being shocked by McNairy County's corrupted system and the redneck gangside cruelty. I was also surprised that one man decided he wouldn't let it slip and went out to do something. Dare? I thought it was - up to the point where it sent my backbone up. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a great story of America's courage to stand up and do something for a system that is only in its own interest. I was pretty blown about it and I think it's still one of the best hero / hero genre movies that can laugh, but that includes the latest movies like "The Punisher", but even more so it's a true story. The recent remake of "Rock" starring does not make Buford Pusser's story real justice. <br /> <br /> "Classic", which I'm sure will come up again in the future.
