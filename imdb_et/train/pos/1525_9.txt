Having recently seen Peter O'Toole's version, I was ready to write this version wisely. It takes little time to fight what I prefer. Instead, we show us all the many motives that are both French and English (who held Normandy) politicians and priests who put him to death. Even their worst hypocrite, Archbishop, leaves us thinking that "Of course he was innocent. The innocent have always had to suffer from violent ambitions. He didn't know what he was saying, no clue about the consequences of blasphemy, or being opposed to the church; "What is the state of the church in such matters." <br /> <br /> Preminger was true to the myths surrounding his death, and I appreciated the preview of the tape that showed the flames reaching and burning. Why? They used gas sprays in the film and two of them stopped. the air pressure blew out of the stop and the flames jumped toward him. Fortunately, they did not have to repeat the fire because it was SO real: he was burnt! Pretty traumatic introduction to my new career in Iowa's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud excelled He is an English politician who organizes the exhibition, and he also points out that if you understand someone, you will not You may want to dwindle on them next time. You can shrink from your "duty" next time ... not that such delicacies disturb the soul of our future president. We Christians, even the most anti-Semitic people, have no problems with the return of the old testament to the death penalty, even though the words of Jesus were. Bring public executions like this little girl. The smell of burnt meat can bring us respectable people to the minds of our souls. <br /> <br /> The only small choice I have about this movie is that we have not shown why the priest, who was so excited about his burning, is so suddenly so embarrassed that even madness. His character, more dialogue, should have been expanded more - as suddenly "reaching your senses" does not make sense. <br /> <br /> And does Graham Greene do it deliberately or not? Joan is such a confident little structure, you are almost, but not quite, happy to see you come. And when he took off his life in prison, for some reason I was thinking of the poet Anne Sexton, who accused Sylvia Plath of stealing her death when she committed suicide ... knowing that such action would ensure death. You have to wonder! <br /> <br /> If you ever had a good example of an obsessive mindset and a logical section, this is one. That is, Joan should have become Buddhist and silent "voices in his mind."
