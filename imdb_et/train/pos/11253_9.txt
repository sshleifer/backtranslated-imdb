This is an extremely long film, which means that before it becomes interesting it can be very boring, but its length gives its characters the opportunity to find a lasting affirmation in your sympathies. <br /> <br /> You reluctantly find it in the heart because it is a story that finds its heroes between evil and weak. If you can love a monster, Magnus Pym, a spy, who puts everything - especially his country, his friends and family - on a man who has been manipulated and shaped by the same people from childhood. The whole story is not one really pleasant character, not one loyal, "moral" personality with whom. But looking at the whole thing without the help of tissue would be quite remarkable. <br /> <br /> I finally enjoyed it. It is worthy of people who like filmmakers about the character of baser.
