79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers never did anything other than great movies. Although it is not one of their best, it is a great musical. Randolph Scott has a couple of outstanding musical numbers, good support. Two remarkable performances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, make for a memorable early screen performance. The ball is especially good and blonde. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best music duo ever. Harriet Hilliard, better to know if Harriet Nelson "Ozzie and Harriet" plays Ginger Roger's sister. The basic piece is quite familiar, but it's extraordinary. Excellent art direction and score.
