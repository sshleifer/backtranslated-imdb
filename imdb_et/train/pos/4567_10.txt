My left leg is an epic outstanding film that explains the brain and time that were cerebral paralysis, heavy trees, and had only the use of his left foot, but he was disgusting, he managed to become an artist and writer with all the odds against him. /> I've seen this movie many times, and every time I see it, I find it to be just as brilliant every time. I don't know how this amazing movie won't win the Oscars for the best picture? is the number of academies awards. Jim Shirdan is one of the world's greatest directors. The scenario, music and everything else is great in this movie. When the movie goes on, you will feel almost brown in the household when everything happens. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing when Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw are equally brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in his opponent's battle. br /> <br /> The Irish film industry had marked its name before my left foot. My left foot was the beginning of an excellent period for the Irish film. so powerful and brilliant films, like a square, a game of play, a father's name and Michael Collins, followed my left foot. these Irish films were held so high for the world and they were nominated for several oscers and won some excellent Irish film period. My left leg is a powerful prominent film. <br /> <br /> Daniel's day-lewis is playing as well and as brilliantly as struck by Christy Brown, and the same goes for Hugh o Conner, who plays young Christy. these two performances are the two best performances of the film, especially Daniel's Day-Lewis performance, which I had to do in the same way as Antony Hopkins lamb's silence. During his career, Daniel day-lewis has proven to be a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie masterpiece, look at it!
