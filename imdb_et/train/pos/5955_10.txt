As a creator of "this darkness", I admit that we did not forget 3 very important acknowledgments in our final credit. The shortcomings were the surpluses that could not be corrected when the participants --- who saw the film - did not mention it. For the excellent cast and the team, I apologize to them. Obviously, some of the criticisms that have been made here are difficult given their credit inadvertently. The values ​​of our production were insignificant and our "special effects" were pretty special, but the plot is very strong and John McLeod's cinematic art is great. We hope that you, the reader, will enjoy "this darkness" and their efforts to free your butts. Thank you, Director Dylan O'Leary.
