I'm glad to see this movie that saw some of the director's other films in the past. I thought the output values ​​were great like costumes and bridge settings. It was interesting to see how the mind and the demons were treated. <br /> <br /> I agree with some other comments about fighting scenes. It was difficult to follow them from time to time. <br /> <br /> Finally, there was a moral story. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers thought about the movie. This is a film I would like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes, such as those where Benkai and Prince fought on a "psychic" level, were well done. <br /> <br /> I came up with a cinema to think about what happened here. Strong.
