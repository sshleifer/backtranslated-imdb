A book that follows the story of making a movie is never a good idea. When people read a book, they automatically start making their "spiritual film" about who the characters look at, what places they have, how things are developing. And everybody's mind-opus is different, so when the "REAL" movie finally comes out, you always have a coded audience who is disappointed that it just doesn't measure <br /> <br /> All scriptwriters and directors can hope they are achievable, regardless of their own vision of the film, and I hope it is as close as their audience expects. <br /> <br /> There is no better chance than this is for movies based on Stephen King's novels. If filmmakers are at least in the nature of their stories, the results may be breathtaking and truly frightening (CARRIE, SALEM LOT, DEAD ZONE), or it may be what fans consider gawd-terrible (Kubrick's version of THE). TOMMYKNOCKERS Mini Equipment). <br /> <br /> Although not even close to perfect king customization, PET SEMATARY has so much skin and bone-deep restlessness that seemed to be on the screen directly from the book that you could quite forgive your shortcomings. To thank you, we have Mary Lambert, director of the music video-director-film (she also directed SIESTA, not just the horror film, but the other hell of hell has to see you put on your list). "Man-ster" itself and probably one of his best scenarios. <br /> <br /> Since most of you know this story, I won't put you in too much detail. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family to the perfect country. Well, almost perfect, except for two unpleasant little details: a dangerously occupied transnational road section and large pet cemeteries in the woods. Because Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler son ... well, even if you haven't read the book, do frickin 'math. After all, it is a royal story, so there's no mystery where it happens. <br /> <br /> It's not so much a destination that counts here, but a terrible stop along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar with the book are sent here, the inducing life screaming here: the terrible memory of Rachel Creed (STAR ​​TREK's Denise Crosby) for her sick sick sister; Louis meets deadly injured yogurt with Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) both before and after his death; trip to "other" cemeteries outside the pet cemetery. And this third act ... if it doesn't give you some nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse. <br /> <br /> Everything here, especially late by Fred Gwynne as a good-willed neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in the story that will take it together: "Sometimes it's dead better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the film version is the casting of Gage (Miko Hughes) of Louis's son. Lambert and the team knew that the child who needed to get the job needed for the job would be impossible for Lamnek and the crew, but unfortunately Hughes was "too hard to sell" at that time the "intolerant" demon conquered zombie . It will take you out of the movie when it appears, although the scenes where it is highlighted are still masterfully staged (especially the scene of Gwynne's death.) <br /> <br /> Moreover, everything else is as good as it can. CARRIE still has the best king adaptation as much as I am concerned; but SEMATARIA is up there. <br /> <br /> Still, is something custom-screened by King's Book just as terrible as reading a story? Not BLOODY is likely ... right now.
