Critics didn't like this movie. It was bombarded in the countries and therefore only limited in the UK. What was a great shame because it represented British rather than American humor and should have been presented in Britain. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman sees stunning and is absolutely convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin's "The Graduate" Dustin Hoffman's character and "birthday girl" have at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of this 1960s classic (despite being a completely different story). <br /> <br /> Of course, it makes the link many times from comedy to black comedy for thriller adventure - but it's a memorable, moving and fresh breath of air compared to blocking the average mega-budget. <br /> <br /> See this open thinking!
