I saw this movie for the first time at a Sunday film festival and I was a teenager myself that I found the movie quite attractive. these kids are a normal and very unexpected to be in this nature movie, but with better dialogue and spam, they made the film a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more than others, but I recommend that you release and watch this movie. it is a confusing desperate comment and a fun reality. capturing the essence of high school, the high school record has added to my favorites list, and hopefully he has the opportunity to shoot in theaters. I really thank all the children who made the hard work of making this movie, it helped me to shout out my laugh at our eyes.
