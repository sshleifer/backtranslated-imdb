When I first saw it, I didn't laugh too much. At that time, I was only fifteen years old and thought maybe some deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at that time. I had the same reaction when I saw it a couple of months ago, and this time because Felix's interrupted suicide attempt at the beginning of the film darkened the film a little. This scene made some things that Oscar said and made Felix later in a movie that seems unnecessarily cruel and their personality clashes were not as fun as they might have been. If I haven't already known this story, I would be worried that some Oscar fixes on Felix might push him. As it was, it didn't make me laugh or smile as it was shown on television with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. All in all, this is a pretty good movie and it made one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10
