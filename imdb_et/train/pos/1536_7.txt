The tighter the drama, the better the sister competition movie! This little legacy was mainly promoted as a comedy in the liberation of Sweden, so I'm glad it wasn't the case. Funny bits of small towns are definitely there, but drama is central to the story. And not just the family drama, it also raises extraordinary questions about respecting the differences in population lifestyle choices. <br /> <br /> A great character ensemble with lots of great and moving dramatic scenes that give credibility to points; and they're not just bursting, they're all in place. It just makes me assume that if Ingmar Bergman had done it (drama would suit him!), International attention would probably have been immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Ozjeppe.
