A historical drama and age story that includes colorful free people before the war in New Orleans. Starts slowly but starts steam when you have mastered the main characters and the real action can begin. This is not just a story of the exploitation of black women because they were free people. They may not have all the white rights, but they certainly had more control over their fate than their ancestors. Young men and women of this story must make their own choices on how to live their lives, whether to give the system shame or to live on optimism and to contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
