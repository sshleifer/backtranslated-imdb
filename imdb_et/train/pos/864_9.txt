Definitely a ten-year French film, a tight, atmospheric thriller, taking full advantage of the obstruction of hearing guides in order to rarely use the sound in the cinema. Emannuelle Devos gives you truly stunning, versatile, sometimes frightening and manipulative, other times open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who value high quality cinema should keep their eyes open for open bids from France.
