I thought this movie was really great because in India cinemas today are everything you see, skin, music and bad behavior ... in this movie, you see some traditions, ethnic origin and at least some decency ... though some parts were a little dramatic, guess what? this is what the Indian movie is! After watching this movie, at least the headache from all loud overvalued music or violence, but just the truth, it teaches love and of course, taking care of what you love all your life ... I think it was an amazing movie ... undoubtedly, it will be seen and the adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be India's firm depth ... until all these rap-shocks, mini-pants and the display of the skin became part of it.
