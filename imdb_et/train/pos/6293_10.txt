Buster absolutely stands out in this episode, the only vehicle I've seen at the end of my career, which allowed him to do a physical (and silent!) Comedy that made him famous. It's still a shock to hear your speech in voice - her voice is the only thing I don't care about Buster, but her ability to practice is still amazing. He even repeats some of his early double-rolled gags with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest thanks to Rod Serling for introducing us to this episode and giving Buster a full range of geniuses. He didn't have much time (one episode) to do it, but it is a respect for Hollywood's greatest genius.
