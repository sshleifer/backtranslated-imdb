The first two sequences of this film were settled by two conflicts: - the conflict between military Todd and his suppressed humanity and the physical conflict between Todd and his biotechnological substitution. Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways. <br /> <br /> The peoples scenario stops somewhat by solving the first of these arches halfway through the film, which means that the other side is a bit more than a simple action. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the defendants are the creators of the heart, and even a little soul, and especially Kurt Russell, a piece of genre that transmits a lot of little. <br /> <br /> Not a great movie, but it's worth it.
