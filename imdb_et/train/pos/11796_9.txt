Given that it is based on today's most notorious mass suicide, it would have been enough to give this 2-part film to the 1980 television. But it is true that it is a great Jim Jones life who built the church into a virtual empire, and then encouraged him to fall into a poor cult where murdered Congress and his companion, and 917 cult followers committed suicide when they watered Kool-Aid with cyanide . <br /> <br /> Made very tasteful, but terribly awful, unlike the scary sadistic offender, GUYANA TRAGEDY has all the stars, including Ned Beatty (like Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But this is Powers Boothe (in his first big role) that really stands out Jim Jones. He STARTS a man, and his performance is riveting and chilling. So it is no wonder that this film can pay attention to over 20 years.
