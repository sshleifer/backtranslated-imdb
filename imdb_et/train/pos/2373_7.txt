The new film "H G Wells' World of War" by Pendragon Pictures is the first faithful adaptation of the original novel that has been around for 5 years. Theatrical release was scheduled for this year (March 2005), but it never happened. The DVD went out to coincide with the Spielberg version, which will hit the theater on June 29th. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie with some reservations. <br /> <br /> How plausible is adaptation? It's not 100% loyal to Wells's book, but 90-95% loyal is good enough for me. At least several scenes were brand new, such as Ogilvy's astronomers' confrontation with a farmer and an indescribable writer / narrator who had an uncomfortable path with a cousin. But this movie follows the book very accurately - definitely much more than George Pal's classic 1953 version. <br /> <br /> Its biggest fault is that it was obviously made with a very cheap budget. Most of them seem to have shot with a blue screen and composed of digitally modified backgrounds. This is particularly irritating during most of the imagery and overcrowded city streets scenes. 1898 \ tLondon reviews see something out of the video game. There were numerous scenes in horse-drawn vehicles - I think they couldn't rent a horse. The only scene that has been shown for "real" is the ones that are open to fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within these budget constraints they managed to do a lot. Artificially, the film looks right. Mars and their tripods are quite well done and very well described by Wells. Especially impressed by heat radiation. Although the Thunder Child order, which should have been one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. It's a great shame that they can't afford more real sets or better quality animation. <br /> <br /> Operation and direction do not win Oscare. Mostly they are competent, not bad, but not prominent. The music is pretty good, though not with any of the major Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I am really glad that it didn't get a theater show because the budget limit would have made it look much worse on a big screen. As of now, I would appreciate this in a similar way to the classic BBC-TV customization. <br /> <br /> Some tricks: Most scenes are played with different colored filters (mostly red). It may be an artistic choice, but it is used in a very inconsistent manner and seems to be a sloppy job of acquiring DVDs. And the writer / narrator obviously fake mustache mutates from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line - Is It Worth It? If you can ignore the technical and budgetary constraints and get into the story, I think you will enjoy it, especially if you have actually read the original H G Wells novel. If, however, you have easily set off your cheap product values, it would be better (if you are not a MST3K fan). Be warned, however, that the movie will last for 3 hours, so I don't recommend watching it all in one session. <br /> <br /> BTW: A completely different version of the effects of the world (called "INVASION")) appeared on the DVD the same month that Spielberg hit the theater: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. It was also done on the budget, but it is still being upgraded as Spielberg's movie - but it is much better! Jeff Wayne makes his animated film his best-selling album since 1978, but it doesn't come out until 2007.
