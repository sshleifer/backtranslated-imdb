This is the time when Gunga Din appears on the DVD. I can't say exactly how many times I've watched this fine film, but I've never tireed it. Leading actors worked so well. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I just can't get over my exploitation in India. Your first glimpse of Sergeant's three is when you see that they are dealing with other soldiers fighting through the so-called treasure card. These three sergeants are sent to the expedition to find out what happened to the wiring when they enter most of the abandoned city, or they think. <br /> <br /> They will do the necessary repairs and will soon find some people "hiding. Soon after they have been attacked by crazy groups and barely escape. <br /> <br /> Later they will be sent to another mission, which will give Sgt Cutter the chance to go for gold with Din. They will find the golden temple and are evil by the supporters of Kali. Din will be sent to find help and Cutter will be closed. McChesney and Ballentine will soon arrive with Din and they are too caught. <br /> <br / > When they die, they look helpless when their regiment comes to their rescue. Criminals look and wait for their surprise attack when the wounded Din climbs on the golden dome and blows on his bug, which then warns the British lurking. <br /> Soldiers are attacking the evil and are about to hit them.
