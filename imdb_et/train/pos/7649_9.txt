Entertaining Jim Belushi's vehicle, it's a wonderful life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel who lets Belush see what life would have been if he had "made it big". Jim has the best, good story and support; it seems to be a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar competitor but fun with a good warm heart.
