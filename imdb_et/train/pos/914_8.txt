Vivah is not classic. Nonetheless, during the hard times, the special effects of the journey and the complex parcels (none of which Bollywood has yet learned), it is quite refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story, as we all know, is a trip from the first few meetings to their possible weddings after some time out and testing time. Something more, not less. The music is not in the same league as MPC or CAS, but it does not know its senses. For me, there were two songs - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. Milano abhi aadha & Hamaari shade were hummable. Shahid sincerely fills & shows a lot of potential. Its good to see him play something other than "cool guy" he usually does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a obedient little town girl. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas have terrible support, and the rest does reasonable work. The direction of the Suraj is simple but effective. The main mistake of the movie is the slow pace that can try the patience of many young viewers. All in all, there is a good, clean and decent family film.
