Adam Jones has a great sense of humor. I didn't like this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully photographed. Adam does an excellent job, not only by developing the main signs, but also by the smaller signs. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to every low budget movie. That you don't have to spend a lot to create something worth watching. Everyone likes something. If you have a terrible roommate. if you've ever cleaned up in high school. if you have ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have a sense of humor at all, you love this movie. This is a film that has been around for a long time and repeats itself when Adam gives himself a bigger name. I'm looking forward to Adami's future projects.
