I remember it on television at the end of the 70s - and it stayed with me! It's charming, pick, colorful - a great children's movie. Recently, I put on a party with some friends - and of course they thought I was crazy and waiting for the dolls to get sick that la "Meet the feebles" But no - its healthy clean fun. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is a fine form, like Mama Cass, and somehow an attractive nervous poo. <br /> <br /> If you like the banana cracking and you're in your 30s, this will create this surreal childhood on Saturday morning Grab and Escape! High Quality TV Movie - If You're Like Me, Metal Death - You Love It!
