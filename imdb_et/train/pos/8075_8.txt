I have decided not to believe what famous film critics say. Although this movie didn't get the best comments, this movie made my day. It made me think. What the wrong world is. <br /> <br /> What you do when your loved ones are cheated. It has been said that no matter how often you feed a milk snake, it can never be loyal and bite when giving the opportunity. Similarly, some people are never thankful. This film talks about how selfish people can be and how everyone ultimately thinks for themselves and works for themselves. <br /> <br /> Brother dies accidentally in a gangster. The surviving brother decides to get hold of. Through this process, we learn about the nonsense of this world. Nothing is real and nobody is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave her life. The new actor Aryan gave a good result. The actor stole an actor who played Amitabh's wife. His role was small, but he played his role so diligently that he was moved by his performance. Chawla had a very big facial expression, but his role was very limited and he was not given the opportunity to express himself fully. <br /> <br /> Raj Kumar Santoshi's great movie. His films always give the audience a certain message. His films are like Nanak Singh's novels (a Punjabi writer whose novels always had a goal and social evil) because they had a real message to the audience. They are both fun and lessons.
