Gere and Danes have two employees in the Public Security Department who are following the released sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, refers to them as his flock. Gere is the arrogant obsessed vigilant to whom he escapes. He's a training, a new comer, Allison, who takes over his job. Gere sees the very sick, disturbed puppies of her flock. He asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve the crimes. He keeps a warning about this behavior and has been replaced. In the last few days, a young girl disappeared at work and Babbage is confident that this is one of her shepherds who is wrong. He and Allison narrow down the list and discover that some criminals have gone to AWOL. So he decides he's gonna watch the missing girl rather than help the police. This part is a little farther away. <br /> <br /> There are some sick, twisted things in this movie. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building, where a lot of people bother each other. There are also people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the movie we see what sick freaks they are. But I wouldn't call this movie too big because the movie doesn't really show much.
