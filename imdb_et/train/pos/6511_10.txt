Like many others, I grew up with Scooby-Doog. Unlike many who did, I love this example! I think it's very well done and well thought out. All of this marks it as a spin-off that doesn't have to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it is a parody with other cartoons, where one bad boy tries to get a good man. Using the well-known Shaggy and Scooby-Doo symbols, it is much easier for the viewer to get involved with the humor of every 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> Scooby-Doo's spin-off has always been who's annoyed by fans. The classic is the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts from the 80s. These spin-offs had their own place: they promised to sell new content, created new fans and kept Scooby-Doo on the shelves. I agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue!" it is not suited to its traditional role, but it is probably what I always wanted to make Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy's short shorts: a packed exhibition that focuses on the best / funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the exhibition: animation, voices, attention to detail, bad guys, "best friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, constant humor! Bad Features: None, although the updated Mystery Machine is occasionally quite close. <br /> <br /> Well done Warner Bros. One of the smartest cartoons for a long time!
