Yes, this movie is predictable and certainly not a prize material. But then it doesn't try to be something that is not. Funny, funny funny funny liner, Peter O'Toole's star and very funny presentation, landing and getting to the ground from Joan Plowright. The band's performance was on the ground, everyone played their role skillfully and comically. The music was good, though not great, but filled the movie nicely. From some of the negative remarks I concluded that the nuances of some humor went over their heads. A good example is the comment "strange baseball game", well my dear American, it was a cricket - from what baseball has got - and explaining it to an unknown US band was very funny for those who know the cricket. Also, you didn't have to win when Carl broke the window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said, "Oh yeah!" to get more money to break up and the manager said at the same time "oh no", also referring to money. Jeez, it seems that every joke has to be explained to some people ... All-in-what I enjoyed and had big laughs! Worth a look.
