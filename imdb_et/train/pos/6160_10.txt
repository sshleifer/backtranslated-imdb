SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I just looked at the expanded version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I would like them to have left the original version of the DVD. It was too long and dragged along the film. Even though dancing is great, a DVD would have been much deleted as a deleted scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great movie. My 5-year-old loved it. And it's wonderful that the movies that kids love are passed on to the new generation. This and Mary Poppins will be added to my collection. <br /> <br /> As I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** out **** <br /> <br />
