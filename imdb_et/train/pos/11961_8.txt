I thought it was a great opportunity to spend time in the hot summer week, sitting in a conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplified, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are nice (even the killer of the well in the well). While some may be disappointed when they realize that this is not a match point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still in full control of what many of us have loved. <br /> <br /> That was the most I laughed at Woody in one comedy year (dare I say a decade?). Although I've never been impressed by Scarlet Johanson, he managed to emphasize his "sexy" image and jump straight to the middle, but lively young woman. <br /> <br /> It may not be a crown jewel in your career, but it was a wittier as "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" great comedy to go with friends.
