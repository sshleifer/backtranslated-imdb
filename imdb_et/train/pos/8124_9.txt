In addition to the excellent film METROPOLIS, it is the oldest pure sci-fi movie. Although sometimes the film is a bit preaching and the actor may be a bit broad, this is a great film for two reasons. First, it's both original and style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films I think about it. Secondly, the special effects were completely unbelievable over time - using matte patterns, models and tremendous references to create both apocalyptic world and amazing scenes from tomorrow's city. Of course, you could sit down, because according to today's standards, the effect is just that. But you have to realize that it was modern when the film was released in 1936 and has to be really surprised by the audience. In many ways, the kits resemble 1939. WORLD COMPETITIONS pleasant "modern cities". <br /> <br /> I think the film is also interesting because the question seems to be torn, "are people really stupid or are we big?" The end result seems to be a bit of both! How true! <br /> <br /> Final note: I saw it twice on television and just after a short video. All three times more sound and print quality stank - especially sound. If it is available on a DVD, then hopefully it will be much cleaner and provide a voluntary label. Since the video sound was cut, I would really appreciate it!
