I saw this movie once or during the release year 36 years ago (1969). Although I can only remember that bit now, I see it again. The parts I remember correctly or wrongly contain mustard gas in the trench and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some sexual advantage on the back of a closed truck to get him military information. The music score was especially memorable and the mixing of emotions in the Gone With The Wind league and I would like to hear it again. There must be commercial or copyright reason to make this movie available. Anyone know why? I doubt it is not about quality or lack of interest.
