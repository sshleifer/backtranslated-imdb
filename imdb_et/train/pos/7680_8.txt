"Holly" is a theme-based film, but it's not manipulative or too sentimental. His heart is the character-driven film that would not be as successful as Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with a gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), a strong will, but ultimately an excessive young Vietnamese girl. From live and photography to effective editing, everything is direct and well done. The modern classic score can initially put some out, but it is a top-notch composition and highlights an admirable constraint that is obvious. This film, which raises a lot of questions, but offers a few clear answers, eventually succeeds in raising awareness and compassion for Holly and many who share his situation. Weave to those who could do it.
