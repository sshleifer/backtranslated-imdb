The tip of this movie channel was stretched through cable TV channels and was so interesting that I was looking for the next sample. <br /> <br /> I really didn't know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I came out of this movie, being quite disturbed and suffering. It also gave me a little better overview of what our children are fighting these days as an adult who went to high school in the 80's. <br /> <br /> The fact that you are not seeing only the cooling of the plot. It is sometimes overwhelming to see both children and adults to understand and understand meaningless shooting. And I admit that I tore down all the tears. <br /> <br /> Generally not a movie I would be looking for, but I'm sure I'm glad.
