A woman who has left alone after her husband's death finds himself against a boy's friend and a handy man. A little twisted story begins to fall asleep with a comfortable man trying to revive himself. Twisted Part? A handy man is also interested in switching his daughter on and off. <br /> <br /> As if it wasn't strange enough, her mother can fall for this man and when her daughter discovers, she blames her not only for a dysfunctional relationship, but also for her confusion with poor mother. <br /> <br /> While you may think badly about this woman, the truth is that the film can portray her in a positive light. Anne Reid's beautifully played character is characterized by great emotion. <br /> <br /> Truly brilliant performance and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
