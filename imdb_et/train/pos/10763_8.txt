I have to admit that I was very skeptical about this documentary. I was expecting this American American propaganda that we do not like here in Europe. I was wrong. It's not propaganda, but it's hardly political at all. <br /> <br /> It depicts the events of September 9 in the eyes of firefighters who called the scene just after the planes collapsed. It's an amazing motive that this documentary was filmed at all! This film was originally taken as a document related to the "man" of the rookie NY fireman. We can only thank the filmmakers for continuing their work during these terrible trials. <br /> <br /> Great work. Absolutely stunning material. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />
