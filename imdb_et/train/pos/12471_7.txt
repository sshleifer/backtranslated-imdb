I didn't know the real events when I sat down to watch it, but the fact that it was based on a true story. After the child's father died, Rhonda tries to help his daughter Desiree (... I didn't know someone actually named her descendant) to cope with the loss. It really is for kids, as is often the case with "family members" (to say that, go ahead and get everything together, even though I would leave teenagers out of it if you are not sure they are buying this concept), but it won't let me down that the death of the parent is, and it doesn't really tell anyone. The plot is interesting enough and moves well enough. Action varies, with great Burstyn having a great part of his companion, Mathis is doing quite well, and Ferland and his peers (with a few exceptions) were the least convincing (and, frankly, they are irritating; I am not really in the target group. and certainly not less. Although humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines, the tone is not unpleasant. It has an intense scene or two. I recommend it to fans of this type of film.
