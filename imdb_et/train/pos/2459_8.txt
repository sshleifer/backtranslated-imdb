A beautiful and moving film that deserves wider viewing than likely. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second-generation Turkish immigrant, trying to break the mold. The Aicha martial arts experience is not entirely at home with his moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with his liberal Danish friends to get in the struggle to find herself and to have the strength to be whoever wishes regardless of family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthy succeeds in balancing introspection and narrative in a deep, unchanging, philosophical discourse, and supporting Xian Gao's choreography skills in a struggle. After all, it is the stunning debut of Semra Turan, which gives the spirit of this film. Raw charisma and the martial arts required are heartily complicated to make his personal drama credible. <br /> <br /> Well worth your time.
