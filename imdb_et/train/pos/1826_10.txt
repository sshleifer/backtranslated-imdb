I loved this movie when I was little. Today at 17, this is one of my favorite films of all time. Beautiful animation and tempting characters are just two of the things you like about this movie. While many people may not enjoy some of the songs, most of them are well done and together. It focuses on Charlie, the strange beautiful German Shepard, who may seem unlikely at first, but eventually wins you. <br /> <br /> Not in any way a baby. Sometimes it is often very dark and scary. Take care of Don Bluth fans and animation films. But keep the tissue at hand. ADGTH never makes me cry and does the same for those who are sensitive to the film. Supposedly one of the greatest non-Disney animated films ever. With Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> Top LINE: Heavenly Masterpiece.
