Tigerland is one of the best films I've seen, and I think it even goes beyond a full-length jacket, a movie of a similar nature. Bozzi plays Farrell exceptionally well, and this is a sign that will remain in his mind long after the end of the movie. Finally, Schumacher is excellently cut - a melodic harmony to slowly leave the song and troops. What a movie.
