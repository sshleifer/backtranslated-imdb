Although I've been a fan of Peter Weir for a long time, I hadn't watched any of his Australian films before I watched the last wave. And that was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise. Richard Chamberlain plays David, an attorney called to defend the five Aborigines accused of murdering another Aboriginal. For David's peers, this is obviously a drunken disorder and they think they should blame and serve a quick sentence. But David believes that there is a secret behind the murder rituals under murder. If the investigation continues, he learns not only about his clients but also about himself. I can only say that this film is going in directions that no one expects. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this an exciting movie: for example, Chamberlain is also acting on David Gulpilil's performances, playing a young Aboriginal who introduces David to the secrets of the tribe; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old aboriginal who is a spiritual instructor. The relationship between these three characters creates the film in the heart. <br /> <br /> But Weir also suggests a supernatural movie. David has dreams that warn him about the future. Australia has terrible weather, storms, falling hail and even mysterious black rain that can be nothing but pollution. But it is also related to the case that David defends. How it is related is one of the great revelations of the film. From small events, Weir can create an atmosphere of fear and oppression that indicates future horrors without really showing anything. <br /> <br /> The result of Charles Wain is fantastic, especially the use of didgeridoo. Photography is also quite good. Russell Boyd, Weir's long-standing DP, who won the Oscar in 2004 for a captain and commander, depicts a blind and terrible world full of mystery. <br /> <br /> I also find that the aboriginal film is not a blame for white culture or a blessing of these traditions, such as dances with wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is too easy to be so easy. But for those who do not feel any strange or unclear, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
