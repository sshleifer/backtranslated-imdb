This movie is not great, but it's good and enjoyable. It looks like an indie movie made from a game file. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears that the script has not been written for him. And there is a small irony of an actor who goes to a supermarket to do research for a film he's not yet committed to. I mean, he finally made the movie and look at it :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue to be a bit too positive for my taste, but still refreshed. This is a film that inspires the viewer to look at his life and choose the direction to go. A little too much emphasis on appearance when you ask me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: A nice little movie made in two weeks, mainly with two actors, and some add-ons, guided by dialogue, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
