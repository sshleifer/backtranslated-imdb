"Pecker" proves that Waters has no intention of changing its sticky ways in its old age. Many things have changed because Waters started making movies in the 1960s, but 40 years later he does what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget for Waters films has increased significantly. This is one of his last productions, but I was surprised that Waters still has this "trailer park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, who is obsessed with photography. He lives in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker draws attention to the Art Agent of New York (always observable Lili Taylor) and his life is getting worse. Once again, Waters brings fun to art, fame and heterosexuality. It does not belong to his best films, but here are some great stomachs ("Memama" is the best in the film!). It's consistently smart and funny and has a very "smart" sensitivity I have loved in Warters movies.
