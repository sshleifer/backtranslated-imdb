so, being a pretty deep fan of the horror movie, it has been for a while, because I've seen what really jumped me (or nervously nervous). <br /> <br /> Intend to get this DVD off ... much better than the ring. the thing i can't do is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was terrible, well if that's what you think, then ... i know what i do I liked it and it takes a fair amount to really feel scared, so I have to say it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Now you may be disappointed with the story if you need everything clean and tidy, because the plot goes back a little bit to help build the story (I think if it had been shown in chronological order, it would have destroyed the whole thing. ) <br /> <br /> I am really glad that this movie had very little bloody confusion ... maybe you are the rest of the studio writers and realize that you don't have to put the red stuff over the set so people would be afraid.
