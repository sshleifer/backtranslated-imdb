Uncomfortable, subtle and lean film, "Man in White Smoke" is another breath of fresh air in cinematic films at Ealing Studio. Although I suspect that some modern viewers may hide it at first, I doubt that many would not be attracted by the experts because his themes and characters are sad in the film. <br /> <br /> Really great Alec Guinness gives one more fine character in the movie, not as obviously as a virtuoso, as well as Eally's inspired "Kind Hearts and Coronets" since 1949. This time he plays only one character, not eight involuntary inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton. finds the right tone and expression. With the fine, expressive performance of Guinness, the rest is effective. Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out as the main players. Thesiger is convincingly absurd as a struck but influential business university, while Parker is reliable as a powerful but central mill owner and father. Father, this is Joan Greenwood, a charming comic comedian who is at the top of this film. Stylish and appealing aspect and dictation, he's a pretty subtle, subtle contrast to this unusual, but more maladrite Guinness in this movie. The scene in which he seemingly tries to tempt him is so adeptly played by the couple that it is so deeply embarrassing and amusing ... <br /> <br /> The topics are dealt with very effectively without simple morals. The complexity of the relationship between science, business and labor has been carefully and satisfactorily studied. Expertly directed by Alexander Mackendrick, the film is technically proficient in all areas; recognizable photography, sound effects and music installation, and poor scripting, all quietly impress. A thoroughly satisfying film with excellent Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
