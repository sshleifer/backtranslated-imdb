I think this is a great example of the differences between the two cultures. It would be a great movie to show in a sociology class. I thought it was pretty funny and I have to say that I'm the mammal who "puts the band together and get the job done" on the plot device. It seems that most people do not realize that this film is not just comedy. It also has some dramatic elements and I think they mix well. In general I give him a firm 8.
