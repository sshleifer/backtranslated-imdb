But this is a great martial art film. Liu Chia Liang is the second choreographer, not just Sammo Hung. This is immediately apparent during your struggle with fancy design - but not from the flashy corners of the camera, etc. The direction is firmly controlled to not only speed up the viewer with speed and movement, but to honor him with the skills shown. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in the camera. Liu's presentation in the banquet scene with which the film opens, is one of the highest points in the history of the kung fu movie. Liu is supported by beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (fame of My Young Auntie) and Hsiao Hou, whose acrobatics are breathtaking and more preferred than any wiring. As for the plot, this film follows the unusual theme of revenge, but with character and moral development and the most appropriate resolution. Humor is also the best. If you only look at one kung fu movie ever, it would be a good choice - that's all.
