Frankly, I don't understand why this movie is so big when it comes to "flop" disclosure. Sharon Stone has certainly not lost her charisma and "touching" from "Basic Instinct". I voted for this movie 10 and I'll tell you why: The game will open in London this time. London is a city where Catherine Tramell has moved from BI1 events. He proves that he is a manipulator of his class. He "screws the brain" like Catherine with such a skill that in the end you are not quite sure who is the real villain. <br /> <br /> As for the technical part of the film: only a real setback is the B-team of the participants. Sharon Stone is the only big name in the first part, compared to her and Michael Douglas. I also think that BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone was a little younger, but she's still quite stunning in appearance and has only improved her charisma. His B-rate "assistants" are not so bad, even though I would have liked a bigger name. <br /> <br /> I think the baseline has pretty good fixes. I think this is a much better thriller than many imprisonments that are so easily distributed in Hollywood that they can be easily distributed today. The plot is large, technically easy to see, the movie's half way doesn't whine and most importantly - it's inside.
