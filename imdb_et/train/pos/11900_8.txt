Visually as well as musically stunning. Treatment for both the eye and the ear. The main Victorian element of the opening sequences was absolutely enchanting, helping to create a Christmas picture that Dickens himself would have been rightly proud of. Technically, the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively and creatively in the traditional stage. Dance of many leading artists is amazingly good. Photography and lighting are first-rate and sound recording is perfectly suited to the overall advanced level of technical skills used. A great movie for the whole family at Christmas and the most enjoyable discovery that can withstand multiple viewing.
