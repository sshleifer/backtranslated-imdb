Deliverance is James Dickey's exciting, haunting, and sometimes disturbing story that became John Boorman's brilliant film. It is about four businessmen driven by masculinity and macho behavior who spend the canoeing weekend in the mountains. There they face the darkest sides of every person and every worst human injury ... poverty, morals and even physical harassment! These four men were going to ride the river for adventure and excitement, but their journey will soon become an odyssey through a violent and hidden mountainous country that is completely excluded from any civilization. All these elements make Deliverance one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. Almost everything that happens to these men, you pray that you will never find yourself in a similar situation. Clean cinema, Deliverance is also a very important film. John Boorman's best (followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film, and it contains many memorable scenes that have appeared in many other films. Just think about the terrible "Dueling banjos" music and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual "banging like a pig" rape scene. All participants give (haha) perfect exhibitions. Especially Jon Voight. Must See The Movie !!
