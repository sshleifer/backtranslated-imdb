Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell participate in "The Amazing Mr. Williams", a 1939 mystery / comedy that is pretty good, though forgotten, probably due to the incredible number of films that appeared in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective who is married to his job, while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What is happening on this film is no exception - he has called the murder scene just as he intends to walk along the aisle. <br /> <br /> Both stars were great in comedy, worked well (and often), and helped make this sex battle fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are great supporters. <br /> <br /> As you read from other reviews, Melvyn Douglas doesn't do much about women. <br /> <br /> Entertaining, Whatever Melvyn Douglas commented on here, one of our biggest actors. He literally went through dozens of movies as a second man and best friend before he himself as an old man in his films. He was not lazy, but rather a very hard-working actor (who made it easy) who simultaneously had a Broadway career with his film career. He simply wasn't cast into the film's leading person and didn't challenge the studio system. I invite someone to see their devastating performances "Hud" and "I did not sing for my father" and call him lazy or referring to his smile.
