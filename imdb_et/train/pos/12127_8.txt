The story is a bit of a trick, characterized by the main character with a successful success, but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis's images, naive obsessed with Philips Carey and his affectionate object Mildred Rogers, dramatically increase this film over standard melodrama. <br /> <br /> Sensitive, cultured Philip, who for the first time is under his affection for most of the picture, and the will to Mildred is unlike the character Howard was supposed to play a few years later - Ashley Wilkes, the South gentleman is too refined and decent to get into the era of restructuring. Philip actually seems to be disappointed before Mildred enters the picture? She doesn't even feel particularly surprised when her art teacher tells her that she will never do it as a painter. Perhaps it is passivity, those fallen expectations that make him self-conscious with the Cockney waitress as long as he does. <br /> <br /> Although Leslie Howard is memorable, the main idea of ​​"Human Debt" today is the image of Bette Davis, perhaps due to the well-known story of how he had to fight with Jack Warner to become part of Mildred, and also because the target audience of the film prefers to prefer the character with its peculiar energy. Mildred may have a grille voice, but he also has a stained glass angelic beauty, which makes it somewhat understandable for Philip to let himself go as long as he did. Although a man who eats Mildred may sometimes feel in one-dimensional form, he occasionally gives sympathy to the viewer when he becomes ill and understands that Philip is the only person who ever cared for him. You may also think that he is something he accuses Philip of looking at him so that he is not good enough. (The scene where Philip and Norah release the novel magazines as a trash can for the kitchens, confirms this). <br /> <br /> Most supportive characters are also effective, especially Norah's sensible romantic writer who loves Philip, but he knows he can never compete with Mildred and Sally, who has Mildred's beauty and Norah's dignity, and appears as a worthy woman, Philip has been rewarded with the final consumer. The only sign I found was Sally's eccentric, ale slurping, aristocratic father, who seems to have the character of stocks from before. <br /> <br /> A classic that deserves this reputation.
