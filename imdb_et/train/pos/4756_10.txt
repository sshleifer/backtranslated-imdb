This is one of the most divine episodes in the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialogues and fun characters to break some horrible moments. There's an ordinary blonde "dancer" (with Serling's love for this kind of character, so she continues to appear in different episodes?) And other mixed characters, but it's Jack Elam's "old man" who steals the show completely. I find this a funny, affectionate version of "The Monsters Of Maple Street" - or perhaps the 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of The Thing. In another note: I thought a young lover of the episode might be someone who finally went into other things - he seemed familiar - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after only two TV credits in his name.
