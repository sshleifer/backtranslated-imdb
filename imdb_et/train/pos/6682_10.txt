I saw it in theaters and absolutely adored it. Geoffery Rush gave the best result as a super-villain I've ever seen from Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were heavenly games. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actresses. Hank was great as Blue Raja and I especially loved the fact that the character wasn't really British. With her and her mother, she was a superhero, my eyes were almost tears. I loved The Bowler talking to the ball. Some of the funniest things were related to the false rage of Stiller and his figure, Mr Figise, and the fact that his dangers and one-off belts were all dirty and that they never thought. I could barely hold on when he said "fraculater, Freinken-puss". But one of the things I enjoyed most was that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie. I recommend this movie anyway and I give it my own two thumbs.
