What a fun movie! If you're a fan of Giallo, the Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. First of all it is difficult to go wrong with Gramlo Bouchet and Marina Malfat. Both are wonderful - especially the innocent Bouchet, who is guilty of his life. The Red Queen Kills 7 Times kill scenes are especially nice and contain enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders is quite unexpected, and the movie really begins to start. The killer, the red queen, is one of the most surprising and interesting murderers I've seen in Italian film. The 70s kits and fashions are wonderful. In fact, all the visuals are interesting when the laughing Red Queen running across the bridge at night is one of my favorite moments. The complex plot was in my interest. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score can be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I couldn't get it out of my head in two days. <br /> <br /> Only two of the problems I have with the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are in the finals. First, the person responsible for the murders is too easy to note. If you have seen more than a couple of Gialli, you have no problems in determining who is behind the killings. Secondly, it seems that the end is a bit too hasty and that's why it's a little confusing. I'm certainly not the one who needs every plot of land I have been given, but I admit that I lost to explain it all. The second view can just empty it.
