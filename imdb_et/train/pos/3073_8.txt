This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs more. No extravagant props, cars, no smart single lining. Just people dealing with people's situation. <br /> <br /> William Macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father Donald Sutherland. Macy is a conscientious son, Sutherland is the dominant father. Son wants a business, Dad won't let him. Macy loves her son, which David Dorfman ("Ring") played beautifully. She starts to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl she meets in the waiting room of her psychiatrist's office. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting alignment of characters, and the film follows a reluctant killer when it balances its own needs with those of its family. There are many touching scenes, especially Macy and her little boy. And as with William Macy, waiting for the film, there is too little humor. <br /> <br /> Great work everywhere, actors and director. It's nice to know that they can still make a good movie in Hollywood with a small budget.
