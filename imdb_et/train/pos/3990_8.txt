May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is uncomfortable because grandchildren and "children" do not seem to know each other as one would expect. There is no heat that should be there. After dinner, May's husband says he does not feel well, accuses him of preparing his daughter, and says irritatingly that he wants to go home. He dies that night. <br /> <br /> May, the widow, is gone. He had no obvious passionate marriage or very interesting, but he had a goal. He had someone who needed him, and although his own needs had been uneven over the years, he had something to do with his day. <br /> <br /> He is depressed and unmotivated. She goes to her daughter Paula, who soon after the arrival of her mother tells her mother that she has never felt that her mother has given her much at all. He makes anger out of his mother's lack of lack of nutrition. It looks like it is armed and surprised, but it also doesn't seem to be energy or a desire to really make it right. "I am your mother and I love you." What do you really say? (I've heard it too many times from my mother and haven't yet understood what that means.) Paula is a bit (well, more than a bit) neurotic. Both women are poor, although they show it very differently. <br /> <br /> Paula has been involved with her son, Darren, who is a handyman working at the son's house. While Paula is working during the day, you can start chatting and lunch with Darren. Darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of his autistic son Nicky, but he allegedly does not live with his wife at home. he has the connection they seem to have. May be attracted to Darren because he offers some kind of peace and understanding that he cannot get from other women in his life. (He is also too interested in the money Mai says he can give him everything to give up on it, although he is clearly not interested in joining such a journey. knew and did not want to know again - because his daughter Paula had often told him that he was leaving Darren married, that May May become a rationalization of what he does, okay. Paula leads, May is introduced, is forced to get along with a widow whom she is not attracted to. With an older man who is obviously barely able, and it is really painful and disturbing, because we see the face of a completely disgusting May because she is wearing a single haunting link. > <br /> Finally, Paula discovers some of her mother's very graphic sketches that her mother and Darren have indeed been sex. <br /> <br /> This movie is undoubtedly seen by many in many ways. During a short essay at Paula's writing group, it may appear that she felt that she hated her children by the end of the day and would leave the pub after falling asleep, ensuring that her husband had clearly not thought of leaving the children before returning to his local pub before returning home. But in the film it had previously appeared that her husband did not like her friends so she didn't have it. He did what he wanted. He was unhappy, but he closed it because, as he said, "it was easier." So, while May was not the best mother who wanted to express her sympathy for her, May's actions as a woman who simply wants to be sexual and live "for a few minutes" during her lifetime can be seen. A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to be a human being would embrace a friend and mistress. <br /> <br /> Paula, although neurotic and unhappy, may have become the more distant parents who raised her. It is certainly not difficult to understand why Paula knows her mother is completely betrayed. <br /> <br /> This is a well-made film that has more complexity than I mentioned, and certainly what leaves many, perhaps conflicting, reactions to the viewer. It's a movie that is worth discussing and discussing, and above all it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> One thing film leaves us is the horror and fear of lonely life. Whatever is considered "righteous" or considered by every viewer to be "wrong", the subject of aging and loneliness, which causes the fear of most of us, is inevitable.
