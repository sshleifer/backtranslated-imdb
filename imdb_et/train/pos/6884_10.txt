This film's miracle is one of those films that have a lasting and long-lasting effect. I have read an overview or two angry people who think they are either Republicans or child beaters, and their extreme remarks tell about the power of films to fight people with their darker secrets. No such piece of art has ever laughed and combined tears and it is a miracle of the film. The realism of the film and Bret Carr's performance must not be forgotten. The nature of this almost interactive effect causes people to get rid of the theater or question their identity. Bravo next cinema level.
