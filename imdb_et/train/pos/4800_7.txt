I went to Straight Story, waiting for the sad / happy type of beautiful direction and good action. I got them. What I did not expect was an allegory of human existence trials. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about driving about 300 miles on a lawn mower and making it a microcosm for human condition. <br /> <br /> If you didn't notice it, look at it again, paying attention to the age of people Alvin meets, the landscape he passes, the reactions people give him, what discussions he has (one of the first is pregnancy and kids, one the latter are outside the cemetery). The last way he leads is particularly haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness. The last mechanical failure can be seen as death and the wonderful revival of his engine, which is related to the later life in which he reaches the desired assembly. <br /> <br /> I only hope that some people who called it slow cute melodrama will take time to look at more holistic attention.
