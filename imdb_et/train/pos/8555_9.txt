* Firstly, although many say it is the worst in the series, I don't think this is true given that it perfectly reflects the 21st century teenage mentality. This brings great opportunities to laugh and remind the pleasant teenager of the occasion if you wanted them to have the same fun as the characters. <br /> <br /> * Do I agree that this is a teenage movie, but nowadays do comedy films don't have to be for teenagers? ... cinemas are usually a meeting place for teenagers; plus, seeing such a movie during sleep or something that is a very good time very good. <br /> <br /> * Many comment on the nudity of this movie. Well ... we get real ... it doesn't reflect the thoughts of teen boys like those who are in the movie? what would you like to see ... smart books, romantic things? it is not at all what would be in the minds of these teenagers ... <br /> <br /> * * * * * * * * * * * * you should see it if you are still a teenager in mind or often think about how it was a teenager, or such things. Thank you for reading!
