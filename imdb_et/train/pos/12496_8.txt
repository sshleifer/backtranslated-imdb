For years, we've been watching every horror film that comes out, like boring Hollywood recycled products like Saw 2, into terrible indie publications that are totally unmatchable ... we suffer through all the bad movies, hoping to find small jewels like "Dark Remains". <br /> <br /> We managed to hit this movie in 2005 at Shriekfest. The audience loved it and I believe it won the Best Film Award. <br /> <br /> Although it may not have the budget or star power of studio movies, it is a serious blow and a scary category. Functional and cinematic are top-notch, but it is the direction that makes this movie worthwhile. The story and characters are developing at the right pace to deliver fantastic fears. <br /> <br /> Editing and visual fx are also top-notch. And while many horror movies can't use music for their own benefit, "Dark Remains" adds only that horror. <br /> <br /> I know that the film has shown a number of festivals, but no one has been close to me so I can't wait to hear it finally appear on the DVD. Trust me, even if you're sick of the current state of the fear films, give it a try ... you won't regret it!
