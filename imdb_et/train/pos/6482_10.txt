I was just thirteen when I first saw this series, and I look at it again on DVD over 30 years later. Images that are over open credit have never left me. This has influenced my opinion of the world and its peoples. My parents were with me long enough to see the series, and we always discussed the program after that. It gave me the love to learn history and the highest marks I got in our school exams! <br /> <br /> The voice and delivery of Sir Laurence Olivier is timeless and perfect. I feel that people who have survived feel that this is a version of the history of their Second World War. I can't imagine watching it forever. Perhaps a similar series of Cold War could be considered, although it is hard to imagine Sir Laurence's replacement. <br /> <br /> Buy!
