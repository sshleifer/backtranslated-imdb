It is a pretty fast and enjoyable criminal thriller based on Ira Levin's game about two gay writers (Caine and Reeve) who prime their rich wife (Cannon) to get real estate insurance. The plot succeeds, but Christopher Reeve, as younger and less created by two writers, decides to play out the real murder. Reeve promises that Easthampton, Long Island, could, for example, become a Long Island Southampton script. The rest of the playground is dead donation and the truth is that Reeve does not think of small rumors or even of Cannon's apparently accidental death. This increases revenue and its own Warhol share. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, a megabucks-making playwright whose last four productions have been bombarded and wanting to do nothing but quietly back up a new game, perhaps with Reeve's input that would redeem his reputation. He can't allow Reeve's scandal-a-clef to be produced. So - what else? - He's trying to kill him. Finally, they stop killing each other, the manuscript is by their neighbor, psychological Helga Tensdoorp, and he makes a million dollars selling it to Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for a number of reasons. One is production design. This multi-storey, multi-storey house with a large windmill located at nine, which must be the most valuable acre of land (Easthampton!), Would be a great set of mines everywhere. Easthamptom's boy can't afford the tent. The house is not too big or baroque in its interior design. It's just very modest, though it's a bit like my taste, a house that is so clean, you're afraid to step on a thick carpet to be afraid to leave a foot mark. <br /> <br /> Next, it would hardly be possible to act. Caine, Cannon and Fred Jones are great. Dyan Cannon gives a pitch-perfect presentation when an anxious woman, whose pants are so tight, look like they're sprayed, that's fine for her assets. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to have a comfortable but psychopathic murderer. Irene Worth, as a psychological neighbor to Helga, was somehow hard to define, a mistake. Allowed to have - or someone like him - needed a plot, but my God, what offensive his character is, goes around and says, "I feel pain zis woomis!" I think that, in order to make her a little more interesting, she rose on a sweat and a cozy look with bicycle reflectors. It is still awkward from start to finish. <br /> <br /> You have to love Ira Levin's fucking dialogue. Frustrated Caine asks Reevel to tell him why he wrote all the lecture. "Because it's there, Sidney!" says Reeve and Caine shouts, "It's MOUNTAINS, not PLAYS! Games aren't there until some *** holes write them!" This is also Caine's appeal to the police after her husband falls terribly as planned. He works himself as a storm of storms, hardly able to speak because he announces the incident and wants the ambulance to be sent immediately. When he hangs, he sees his usual horrible expression, he blows his nose on his handkerchief and walks, all the business again. <br /> <br /> The climax is confusing and noisy and full. the violence that had no evil charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the earlier scenes. The result is mostly harpsichord light reefs that fit well with the film. <br /> <br /> You probably enjoy it.
