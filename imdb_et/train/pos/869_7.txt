Deaf Secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) has been bullied by her central, spirited male colleagues. <br /> <br /> If they suggest he needs an assistant, it seems to be the last offense, but if the first applicant is ex-con Paul (Vincent Cassel), he seizes the opportunity to change his life. <br /> <br /> Carla covers her mistakes and she wants to go straight, involuntarily helping her colleagues to retaliate. <br /> <br /> When Paul asks Carl to return, he finds himself a criminal in the underworld led by the ruthless single Shark Marchand (Olivier Gourmet). <br /> <br /> Recognizing their ability to read as a weapon, no one has agreed, these two saw justice. <br /> <br /> French filmmaker Jacques Audiard's third feature "Read My Lips" is a genre attacking piece that shifts from dark social comedy to a visceral full thriller.
