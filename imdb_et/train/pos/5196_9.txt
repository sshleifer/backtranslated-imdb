Human Tornado (1976) is a better film in many ways than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to do and accuse Rudy Ray Moore of acting as an actor. It's a fun movie that is technically more reliable and has worked. Performers do not take themselves too seriously and this time it seems everyone is joking and going with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff as he was in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie very much and I highly recommend it. Just like his first film, it is targeted at a specific audience (I doubt very much that Mr Moore was trying to expand his audience at the time of his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
