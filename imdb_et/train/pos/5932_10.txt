Best Stephen King movie next to IT, though it's more fun. <br /> <br /> It has it all: <br /> <br /> - Great cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a fun king, king; a well-metered horror with a funfoot, <br /> <br /> - great music usage, especially Santo & Johnny's "Sleepwalk"; somewhere in the village; <br /> <br /> - lots of humor. You can't really scare good fears here because it's too much fun and top; 4.5 rating: I can't really do it. When was the last time the horror film was as fun as it was?
