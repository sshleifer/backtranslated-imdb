This movie, together with WESTFRONT 1918, is my favorite Pabst-style movie and I enjoyed them more than his many famous films that celebrated Louise Brooks (like PANDORA BOX). This is probably because both are very similar to the neo-realistic films that the Italians performed in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for the use of non-actors (just typical people) in everyday environments to create intensively inclusive and realistic movies. appropriately, people in the role seem to be miners - not actors. The central conflict when the film begins is that there is a large mine on the French-German border. Instead of one large mine, it is divided into a border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite the fact that Germany has higher unemployment. This, inter-language differences (perfectly illustrated in the scene of the dance halls) and World War I conspire to create an enormous split between the factions, resulting in WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, the explosion in French causes a major collapse and the Germans refuse to sit and do nothing. By threatening their lives, they prove that there is a real comrade between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried to get into the German audience in vain to see the nonsense of war and anger. It was a gorgeously moving film with some scary and claustrophobic pictures I've ever seen. Looking at history, the effect of the film was at best minimal. This is a real shame, because, like WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON WESTERN FRONT (Milestone), were great messages of peace and harmony, but ultimately these failures were positive for the public. So, from a historical point of view, this is an amazing and sad remnant to see.
