Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine the winner of this contemporary movie. Of the three, I don't know who was the most interesting because everyone offers good results and intriguing signs. Patric does it with a dagger, playing a former boxer and mental patient. Wow, this makes an interesting man alone! He looks stupid, but he's not. Ward is a abducted, enthusiastic, cynical, intelligent and compassionate associate who has been robbed badly. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern never enchants the movie. <br /> <br /> A movie can be seen as a downward view for the average viewer, but I found it interesting ... and I don't usually like pressing movies. What I found was a kind of peculiar criminal film. See and see if you agree. This is a pretty unknown film that shouldn't be such a status, because it's just a good story and well done.
