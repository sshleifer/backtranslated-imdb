Anyone who lived through Nerds Revenge and Girlpower appreciates this movie. This is one of those films that offers "spring break" all you want. PLUS does this in the college movie genre. It's funny, it's dead (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch !, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) Writer / actress Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a big villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I just repeat myself now ...) She lives with the girls who love Miranda in July, but feel they are eating ice cream and pretending they are stupid.
