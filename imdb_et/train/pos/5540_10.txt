At first, this movie seems so bad that I almost fell trance for the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream. Cosmic hole. But I gave him a second chance, then another, and so on. Finally, I became addicted to this movie because it is a dreamy slow temple, wonderful nature sets that have been bathed in a deep light and especially a musical result made by about 70s progressive stone and absolute fine folk music by actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (Troubadour) .You should notice the song about the disappearance of walnut, silver trout and air ..., heard in the middle and end of the movie. At first, there are some carnal scenes that let us understand Elizabeth Suzuki's natural charms. If this film was made by some of the "repertoire" leaders, such as Bergman, Lars Von Trier or Jean-Luc Goddard, the critics would have rolled up on the floor, that film would have been a cosmic masterpiece.I personally think this movie is one million times better than any Fellini movie sh # Â¤ @ t!
