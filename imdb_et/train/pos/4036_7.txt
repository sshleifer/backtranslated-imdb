Good luck finding it for watching the movie - it's not released on tape or DVD yet. I saw the release in the early 1970s that I managed to catch it with the American Cinematheque's retention efforts, and it still has tangible moments that lasted thirty years with me. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to repeat rwint's exact comments here. Soon after the five simple pieces of success, Jack N has said he has managed to manage a small budget effort as well as possible, and it certainly shows misleading and agitating that could have used some circumcision. But it is also a memorable icon for this time: all the very intense clashes in the 60's college sports, student movements, sexual revolution and more. <br /> <br /> Why see this movie? Probably in some scenes, it was a derailleur: glowing male tying in after-shower showers; Karen Black's scene with a car with Tepper keeps you a little, but that's the first word I haven't seen before; and accidental and unexpected use of nudity. There are probably others I leave. <br /> <br /> Look at the young Cindy Williams surprise in one of her first films; thin David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren is ready for the fresh powder-blue UCLA form and freshly blue TV format; Robert Towne - actress; and a whole lot of people just play by themselves. <br /> <br /> Now: Any link between Harry Gittes surname, Robert Towne and a certain character in Chinatown and Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> He gets "7" based on Karen Black. You see why.
