The movie was all back to October 20, 1944, where it seemed to be part of the great landing of 'I Shall Return' in the Philippines? Just on the shore of Leyte where General MacArthur got fame? First of all, did Gregory Peck win his big overall picture? This is the step, the number of shoulders, the intensity ?? This is what both men have in common: intensity, full absorption, commitment? Was it for the army with MacArthur? Was it a challenge for Peck to act? He has won the academic prize "To kill Mockinbird", Oscar nominee "The Keys to the King", "New Year's Eve", "The Gentlemen's Agreement" and "The Twelve Clocks High" for all the apparently condemning amnesia to a raw-access journalist; a troubled lawyer obsessed with the armed forces; Bible David Captain Horatio Hornblower? He has brought them all their unique insights, their character, their sincerity, their warmth and their love, especially their humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where "MacArthur" stands on deck "President of the Philippines". We can hear the dialogue: "General, I hope the water is not too deep," says the "president", because my people know that I can't swim. "Then come the voice of Pecki:" And my people see that I can't walk on the water! "<br /> <br /> Like MacArthur, did Peck justify his reputation as a giant of the film industry? did we know his anger, happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family?
