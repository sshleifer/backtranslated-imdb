This film gives a strong comment on Italian ages. The use of mirrors to improve the revelation of symbols is lovely and I cannot mention the beauty and size of Sophia Loren and Mastroian. I love both of them. Their way of communication is so beautiful and natural that you can ask if the camera actually exists. The husband also plays a brief role as an excellent Fascist Italian who orders his wife and children, but a loving father in his own way. The original scenes with Hitler in Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are incredible and really place the film historically. I loved the movie and I also agree that it's funny that it's not more well known.
