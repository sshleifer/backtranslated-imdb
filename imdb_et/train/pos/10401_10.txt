Words can't describe it, so I'm short. "The Baghdad Thief" was my favorite film as a child, and it has never stopped or fascinated me. I loved this movie from the first moment I saw it when I was a six-year-old boy who started reading "Arab night." I remember walking in the TV room Sabu in a battle with a giant spider and immediately terrible. <br /> <br /> There is rarely a lot of beauty, magic and wonders in the film. Sabu and John Justin are great when the dirty heros, Conrad Veidt, are very cheerful as the evil villain Jaffar and Rex Ingram have the pleasure of watching as a sardonic gene. Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best technical colors. One of the three credited managers is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightly proclaimed by critics, but the audience often overlooks his remarkable films, including the "life and death issue" (aka "Stairway to Heaven") and "Red Shoes." one of the real masters of the camera, right there between David Lea, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> As with all major artworks, the "Baghdad Thief" is also a beauty. lies in the details. Each frame has its own magical charm. The story is never left behind and characters and their activities are always involved. Here's a movie that will ever get older.
