Classic drama / western cinematic amazingly better than time (1954). The output is very good and you can say it is done with pride and love. The general look at the American NORTHT WEST pioneers is very educational and entertaining. This film is very little appreciated because most people do not want to see that many "attorneys" had this particular time and place very complicated / corrupt like most developing countries today. The sequences could have been more realistic, but still, most of the important ones are covered by this film. testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who know history and philosophy .......
