Compared to the earlier film, Sleuth, it's obvious, and at my first look, I thought Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap has at least many more repetitive views than Sleuth. > <br /> I bought Deathrap in a Wal-Mart bargain, noting that it had Caine and an undervalued Reeve, and it was worth $ 6. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could have received. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best secrets that movie fans always enjoy. And it is absolutely worth the repeated viewing. <br /> <br /> While Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine turned to Sleuth in Bravista, I was impressed by Christopher Reeve's impression of Clifford Anderson. Reeve, who rightly associated his present-day depiction of the legendary Superman, stole an exhibition that should have been worth the Oscar. I have always felt that Reeve was a type of actor who didn't get much chance to shine outside of Superman movies and some other bad but fun movies, like somewhere in time, but this movie shows that his potential was really used and used, thank you for the goodness . <br /> <br /> I'm very happy with Michael Caine's performance. He was glib, tasty manipulative and sadistic. His look at Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. Actually, thanks to this movie, I got into the "Michael Caine phase" and started to rent as many things as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> Deathtrap has a juicy dialogue here to fill your "catchy quotes" section. (Unfortunately, a large part of the dialogue violates the enormous entertainment plot). <br /> <br /> It's really hard to talk about a movie without damaging important plot points that are endlessly fun. Needless to say, this is a must-see. But for me it was the biggest and most satisfying darkness of all time. <br /> <br /> Revision is mandatory. <br /> <br /> And it's worth sitting with the Sleuth on the DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I'll leave you with this beautifully quoted quote from the movie: "I don't know if it shouldn't be ... well, just a past who's about me to enter this dangerous and exciting collaboration ... where am I could count on the idea of ​​moral obligation….
