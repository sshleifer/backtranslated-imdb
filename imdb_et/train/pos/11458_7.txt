Reiterates the darkness. Understanding of the wonder and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange it is that most of us would see someone who has to work ... no matter what the circumstances of his life are. To see the Goldsworthy sculptures come alive and see that his reaction to everyone is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. It's his vitality. When you see his failures, it seems that the energy is thrown out of your body like a hot air balloon. It is not a fear of starting again, but of taking his energy from his work. Watching it simply creates a takeover of nature and reminds her that her work is somewhat painful, but still breathtaking. He discusses flow and time in minimal dialogue, and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the land are the same. When he says he needs land, but he doesn't need him ... I ask differently. The only complaint is a musical result that seems to slow down even more speed, which at best is relaxing.
