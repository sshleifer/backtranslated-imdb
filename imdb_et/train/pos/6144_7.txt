I saw it as a child of the wonderful world of Disney, so I didn't remember that much. When I looked at it recently, I sat there thinking: "It's a weird thing I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> "Traveling" scenes look like something caused by LSD overdose. Animated characters are mostly strangely colored / tuned characters from Jungle Book and Robin Hood. Some of the non-Disney things I noticed: children are threatened with a knife point and prostitutes (Portobello Road during the song). <br /> <br /> It was a lot of fun, although the musical number was long and I see little kids getting bored with them. The subject was also five in the dark, seeing as it was during WW2.
