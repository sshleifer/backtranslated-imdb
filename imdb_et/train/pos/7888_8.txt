Freddy Krueger Dreamer Walking From The Street Returns, A spectacular actor Robert englund is back in this nightmare 5, a dream child. I hope I got the number right. There's so much, and that's one of the best, Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) tom Arnold, johnny depp (who made the first nightmare in 84) alice cooper (singer) you see Freddy as a tortured child, a teenager, who loves pain and the effects of a family boy (horrible) are very funny and creative, there is also Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) breckin Meyer (road trip) yaphet Kotto (alien, live and die) and Amanda Donahue (father knows best) one of those people who saw it in 3D well to the end. I love 3D movies. I left the first 3D wave in 1953 (I wasn't born yet), the second wave was in 1983 like all Freddy movies. it stands out as one of the best, who doesn't read the first thing that was absolutely brilliant, Freddy got a new monster of the 80s and 90s with Jason voorhees, Chucky, Micheal myers and skin face.can you can imagine a movie with all of them ? I recommend it to all Freddy fans and spooky fans.
