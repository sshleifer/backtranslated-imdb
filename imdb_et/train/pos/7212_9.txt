I do not hesitate to adapt this "Death Trap" between the top 5 best stages, best equipped with "Caine" and "Reeves" (an underrated actress who has never had the opportunity to do anything more than a dirty romance and ""). Superman ") plays very well with each other, even Dyan Cannon - whom I usually don't care about - plays a great role that uses his resentment as an actor. <br /> <br /> It is not certain that" Deathtrap "and" Sleuth "compare - one more terrible and adaptable adaptation to Michael Caine - right or even fair. Yes, these two stories are much more common than class warfare as the mindset and "Sleuth" is set in the movie as much as two actors - the house is not in fact, "Deathtrap" is equivalent. "is not so much a intelligence battle as it is a sharp vignette of how people are not good (and never as intelligent as they think they are) and deserve everything they get . I'm just saying that both movies are great examples of the genre and worth your time and money. After all, it's America. You don't have to choose! <br /> <br /> I don't give up a lot of twists, but I don't think it's so important. I watched a DVD eight or nine times in ten years and still enjoyed chemistry and timing and mean, scary moments when things go "all pear-shaped". It's all so well done that driving becomes more important than the actual destination. <br /> <br /> Everyone who likes black-hearted comedy and intercourse in Hitchcock's filmmaking style will probably enjoy "Deathtrap".
