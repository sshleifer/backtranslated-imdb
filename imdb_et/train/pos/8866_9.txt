"COSBY", I think it's an unseen CBS hit! I'm not sure if I've ever seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. I also loved it very well. If you asked me, although I liked everything, it would have been nice if Madeline Kahn hadn't disappeared during the show. Since that happened, I've always wondered what that exhibition would have been. Everyone always gave good results, production design was remarkable, costumes were well designed and writing was always very strong. All in all, however, I suggest you see at TBS that it is being fished just when it goes off for good air
