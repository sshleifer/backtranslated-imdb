Someone had a difficult task in combining sport and romance. In fact, sports and romance come together like oil and water. So, to successfully put two examples ... well, it's equal to atomic division. I didn't think it could be done. I say first that I don't like romantic comedy in general ... but I like sports and most sports movies. This movie was a good combination of these two. Being a baseball fan, I can really understand that Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) is an enchanting Boston Redsox fan. Anyone who knows something about baseball knows the curse of a baby that has been suffering for Redsox for 86 years, and they know how nuts for baseball are many Redsox fans. Farrely's brothers did an excellent job of catching it and doing a good comedy. It was a very good movie that could ask many.
