"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, but with painting, she goes up and down with her friends in her wagon, saying hello to people in the city and trying to match everyone she knows. I think there were no movies, TVs on this day, and the girls had nothing to do but rumors. I wish she had read a little more. I like Gwyneth and I think she's a lovely young woman. He's gifted and Emma has the privilege of hearing Gwnetnet's singing. I look forward to seeing "Duette" where she thinks she sings. He is brave to speak English with all those indigenous people, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (four weddings and funerals, dancing in Lughnas). Mrs. Elton Juliet Stevenson (Really Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising participants in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American Film Reward, being none other than the director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony's Daughter Prize Winner Blythe Danner (Fingerprint Myth). Hopefully he will have a real long time. Lucky us! I liked Emma and suggested it. This is one of those old stories that are still accurate these days. Favorite Scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I especially like it when she sings a duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you didn't ask me to understand." Emma: "Your whole personality is a mystery, Mr. Knightley. I thought you were qualified." Miss Bates: "It left us speechless, quite unspoken, I tell you, and we haven't talked about that since."
