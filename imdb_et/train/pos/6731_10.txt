I appreciate it in 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * This gives an insight into what I hardly understand - surfers surf because it is all they want to do; Something else doesn't seem to them as much as surfing; It's also not a temporary thing - it's the lifespan of their boys * The film has a great history of surfing. I've never surfed, but I love to surf movies and I've seen a lot. No one taught me what this film did * The movie was very well changed. It flowed well. Interviews were outstanding * Interesting from start to finish <br /> <br /> All in all, it's as good as a documentary, as I've seen, so I have to evaluate it. The rating is 10/10
