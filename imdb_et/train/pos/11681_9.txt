Many of the comments and comments I've read about this movie say it's a pretty outdated movie and Clara Bow's performance. Although the story was quite typical for Clara's later children, I still find myself somewhat bland and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy-happy Hawaiian girl who won't let anything she loves ... never that man be married! The lack of Clara's modesty was shocking on the day, but I believe that it is the sweetness of the film and the overall fun. Although this movie is definitely not a brilliant story (actually typical), this film is Clara's ability to show the audience a laugh.
