This film seems to draw a line - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other hand, those who find it intolerable. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie has a lot of comedy that many viewers can't "get". Of course, Li's Mask looks like Bruce Lee Kato - he should be, this is a joke. A boy with a time-bomb sewn into his heart? Of course, this is a joke! Some readers are likely to ask whether this movie should be so funny, why all the redundant and gory violence? well, on the one hand, tolerance to this level of violence is actually different - from culture to culture; and although Hong Kong's viewers consider this violence to be extreme, it is definitely higher than average for HK. in extreme situations, simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After seeing decades of people without visible open wounds, many people were frightened to see the laws of Bonnie and Clyde and Wild Bunch, which put the blood all over. However, the fact is that when you take pictures with fast metal trunks, it is almost certain that the blood will shine, especially from the artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese comic book movie. It is true that Spiderman's movies will never get that honor - but if they were real, they would! Well, despite your comic book, this movie is real to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is flashy, too stylized filming and editing. If the makers of this movie shot it with a Hollywood-style nostalgia (such as Rocketeer or the recent Sky Captain), I doubt anyone would offend. <br /> <br /> But as it is, I still had fun to watch this movie.
