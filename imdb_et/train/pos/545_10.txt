Postcards will never be able to live the original. This certainly proves true. However, if you're a big fan of the original, it's definitely the watches. Although the camera's work is incomplete, Brian Krause's character is annoying and the plot is a click, it's much more fun than the first one, and that's what I find in this entertainment. <br /> <br /> Do not see the same performance as the first movie while waiting for this movie. Frankly, it is a bit different. Instead of sitting in your cockpit, writing scenarios, Stanley has tried to steer his dream project, Cabin by the Lake, into Hollywood. This film has a lot of different feelings, but it's still great when you see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I give it to 6 out of 10.
