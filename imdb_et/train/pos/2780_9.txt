Great movie - I loved it. Editing and using a good soundtrack. There is a real sense of Indian life, but we can all relate. Some big characters were well selected. The movie develops all the characters, so you really care about them all and feel that you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some football scenes is great and the direction really works because everything comes out as real and natural. You can't just grab Jess in this movie! The action was really good, even the tomboyish walking and body posture of both leading women is very convincing as someone who played a lot of football.
