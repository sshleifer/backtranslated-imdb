I love it when they really do the sport story. So much has been so hokey in the past that it was embarrassing to look. Not that. It's just a really nice movie, an old-fashioned story - and it is based on a real person who did what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a high school coach, who is spoken in a lifetime of living to become a professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal to bring it to bigger leagues, even if it was a very short stint. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are nice people you drink, from Quaid to his high school team players, his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now some star in television). <br /> <br /> Quaid is likely to play Jim Morris because, unlike previous sports events, he knows to throw the baseball. She looks like a jug, a man who can do it 90 miles per hour. And most of this movie is true, as a real life jug in one DVD documentary. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for a nice, inspiring real lifestyle movie, you won't get it wrong.
