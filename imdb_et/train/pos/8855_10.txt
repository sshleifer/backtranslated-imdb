Sydney Lumet, though one of the oldest active directors, still got the game! A few years ago, he shot "Find me guilty", a proof for everyone that Vin Diesel can actually act when he gets the opportunity and the right director. If he had retired after this movie (a real masterpiece), no one could blame him. But he is still strong, his next film has already been announced in 2009. <br /> <br /> But we're here for this movie. The cast list is incredible with their cutting edge performance. The little nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and / or the situations developing throughout the film are just amazing. The film (time) structure that keeps your toes all the time, mixing timelines so smoothly that editing seems natural / flawless. The story is heightened, even though it would have been at least a good film (Drama / Triller) even in a "normal" time structure. I can only highly recommend it, the rest is about you! : o)
