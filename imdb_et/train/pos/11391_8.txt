The American in Paris is a presentation by Gene Kelly. See how Gene sings, acts and dances her way through Paris in every situation. Some are purely majestic, others are pure corn. One can imagine what Kelly was doing when he made this movie just one year before "Sing 'In The Rain". He's definitely one of the greatest ever. It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the only major difference being that one is in Paris, the other in LA. Some have said that Leslie Caron's behavior was less than pure. Perhaps Cyd Char, who was originally intended for the role, would be better, but Caron is quite credible in this role and has Kelly chemistry. Oscar Levant's short role in this film gave him just the right thing, someone who doesn't look like Gene Kelly. Role playing is not an easy task, but Levant did so much with the class as no other driver. <br /> <br /> The routine of singing and dancing is perfect. Even the long ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film than without. Seeing that there wasn't really much time on the screen to make such a loving relationship credible, Minnell used that sequence to feel like I had spent four hours with them. Awesome! <br /> <br /> I should rate this movie with Singin because it is very similar to story and song. Singin 'barely got Debbie Reynolds resurrection. <br /> <br /> Complete recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
