There should be more movies about our local Americans. In particular, I think the use of real true Indians would be right. I know that Archie Belaney, played by Pierce Brosnan, did a great job of portraying this character because she was an Englishman. But my proposal to Hollywood is to put more American Indians in roles and never use anyone else. Sioux Nation is a burner burner for too long. Their poverty is disgraceful for our country. My firm belief is that our country should return Black Hills to Sioux. We ask Israel to return to their country for the Arabs, but we are not trying to do that, we should be ashamed. We have to practice what we proclaim!
