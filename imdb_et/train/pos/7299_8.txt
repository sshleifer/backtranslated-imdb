A poorly cast, terrible script that is full of holes, a hot blonde gets eaten alive. An evil scientist has a serious nasty mustache, one man takes out a trained armed attack and comes out of victory, terrifying special effects. monster ... Awesome. The only thing missing was one of the unnecessary graphic sex at the time of killing. Haha. Good fun, full of predictable turns and ridiculous linings. I enjoyed this movie very well, but before you watch it, make sure you laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch the movie and not take it seriously. I can't think that this movie is made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch and sit and just enjoy it, I think you can enjoy the movie as it was intended. Very easily. So get some popcorn and a few beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. It brought joy to my life.
