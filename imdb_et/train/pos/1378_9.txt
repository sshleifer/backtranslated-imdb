I saw this little Belgian pearl two days after I saw "American Teen". Don't do it wrong, the adolescent is a roller-skater, be it American or European. "Naissance des Pieuvres" (or as the US "Water Lillies") is a story of young 15-year-old girls (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes resembles a young Scarlett Johansson), a cool, retired girl who wants to be in a school swimming team , just another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It's more than obvious that Marie is more than Floriane. Among them, Marie is a pretty soft, unpleasant friend, Anne, who just wants a boy like every other girl in her age. Along the way, we have shown the usual teenage pastime (broken hearts, shop lifting, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). It's a quiet little movie that takes time to work on your system (Michael Bay fans, note that the pace here is s-l-o-w, so it's clear), but if you don't have a problem, Water Lillies is charming. There is no rating here, but it will distract language, nudity, adult situations due to hard "R".
