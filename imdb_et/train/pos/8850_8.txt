Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his best films in his historical career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story of a single child's dysfunctional. With A-lists headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Oscar-worthy presentation here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney, Lumet has taken into account not only botched crimes such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories, such as Traditional People. <br /> <br /> Many viewers may be confused and feel that Lumet has been here to build a plot. Instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone through the Tarantino route and shows that the central scene of the robbery has gone wrong from a different perspective. Personally, I found it to be very satisfactory and left me constantly thinking what would happen next. The script is very strong with some great scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tome, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are in full control, and Lumet is probably fun to lead a style he doesn't usually dig. A lot of action and intercourse to keep the audience up to two hours running is a rare film that isn't disappointing at one point.
