The story is about a little colony growing girl in Africa, but that's so much more. <br /> <br /> Anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things. Longing for another, one of a different race that cannot be filled. Even a look is forbidden. No need for words. Their facial expressions say everything. <br /> <br /> This is a black servant Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they don't get each other. <br /> <br /> Little girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) is lonely and spends her time with Protée. She really doesn't see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the most irritating aspects of film is colonial laziness. They can't even dress in bed. There's the world coming to an end; they just don't know it yet. Their racist attitudes are erased in their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I would like to visit this Africa. It seems so quiet; especially at night when you only hear animals.
