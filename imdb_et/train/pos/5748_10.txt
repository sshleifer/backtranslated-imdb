This movie was great - the emotional power of Tom Hulce's and Ray Liotta's performances brought tears and joy to my eyes - this film shows that there is still hope in the world. If this film had been released at the end of 1988 instead of Rain Man, Hulce would certainly have been at least the best actor for Oscar. Definitely a must-have!
