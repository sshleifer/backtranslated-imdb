The pilot of the NBC series was Ghost Story (TV film 1972). The film was well written and worked well and thought that as 1972-73. The beginning of the years started with the TV series, when the TV series has a side of the film, the NBC has a winner. (I want this movie to be available on video!) The series was a colossal disappointment - even with William Castle like an exec. manufacturer. But if you have the chance to see the Ghost Story movie, check out this. You don't have to be disappointed.
