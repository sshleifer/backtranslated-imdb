I have read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that 9/11 is a shocking history. There are some who think that the added narrative is weak and I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers who discovered each other after the disaster and the tony angle. But I do not believe that narration is not necessary. Like many theorists, I think our own lives are stories. We live and do our autobiography. So when we talk about our lives, it's always in the form of a story. We cannot summarize such facts as: Birth, Childhood, High School, etc. We create the story of our life. <br /> <br /> As we know the stories, we also want to tell the story of history. Because the story we can identify ourselves. We can better understand what has happened in history when it has made a story. So it's a goal to add a story to a documentary. The story is weak, yes, but we understand what's going on. If I were out there, I'd be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> And another point that makes it burst. True, it's been recent to come up with 9/11 on a big movie. Nevertheless, there has been little on this subject, but none of them is such a documentary. But what if the film takes place in about 5 years? I agree that it is wrong to try to make a lot of money on September 11th. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to report history. How many films about World War II have we seen? If I hadn't seen these movies, my opinion would be completely different for WW. I remember seeing Schindler's list and I shouted for an hour. Films give you a good picture of what has happened in history, and while it is a fiction, it contributes to the memory of disasters and accidents. <br /> <br /> So my idea: telling stories is not always bad, it makes us identify the story and never makes us forget what happened.
