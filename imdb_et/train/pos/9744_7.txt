"Yes, Georgio" is a light and enjoyable movie / comedy with beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I've seen more than once. Some reviewers suggested that if you wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, they would probably be better off if they took the opera to a DVD. Although a complete opera can be a better representation of Pavarotti's opera lesson, opera often needs costumes and has a story that completely hides the person's appearance and character. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarottiel to use his speech and show personality and character in a way that the opera would not be. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seemed to be an incredible story; I disagree. Extremely talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming that smart and beautiful people occupy. In addition, people who are very different from each other often understand their own self and grow in positive ways when they communicate with people who stretch or take them in directions that they themselves would not have chosen. Both Georgio and Pamela open up unexplored unexplored parts that are interconnected. <br /> <br /> Unleash and release Pavarotti's visual vocal abilities in a visual and phonetic way. Puccini Turandot's end scenes are the only time to get there.
