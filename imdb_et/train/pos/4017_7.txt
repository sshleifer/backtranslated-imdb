This is a very memorable western spaghetti. It has a great story, interesting characters and some very good exhibitions, especially by Rosalba Neri. His role as the evil taste of this film is truly classic. He steals every scene he has and expresses so much of his face and eyes, even when he's not talking. His performance is very plausible. He can be quite enchanting without being up (not because there is something wrong). Mark Damon is also surprisingly good in this film. <br /> <br /> The music score is great and the theme song is one that plays with your head continuously for days after watching a movie, whether you want it. or not. There are a couple of parts that are very entertaining. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri dresses in front of the parrot. There are also many sliding weapon games that are very well done. <br /> <br /> I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first is a silly bar room that takes about 25 minutes to film. This is one of the most ridiculous views I've ever seen in the movie. It is very poorly choreographed and is more like a bad musical dance number than any real fight. This can be forgotten when it came to Terence Hill / Bud Spencer's comedy, but it is more serious in the West and the robbery was really more realistic. The other thing that irritated me about this movie was Yuma's coward who was an insane Mexican sidekick. I think he was supposed to be a comic relief or something, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in such a movie, and he wasn't funny at all. Can I tell you where Tuco is when you need it? All that has been said, let me assure everyone that I read that Johnny Yuma is a classic western spaghetti, regardless of the mistakes mentioned, and all the genre fans have to see this movie.
