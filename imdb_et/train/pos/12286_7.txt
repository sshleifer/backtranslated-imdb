I liked the movie, first and foremost because he was talking about an interesting story, but the story he was talking about in the movie seemed to be a much narrower story. Since the book is over 400 pages, it makes sense. This includes the period from the 1920s to the 1970s, a fictional South American country, as well as a lot that fits the time available. I think it would have been much better than a six-hour mini-series when it appeared as a 140-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Although it's rushed, the story doesn't leave so much that it gets confused. They are fairly well spoken. One mistake is that Clara's supernatural powers seem inconsistent; whether they should have appeared more evenly during the film or they should have left out. Two more flaws (which could be spoilers): Esteban's final smile returns somewhat too steeply, and the Ferula curse seems to wear out, though the story tone shows that it should last forever. <br /> <br /> Operation is great. Glenn Close, like the tortured spinster Ferula, is outstanding. Jeremy Irons, like a brutal self-proclaimed rich man, is also great. Meryl Streep, the main character of Clara, is great, although she is often even better than this movie. There were also many well-done minor roles. The biggest fault is that the film did not have a fracture coach; Every actor seemed to speak a different emphasis.
