I still have a sharp, late night, non-cable, cheap VHS with this show back from waaaaaayyyy, as late-night ads and everything, if I stop for any strange hour they would hit with this show - just so I can to hit this tape. <br /> <br /> The series wasn't really about Freddy Kreuger - only the first few episodes actually made him something other than the Rod Serling-esquire announcer. Instead, each episode was a special nightmare, using traditional horror themes that were terrible childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating and ... hmm ... dating. episode where a teenage boy inadvertently says, "I love you forever" with a wrong girl and is stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow together ...), where the young stewardess goes home with a strange man to find herself in her cab, where she has a trophy room with other flight attendants, and one just remembers me vaguely, comparing the blind days with hockey (and the resulting injuries and penalties) - dating was certainly a more terrifying thing in the series. <br /> <br /> One episode was a Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) motivated pizza trader with a delicious new secret ingredient. Not original, but still creepy and fun .... <br /> <br /> Although some episodes were great. My personal favorite was "This is a miserable life" where a young man tries to work with his parents' burger union when he wants to go to college. Stuck spoke to himself and makes a small puppet theater with old cheeseburgers - until one late night, when a strange guy goes through the race and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not Freddy, just a thug with a gun - it turns out that the whole desperate episode is just that - the last thoughts that pass the child's head ... with the ball. <br /> <br /> The other half of the same episode (many of Freddie's nightmare episodes were essentially two vague short stories) followed by his girlfriend, who was also wounded but not killed in a car ride and taken to a "hospital heck". the most horrible hospital nightmare clich√©s and then some - from accidental mouth stitching - or waking up during surgery - that your dead boy will try and lure you into the morgue for a little cry. <br /> <br /> Again, this was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some episodes were dirty, like ALL ONE ONE WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN WEBSITE. They put the cracks in the series and no one likes them, thinks the exhibition is stupid, and then they don't put the video any more. It's an unhappy life available only on PAL DVD in England - but I still buy it.
