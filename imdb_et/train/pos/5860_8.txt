A fun game that offers fun and simple gameplay and fair play. What's left for the comic and giving a low curve gives something to the game that you can't see in most action cameras today. Also, used quotes and animated scenes (though long animations are replaced with slideshows in Nintendo 64) make full use of platform capabilities.
