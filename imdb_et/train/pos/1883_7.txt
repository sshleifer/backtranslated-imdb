Great comedy, celebrated by Dudley Moore, supported by Liza Minnell and, in good words, John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to a multidimensional family who was close to getting $ 750 million, provided he married a second multimillion family (Susan). Basically, Arthur accepted the conditions, but eventually he refused when he met a nice and poor Linda Maroll (Liza Minnel). Arthur was just a parasite because he didn't work, just enjoyed himself hard and having fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just a few minutes before the wedding. The end was lucky for Linda and Arthur, although the latter knew that her life would change in the future. This comedy is a good lesson for everyone. Rich people are usually not satisfied with their lifestyle.
