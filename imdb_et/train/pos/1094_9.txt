This is one of the few comedies I can look at over and over and laugh out loud. In other places I have read complaints against racism and sexism from the sacred, politically correct. Nor is it here if you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family using a colored girl. <br /> <br /> The lines are fun and all the drivers have never been better. Melvin Douglas is particularly brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have ever thought or tried to build a new house, you are free to find out that no matter how sad this process is, no matter how much lamb is wolves you know, you are not alone!
