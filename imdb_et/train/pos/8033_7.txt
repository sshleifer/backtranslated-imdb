Zane and Beringer keep you on the edge of your seats. I don't usually go to military / war movies, but it was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was also humorous. Beringer's character has proved heroic and honest. No matter what, you know he has your back. <br /> <br /> Zane's character has evolved throughout the film. He was not just a suit, he really proved he could be a hero and handle a gun. <br /> <br /> Finish a little over me. It didn't go into the whole movie, but I'm glad I saw it. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out.
