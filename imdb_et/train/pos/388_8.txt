... and I love it. A lot of special effects and for a movie that is not made from a mega-budget, this movie will do a great job of creating a truly fantastic masterpiece. I'm one of those men who didn't understand this story, but it was still a great watch. It's definitely in the standards that go beyond Bors of the Rings, and in parallel with movies like Harry Potter. That says a lot about the film, made a fraction of the budget for these international hits. <br /> <br /> The one thing I really love about this movie is that it expands on the future adventure movie envelope out of Hong Kong. The theme is exotic and original. The quality of production is different from everything from HK to the fantasy channel, and the acting is great. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies from Hong Kong, this is the film of fantasy movies in Hong Kong, and I hope they will continue to work in this field until they cross Hollywood adventure films. <br /> <br /> Just fantastic.
