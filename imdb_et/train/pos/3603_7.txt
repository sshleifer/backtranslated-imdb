"Girlfight" is much more of an age class than it is a fight. And what is the relief in a city school with natural, realistic latinos and the credible use of Brooklyn project settings. <br /> <br /> It made me realize that almost all of Hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbs or small towns. (Even a somewhat comparable "Love and Basketball", which focused on teenagers in African Americans, was set in the suburbs.) Although these children share the same problems, these issues are reduced compared to the struggles of other children where graduation from high school can be a great achievement for their lives. <br /> <br /> The feminist element here is riveting in its originality when you hold your breath to see if it has a relationship - and victory - under its own conditions. Many of the audience's sympathy goes to the guy who is challenging to rise to gender-folding expectations. <br /> <br /> Film does not drag here and there, but it is not cheap Rocky's thrill to fight the film, because practices and struggles have complicated results and all relationships - especially with fathers and father numbers - take more center than middle . <br /> <br /> There were many interesting music credits at the end, but I didn't know the songs very well. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 10/7/2000)
