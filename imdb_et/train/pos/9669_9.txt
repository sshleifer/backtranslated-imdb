After reading the original game, I thought it would have been much harder to adapt to the screen than it was. Donal McCann puts a one-off spectacular performance, such as the public Gar, a repressed antagonist who appears on the screen openly (but invisible to others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays great "screws" whose inability to communicate their feelings is only suitable for Gar. <br /> <br /> Be sure to rent if you can find it. (Unlikely to be available outside Ireland and the UK)
