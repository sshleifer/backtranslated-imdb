I am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film (which I saw for the first time since it first appeared in the early fifties) has recently been so badly received. In my opinion, this is greatly underestimated - but maybe it is more of a European sense of humor than (for example) Americans: maybe we in Europe understand and appreciate our nuances and situations more because we are closer to some of them in real life! Particular mention should be made of limited but good music - a particularly pleasant and memorable song "It's Good, Good Evening", which was given in the 50s in a separate HMV 78 rpm (10 inches plum label, in my opinion!). I invite all interested parties to try if you have the opportunity: you may have a pleasant surprise.
