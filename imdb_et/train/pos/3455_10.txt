Steven Spielberg (at 24) had already directed two great episodes from the 1971 series "Psychiatrist", where Roy Thinnes played. One episode was an emotionally disturbed 12-year-old boy and the other was a living young man (Clu Gulager with his best result) who dies of cancer. Both episodes were stunning, visually different from TV and emotionally complex and adults. The creators of the "Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link who created Columbo and also made their first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk demanded "Columbo" experienced TV drivers such as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight during the first season of the first season. But Falk agreed with Spielberg after looking at part of the "Psychiatrist" episode of Clu Gulagher. <br /> <br /> Spielberg says from the "Duel" DVD that he loved Steven Bochco's "Book Murder" script. Levinson / Link Story) and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature, even thought he had a lot less money. <br /> <br /> This "Columbo" episode is far more visually stylish and better utilizes soundtrack and background music than almost all other "Columbo" episodes, although the series always used top leaders. Spielberg is able to hold too much Falki and Cassidy, but both participants are still very fun. Spielberg also has Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All the performances have their freshness and vitality. The only "well-managed" episode of Columbus is "By Dawn's Early Light" episode with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think the two episodes "The Psychiatrist" and this "Columbo" episode suggest that Spielberg is not technically as much as a director. He was excellent from the start. In "Combat!" The 1962 episode guest DVD commentary by Albert Salmi, says Robert Altman, that the episode was as good as ever as a director. Perhaps the same applies to Spielberg.
