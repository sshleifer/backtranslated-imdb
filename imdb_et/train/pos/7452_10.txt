I'm a big fan of Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and it's one of the best! It's funny, romantic and classic. I recommend it for all ages. It's great for kids because it's fine, Cinderella and great for adults and teens because it's funny and not up. I looked at it when I was little and I still look at it. It has great features that my family and I always quote. The actor is great and it will never get old. If you like fairy tales and romance, you love it. I've been watching a lot of Cinderella movies of my time and that's the best of them all. (Excuse me for Disney) I recommend showing this movie and all of the Faerie Tale Theater. They all love every age and are all unique and very fun.
