Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer and Kramer with Pan's Labyrinthi's imagination. Even the original special effect seems to give the Pan Labyrinth. But this is the story that is happening today, not sixty years ago in the war, and so it has more resonance. Jake's closet is a boy, the only child who is practically alone in summer holidays and is dealing with the breakdown of his family. It's a horror film, like the others and the sixth mind, the horror film of a man of thought. If you are looking for a movie, this is not your way, but if you are looking for a story that is both touching and varied and a good example, it's a movie for you. I saw in the screening that I swear that it was a moment when the whole audience shouted. I suggest you catch this movie.
