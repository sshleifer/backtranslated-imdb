One of John's Funniest, Eugene Levy's one big one, I just want the studio to find out it has to be on a DVD, I have it on a video tape, but I feel this movie deserves a DVD (and the extras would be great) Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) skit is so funny, as is the whole movie, she is also big with her girlfriend and her family, this movie doesn't seem to be on television, but it loses the most it is fun when it is broadcast on television for when you find a video I would recommend buying (ebay is a good place to find a copy) I keep my VHS up to one day when we see it on the DVD. there are so many great movies that are still not released on DVD, and that is one of them.
