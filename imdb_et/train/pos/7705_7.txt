I have seen it about ten times so there has to be something I like! <br /> <br /> 50 US sci-fi movies were pretty much mixed: they were smart and / or thought-provoking, or cheap and ridiculous cheese. The forbidden planet is a bit of both, but this rarity has a genre, a color. <br /> <br /> It was also the beginning of the script - although Shakespeare may not recognize it, it was based on timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain longevity itself, if it is well done. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a man murderer id by artificially augmented machines when a dead race was introduced 200,000 years ago. Along the way, brushing with 50's stereotypes and corn so pure that you sometimes wonder why you look at it, but always. This love triangle thing ... yuk! Disney's comic book art is still well and the covers of magazine magazines, etc., just like in 50 years. Robbie, who travels by car in the desert, is a hoot! <br /> <br /> All in all, all the bugs, the best of their kind, and we should be grateful that such pristine printings will survive.
