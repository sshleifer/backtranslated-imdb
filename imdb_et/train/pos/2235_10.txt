I really liked this movie because it is a real story of the Amazon that is part of the world that I was always interested in. I believe that the short form of the book was published shortly after the actual "Reader's Digestis" event. <br /> <br /> Since I am a "baby boom", this character and actor are my companions and for this reason I am involved with the film. I also believe that the film is valuable for teaching survival skills when the viewer follows the nature-like rivers and coastal areas where he receives help, as well as other survival methods. The most important thing was his will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. Finally, I hope that the audience will learn something about it, as well as see it as entertainment. <br /> <br /> I want the movie to appear in VHS and DVD as soon as I want to add it to my video collection. It should also be shown more often on satellite channels.
