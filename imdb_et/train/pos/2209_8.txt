I think it's a pretty good celebrity show. I liked to see Greg Kinnear as a host. There are many reasons why I said that. Although Hal Sparks was an okay host, I sometimes want Greg Kinnear not left. If you ask me, it seems that no one is left behind during this time. However, I enjoyed seeing different hosts and other people celebrities. When you ask me, it was pretty funny. Before I put it up, I have to say I miss such an exhibition. Finally, I highly recommend that you show this show to everyone you are drawing. You really enjoy it.
