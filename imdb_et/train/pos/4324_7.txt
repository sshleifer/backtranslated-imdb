You don't have to read this review. <br /> <br /> The previously reviewed Seattle pninson has already identified all the major drawbacks of this production. I can only amplify my main arguments. <br /> <br /> The expensive house was relatively late in Dicken's novel and is much darker than his earlier work. Ross Devenish has taken it too literally, who silences too much fog and mist. When Ada, Rick, and Esther appear for a half hour opening episode, it's just a relief to be in the first time for the first time. In some murmur scene it was hard to see what was actually on my TV screen. I looked all day one day, starting in the afternoon. When daylight flickered, it became less of a problem, but I have a pretty good TV and I've never had this problem ever before. <br /> <br /> Acceleration is very deliberate (ie slow). I'm sure it was intense, but it's superfluous. There are many people who are struggling with Victorian London's moisture and darkness, which is kept longer than needed to create the mood and atmosphere. A good editor can probably take several minutes of every fifty-minute episode without losing the dialogue, just by cutting some of those scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't want to overestimate these two problems. Soon it will adapt to the appearance and pace of production. The most important question is that it doesn't always speak the story very effectively. In the past, Dickens' novels are as long as the blind houses, but are not nearly as complexly drawn. For example, I recently read Nicholas Nickleby because I was interested to see how Douglas McGrath created an 800-page book in his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is full of upholstery. McGrath created great varieties of the novel while retaining all the important stories. It wouldn't be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production takes seven hours. It will probably take longer, because many elements of this twisted plot are not clear enough or well handled as they have to be. Some random examples illustrate the problems. <br /> <br /> Maid, Rosa, appears somewhere without the background, so the attachment of Lady Dedlock to her is largely unmotivated. <br /> <br /> Sergeant George's consent to the demand for Horton's handwriting by Translinhorn is somewhat fudged. <br /> <br /> It is not clear enough that Esther is actually in love with Woodcourt when he agrees to marry John Jarndyc. It is also not clear that they have agreed not to disclose their participation or why. Ada and Rick's secret marriage has been dropped. In one episode, they are just lovers, in the other case people suddenly refer to them as a spouse. <br /> <br /> Mrs Rouncewell will only be introduced at a late stage of the story and Sargeant George's alienation from her family has not been explained - as is her discovery. <br /> <br /> The dedication to the Dedlock family's honor and respect is undervalued, so its motive to persuade Lady Dedlock is less clear than necessary. <br /> <br /> Engaging bricks with both Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaque. <br /> <br /> It is not obvious that Guppy is upgrading its offer to Ester because his smallpox scars are all gone. <br /> <br /> It's just a choice: there are others. These are not big problems and the main purpose of the story is clear enough. Nonetheless, these are the little excitement that reduces this power: you should not think of the ball over the bishops. But there are still more important structural problems that weaken the story in its later stages. <br /> <br /> The whole thing about the murder of a translator is somewhat thrown away. Bucket immediately refers to Hortense as a suspect that undermines Sergeant George's reluctance and the importance of finding Mrs Rouncewell. It also reduces the effect of the sub-plan, which suspected Lady Dedlock, and weakens the scene where Hortense has come to Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> The more serious problem is that the murder, its investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock are dominated by the story over an hour, during which we completely lose the second main plot: the legal case and its impact on Rick. His unsuccessful finances, attacking Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, his declining health and so on, are on hold for the whole episode. This may happen as Dickens wrote the book (I haven't read it for years), but a good scenario should keep the different plot directions moving. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of Smallweed in the story is so reduced that it is almost superfluous. Also, his new will, which triggers the final phase of the story, will be dismissed. This happens out of the screen. <br /> <br /> However, it is still a very good product. Many performances are outstanding. Individual scenes are beautifully realized. Its tragedy is very powerful. However, I would recommend this as an excellent adaptation of an excellent book if it had not been the 2005 production. In fact, I would probably not be fully aware of its shortcomings if I had not seen Andrew Davies do better. I've criticized Davis Jane Austen's adjustments, but I have to admit that he knows how to give Dickens sprawling books. <br /> <br /> It is an impressive and thrilling drama and worth seven hours of someone's time. Nevertheless, its likely fate is to be seen primarily as cross-reference to the final 2005 version.
