I saw this movie premiere on Friday (1/19) at Park City's Sundance and it was amazingly moved. Sitting in the theater and for the first time hearing anxiety soldiers went almost over when I could do it. The other members of the audience had moved equally, and although we wanted to turn around, the least we could do was to witness, because these men and women shared our experiences. Also included were veterans of the Iraq war and Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel. Although they may now be at home, you can say that this war is still inside them and probably always. Regardless of whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the forces other than the bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
