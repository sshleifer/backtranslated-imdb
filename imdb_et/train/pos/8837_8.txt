My personal feeling is that you cannot separate this film from your political / historical background, as so many (American) reviewers do. This does not mean growing in the United States on Main Street. It is growing in Yugoslavia at a time when it was broken between East and West. Just as the guys are pulled out of Esther and everyone else, and Esther is torn between "Tovarish Joe" and the boys. In some situations, there is a shame that has been lost to an audience who has never lived under Tito. I feel the film is undervalued and it's too bad that we lost the director. Such films make freedom more important. This is not just a "second Eastern European age plan" ... it is a sensitive image for teenagers who are on a fine line that can eventually lead to their true freedom.
