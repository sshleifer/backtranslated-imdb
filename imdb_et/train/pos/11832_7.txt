Time on the beach, eh: I thought the Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there were some things that prevent me from ranking above 6 or 7 (I'm a bit generous with 7). <br /> <br /> Point # 1: Matt Damon deepens me. I thought, "what a bad voice they got for the main brother" when I first heard him - and then I realized that it was Matt Damon. The man's mistake is so bad for me - his play "The Departed" was terrible and destroyed my movie (before the film got a chance to destroy it, but it's another story for some other time) like almost "Spirit". I could ignore this fact because there was little narration there ... fortunately. <br /> <br /> Point # 2: Brian Adams Sucks ... The whole score was terrible ... The songs were unoriginal, general and poorly performed; never found music suitable; and the words were terrible. Every time one flat song came, I was off. I almost thought I was going to listen to some patriotic propaganda that slipped into the super-American freedom-style lyrics (I could not recall the terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio continuously after 9 September). In the light of the local American aspects of the film, they would have had to match the music with the music, not the little radio hit, the teen-bop, the 14-year-old girl. I thought I was back in high school. I can't believe I could have done better - I refuse. If it weren't so, I'd put the movie more with Disney, who knows something or originality (ok, don't worry, I know some of you probably think;). Too bad, it's a shame that they couldn't hire better musicians. <br /> <br /> I liked the art and the animation except for a few things here and there ... as sometimes the angles on the face seem too sharp and the muscles are too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines mostly close to the tip). It was often a time when I thought they tried too hard with emotions and facial expressions and couldn't draw a true emotion. But there were times when the emotion ran thick. Anyway, many scenes were lazy and the layers were obvious. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm sleeping here, so I'll get together before I start thinking less ... <br /> <br /> Nice to try the epic movie ... it turned out to be mediocre. Matt Damon, you do!
