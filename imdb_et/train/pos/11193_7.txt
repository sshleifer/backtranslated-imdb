I liked Lonely Lady. Give Piale a break. She looks good and has really nice eyes. What's not to like? The scene where Ray Liotta was raped with a garden hose was kind of heavy and cruel. In fact, there are many movies that happen in this movie, hard and cruel. But this is a trashy movie. Many trashy movies are not all bad. I liked it better than the Dolls Valley, which was not only trashy, but also boring. At least it wasn't boring. <br /> <br /> Pia gets naked naked and seems to be a writer. Talking to Pushkin and Byron with a three-time boy is incredible. I'm sure Pia is a nice person in real life, she just doesn't write a writer. She seemed much happier when she was working on Saturday night as a fever's hostess and wore a sparkling disco-dress. <br /> <br /> A couple of scenes are funny. That's where he talks to a double actor that he's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and clicks on him to "stop!", All the time he's practically over every bimbo who flops. <br /> <br /> Pia's nervous system is good. It was probably a mistake to go to the supernova (a swirling face whistle and a scream of the freezer - whoa!) And his subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of superfluous. <br /> <br /> The call is hoot, but. I want to see someone making this speech in a drama class. <br /> <br /> But it is a recycle bin again. In the eighties, the week was worse for any movie.
