Branagh and Fishburne give great performances in Shakespeare's classic version. Branagh plays Iago better than I have seen in a movie or stage. Some may say that this movie is too Iago-centered, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in film history, gives a powerful result. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but Venice Moor is one of his best. <br /> <br /> One problem I have with this film is the simple subtraction of several important scenes. Desdemona's character is much less deeper than the game. It may not be included in this movie at all. One of the worst cuts Branagh made in this film was the separation of the conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second show. This part of the game shows that Desdemona may not be an innocent child she depicts as in this movie. The integrity of this film was undermined by several divorces. <br /> <br /> But if you haven't read the game or seen the Othello movie version, I recommend this movie. The story, cut or not, is still incredibly appealing. As stated earlier, action is very good. If some important scenes were added and Desdemona's character is a little further set, this would be a great movie. At the moment, this is an amazing version of the original. I'll give her a marginal recommendation.
