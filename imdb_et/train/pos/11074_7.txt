Revolver is not at least an admirable attempt for Guy Ritchie, who did not want Britain's critics' total disaster or misconception masterpiece of a few fanboys demanding that he add a little substance to his conman capricious. But then there is nothing worse than an ambitious film that bites more than it can chew, especially that which uses the gangster / con-artist film framework. As can be expected from Luc Besson's producer credit, this is a definite element of the "Cinema de look": it is a sort of realistic world of fantasy where America and Britain overlap, looks good, the couple is perfectly edited and planned sequences of action and oozes style, all denote it for one-time entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than just replay her movies quickly, and she has spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe, and everything. If something is his problem, he tries to throw too many influences (a bit Machiavelli, Godard's dash, lots of chess principles), motifs and techniques, wrapping the screen with quotation marks: the movie was originally meant to end with three-minute epigrams of mobile victim corpses and sometimes it seems that he never reads a fortune cookie he didn't want to make into a movie. Instead of trading for Kabbalism, it really is more of a mix of overlapping trade principles, chess and trust tricks that mostly distract the trick to make theosophy accessible, hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical). The last third is where most of the problems can be found, because Jason Statham takes the enemy (literally) inside with many ambitious but not always successful cross-sections to contrast people's appearance. internal fear and anger, but it goes a long way. It is not worth starting a new religion, but I am surprised that he did not get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta deliberately fake red, which is too frightening?
