Call me a teenager, but I really think it's a great series. If you haven't had the chance to experience the last episode of the Star Trek series, you should definitely watch it. Maybe there is more than a Voyager caregiver who launched the Cpt series. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different, but strangely familiar ... The music is also pleasant. No real Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode - and these postpayers are welcome.
