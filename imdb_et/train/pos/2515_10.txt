Moon Child, who played Japanese rocker Hyde and Gackt, was a better film, so I waited. In fact, I was very impressive and immediately became one of my favorite films. <br /> <br /> The story of Mallepa is the story of street orphans, Sho, Sho brother Shinji and Toshi, who kidnap and kill their livelihood. In one robbery, Sho Hyde Kei meets a vampire in sunlight. Kei's eventual events show Kei's true nature, but nobody's gonna let him go. <br /> <br /> Time is passing and means the immortal, unchanging Kei has lifted Shot and has a very close bond. Then Sho and Kei will meet with Son in an outrageous arms fight and they will become a quick friend. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with their sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time goes on and shows the grown Shot, this time Kei is empty. It also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. Through a tragedy of tragedy, this film dives into life and all its difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. This is a really touching movie that is sad but beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> As for the actress, I think Gackt did a great job. Hyde did an amazing job for the first timer. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but the film has rare and short harsh images. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have to say this movie is amazing, moves and I recommend it very much.
