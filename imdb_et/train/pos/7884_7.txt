WARNING! TONS OF HIGH GIVEAWAYS !!! DO NOT READ THAT HOW IT IS THIS SYSTEM! OR YOU, AS POSSIBLE. <br /> <br /> They are some of the words that describe a movie that claims to be the last one and come out of another; Liars, Cheats, maybe even some words that can't be said. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows anyone who thought the series was getting old and wanted to see him, or the people who wanted their hero (or Villian) just to stop their final soul, this movie was it. <br /> This movie begins with the Ozz Wizard's Parody. Then you see a boy named John Doe, the last child in Springwood, Ohio, to leave and get out of Freddy's territory. A woman who lives in a hospital / place to have children on her feet, meets that boy, and at the same time a dream of a man, a water tower and his secret secret, goes back to Springwood to find out this frightening vision and soon finds out that he is a Freddy child , and we'll soon discover that Freddy can leave Springwood only when his daughter can be kind to him. And then it frightens. This film seems to have hit the nail for everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This film contains tons of humor and camouflage, such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and the very young Breckin Meyer, who plays a teenage stoner who sees a psychiatric vision of flowers and Iron Butterfly 'In- From a-gadda-da-vida, you will stick to the super Mario parody. This movie makes you hate this movie or Krueger. Best of the best.
