This 1953 Sam Fuller film contains some of his best works and is sad that he was unable to continue supporting large Hollywood studios. The story is something like that. Heavy, wide (read a prostitute) rides a hot summer day on the subway and gets his pocketbook chosen by Skip McCoy. What Skip (and dame) does not understand that he also carries some microfilms that are handed over to spies. This dialogue, without dialogue and mostly in close-ups, is a beaut, one of many that Fuller uses throughout the film. Playing Candy called Baby is Jean Peters, who was never better or better. One forgets how beautiful it was, and she's doing this role very well. Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who had already made his mark, and set his style with 1947 Kiss Of Death as a crazy scream with a horrible laugh, and although he is a little softer here, he is still scary. These hard-edged characters are soft spots here and there, but its noir and nasty. Standout's performance belongs to the excellent Thelma Ritter who plays Moe, who saves her dough for her funeral. Ritter received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his decoration, but lost Donna Reed as a B-girl (read prostitute) for a boring but popular performance "From Here to Eternity". Hollywood loves how good a girl gets bad and loves Oscar, although their performance is usually terrible. See, for example, Shirley Jones's "Elmer Gantry. There are excellent Joe MacDonald's black and white photographs and great artistic directions between the docks and dives in New York. The New York-based subway and the River Widmark made of the Cold War and the Red River are especially good. at the height of intimidation, the wool is a woolly look, played by Richard Kiley, who is much more dangerous than a pocketer who is a criminal, but is simply trying to live and above all loyal to America.
