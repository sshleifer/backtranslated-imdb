After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never turned into a theater, so I ordered BluRay. It was a great time for me to watch it and I have to say that this movie is better than some big animation films out there. Of course he has some drawbacks, but I can really recommend it. The animation is well done, very entertaining and unique, and the story keeps me going until the end. Some of the tiles are just fallen and you can see great French talent. I thought Forest Whitaker's performance seemed a little lifeless, but that is how the Lian-Chu character is depicted in this film. So in general, I liked the tiny and I love it a lot and hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue to make such great movies. I recommend giving him the opportunity and be surprised how big the film is with such a small budget. Hector alone is worth watching a movie because some of his moments are stitch-like fun.
