"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast-growing, surprising and wonderfully fun musical comedy from Warners, unfortunately overlooked. It should be remembered that only Tinseltown's official song - "Hooray for Hollywood". However, Richard Whiting's and Johnny Mercer's scores have many other gems, including the charming "I like fish out of the water" and "Moonlight silhouettes". The best musical number is "Let You Be a Lesson You", where Dick Powell and the company describe in detail the people who were "behind the eight balls", a fate that literally hits the end of the burning Edgar Kennedy. The picture shows Hollywood's glamor and punches it at once, as it gets a lot of comic passage from pompous and ego-maniac actors and duplicate studio leaders. There is a great deal of strangle comedy strangle - Allyn Joslyn as a clandestine journalist, Ted Healy as Dick Powell, Fritz Feld as an exciting restaurant patron, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall's sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy Mona Todd as Mona's sister and Hugh Herbert as her even denser father. The "racist" element mentioned in the second review is a ten-second bit, where Herbert appears in pseudo "Gone With the Wind" on the dark face. This is a questionable taste, but it should not prevent you from seeing other movie joy, especially Benny Goodman's quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!), Which I think is the only material available for this incredible jazz combo. The "Dark Eyes" sequence goes a little too long and is too late, but otherwise the "Hollywood Hotel" is a gem that is worth your time and definitely a movie that should be read to release a DVD.
