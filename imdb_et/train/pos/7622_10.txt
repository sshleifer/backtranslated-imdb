I love this example! It's like watching a mini-movie every week !!! The first episode was so captivating and frightening ... so it was pilot's 2nd part. It's a real survivor! I looked at some other comment and I see that after one or two episodes, the gentlemen here are already crying for a wolf ... Sorry, if this is not another reality, kiddies! It was once when it was ... now yourself! Real TV Shows! And it's actually good, unlike most modern rogue or copy of the law or order or NYPD blue or CSI carbon they're throwing out ... See for yourself to form your own opinion, don't take boneheads here!
