This is a very fun movie. Some of the reviews in this forum have been written by people who probably think the film was a serious drama. It wasn't done in this way. This is an extremely enjoyable film that is present on the tongue in the cheek way. All participants entertain us in a fun way. The fighting sequences are lively, brisk and above all not for free. The so-called "green death", which was used a few times, is not, as I read from one review, "bad." A few evaluators criticized the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas at the end of the film. Hey, glow ... Again, I remember that it's a fun movie. The title of each of these "fighting" stages is titled, adding a fun aspect. The actors didn't try to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chani. This is not one of those martial arts films. Ron Ely looks good in this movie and is the perfect choice for Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way to deal with the final fate of the "bad boy". I promise you that if you don't try to take this movie very seriously and just look for entertainment value, you spend 100 minutes in a more enjoyable way.
