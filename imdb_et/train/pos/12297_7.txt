Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> This version of Garbo Anna Christie, which was shot in German a year later with completely new pain, is said to have been softened and refined enough to work better than the English version (both American MGM productions). Garbo is where more was commanded (or more beautiful than the screen) and his action is more restrained. And, frankly, he seems more easily, probably for many reasons, but we can speculate that he no longer does his first talking picture, so it was quickly adapted. other, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill who plays too many words. Her themes for a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but it's so strange old-fashioned. There are no scenes - Coney Island's part is shortened and not so good - but in general it is the direct echo of the first film. Director Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French) just changes the work that I have already done, which I suppose must be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see both movies sequentially because they are exactly blocked in the same way (not just the sets, but the shots are all the same). Sometimes a random scene has been picked up from the earlier film - some of the storm, but also a short scene where Marie Dressler (from the English version) walks to her friend over the canal, drunk. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their face, we see German participants in their parts. Certainly there is no substitute for Dressler, but for me the German father is more credible and honest in his work. <br /> <br /> Of course, these are the topics of immigration, the paths of the parents, the daughters who turn to prostitution and the troubles of finding true love - at this time there are strong currents, especially in the case of European threads (Garbo is a Swedish young woman).
