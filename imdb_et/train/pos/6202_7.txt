When I started to look at "Fay Grim," I had no idea that it was a "Henry Fool" sequel. Now, the last movie I saw was not a sequel. But one has arrived and it's pretty good. I assume you've seen the original, so I won't explain it. It starts with Fay (Parker Posey) who lives with his son, whom he was with Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in jail. One day the son goes out to bring a pornographic toy to school. But it's not an ordinary toy. He has a secret that explains a lot of what happened in the first movie. And this secret deepens in geopolitics deeper than "Syriana". <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have the impression that Hal Hartley has achieved here. Maybe it's not exactly the quality of the original, but it's definitely good to see what's going on in the world. And the end pages open up the possibility of continuing the second. <br /> <br /> Also starring Jeff Goldblum.
