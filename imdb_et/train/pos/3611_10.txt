I saw this movie after I saw the Blue Crush and other Michelle movies, I thought he had a gloomy future in this business. I was extremely wrong after watching my "Girlfight" performance that I was surprised to see as a fighter but also a warrior in his emotion. In this movie, how he treats his father when he hits his brother and his brother . His character's curriculum in his film is not always able to lay the wall and hide from love, or simply because he has power, he does not win. I believe that this role was perfect for Michelle, although she had no previous experience, the director saw talent, I criticize myself for not seeing talent.
