Never looked at this movie recently in TCM and found this story about Poland and the small town that was supposed to suffer under the Nazi occupation of local cities, like many other European cities: Norway. The First World War was over, and the people of this city were still suffering from lost soldiers and wounded, who are always caused by war. Alexander Knox (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns to the war-lost leg and was a former school teacher in the city. She was raised in German and was not very pleased with the Polish people, and they did not fully accept her. When Hitler's party came to power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to get from the Nazis to return and punish the small Polish city for the treatment that was really in his mind. Marsha Hunt (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer" played a great role as a woman who lost her husband and was romanticly associated with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many setbacks and some true truths about how the Nazis destroyed their families and their entire lives. In this picture, bovine cars are shown towards the Jewish Nazi gas chambers. If you haven't seen this movie and like this topic, give it your time; this film is very underground for the 1944 film and story, which you will not forget too soon.
