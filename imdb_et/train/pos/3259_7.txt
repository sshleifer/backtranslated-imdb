It's never the best romantic comedy, but it's certainly pretty nice and observable. It is old-fashioned and works well. Cybill Shepherd, like Corinne, is not a bad woman who cannot overcome her husband's death. She has sexy maturity. But Ryan O'Neal can't talk much about Philip, because he's at best unsigned. It may be enough in its role, but it is not good enough. However, I feel that some signs, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written in sufficient detail. We don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear, the story becomes thick, and the writers don't tell us much more than what happens. But this problem was saved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a refreshing sweetness to refresh it, and Robert Downey Jr is so charming that he melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And so it happens that his big dream eyes are perfect for deja vu and kickback. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you like it, why not try it. <br /> <br />
