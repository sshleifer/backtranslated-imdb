The last hunt is a forgotten Hollywood classic west. Through Buffalo killing, genocide is in other films, but never so brave. Robert Taylor's resistance to acquired buffalo and Indian killer is his best result. In the 1950s, you and your friends fell from your mother's Saterday matin√©e and were usually western or comedy. But it was wrong then and now let the young people watch psycho-dramas like The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before they reveal them to films with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred. Why didn't Mom censor these movies? Because they were "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the last hunt is terribly terrible when the Vincent Price mutation was flying. <br /> <br /> The white buffalo mythology, which is part of the texture of this film, later hanged from other films including The White Buffalo, playing Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. The laugh here is that Bronson played the Indians. <br /> <br /> Today, a large bison cattle live in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. In winter, hunger comes from animals around the park in Montana, where they are sometimes collected by the Indians of Idaho Nez Perce under a US treaty preceded by the Lincoln Presidency. Linclon signed the Congress Act, which allowed the mainland and began to kill the buffalo.
