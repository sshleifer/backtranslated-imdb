This movie is so old that I have never understood how in 1936 I watched Ray Milland's young man, remembering him playing a big movie "Lost Weekend". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, a very rich banker. In this picture, there are three girls who are not very happy about separating their father and mother, and they find that their father marries a young blonde who is a gold digger looking for only rich sugar. They hire a man who is a very rich Count, his name is Count Arished (Misha Auer), who is drunk all the time and is imperfect and gives a lot of comic in the whole picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked to the police station and told the police chief she was an opera star, and then Penny starts to sing with the most fantastic soprano I have heard, the whole police department and the convicted people started to shake what was the movie Fun and enjoyable scene. This is Deanna Durbin's first film debut, and she became a success for the night and, after leaving MGM, got a great movie with Universal Studios.
