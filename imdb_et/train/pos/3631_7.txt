The film actually has a pretty good story, but it is stuck in many key locations. It's almost like a leader when the director threw the movie together, without taking the time to make some important cuts in the movie. Dennis Quaid does a decent job in his role ... but there are some obviously missing key scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5-hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2-hour movie. And, apparently, it would have been a much better film if he didn't feel like it had been thrown together. <br /> <br />
