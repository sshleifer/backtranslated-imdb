This film surprised me pleasantly. It has a touching, slightly centered approach that does not lose your attention. It's a movie I've never heard of, but if you want a "sleeping place" then that's it. Great for writing, producing and acting. I highly recommend it to the audience who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why not make this movie more?
