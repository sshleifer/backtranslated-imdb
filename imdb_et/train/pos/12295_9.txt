"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carné movie from 1936 to 1946, with dialogues not written by Jacques Prévert, but Henri Jeanson.Janson was much more interested in Jouvet / Arletty than a couple of lovers Annabella / The latter is quite boring and their story resembles strangely Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour", except that the story of chanteus is tragic. What's exciting today is the popular little world, channel Saint-Martin settings. <br /> <br /> This movie is another very special reason for French films. Pimp Jouvet tells his lawyer Raymonde that he wants an air exchange (atmosphère) because he doesn't understand the meaning of the world atmosphere, whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty) thinks it is offensive and he brings that line that is arguably the whole French cinema most famous: <br /> <br /> French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Este ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?" Translation: "The atmosphere? The atmosphere? Do I have a face? This is our French language "no one is perfect".
