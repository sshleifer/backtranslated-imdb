What a awesome movie! It was a very scary, exemplary, well-written, nice plot twist, interesting characters, a very good direction and a surprise that leaves a smile on your face. This is one of the popcorn horror flick that may not be attractive to non-spooky fans, but is still one of the best thrillers today! I recommend it only to fans: <br /> <br /> 1) horror genre <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) actor or actor present. <br /> <br /> *** out of **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS - I am sick and tired of people who compare it and other modern horror movies with SCREAM. You know what they didn't want to be like SCREAM. Everything is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". Well, if I don't mind, SCREAM copied other movies! In fact, almost every horror movie has been copied before. However, SCREAM was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is! <br /> <br /> EASY AND EXCLUDE THIS! <br /> <br />
