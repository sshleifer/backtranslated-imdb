The man from the snow river II does not re-invent the wheel, but is a beautiful film that captures some great notes. <br /> <br /> For those fans who want to hit the elements that made the original man's snowy river movie a hit (breathtaking scenery, wide-ranging score, sweet romance and cracking), this movie really offers. This story rises a few years after the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) has gathered his fortunes off the horse herd. He returns when he left with his cute, bred sweetheart Jessica (played by the adorable lady of Aussie Sigrid Thornton), who is still trying to break her beloved upbringing in her feather herd (Harrison now plays with American Brian Dennehy). Jimi's Foil and the Shattering Character is a top-notch top-class sniper Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) with his own sights in Jessica. Add some social tension to the blend that surrounds the lands and the slave, who has a bad attitude to the first film and that is the plot. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the actor. Tom Burlinson fits tightly with Jim's broad-edged and laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and two are leading the real chemistry screen. Filling the solid shoes of Kirk Douglas was never easy and Brian Dennehy's stomps and screams, but never feel very authentic in this regard. <br /> <br /> Music is sweeping and lush, and cinematography can be a roll of Victoria's tourist roll. At the moment, however, it feels like it is very self-conscious, as the director wants another helicopter image from the passengers to show how wonderful the landscape is without a person's personal drama. A little more grain would have been enough here, we are Aussie, we can take it! There are some JAWSish moments where you cannot win faith. But the funny thing about this movie is that some of the outstanding clich√©s include some truly inventive and touching scenes. Jim put a saddle on a slave (VERY Horse Whisperish before his time) Jim and Jessica, who founded the home, a stunning scene where Jim shows Alistair's riding with his trusty whip. I see why this sign is such an icon. <br /> <br /> There is a very nice sequel. Here's the hope that everyone involved wants to do it. man from snow in river III: CRAIGS. I'm sure we all would love to see Jim and Jessica doing on their farm. <br /> <br /> Aussie DVDs have a few extra scenes. Worth if you are already a fan.
