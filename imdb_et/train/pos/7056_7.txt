The order of the increasingly popular Cinderella story reminded me somewhat of what they did with one movie “Beauty and the Beast”. It's basically three short stories that have been rolled into 1. <br /> <br /> OK, the mice are divine (I love Gusi! He's so cute!) and Lucifer's awesome (as usual). I also liked some of the newer characters (Pom Pom was divine and I did like Prudence.). However, the story was somewhat limited, but still very cute. So, I will vote 7/10.
