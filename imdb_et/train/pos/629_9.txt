The 14-year-old in me is very happy that they are now able to make a fantastic view of fantasy films and that they are all the rage with the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia. cash in hand. This year we see (and have already seen) a number of other, especially the golden compass, which has the most exciting trailer this year. Stardust, based on Neil Gaiman's novel, showed a bit more in theaters this week than peep. I didn't see any previews for this, but a few ads. The critical reaction is such a blah. I wouldn't even have seen it, if not because I have to wait for a friend to see Bourne's ultimatum, and that no other interesting thing opened this weekend. Well, if you forgive a terrible punishment, the stars must be properly aligned, because I went to see Stardust and I loved it. It's not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very ordinary fantasy search (the hero is trying to find the fallen star) that is full of obstacles. But within this basic review, the story is lively and imaginative. Its purpose is just to be a fun and charming little romance. And it works great. There were many great movies this summer, but none of them were as much fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is well-communicated and almost completely coherent. This is not a masterpiece, but it can certainly be the same as something a princess's bride is (although I don't like it as much as the previous film). Here's a lot of fun when you're a fan of the genre.
