This complicated story begins quite easily when the English journalist accepts the contribution of Edgar Allen Poel and his friend Lord Blackwood that he cannot stay at the haunting Blackwood Castle. Then the writer traveled in dusty rooms and corridors until he left an empty space for the music and glimpse of the pair. She sits on the harpsichord and starts to play what she has heard and is surprised to suddenly succeed with the beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. He informs him of the vague charming / frightening way he has prepared his room and that someone is always waiting for that night ... the night of the dead. That's how an astounding number of supernatural events begin to disturb the journalist over the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: Probably not surprising too many viewers to find out that lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost. It does not prevent her from loving a journalist, but makes it more difficult for them than the average pair. It's a fun movie that has absolutely everything: ghosts, spooky castle, recurring visions of past events, sex and violence (though both are under tidy in most American years.) The charming, exciting Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. He has a strange charisma, unlike the others you've seen in movies. Recommended!
