This schlockmaster William Castle documentary takes some of the cheap shots of the naive 50s in the midst of his most characteristic work - watch funny, stupid people with ghost glasses - but it's also gentle and lively with white comments from John Waters who was at that time absolutely a target group, and a girl from the castle who adored her father and is also quite understandable how she wanted her craft. (We'll never know what got of other Castle descendants.) Movies were not very good, it makes it clear, but his marketing was great, and he seems to have been a sweet, hardworking family man. Fun people open up like "Straight Jacket" by Diane Baker, who looks great, and Anne Helm, whom she replaced with a letter by Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman all but explodes into a wealthy memory to work with Castle Tingler, and there is enough material to give us an idea of ​​the level of talent in the castle - not very high, but very energetic. A pleasant look at the time when the audience was more satisfied and it makes you nostalgic for the simplest movie days.
