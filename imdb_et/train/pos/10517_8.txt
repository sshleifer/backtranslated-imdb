Jane Austen's satirical classic classic marriage game in this class between 18th and 18th century England classrooms. Northam and Paltrow are the right mix for friends who have to go through jealousy and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a permanent round that goes a long way in explaining the accessibility of obsolete source material (which is a bit tighter in skepticism). I liked the look of the movie and how the shots were created, and I thought it didn't rely too much on headdresses like most other films from the 80s and 90s. Very good results.
