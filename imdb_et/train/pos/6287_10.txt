In 60 seconds, a very good comedy movie that made over $ 100 million, but most of the critics burst, has gone. Personally, I thought it was a great movie. The story was plausible and is probably the biggest cast on this film, including 3 academy award winners nicolas cage, robert duvall and a very hot anjolina jolie. Other than a flat stunt at the end it is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (****)
