"This man's navy" is, as other remarks have shown, a rare and well-filmed look at the navy's lighter air (LTA) action. The LTA teams were fairly proud that their shaded convoys never lost their vessels that were underwater. And filming at different NAS locations gives a valuable look at the long-lasting type of aviation. The first half of the movie, however, is about Beery, his relationship with service providers, and his meeting with Tom Drake's character and mother, and the confirmation of Drake's leg. Only then will the second film begin. The second film is mostly LTAs that take on the surface, boys kill and cause much damage. The look is quite tough and realistic. Then we move to Southeast Asia. Does the Navy have LTAs there? Don't forget that this part is really wild, using some of the fallen flight crew withdrawn from the jungle. And the jaws are shooting like crazy. Vietnamese tones, except holidays, are oh, so calm. We're talking about that. After all, there is a good WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.
