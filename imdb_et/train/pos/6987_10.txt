UFO "thing" set aside. It was the best documentary I've seen. Neil and Buzzi's factual reports ... must be seen. Interviews and reporting are revelations because most of the information is confidential in 1969 and was only published in 2006. There are currently no documentary documents with such a short 47-minute accuracy or precision ... FACTS captures you and is left with awe for the first months of the month ... They and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Ever see a man saving his life? Don't bet. They save their lives when only milliseconds separated him from death. Amazing watch. It's travesty people who haven't known all the details related to the month of landing, and the courage that these men had before a certain death on a failed computer ... 10 stars!
