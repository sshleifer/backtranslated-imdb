This movie is underestimated. I love it. It was really sweet and cordial. A family struggling but not a dysfunctional family, which is so typical of films today. The film did not cause the problem that they had little money or the Dominican Republic, how Hollywood is. <br /> <br /> Instead, the question is Victor is immature and must grow. She slowly ends the movie. He has the opportunity to go, but it was a cordial attempt to move on. Her grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws me was laughing for the longest time. A truly cordial indie
