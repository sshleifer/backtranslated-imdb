I was happy to see it during the film festival and I saw it as hard as I saw that I came back the next evening after my third session. A funny, wild and sharp toothed attack on every side of mainstream entertainment that is passively swallowed up by the lowest common denominator target, led by a single-man journalist who slowly takes members to fight their predictability. The movie is everything and it is filled in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you have been renewed with hope after renewing your hopes and excited that the original films can still be done. Anyone who is disappointed with unfulfilled expectations to imagine something with their imagination will hardly see the object hunted (and I mean this yacht). For fans of the Fight Club and all of Charlie Kaufman's films and for viewing all who avoid multiplexes like rabies.
