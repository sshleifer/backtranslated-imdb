it may not be war and peace, but two academies would not have come if it wasn't the genius of James Wong Howe ... <br /> <br /> this is one of the few films I have been in love with as a child and gone back with dissatisfaction. Whether you are interested in fiction or not, BB & C is a visual party. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's the best job. but the appearance of this movie is amazing. I love it all; Elsa Lanchester, cat, crazy hoo-doo, retro-center; but the way it was put on the film is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even like the contradictions and "special effects" on this page, which are now retroactive. it all creates a truly consistent world.
