So Mary and Rhoda are outdated - who's not? I was doing Mary's premiere and "young adult" when she left the air. Yes, it was nice to see Mary and Rhot together, and yes, maybe the movie didn't support the original comedy, but there were enough moments that resembled a series of minds to make it suitable for respect. Example: A manufacturer who hires Mary and then dictates a new series of "old people" ideas. Is it not typical of the modern beacons of Hollywood television and movie? It may not be MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW your best - but it's pretty damn good to look back one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s.
