18 Directors had the same task: to talk about love stories in Paris. Of course some of them were better than others, but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - besides, wouldn't it be boring if they all had the same vision of love? I will describe the segments (which may change in the second viewing): <br /> <br /> 1. Quartier Latin <br /> <br /> Gérard Depardieu One of the greatest French actors has ever drove my favorite segment where it's always wonderful Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Funny and delightful. <br /> <br /> 2. Tour Eiffel by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Cute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of the Belleville triplets) story of a small shop whose parents are mime; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", Ethan and Joel Coen. <br /> <br /> Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Funny <br /> <br /> 4. Parc Monceau by Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También", "Children's Children"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5th Place des Fêtes, directed by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6. Here is the 14th "Arrondissement", a wonderful look at Alexander Payne ("Elections", "Schmidt") for the miserable side of life. undervalued character actor Margo Martinda (Hilary Swank's mother "Million Dollar Baby") as a lonely, middle-aged American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. Faubourg Saint-Denis, the frantic style of Tom Tykwer ("Run Lola Run") is a story of a young actor (Natalie Portman) and a dark man (Melchior Beslon) who fall in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (in addition to Alexander Payne's curious comrade ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème", Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (a simple but moving story of talented Brazilian directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. Quartier des Enfants Rouges, Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), sad story feat. always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; 11. "Le Marais," Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Believers (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. Quartier de la Madeleine by Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine" by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14th Place des Victoires, Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille", Isabel Coixet (submissive director of "My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. Pigalle, Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. Montmartre by and with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. Porte de Choisy, Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (commonly known as "Barfly", "Fortune Restructuring" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I can classify some segments as bright and others as medium (or even a bit boring), but none of them are bad. All in all, I'll give "Paris, Je t'Aime" 8.5 / 10 and suggest what it is: a lovely mosaic of love and other things.
