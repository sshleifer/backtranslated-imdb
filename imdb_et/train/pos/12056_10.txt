Although I've loved haunted house movies like Amityville and Polterge, it's made to customize Susan Hills's book on TV, which contains a huge hit against Hollywood horrors. <br /> <br /> With great pain (many of which are heartbeats and other TV shows), superb exemplary and fantastic settings (convincingly depicting life in the 1920s) are all the right ingredients to attract the viewer to a powerful ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence or gore to send chills under the back of the audience. Using her imagination, Woman In Black is an indicator of fear and fear, and whose presence never occurs when she first appears. <br /> <br /> The main character, Arthur Kidd, a lawyer, is studying his unseen vision of his mission to settle the estate. The widow dies and Arthur spends a couple of nights in her harsh home where she notices many strange things that can haunt her for a few days. Some scenes are a very unpleasant and claustrophobic, especially locked room that opens itself up to turn off the generator and close Arthur in the dark. The film becomes more harrowing, the more you put yourself in Arthurs shoes and its efforts to worship it. The writer writes a lot of cool additives, such as the re-appearance of the tin soldier. One is eager to learn all its meaning. The fact that we can never know a widow much about it leaves more imagination and makes it even more peaceful. <br /> <br /> The widow mostly looks cruel and scary. The post-generational scene sent chills to me, a woman who appears somewhere in the harsh countryside of the wind? Being on these qualities, I can understand how it is isolated. And the hostel scene was probably the most terrible thing I've ever seen, one that I don't want to rush or show to elderly relatives. I often remembered at night that he was behind my sleep. <br /> <br /> Woman Black is a great TV movie and lost a gem. I agree to some extent that the internet hype of this movie is completely overtaken and understands why people were disappointed after spending the best 50 pounds for it, but I think this network is captured by hidden gems because it makes such movies too wide open for such. I think it's still brilliant and fantastic, and I consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century.
