I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but only when I looked at it again when I was 13, did I really understand what it is; A golden dog with a real golden heart receives a little girl to use her talents to talk to animals. The dog star Charlie B. Barkin is murdered by her official business partner Carface (who is, by the way, completely insignificant). His soul then goes elsewhere, but in Heaven only to find the golden clock that is really the lifetime of his life, which Charlie is lousy, but lovable, that he steals and rebounds, sending him back to Earth. Coming back to Earth, Charlie is going to look for revenge on the evil surface. That's how he comes to a young Anne-Marie, a little little orphan who can talk to the animals Charlie is planning to put on her talents to get back to her enemy Carface. But guilt Charlie has to take care of the young Anne-Marie and her plans because she has to think to do what's right after Anne-Marie discovers what her best friend Charlie has actually used to make money in a new and better dog casino . He must now save him from the fear of being saved. I still love this movie at the age of 22. The idea and plot is really quite different and original from many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog plays once a villain. Carface was even better than he was in the sky for all dogs. In this picture, he seemed to have a very dubious role for his people.
