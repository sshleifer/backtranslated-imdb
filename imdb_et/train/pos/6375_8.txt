Although I have a great respect for the Disney animated film, they are not really what I would call the "must-see". Atlantis seemed intriguing to the first movie poster and trailer and luckily lived my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a "more mature" Disney movie in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual feature) of the Disney movie really) and focuses more on action and discovery than any other Disney offer. The world of Atlantis, hidden under the core of the earth, is fantastic, presented as ruined caves with shades, and then slowly evolves into real ecosystems, which, although usually contain some bitterness reminder, are becoming more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is. achieved. Just presenting and setting up the Atlantis landscape, without some fun fun, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing look. It is accompanied by the inclusion of the Atlantis language and attempts to connect it to the mythology of real ancient civilizations, and it works quite well. <br /> <br /> Except for some of Mole's events, practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a "childish" element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to reach Atlantis and the constant discovery that took place in Atlantis, as Milo, who was an outsider, was able to learn everything he needed to know about this place, helping the Atlanticmen discover the parts of their own history that they didn't know. Part of this is Atlantis 'armament', which is used at the peak of the action pack, which is quite exciting due to the lack of a better word. <br /> <br /> It is allowed that not all of the stories are filled with sense and the movie does not contain amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but in addition to Toy Story movies, this is the most entertaining Disney movie I've seen for years.
