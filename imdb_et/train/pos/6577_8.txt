With a few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's plays today have almost disappeared from the theater. Too arch, too talkative, seems to be a general decision. This BBC version of Shaw's most fun games doesn't talk about this decision. It's definitely arc and conversational, but it's also great. Because of the quality of British theater, it is perfectly cast with actors, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - most of us have probably never heard of. Carter is great as a Bulgarian girl who hides a professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with her. One can quarrel with the ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), an Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge to the enemy ranks and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his weapons. But the role calls for over-action, and Ryecart was obviously over-voting. Other players are perfect. Of course, Carter is of course Carter as a dramatic Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as a happy soldier. Yes, "weapons and man" are filmed in the game. But you've probably never seen a Shaw movie that doesn't give its origin. Plots are generally clever. But Shaw is all about dialogue. The activity is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the kits are irrelevant. Enjoy what it is.
