"One shot, one kill, no exceptions." You have to see if you are in the navy or sniper. two big thumbs up! Great overall storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details and more. Pretty close to the real thing. But this is not a movie that is distributed and selects editing errors. it is sit and good in 99 minutes. The plot has some depth, but this movie is not really about making your mind. It is about sniper lifestyle and enjoyment. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good tracking, but the first is still the best movie. Tom Berenger is doing a good job of playing his character and showing a sniper on the hidden side. dealing with all death. Must see sniper fans.
