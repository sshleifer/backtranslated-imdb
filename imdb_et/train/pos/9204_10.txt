The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna rose to Dev Anand's mind when he saw Hippi and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu, where he went after protest against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was in a small alcohol because his film was against and some had burned Prem Pujari posters. But the life of hippies blamed Dev's mind for coming to film. <br /> <br /> It was Dev Anand's best manager. The film was a box office superbox and Zeenat Aman, because Devi's sister made a huge impact. <br /> <br /> This movie was Dev Anand's call to the people to preserve their moral values. <br /> It's about a monterial Indian family and the brother's role is very fond of his sister. But the parents quarrel and left with their father with Prashant's (Dev) departure mother and Jasbir (Zeenat). He has repeatedly said that his mother and brother are dead and he finally believes he will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> He has been badly treated by his mother and runs away from home. Dev is becoming a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is a Kathmand with some hippies. <br /> <br /> As he joins his sister, Dev Kathmandu travels to Shanti (Mumtaz), who later had to marry him and Janice, who is actually Jasbir with a new name and a new identity. She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too. <br /> <br /> Dev must return his sister to all other events, including his suspicion of an early catechism and people after his life. <br /> <br /> It was a story that Dev Anand was well-run and acted on. We see Zeena Aman more than Mumtaz. Rahul Dev Burman's music was well composed. For the first time, Dev had offered music by Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da didn't want to make Devi's movie. He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari was good but was against Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter topic because he thought that the hippie cult could revive people's anger against Devi. But Dev continued with the film that convinced Burman Da and the film was really successful. <br /> <br /> R Burma was the award winning Dum Maro Dum sung by Asha Bhosle. Another good number was Kanchi re Kanchi re. <br /> <br /> It's generally a good movie.
