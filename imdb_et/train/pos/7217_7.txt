There is often a big mistake in adjusting the steps. Often they come out as the film camera was just on stage (like "Night Mother"). The direction of Sidney Lumet keeps the film alive, which is especially difficult, because the picture does not offer him a real challenge. However, it is nice to see what it is. Chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve gets one of his little ways to really act. <br /> <br /> I admit that I've never seen Ira Levin playing, but I hear that Jay Presson Allen's adaptation is faithful. The script is incredibly twisted and keeps you away. "Deathtrap" is a tremendously fun movie that is recommended for almost all stage and screen fans. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
