What can be said, really ... "Tenant" is a first-class thriller made between equal amounts and full-time. This is a complexly drawn film - every detail seems to be a reason - although the plot is rarely meaningful and much of it has never been objectively addressed. That is why we are becoming more and more unstable with Trelkovski (Polanski), a hidden Polish man who has received an apartment because of the suicide of a previous tenant to drive us through increasing fear and uncertainty. After warming up the apartment, thrown by some reluctant colleagues, Trelkovski comes under the control of the people living in his building, with greater and seemingly inexplicable control; the rest of the film crowns his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu * k in parallel with David Lynch's later efforts. However, the "tenant" is more despicable and despicable, blessed with unexpected comics, fine performances and a truly haunting score. This is a film that is better described than described so create it.
