My personal favorite horror movie. From a long first observation to the final impact strength, this is Carpenter's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween Night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. In 1978, when all the shelters, Michael escaped from Smith's Grove sanitation. At Halloween night, Michael has again come to murder. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, Michael shoots and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. This is Carpenter's almost overwhelming fear that creates tension. Like all big horror movies, the events are telegraphed a long time ago, but they still seem random, but don't let the audience guess the movie. <br /> <br /> Dark lighting, long continuous camera shots and, most importantly, the fucking eerie music creates the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes that I still can't see in the movie. There's a body number, but after it has a slash it is quite small. This and most of the murders are almost bloodless. Fear is not death, but you don't know. <br /> <br /> The actor is round. PJ Soles offers many movies with limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis becomes decent and then young (at that time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. His performance first seems shy and confident, but you quickly realize that it is perfect for a character who is shy and confident and is not ready at all for what he is facing. And, of course, Donald Pleasence has been assigned (perhaps a little unstable) completely painful. Rest in Peace Mr. Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the film has a damaging error, it would be a time-out. Since the release of this film so many years ago, countless clones, copies, hangings and imitators have come and stolen (usually badly) the best bits until almost all of them are familiar. Along with changes in audience expectations and appetite, a large proportion of the films are found to be diluted. To really appreciate it today and age, it has to be seen as never before. <br /> <br /> Never less, I have no reservation for this movie with a great recommendation for anyone looking for a good, scary time. Highest rules. <br /> <br /> 10/10
