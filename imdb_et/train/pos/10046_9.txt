I avoided watching this movie for the longest time. Long before it was even released, I had rejected it as an over-jumped, bloated, too romantic Hollywood schmaltz piece and I didn't want to do anything about it. I've never watched it in the theater. I shook my head at an incredible 11 Academy Awards - although I've never seen it before. Then I was asked to be a high school public competition judge. One of the girls talked about this movie. "It was so big," he said. "You felt you were on the ship." "Nonsense," I thought. I shared my feelings with colleagues. One looked at me and said, "You may be right, but if he liked the movie, he might want to know more about the real Titanic." Well, maybe, "I thought it finally appeared on Pay TV." OK, "I thought," I'll give it a look. "I didn't want to like it - and I didn't do it. I love it! What a great movie. <br /> <br /> Where to start? James Cameron is doing a great job in creating an almost "you" type of atmosphere, living on board the most elegant ship in the world, a contradiction when the news of the iceberg first spreads, then a growing panic feeling. Then - the performances: Kate Winslet (Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jackina) lead positions are excellent - Winslet is higher, I thought, but both were good, they had a rich girl / bad guy to perfect "t", which I thought. In my opinion, Frances was stealing the exhibition Fisher's mother, she was perfect as a snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and enthusiasm she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - details. I'm not a Titanic drowning expert, but I have a sensible general knowledge, and this film makes a tremendous job of accurately recreating historical details, and then weaving smoothly into fancy romance. Very impressive. Then the song. Who can watch this movie and not take it as a result of Celine Dion's "My Heart Goes On". <br /> <br /> Problems. Well, romance was probably too busy in the sense that I just disagreed that Jack could have moved from such a first-class effort. (I know she was first called but she seems to be getting into the first class without stopping until she has been there for a while.) The reality of separating social classes was much more realistic, I wondered if the riders were left there only after that when the ship remained on the iceberg, while the first-class people could enjoy the semi-empty lifeboat. <br /> <br /> However, it is small in scale. This is a really great movie. My only regret does not see it in the theater where I think it would have been so impressive. <br /> <br /> 9/10
