I have to admit that at first I was cautious about watching this movie. I thought this was a stupid, small, romantic movie about a French woman who met America on a train and decides to visit Vienna with her. I wasn't really fascinated by this kind of script because it kept me believing it was just a movie. But I looked at it! And I was surprised ... "Before sunrise" is one of the few films that dare to speak quite philosophically, I thought that at our birth, we are understood to be death or that it is the idea that the couple should rest together forever or that we, people, can sometimes allow to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was wonderfully chosen (we don't know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock in Vienna). The actors acted very well, so I started to believe that I, myself, could live the story of love.
