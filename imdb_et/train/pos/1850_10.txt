This is my favorite movie EVER. I watched it at least 10 times and cried every time. My family asks me not to look at it so I don't have a cry. I think I love the fact that it is a true story written by Antwone as much as I love the movie. Action is top-notch and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he has done so far. I took care of a little boy who was born in prison. He was the most expensive little boy I ever met. She has now accepted a wonderful family who fought for her for almost two years. I saw this movie when the fight was still going on and his future was not sure and I'm so happy he's safe and loved. And I'm so happy that Antwone is happy and found his family. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about her and how she's been after her family meeting. I'm just not saying enough good things about it !!
