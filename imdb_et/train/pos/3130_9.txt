I'm in Belgium and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was inspired. Unfortunately, this caused "panic hysteria" among mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Geez, compare the innocence of this series with the children who can see today. So thanks to the overpowering mothers of the 60s, I only got the chance to see two or three episodes! I'm so disappointed that I started to compensate for cartoons and bubble cards (I still got them!). I even got View Master slides ... I had the urge to see the captain. All children need a hero. Tongue-in-cheek acted would have escaped me when I was watching it as a child, but I got it at the age of 17. Yes, I watched all of them now and the episodes of random soul internet mailings because they haven't issued a series of DVDs (I know). <br /> <br /> Tonight I enjoyed "Back to the Bats Cave" ... it was a joy to watch because it was full of trivia and inside jokes. Seeing Adam and Burt was a joy and this TV movie is just fantastic in every sense. They play themselves when they played their parts in their series. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE! Rent it !!! Hire it for a friend !!! Buy !!! I'll never wait to rate it as 9/10 ... Very well done!
