Particularly modern houses in affluent neighborhoods seem to be the cause of each of its inhabitants' (and deadly) behavior. Or at least that is stated by Lara Flynn's Boyle character, Col Kennedy. After a series of deadly events in a high house next door, Col knows what to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar is also a mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: House Next Door works with Lara Flynn Boyle and places (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actor, not to mention totally stunning. He brings credibility to his character and makes the film interesting. Without him, it would have failed. "It's so alive" announces a potential buyer for the house. Yes, it's alive. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> <br /> Boyle's presence, not much here, is because a huge number of movies are spent watching or waiting to see how the house affects its current owners. The results are predictable. But I still liked it. Cinematic art gives the film a polished look. 8/10 Because of Boyle, the premise, location and cinematography of the evil ultra-modern house, and the decoration and wardrobe.
