Henri Verneuil's film may not be as well known as the Parallax view, 3 days from Condor or JFK, but it is certainly not inferior and sometimes even better than those of the classical representatives of the genre. The action takes place in a fictional western part where a fictional president has been killed. After several years of investigation, the special committee of the government decided that the president was killed by a single gunfighter. But one man - Prosecutor Volney, who was played by Yves Montand - thinks there's something to look into and the film begins. This film does not deal with some precise theories, but it involves the structure of the relationship between the whole government and society in today's world. Such a film can only be done in the 1970s, but it never loses its reality. What's more, it is even a little scary as to the accuracy of its oracles. 10 out of 10
