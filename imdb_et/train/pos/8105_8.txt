SYNOPSIS The future from 1939 in England. Since war was over Europe, the salvation of mankind cannot be found in past politics. The task of the new world of science is to overcome the past mistakes of man. <br /> <br /> CONCEPT WITH REMOVAL Keep your drivers and what you are told about. Thinking outside the box may be brighter tomorrow. There is always descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> PROS AND CONS I had seen this movie a long time ago and recently downloaded it from the Internet (this is a public domain). This is an exciting job on many levels. Since it is a story of the future since 1939, it has obvious drawbacks. This vision of the future is both daunting and crazy. This movie was a top-notch day of its day. Special effects are very good, as is the story. The actors suffer a bit from the British theater because it may be a bit of a shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the themes behind the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems we now know, not always true. The other plot of the movies is that charismatic leaders are the curse of human existence and will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> The basics of almost all the latest science fiction are in this movie. The "Forbidden Planet" set design and wardrobe, the "2001: A Space Odessy" technology, even the "Star Wars" lush landscapes / urban spaces owe some inspiration to this film. <br /> <br /> Stopping the movie leaves the viewer a little confused. Although the order of completing the stars is optimistic, we have a question whether mankind can ever do it. Even when we arrive, there are those who are trying to hold us back. This film's vision of the future is also interesting according to today's standards. Huge flying machines and weapons that could shoot people into space have not materialized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many great British actors are young men in this movie. The best known are Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson and their oral skills are here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the game, Cabel. His character is almost new to the new Christ, who is sent to save the world from his destruction with a new scientific religion. <br /> <br /> This is a good cinema history, whose themes are still relevant today, even if his vision of the future is unnoticed.
