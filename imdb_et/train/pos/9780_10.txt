I saw this movie at the BIFF Festival in Brussels in the spring of 2004. What a surprise! This German production, stylish and imaginative shock, is one of the most frightening flik I've ever seen. Be warned: this is not a joke! This terrorist has a great number of good actors (for example: Peter Martell is heavily represented at the European guru), great direction, nice product development, great soundtrack and a lot of serious sfx like Italian horror movies. eighties. Flesh hung up in the bones ... and the blood runs red ... this wild Heart Stopper grabs you ... and gives you dark dreams ... Black-black!
