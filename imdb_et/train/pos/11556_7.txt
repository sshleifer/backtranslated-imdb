Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started and finished their career together. Remember, like Grumpiest Old Men and Oddest Couple, who once made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's most loved comedy teams for the last 100 years. Not as "dirty" as Pryor and Wilder, they were a classic comedy team that featured the more modern Marx Brothers routine. Just like the combination of physical comedy and chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In odd pairs, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create chaos. Physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually in itself inconsistent with passing on the joke to another. Not your typical guy in the movie, it's a kind of age comedy against two old men who are against two young teens. Chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertaining enough. Although this movie is not for everyone, it is a great comedy.
