Alec Baldwin's walk with Cavemen is a look at all of the five million years of hominide (that's us!): Who they were, what they were, and how they died. With a very interesting scientific look at the information about these species, the walk with the soldier also explores what makes us human. I waited for several weeks to watch it, and I wasn't disappointed.
