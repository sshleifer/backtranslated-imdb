It's so rare to find enough translated literary work on the screen that I've rated this movie higher than worth, but not much. As a long-term student of works by me, I do not want to recommend the film to my readers, at least to those who love her. Casting is inspired: Nolte is underestimated, surprised and decisive in triumph. Sheryl Lee is a luscious whole, but her behavior deceptive Resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget your beauty. Alan Arkin offers a completely loved but equally betrayal Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Don't feel the need to read the Mother's Night to read the movie; but if you haven't read the maternity evening, you probably want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Note that the colors will turn black and white and do not skip the final symbolism of Campbell. See also that at the end of Kurt Vonnegut's film there is a scarf. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" can never hear the same (I will write in mid-December when the song is in a heavy radio show and it will drive me with nuts).
