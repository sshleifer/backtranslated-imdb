It was Saturday night and there was a movie on BASEketball. I always wanted to watch it, but never been to the cinema. The boy was wrong. Words cannot describe how this movie is funny, looking at the creators of South Park who share funny natural screen chemistry. I recorded the playback the next day and exactly one week after it was first seen, I've seen it 7 times !! I am obsessed with this and I know that anyone who appreciates the work of trey and mats appreciates this movie. TAKE HOW IT IS ALL MY QUESTIONS
