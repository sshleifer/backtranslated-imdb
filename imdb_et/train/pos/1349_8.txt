RKO had a reputation for making nations, homemade pieces Americana. <br /> <br /> Anne Shirley (like Dawn O'Day) had been in toddler movies. By 1933 he was in limb - playing Ann Dvorak as "Three Games" (1932) and "Flower Girl" in both "Heavenly" and "Key" in both 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered Anne's work from the previous movie and it got part of it. She also took the lead as Anne Shirley. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot is a leaky boat, a "stolen" brooch, a "red hair" case. Anne was so right about the role of this orphaned orbit. He was heartbreaking in his intensity, a desire to wish and also his hot mood. O.P. Heggie was wonderful because the understanding of Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley was good as Marilla. Tom Brown was a great Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who had been a young child in films, was good as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved she can play anyone except Ani's aunt Andy Hardy, Mrs Barry.
