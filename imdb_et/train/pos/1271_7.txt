Never seen a movie based on Nicholas Katzenbach's entertaining novel and taking into account the first-rate image of the production, we decided to watch. "Just cause," although it is not a terrible film, it takes too much freedom from the original material that Jeb Stuart was unable to handle in his treatment. Arne Glimcher is targeting. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think of when a young black man is pulled into a local village department is the brutality of the police. After all, Sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox do not show any mercy in beating Bobby Earl, accused of killing a young white girl. We know the fear that officials make for prisoners. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangelical, Bobby Earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a special Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, a young man wants Paul Armstrong to protect him. His old wife is convincing enough for Armstrong to investigate the case. He is also convinced of the young man's innocence. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought. When Blair Sullivan, a man who earns time in the same room as Bobby Earl, has to talk about how he's involved with the murder of a young girl, and changes the dynamics of the case. The way he plays in the film confuses the viewer and pulls Armstrong to the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller is a delightful Sean Connery who plays Armstrong. Intense actor Laurence Fishburne makes a fine impression that the Sheriff is guilty of abuse of his prisoner. Ed Harrisel is a great way to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee, and Young Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't even disappoint because of its mistakes.
