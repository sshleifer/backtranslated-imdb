I do not care how many bad reviews of purple rain can, this movie rocks! Great movie, it's all, great music (tough! Prince), romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is a really sad movie, very touching. I don't want to say much more, I don't give up the plot, but I say it - the film is very realistic, so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, so many families that are similar to those in the film. I see it as very realistic and so realistic, makes the movie more mobile. My generation loved to grow this movie, so many of us loved the prince and there is much to communicate with every teenager who has had similar problems. <br /> <br /> This means it's not just a teenage movie, we recommend it for all age groups. And it's not all that dark, the movie has some great music, band performance scenes and a sexy fun scene between Prince and Appelonia.
