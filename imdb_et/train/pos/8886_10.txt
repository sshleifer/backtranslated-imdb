I wasn't in the 60s, so I can't guarantee that this movie was a perfectly accurate presentation of the period, but it is definitely a moving and satisfying experience. There are some great performances, especially Josh Hamilton (with prizes), Jerry O'Connell (sliders) who play war brothers. Bill Smitrovich, an actor of nature who has been ignored by many for a long time, gives his strict father a heartfelt performance that is forced to question his convictions and values ​​when one of his sons makes him proud to go to Vietnam, but empty, while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all, this is a powerful and warm-hearted film that I hope everyone has the opportunity to experience.
