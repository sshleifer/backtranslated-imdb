This is, in my opinion, a very good film, especially for Michael Jackson's lovers. It contains a message about drugs, stunning special effects and a fantastic music video. <br /> <br /> The main film is focused on the song and music video "Smooth Criminal". Unlike a four-minute music video, it's normal speed and I find it much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot, however, is rather strange. Michael Jackson plays a magical "gangster" that, when he sees a star, turns into a machine image. Throughout the film he becomes a racing car, a huge robot and a spaceship. The robot's scene is especially slightly drawn and weird. I found it somewhat devastating compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The kid is kidnapped, Michael tries to save him, tortured and beaten, and suddenly all the bad guys are blowing into a giant robot. A little weird? Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> But besides the bizarre robot scene, this is a very good movie and all Michael Jackson fans will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
