I loved all Cream's work, even if there is a small and valuable work directory to get it. Even when they go with their songs for twenty minutes (Spoonful and Rooms off of Wheels of Fire are great examples), these socks are out of more than half of today's rock shows. This show on the stage is one of the most anticipated rock band gatherings, as shown by Royal Albert Hall last year. They can be parents, as well as their fans, but the energy is still there, the classic blues song and their own great arrangements. Transfers of white space, sign, politician, spoonful, sunshine of your love do not seem to strike. Clapton's solos have the emergence of sometimes having no solo band on stage. Ginger Baker said enough. Jack Bruce is strong enough with his vocals that still have the power that Clapton never got. The bottom line, if you want to see what the best shows you wanted, you would have seen last year (well, some might see them), it's all on this DVD that has cool features.
