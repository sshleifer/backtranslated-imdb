I went to this movie just because I was dragged there and I would have left immediately again because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and I felt inappropriate. But the film was very exciting and far from the old people. The characters were all very real and believable, and I found myself feeling the film, characters and storyline. There are some pretty tempting scenes, but they are necessary and will help you better understand the situation. All in all, this is a great and valuable movie that is somewhat less common, but that doesn't mean that people who prefer mainstream can't enjoy this movie. It's an exciting and interesting movie experience.
