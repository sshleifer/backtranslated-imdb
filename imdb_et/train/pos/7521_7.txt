I had a vague idea of ​​who Bettie Page was, partly because of his appearance on Playboy's very older days (probably when he got his picture from his and his santa hat, just because he didn't know what sweet was). In the form of a film produced and staged by American Psycho Mary Harron, the main parts of her life are well developed. The southern belle of the church worker has some bad experiences and they leave them to look for better times in New York where she gets into modeling and much more. Soon he will become a ground-based pin-up, a slave with the obvious (and "notorious") title he was given. Actor Gretchen Moll depicts her and gets the woman's spirit as well as possible, which is really a lot of movie success. He's not a simplistic character, even if sometimes his moral idea is questionable ("Well, Adam and Eve were naked, didn't they?" He comments a few times). Apparently the filmmakers will leave the later years of the page and leave with him during a period of redemption, leaving behind Jesus' photo races. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, Notrious Bettie Page is not much more than the usual bioplay from HBO films, although this time with the release of the feature film release. The best scenes Harron captures are Page in his "questionable" positions, getting photos on top of him, and being ridiculous films of whips and chains and leather uniforms. This adds a lot of necessary comics to the movie's usual style. It is not that it is uninteresting, which involves the government's investigation into the so-called 'out of the box' of such photographs and underground magazines. But there is not much time to explore more than just hinted, Page and its complexity, or his relationships, sex and fifty. All of this is a truly pure black and white look and sometimes it seemed that Harron would go through some black and white photos to drive more. This is a traceable view if you are not well informed about the Bette page and probably also fans.
