The Pentagon science team seems to have improved the serum that causes invisibility, but if the guiding vocal tries it, it cannot turn the process. Disappointed and drunk with force, he becomes a classic HG Wells tradition psychotic. <br /> <br /> This is the gleefully terrible Invisible Man story offered by Verhoeven and Bacon forever, like genius-turned loonyton maniac. As with many Verhoeven's works, he has a fantastic unlimited idea of ​​a boy's own comic book (a secret underground lab where scientists are just wonderful) combined with the most terrible and backward visual images (women who have been littered and attacked by invisible tapestry) , dead animals, literally gallons of blood and wholesale in the last two rolls). Although the story does not speak of any new ideas in the old sense, Scott E. Anderson's CG special effects are strikingly brilliant, as we see in veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and muscle, all of which literally appear somewhere. Especially the sequence where the team brings out the invisible gorilla and the scene where Bacon drops into the Devane swimming pool is a completely exceptional and artistic invention of effects. The film also features Jerry Goldsmith's great sound and Jost Vacano's classic horror film photography. The film's technical generation hides the young cast, but both Shue and Dickens are impressive in their depths. This is a very fun nasty movie.
