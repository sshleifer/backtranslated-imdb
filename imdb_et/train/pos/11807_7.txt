After seeing Dick Tracy in the $ 6.99 binary Future Shop, I decided to go without the previous knowledge and big fan of the Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very fun, smart, entertaining movie that has a solid performance everywhere. The film is moving well, of course he has another firm performance by Warren Beatty, but the real specialties of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was delighted to know that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an upper gangster who tried to take the city off. Madonna was great as a girl in distress, she made me impress and gave me a deep impression of her performance. If you go with the attitude that you want to watch a fun, smart movie with a high-performance and secure script, try trying Dick Tracy. I don't think you're disappointed. And look at Paul Sorvino, James Can, Kathy Bates, and Dustin Hoffman.
