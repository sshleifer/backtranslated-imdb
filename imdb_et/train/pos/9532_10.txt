I loved so much this movie ... the time it took to develop characters, turn attention to detail, great performances, stunning lighting and cinematography, a wonderful soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> This is a combined intensity and touch that doesn't work for anyone who wants typical quick action. If we were to live on Elizabeth's days, I would say that this film is a tragedy for Shakespeare. But because we don't, we say it's a drama-tight movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is tricky. The film is intelligent, how relationships and issues are studied. A lot of the story has been shown rather than said, which in my opinion makes it finer and moves - and it works well with the story of a comic book (or graphic novel). Sometimes I felt like I was actually there in the 1930s, some of this story - was so realistic, but dreamlike in quality, as it says. <br /> <br /> I often don't prefer the books on which they relied, but in this case I did. (Although I also enjoyed this book.) I have bought a DVD because it is great because it has some excellent deleted scenes and insightful comment. <br /> <br /> (I also took my little cousin who is a little younger than a boy in the movie to see it after I first saw it because he has problems at home and I wanted to use it as a father starting a discussion with her son - and a discussion.)
