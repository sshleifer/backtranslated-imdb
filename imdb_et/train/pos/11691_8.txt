Great movie when I saw it. I have to say one of my favorite films. I saw it 8 times in the theater and got a DVD. When I got older and saw it again, I realized the movie was average. Compared to movies known for good comedies, this is nothing. I mean, Rock was fun in the movie, and switching over to racial things crushes small barriers that are big. The idea of ​​how the film goes is also a nice way of thinking. It's like most thought about the movie, but also a little twist, which is a very nice touch. I like the movie in general, so I'll give it ... <br /> <br /> Still good 7/10.
