I saw it in the movie preview and it dazzled it. This is not a typical romantic comedy. I don't remember so hard with the movie and moving it. Laughs are not here - they are observations, laughing, small shocks "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who knew it!" I'm not giving away a plot that is more than just "Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend." The whole family plays in the relationships here. Probably the best laughter and heat mixture, because "When you slept." <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes a lot deeper than he's gone, and for the first time he really liked him. Amazing, the list of veteran theater actors I have loved with other roles, but they are a compelling family. Dianne Wiest is cute because her mother, Juliette Binoche is bright and fun (who knew it was funny?) And even revamped Dane Cook gives warm, quiet and moving performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a great add-on and I buy the CD for what it has available. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it.
