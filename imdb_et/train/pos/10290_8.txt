Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrey after Truman's show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent "Hey Hollywood - see how good I can act!" Box office frustrations. It is nice to see that Jim recognizes and attributes his strengths. He does not receive the Academy Award, but the film itself lasts longer than many of the Academy's "award-winning films". He's in the last movie at the top of his form - it's like sending an old friend back. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman and Aniston are doing a good job together - comfortable in their comedy roles, great comic timing and probably fun together, but without the "hey mother - see how I'm funny" comedy type. The real surprise was Steven Carrell as a Carrey's nemesis (celebrity of the Carrell of The Daily Show) who walked to the best and funest scene in a movie. I laughed at Carelli over the last three years than anyone else. <br /> <br /> I can foresee that US religious nuts are at the disposal of God with weapons, but the bottom line of the film is right for all the great theological beliefs - we are massive protoplasms trying to get through our short life using our free will. Without married children, it complains that it is likely to become a target group for people who have wrong priorities (who know the types - men with golden watches on Sunday morning and late television selling prayers to God). And again, about 0.5% of the country cares and 80% of the media report it. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is a purely entertaining movie, every audience member laughs what they would do, and feel good at the movie's summary. A walk on any major American street must confirm that God has a great sense of humor. The better the comic genius is to remind us of it as Jim Carry. <br /> <br /> Thank you again, Jim - it's great to get you back!
