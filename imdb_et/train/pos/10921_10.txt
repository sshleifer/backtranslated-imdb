After reading tons of good reviews about this movie I decided to take it spin (I bought this DVD, so "spin" pun ... I'm dork). At first, everything I was hoping for was a perfect structure (with some of the quotes I've heard on various Wu-Tang albums) to what should have been a good movie. But the plot I heard was so big, so predictable. Every time I saw the character (except the Lizard), I thought what Venom was. Plus, the only cool character you can kill is in the middle of the movie. Ok, so the plot wasn't very good, but at least it was a good kung-fu? Wrong. The struggles were very short and few and far away. Giving different styles was pretty cool, but I want the struggles to be longer. I was hoping to see how the Lizard runs and there are some crazy isps on the walls, but that didn't happen. I was hoping to see a little bit of shit near the century, but that didn't happen. I was hoping to see Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes, but it never happened. In short, not much happens. Fighting is all routine. Don't be fooled simply because this film is a plot, it doesn't mean it's good.
