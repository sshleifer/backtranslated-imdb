Of course, Titanic was a good movie, for the first time you saw it, but you should see it for the second time and your opinion on the movie will definitely change. The first time you see the movie you see as the underlying love and think: oh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one who thinks it is) is just annoying and you just sit there looking at movie thinking, When is this d ** n ship going? And even this is not as impressive as you see it many times. Acting in this film is not bad, but certainly not great. I was delighted that DiCaprio did not win the Oscars of this movie, I mean, who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes 1 semi-good movie and doesn't make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then it is all surprised that there are hardly any movies with him. But in my eyes, the worst character of the film is enough. However, Kate Winslet's performance was great. I too, the director is very talented to put together a movie of this size. There is one lesson on this film: there are too many love stories, because filmmakers should not try to add a tough romance to every movie! Of the possible 100%, I only give 71% to this movie.
