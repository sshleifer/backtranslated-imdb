despite the occasional rigid action and the "seen-all-before" story, it's a pretty convincing film. <br /> <br /> This is a relationship, demon scenes are actually pretty scary, some visual effects are great and the best, not ridiculously poorly placed humor to kick off a movie because too many (wannabe) horror movies are now honestly <br /> <br /> but it really pulls you in and makes at least an attempt to develop characters <br /> <br /> I was glad I watched it
