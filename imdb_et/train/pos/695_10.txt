This movie pulls you in and makes you keep an eye on it. The writer / director is narrative with the use of parts and creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives, all of which add to the thrilling attitude. Insomniac's nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen. Is it a dream or a reality? This indie is discussing the turns he takes through consciousness and subconsciousness. It has an eery feeling of blind interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became insomnia. She is a great actor who is not on the eye! He poured out his entire role in this. This is one of my favorites about how it was captured. I would recommend it very much and eagerly to see more of this innovative, creative writer / director / operator!
