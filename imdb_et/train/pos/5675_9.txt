Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have heard the least - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth, and they have nothing revolutionary about it. But it is still a big one - Dramington's Duke and the Foolish Fool Drummer Johnson (the first dictionary writer in England) make this series believable. This series still features fun disposable liners that bring humor into a lesser known era - a historically accurate and enjoyable episode. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known party, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a foolish prince is funny and effective and Hugh Laurie is the best in this series. Very good! 9/10
