I loved how EARTH was made. Its photography is incredible, editing must be an interesting challenge, and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. In addition, editing music and sound makes EARTH a profound experience that you don't want to miss. You're really traveling where you will probably never reach. <br /> <br /> And while at first I was surprised by the audience's laughter when we see our daily struggle for animals to survive, I could sometimes not laugh at myself. Nature just seems too impressive. <br /> <br /> But not the need for laughing, I left the cinema with a deep question: "If 200 years of industrial revolution is possible, can it destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?" <br /> <br /> With this in mind, you will understand how I felt the taste and vision when I saw the earth. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to reverse the changes we have undergone in the last century, and to stop global warming at the same time not a non-organization activist at all!) ... <br /> <br /> So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the movie to see what I can do to save our stable planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was disappointed not to find direct answers there, but it was very interesting to know about the movie and the struggle with this team went. <br /> <br /> hope my energy supply I don't know how to otherwise reduce the distance that polar bears need to bathe to reach the land before they drown or attack animals they can't beat in their exhausted state ... <br /> <br /> Inspirational movie, which is, but I didn't leave the cinema very happy.
