Especially this film shows one of the best British films of this or some other time. <br /> <br /> "Life and Death" is Jack Cardiff who knew how to do wonders with the camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast of the monochromatic tones and colored tones given to the scenes in the sky that take place on the earth. It was quite a coup and much earlier. The black and white sequence, which includes the long stairs where Peter and the conductor speak, must be one of the most amazing things on any film. our comment concerns a great actor Powell and Pressberger got out of a big, prominent cast who was perfectly responsive to the drivers' instructions. <br /> <br /> David Niven is Peter whose plane has hit and his best friend dies as a result. This film marked one of the highlights of Mr Niven's career. He was a great movie actor when he shows this movie. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good in June, a woman who spoke to Peter when her plane crashed. As fate should be, Peter and June will fall in love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British filmmakers love this movie with their presence. Robert Coote is Bob, a man who is allowed to heaven, but he is surprised when his friend Peter never made a trip with him. Marius Goring is a superb full turn that steals the film during conductor 71. Mr Goring, who had worked with the directors, is one of the best things about the film. Roger Livesey, like Dr. Frank Reeves, makes the best of his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is considered Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> "Life and Death" is a timeless film that is always seen against its creators.
