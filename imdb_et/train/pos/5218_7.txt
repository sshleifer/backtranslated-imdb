The flock is unfairly paralyzed as the lower ripoff of "Se7en". There really is no reason to compare them except maybe in the final showdown for similar landscapes. <br /> <br /> Now that it's outside, how do I go, why Flock is in some ways very interesting. For the most part, it is more like a drama than an inflatable thriller from a very vigilant social worker who follows sex offenders. At first you can clearly see that his work is better than him. It is evident in two scenes where the first interviews the criminals and captures him and the other, when a woman tries to pick him up and everything he can think of, is his standard questions in his questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way to do his job is not unlike a police officer, he carries a weapon and constantly checks newspapers and provides information to law enforcement officers when one of his "herds" may be responsible for sexual crime. He is also a man who has lost all the happiness of living, and his only relief seems to be the demand for justice from his own cattle plague. Twice you see her smiling, once she apologizes to her partner terribly and the other after beating her flock. <br /> <br /> Flock is not so successful in the range. Somewhat confusing and with some holes in irritating plots, but it has a number of striking sets. <br /> <br /> In general, Flock is confident about the drama person who performs dehumanizing work and finally has to work hard to swallow the abyss he surrounds. The world we live in is a pretty sick place, and the farther the worst is happier. Flock gets this point nicely.
