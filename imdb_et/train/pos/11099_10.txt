Chase has created a real phenomenon with Sopranos. Unfaltering performances, rock-solid writing and some great music make up that has become quite likely the best show ever. <br /> <br /> All the casts are strong, but Falco and Gandolfin earned every inch of those in Emmy's. Anyone who doubts this should try only a few episodes; especially during the first seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely frightening, and you still find yourself in love with him - he's dirty. Many people I talk to about Soprano (who has not seen it yet) say, "I'm not just a fan of mafia movies / shows." What ever. Run - don't go - and get it. These same people usually love "E.R." but I bet they don't care about hospitals ... It's not context.
