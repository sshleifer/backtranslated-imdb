I was just looking at the first DVD, but I would have assembled The Sopranos as a Shakespeare plot with a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and the casino and almost as good as the Godfather (so not "10") and much better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there are many actions, some are pretty bloody, the story is characteristic. Even some small characters contribute to a grand story; e.g. the priest's relationship (or absence) with Carmilla and restaurant wife and Christopher and his dimwit friend (who didn't last long (candidate for Darwin?)) <br /> <br /> script and actor, other reasons I like; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me visit New Jersey and put it in tomato sauce. 2. Music. 3. It shows that literally everyone can suffer from mental health problems.
