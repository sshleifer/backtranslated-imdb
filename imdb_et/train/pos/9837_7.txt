Zombie 3 is an interesting history of doing this. First, it is a sequel to Fulci's hit Zombi 2, where Zombie 2 itself is naturally a marketer to trick people into thinking that it was the successor to George A. Romero Dawn of the Dead, or Zomb. Is it confusing? In principle, no movie has anything to do with each other, but who cares when they make money. I think Fulci himself will not take care of Zombi 3 production when he decided to walk. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to assist the film with additional scenes to extend driving time. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 plot is your typical zombie price. Scientists are developing serum on the island of the Philippines, terrorists steal this plague and release the zombie. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the army is put down all without prejudice. Radio DJ also has short extras that tell us how we treat the planet. In general, I liked this movie. I heard terrible things, but I find the funny dialogue very enjoyable. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness of pollution, the corrupted army, the man who plays God, and so on. I feel that it was a serious movie at one point, but it created a strange direction, probably when Matthew came on board. Besides ripping the other zombie clip, it reminded Romero The Crazies. You hear the good news of radio DJ, "If you see men in white suits and gas masks, get them started." This is naturally played so that men represent white images of zombies. Later, they lurk directly in the Crazies scene, where one of the ordinary, uncleaned people is killed in error. <br /> <br /> The Gord Factor is pretty good at where there are zombie hordes around every corner. How's that cool? Let me read the ways? 1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombie without feet in the pool. My favorite zombie was a maniac caring for a gas station mechanic. He was a bad ass and almost dropped the whole building, trying to kill the girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote? When the Sergeant calls for the zombie ashes, the scientists say, "Don't you think that if the ash is in the air, it falls to the ground and pollutes everything?" To whom Sargeant boldly replies, "Now you're talking about scientific literature." He also mentions the scientific literature spoken by scientists, even when everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Attachments: gallery, trailers, and interviews, especially with Matte, where she insists she drives 40% of the scenes, but can't remember what or other important details. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Must be seen by zombie and Fulci fans. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
