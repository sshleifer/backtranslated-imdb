Anyone who has experienced divorce fears knows the main character of this indie movie, scared of the little boy who believes the zombie hides in his closet. Does Jake (Enchanting Anthony DeMarco) simply "transmit" the traumatic picture of the traumatic parent trauma? Or can the creature be real? Writer / director Shelli Ryan balances both options and keeps the audience away. His choice to use one device - a suburban house - adds a sense of despair and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as angry but loving parents. However, it is scary little characters, Mrs Bender (Barbara Gruen), unhinged babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode). Jake's Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special hell.
