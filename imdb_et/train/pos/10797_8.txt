Composition, elegant Carol (admirable beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her lovely wife Eddie (pleasant David Houseman), Carol's nervous, eats the best galpal ever Anna (admiring Chris Jordan with admirable comic enthusiasm) and Anna hunky, love with her husband Pete (typically exquisite Eric Edwards is a freed up swingers quartet who enjoy frequent group words with each other. Their routine is interrupted when Carol is a lonely, repressed, but still attractive widow's mother, Jennifer (a great Jennifer Welles superbly moving force). Soon enough, Jennifer will relax and become a willing participant in the delicately enjoyable and unhindered muscular life of swingers, with all but Carol wanting to attract her. Writer / director Joe Sarno makes a sharp, enthusiastic and sensitive exploration of the suburbs and the rest of the wild 70's sexual revolution; Sarno transforms traditional middle class moles into its heads and adds spices and provocative mother / daughter incest blocks. What's more, Sarno brings the first-class show to the forefront: Welles and Brooke are both extraordinary, with great support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as the shining New Age sex therapist Shandara and Erica Eaton's ridiculous neighbor Fields. Even better, all women are very hot and tempting; Especially Welles evaporates the screen from its subtle strange figure and ridiculous erotic presence. Sexual scenes are really sparkling and fairly clear, but never dirty or annoying. Stephen Colwell is a brilliant, polished cinematic and Jack Justis bumping acoustic acoustic folk score in both financial and effective. Recommended viewing for Sarno fans.
