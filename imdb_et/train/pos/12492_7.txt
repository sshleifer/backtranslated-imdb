After her daughter's brutal murder, Julie and Allen flee from the city to find comfort and temptation from a lonely cabin on a remote hill. Allen's intentions are good, he wants his wife to get out of his depression by continuing his photos. The old prison and sees the perfect scary for his photography, but even when the photos are developed, they are full of dead people and Allen quickly detects the tragic history of suicide in his new mountain. "Dark Remains" is a pretty decent indie horror flick. It offers some real fears and lots of tension. Operation is pretty good and cinema is 10 to 10 big.
