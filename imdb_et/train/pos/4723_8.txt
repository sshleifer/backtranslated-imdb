Really liked this little movie. It's a moving film about fighting, sacrificing, and especially friendship between different peoples (Mickey's child artist is especially good). There are so many large impersonal films around the World War that this convincing little story is a real break from the usual, and it is original. I also add that this movie is far from boring, very far !! Of course, the horses are wonderful and the landscape is amazing. For anyone who really treats their animal as part of their family (that's what I do), you'll find this movie particularly rewarding. Recommended for movie fans looking for something different.
