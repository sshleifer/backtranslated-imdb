Touchy and sad movie. Introduces the writer's challenges and ailments that try to reach the paralysis caused by cycling. The film focuses on his relationship with a married lover, whom he is often very hostile to, and his interaction with other casualty victims, especially the black-all-out and the white-dominated biker. The film is often humorous, often sad and always credible. Get out of the kleenex box and watch it in a cozy Sunday afternoon with your partner.
