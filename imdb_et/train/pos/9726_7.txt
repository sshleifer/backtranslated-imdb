That was a nice surprise. its trailer didn't predict a good movie at all, it was even a little misleading. Especially Jeff Bridges's part was a positive surprise, well-written, sardonic and funny. Less real, but I don't think the boy who got where he got would see signs of such irreversible everything his current company stands for. One does not become an upper suit to suddenly question it again. The end of the movie, while Dolce Vita was running, was too dirty, clich√© and quite disappointing. And, of course, like Pegg's character, it won't last in his first week in New York magazine. I hope one day I see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here he looked at the poor actor who played bimbo. And by the way, I don't see why he is the "sex symbol" of the year, I see the hottest girls on every cover of almost every magazine.
