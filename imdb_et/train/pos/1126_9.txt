My interest was raised when I slipped and saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought OK, look what it is. I'm so glad I stayed on the channel. What a wonderful and wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some up, but great time. I look at it and it makes me sad when the film industry throws out and these beautiful little gems go through. Try to try Iphigenia and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I have even enjoyed my children (27, 25, 20 and 17). It starts slowly, but the drama is built and you are drawn to the story. Watching this lovely movie made me want to be in a Greek tragedy and sin.
