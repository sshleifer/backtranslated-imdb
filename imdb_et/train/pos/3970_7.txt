It is a film that appears to be on the surface just from J.Edgar Hoover, giving him a larger pillow to fight with Klansmen, after Indian killers, hunts of the 1930s famous gangsters, fighting against the Nazis in the United States and South America during World War II and Commies in New York in 1950. early years. Of course, in 1959, we did not know about Mr. Hoover's obsession with keeping secret files honest Americans accusing people like v. Martin Luther King, Jr., but the worst, his secret affair with his deputy director Clyde Tolson (If you want to know more about this topic, I suggest you see Citizen Cohn). Hoover aside, this story of life in the FBI, as Jimmy Stewart said, makes a decent, but dated film. Vera Miles as her dedicated woman is also good. But Jimmy is a movie. As far as Hoover's controlled production, and always convinced that the FBI was seen without guilt, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human face, quite an achievement with Hoover always looking over his shoulder. The background is also pleasant. I have read the latest online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show it for a long time, and I hope they will show it again.
