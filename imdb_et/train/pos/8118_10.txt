You saw it for the first time in a German TV channel in 1975, and was immediately delivered, after that I saw this movie about 12 times in cinemas and nowadays I have a videotape that I watch at least once a year - this film is excellent in every aspect (direction, actor, cut, musical result ...). The sets are outstanding and very impressive, the devastating World War in the late thirties seems to be a prophecy for the 1936 film, the "Everytown" dictator is pure Mussolini, and Raymond Massey is simply a charming, plausible and ideally cast "hero". The positive tone of technology and advancement today is quite refreshing with the usual pessimistic standards - especially the finishing scene that always brings tears or two to my eyes, even after watching the film so many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is good on television, but it was made on a big screen, so if you have a chance to see it in some movies. please, it's overwhelming.
