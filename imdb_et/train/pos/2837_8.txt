The boring and unhappy young babe Zandalee (a gently weird and lively performance by luscious brunette loser Erika Anderson) feels a cozy and inexorable marriage to a failed poet and a decent but boring businessman with Thierry Martin (firm and credible image of Judge Reinhold). Zandale has a disgraceful adultery with a bumpy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins (Nicolas Cage's glowing film). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be saved? Or is everything going to break down and going to the seed? Directed by Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser, the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics made something thick, trying to tell what a serious and understandable story about the desire to run and its potentially dangerous consequences; The plot goes ridiculously histrionic in the last third. The dialogue is similarly funny and vulgar (sample line: "I want you to shake naked and eat alive"). Better yet, this flick offers a lot of delicious female nudity (gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks hot) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft core scenes (Johnny and Zandalee make a dirty act in the church's confessional booth) with a certain steamy pressure). The Orleans Seal Village will once again add extra spice to the steamy process. Its long, black hair, greasy mustache, unpleasant mouth, and coarse ways are John Cage's absolute hoot because one of the most unpleasant "romantic" leads to celluloid. Casting meritorious behavior with good deeds: Anderson, Cage and Reinhold are doing a respectable job, Joe Pantoliano as the cheerful homosexual friend of Zandalee Gerri, Viveca Lindfors as his friend's wise, perceived mother Tatta, Aaron Neville's friendly barman Jack and Steve Buscem as funny, disgraceful shameless thief. Walt Lloyd's sharp and bright cinematography gives the image an attractive glossy look. The delicious and harmonious result of Pray for Rain also hits the spot. Pleasantly matured and blooming rebellion.
