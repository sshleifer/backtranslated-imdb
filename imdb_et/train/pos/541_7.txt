as a sequel, it's not a bad movie.i really liked it better than the first one. i found it to be more entertaining.t it seemed like it was shot in a documentary style.at first it bothered me because i thought it just seemed too low a budget. But it grew to me, and it made the film much more authentic. This film is more dry with one of the liners than the original, which is good, in my opinion. I think sometimes they went a bit from above for some scenes and characters. there may be a point.this movie at least has some intercourse which the first one was not, in my opinion.it is some of the same great original music that is great. acted again, was mostly fairly decent though as i said it seemed part of it above I also felt that the film was going to end in the end and there are a few minutes that seem really slow and don't seem to flow like the rest of the movie. y "Return to Cabin by Lake" is 7/10 *
