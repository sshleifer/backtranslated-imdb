This place in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He doesn't want them, but he takes them reluctantly. He seems to be learning to be a witch through a meeting with the college. (OK - I understand that this is a family film, but - the witch college has come! Head Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And she and the kids are going to bed with the bed. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time I was 9 years old and did not remember it lovingly, not an adult! The story is stupid (even for fantasy), kids are terrible actors, and one of them (Charles) is incredibly uncomfortable. Roddy McDowall is on the third bill and it only appears in two There's also a trip to Naboombu Island, which is run by animated animals, I thought it might be fun, but the animation is bad (for Disney) and it has a very violent and too long soccer game between the animals. Lansbury and Tomlinson are just big; songs (though forgotten) are nice; the long dance series of Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy, and the special effects of the Oscar are still quite impressive. But a weak story, bad animation are and unlikely children pull it down. I heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give it 7.
