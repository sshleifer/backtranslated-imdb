First of all, we start with the negative points: 1) the story is an enormously wide range of issues and raised issues that do not allow them to be answered; 2) The film is not intended for all people, so rude viewers become uneasy and start to fight against each other during the movie. <br /> <br /> Point 2 is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type of theater (like what I went to), you can hear whether the roller occasionally passes through the projector. I loved it. Film does not keep you busy with music or effects: it allows you to think about what is going on. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that creates an atmosphere that is interesting and enjoyable. The same type of atmosphere created by Stanley Kubrick Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to cinema fans because the cinematic work is amazing. Those who appreciate the story of the film alone are completely disappointed. This is the kind of story you need to unite in your mind. (My version of this is quite cool, but probably quite different!) When you catch the movie, one very cool part is: when two police talk to each other about their cell phones. Ultra-cool sound effect that really takes you right now. Hats for the man who thought about it.
