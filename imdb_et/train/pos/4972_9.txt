LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt I can see better this year. The beautiful tragic comedy of the Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is in the industrial waste of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a dad who desperately wants his son to win a car (Lada!). To do this, the son must break the doors of opening the high scores. What Dad really wants his son to be is because he himself has never done it as a local news journalist in a newspaper that is ironically L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing works as planned. This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and humor is darker. Like this film, however, the tone is more melancholic than depressing and endless, being unreally happy. Humor is absurd, unbelievable, and Mariage finds stunning images in stunning images that never look artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the action of the Poems. This actor also became famous for the brilliant cult-classical C'EST ARRIVÉ PR DES DE CHEZ VOUS, where he played the charismatic brawler Ben. Since then, he has played only two minor roles in unpublished films in the Netherlands, because, as he said in the interview, he was not convinced of his acting ability and all the roles he offered were repetitions of Ben's character. His return to a leading role in LCA should no longer give rise to any doubt about his activities. He is just as brilliant as a man who is stupid and evil to make his family sad, but smart enough to understand what he has done and what he breaks. Must see.
