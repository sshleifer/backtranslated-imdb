Robert Urich was a beautiful actor and he makes this TV movie credible. I remember watching this movie when I was 15, and when I see it again, my opinion remains the same. People are losing those who entered the exclusive club, a computer-rich California. Urich tries to find out what is wrong with his family, and I love the idea of ​​a Halloween space suit, brilliant. This movie talks about its fight. TV quality that goes beyond the big budget of the New York Gangs. I don't know if Robert Urich was a compassionate man whom he depicted in many of his films? I hope! 6 or 7 out of 10.
