It felt very balanced, showing what Jehovah's Witnesses had done to defend America's freedoms. It also showed the strong faith of the two families who were first-generation witnesses. I also appreciated how it showed how Jehovah's witnessing affects non-witness family members, and how difficult it is for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate the holidays, is a sad part of the fact that non-witness families do not think of the family dinner or witness visits of the witnesses to family members or visits or gifts for them at any time, but for holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care, witnesses want and expect high medical care, which people forget that blood transfusions allow for drastic medical care and surgery, while bloodless treatment is caused by a highly qualified and trained medical team that would prefer to treat their loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
