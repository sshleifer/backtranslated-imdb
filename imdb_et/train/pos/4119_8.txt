Another Kurosawa genius, his first color film, is a darkly surrealistic study of the tragic life of the people in Tokyo, mostly in the series of related vignettes, depicting a group of people who represent a dangerous existence in a harsh and uncertain post-war coastal town. This film shows comedy for the tragedy and back to see how people deal with the worst of life in their own way, mostly retreating and living their heads on fantasy worlds, emotionally embracing people around them, or drowning in alcohol. Mixing the realism of kitchen sinking with the Kabuki-esque theater, Kurosawa's toys expertly with your audience's emotions, drawing tears and laughs with equal nonsense. Excellent drainage experience.
