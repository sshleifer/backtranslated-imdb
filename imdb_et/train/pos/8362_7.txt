An updated version of the 1938 film became a story of the Frog of the Frog in England, dealing with the frog he carries, like a frog like mountain-rich eyes, and so on. <br /> <br /> One of the good Wallace films of the 1960s is a little entertainment. Obviously, the restart of Dr. Mabus's films will be affected (or done) by the fact that the frog seems to be more than an overflow than a master thief. Although it is not the best of Wallace movies, it's worth a look. This would be an interesting double feature with an excellent previous movie. <br /> <br /> 6 to 7 of 10.
