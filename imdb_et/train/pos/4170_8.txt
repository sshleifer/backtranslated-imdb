I've seen this movie more than once. It was in parallel with many of the horrible things that were on TV in films. The only problem I had was the title for obvious reasons ... One thinks of Drake's famous snack cake! Leaving the first part would have been enough for "Hell's Hound". Richard Crenna always succeeds in bringing something he does seriously, regardless of whether the plot is good or bad. But it was an enjoyable Halloween ticket offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna flies to some hidden country to find a mystic who would help her conquer the evil beast. He asks the cab driver how to find this man. Great dialogue between the local cab driver and Crenna regarding the dissemination of the ethnic beliefs of their peoples. "Aw, Mr Barry, I left this thing behind the mountains ..." - referring to a mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one knows how to actually contact him. <br /> <br /> For supernatural prices, this movie is still enjoyable.
