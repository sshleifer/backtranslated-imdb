I can honestly say I never expected this movie to be good. I don't like family movies. I'm a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The last film of the director (MPKDH was total stupidity. And the music was very boring and sharp. But there was Amrita Rao, who has become my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There was also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher plus point. <br /> <br /> Finally, I saw the film and I was very impressed, he brings us MPK young lovers to the HAHK wedding and we have a winner. The story sketch is similar to CAC, easy at the beginning and in serious mode at the end The director also gave you the character you could associate with. Hahk did not like the characters being too eccentric. Shahid Kapoor surprised me with good results, this is a big improvement, and most importantly, it fits best, the best is Amrita Rao , it's really his best performance. He is forced to love his action, Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are intimidatingly cast. No actor feels inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The songs were pretty pe but they look better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnab are beautiful ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice to watch. The songs are not colorful and dancing and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, who reminds you of HSSH and HAHK. What was a movie error? The film becomes quite slow and the end is quite stretched. But the movie is still at a good pace, making it a perfect family film.
