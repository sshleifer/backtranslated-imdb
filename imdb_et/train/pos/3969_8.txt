Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is a waiter who serves when Hagarty's wife shows that she is pregnant while staying at a lake-side restaurant. I watched this movie on a video I had cut off on a TV. When I watched this scene, I thought I would recognize Jones's voice as a "waiter" at the end of a laugh. I repeated the tape and then slowly stepped through that part when the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen carefully when the waiter laughs when Hagarty waits and tells them they have a baby, then watch closely or slow down the scene if the camera displays the waiter, though quickly.
