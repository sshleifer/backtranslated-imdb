You won't get more dark or tragic than "Othello" and this movie hits the game quite well, with great performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacobi. Fishburne expresses Othello's torture to the viewer because he falls victim to Iago, a very realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is a loving and loyal woman who will become the vengeance of Iago against Othello or the object of his anger (it is not clear what is the motive of Iago's behavior). While Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows Shakespeare's usual talent in his film, he is somewhat marginalized. Cassio and Emilia's characters also travel to and from the scene, although they, like Iago, seem to be more important to the plot. I haven't played against the movie to see how many lines have been cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even seemingly irrelevant, very well. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism of the film, the story would come too fast and the relationships between some characters would no longer be outlined. The director had a great performance and no one had any bad results. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and Emilia and Desdemona must be further developed in the film. I feel like they were closer to each other than the movie, even though you get it very late in the movie. Othello and Desdemona also need more time together. Though their anxiety is convincing, their interaction with each other makes it seem like they just met. On the other hand, perhaps it was just like Rome and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In short, good results, too short. <br /> <br />
