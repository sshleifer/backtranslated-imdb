* I note where the spoilers are! General remarks: If you can take a serious movie, watch it. Be open and enjoy it. Don't leave the theater because you're confused what's going on! The film fits well on the other side. I take my mother to officially open this movie. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see it a few weeks ago when Will went to introduce the film. He was great - he spent a lot of fans. Thank you for the photo Will! Willi's performance: many times when you see a movie that the actor really belonged to for some other film / show, you always think of them in your current performance, as you think of their past. That's not the case with Will Smith in this movie. Looking at this movie, did not update the fresh prinsi (lol). He was completely and completely convincing in this very serious role. He has grown enormously as an actor. I think he will at least get this Oscar for this activity. <br /> <br /> His character: Ben is very controversial and tortured. He's sad ... guilt ... very confident but very scared. Very true to yourself. His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow, Will managed to put it into practice. taxes. Maybe he's not a bright star Will in this movie, but he was very convincing. I think his character didn't have as much work as Will's did. I didn't know about getting into the movie and nothing was reasonable before the second part. But when things finally fit together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. This is an extremely intense film that really sticks to you. <br /> <br /> It actually takes a lot to watch. In the theater where I was, most people cried to the end - even grown men. If you understand what Ben is doing and why, this is a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Small SPOILERS ***** What is the reason why it is very difficult to talk about a plot without giving the big things. I feel that knowing this movie too much really destroys it. There was a lot of symbolism in the movie I enjoyed. I mention a few here (without trying to give away much). <br /> <br /> - Fish that Ben had in his hotel room. There's no point at first. There were many sermons in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> - I hated Beni at the beginning of the movie. In the end I loved her and hated her. So was convincing Will. I thought Ben was a huge jerk for Ezra, a blind man just trying his way in the world. Why did she treat Ezra so that it became clear later in the film. Wait for it though. All in this movie: wait for it. <br /> <br /> -Ben is basically a good person who made a big mistake not to forgive himself. It is not clear to me whether he does what he did, because he tried to get rid of his guilt or he really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit like that ... I think he wanted to help people, but also get rid of his past. I love his character. You love her and hate her because you realize that what she does is not strange. You hate him because of what he does to himself (as a very good person) both physically and emotionally. Nice job Will.
