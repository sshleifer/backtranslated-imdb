Paul Lukas played the Russian intellectual way of living as a waiter in William Dieterle's "Grand Slam" (1933). This is a surprisingly funny building of satire's fame. The hockey check girl from the provider and the Russian restaurant, played by Loretta Young, is an American dignitary as a bridge partner who doesn't rob. With the help of publicists and ghost writers "Speed" McCann (who died perfectly, Frank McHugh), they get a walking ad for the "Stanislavski system", which is a "system" for bidding, whatever it seems <br /> <br /> (because bids are not rational , there is no reason to accuse them of stupidity). <br /> <br /> Duel with the shifted bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn (sounds close to Goren, no? and I suspect that the character's name "Stanislavsky" was also a slamm of the second type of system), Ferdinand Gottschalk's very well-inflated charlatan sent over to American radio stations such as Roscoe Karns Prize Fighting (another 1930s high-speed, deadly comic book artist). <br /> <br /> Bridge players are even roped-off squares, although the audience is <br /> <br /> higher than the "rings" in different boxes. <br /> <br /> America's different types prefer the comedies of Preston Sturges, although "Grand Slam" is the most popular in the mind of two celebrities for the production of celebrities in the same (pre-code) era where Lee Tracy plays fast-talking <br /> <br /> publiciste: "half-truth" and "bell-bell" but "Grand Slam" moments, especially for anyone who has played a bridge with a serious point <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a horse. (It seems to me that his face is a bit long <br /> <br /> and also horsey. The second concept of beauty, I think ...) Film <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, everything falls but Glenda Farrell falls who plays McHugh's forgetful <br /> <br /> girlfriend.
