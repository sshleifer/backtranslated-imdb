Warning! Front Spoilers! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I've seen a movie in German, so it may be that I missed some clues. <br /> <br /> Despite some weakness in the plot, this is the movie that came to me. I particularly liked the action of Lexa Doig. Sometimes I got the impression he was * Camille. But I can't wonder what happened to Bob, Cassie and the baby. I believe that after he had originally put him on Bob, he finally made him love and regretted what had happened to his brother and was forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it's a little weird that he would wear his baby and love it. It's the viewer to decide - and I don't like such ends. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts .. well, I've seen him better, but also worse. <br /> <br /> I believe that film is more a human relationship analysis and response to unexpected situations than a crime story. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I really liked it.
