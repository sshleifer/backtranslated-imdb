In our household, we are big fans of A Christmas Carol and we are practically looking at every version of Christmas, including the old 1938 Reginald Owen and the modern 1999 Patrick Stewart. Our general favorite is the 1951 black and white classic, because Alastair Sim is Ebeneezer Scrooge and his conversion rings the most serious. However, this 1984 handover has its own unique values ​​and makes it a beautiful and fun story that is quite loyal to Dickens' novel. (See my comments on other movie customizations if they are interesting) <br /> <br /> First of all, George C. Scott may definitely look pretty tough and don't do bad Scrooge. I adore her bushes, her long cover and hat. He cuts the best shapes of the lot and the pretty gentleman. But sometimes it seems that Scott enjoys Scrooge's role but just a little too much and doesn't take it as seriously as he should! <br /> <br /> This transfer is the best overall Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. Somehow you know this story is a happy ending. Filmed in Shrewsbury, England, it just seems somehow British. The film has a beautiful musical result, with great and lively music in all parts of the story. Occasionally I could sing in copper almost in chestnut sauce and in a bottle! <br /> <br /> Marley's embarrassing ghost (with her wonderful jaws) and three spirits are all convincing. Christmas is a lovely ethereal lady, a Christmas gift that is wonderfully gigantic and cheerful, but Christmas comes hidden and predicts as always. But I found Scrooge's nephew Fred, who was a bit quiet and gloomy, almost as cheerful and cheerful as he should be. I like my brother's wife, whom they have called Janet, their lovely hairstyle with harsh periods. Instead of a blind man's bluff, they have called a game called Similes for a brother's Christmas dinner party, a lovely little touch, with Scrooge getting in the way. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and their somewhat weak (though very welcome) Christmas dinner are well illustrated, Bob (David Warner) is appropriately sympathetic and long-suffering in his miles. Ms. Cratchi is admirably portrayed by Susannah York, who played with George C. Scott with Jane Eyre's wonderful adaptation of the 1970s. Above all, this version is undoubtedly the best Tiny Tim, not just the divine and loving little waif, but the sick. The dark circles under these eyes seem insecure fun for an hour! <br /> <br /> This is a cheerful and heart-warming version of the classic holiday class. With its festive atmosphere, it's definitely in the spirit of the season.
