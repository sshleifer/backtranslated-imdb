When I first saw this animation (I was 15 years old), I was really impressed! It's a completely different style compared to Japanese animation and I like it more. The overall impression of the film is darker and darker ... Colors are not ... colored. Characters don't talk much, it's not long and boring conversations, and that (like Ghost Shellis). With its dark images, strange wildlife views and magic feelings, it seems to be one of those ancient Scandinavian stories, full of violence and terrible creators, fascinated forests and deep caves, living dragons, dragons, orcs ... and one mysterious hero to stop evil ...
