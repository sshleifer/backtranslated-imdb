No film has turned my attention. You see, I wanted to watch this movie for more than twenty-five years. One and one time I saw it was a teenager, which could be the year it was released in 1977. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, I remember that it touched those deeply held emotions so deeply that there is still a great desire to look again. The intrigue of this film, offered by searching for and searching for a father / son, certainly touches all human beings who watch it. Why this movie hasn't been recorded and shown as often as much deeper movies, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Postscript: got a copy of the movie and after watching it, it was nice to see my memory is true. The rating reflects the content of the film. You would like to watch this movie on DVD because you see this 1977 production from a used VHS tape that removed the overall quality.
