Ahh, Talespin! What can I say about this big show yet? Something! This is undoubtedly one of the most well-written exhibitions I ever encounter, live-action or animation. The newer things are too outraged for my taste and some "mature" things I have to get out of the room. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> Stories are tempting and very believable. Some of them could even stretch out for one or two hours for a movie. Episodes, such as stormy weather and his chance to dream, are very dramatic, while being enjoyable for children and adults alike. Then there are pure comedy episodes such as Bluest of Baloo Blood and Stuck, where the pressure is fun. I can smile with some options with tears. <br /> <br /> Most exhibitions have a dramatic aspect of drama (at least those that aren't specifically targeted), especially cartoons. In the Stormy Weather episode, Kit Cloudkicker decides to join the air circus, but Baloo believes it would be too dangerous. In the biggest battle of the episode, Baloo shouts to Kiti to stay away from Daring Dan, to whom Kit shouts "NO! You can't tell me what to do! YOU * NO * * MY * * DAD *!" and buries his pillow on his face. The next day he leaves the air circus. Such a drama is a rarity of comics and it is hopefully welcome today. <br /> <br /> Characters have a lot of depth on them. Baloo is pretty much as he is in Jungle Book, plus or minus some laziness. Rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas about getting money, though theoretically good, are rarely good in practice. Molly is a cute little girl, but you can't mislead it. He can sometimes be a real hellion. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker sign than the rest. He does not trust adults unless they turn to him, and he has a tendency to interrupt the relationship. Look at his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs a gripping hook: he looks like he's ready to set it up right through the pirates. The characters that make this show in your book # 1. The Baloo and Kit relationship is very real, almost father and son. It's well shown in All's Whale That Ends Whale when Baloo takes Kit's word that Seymour is abusing his aquarium animals instead of visiting other adults. The relationship between Baloo and Becky is also realistic, as the motivation of Baloo's work stems from the desire to buy an ocean boat, not necessarily the desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he sent Duck back, he would still work for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> Sea Duck, not to mention all other aircraft, is pretty realistic. The functions of the aircraft do not change throughout the series (just as consistency is difficult), and unlike most other cartoons, "super-planes" do not have one weapon (unless you read mangoes!), And instead rely on a cunning pilot's great skill in distress come out. It's hard to think of a hero's vehicle that has no gun tower, laser cannon, or even a handrail. And the fact that they are using their head out of trouble is nowadays so difficult to find a cartoon. Plus it's just such a tough cool design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best comic. Never. Period. Definitely worth all ten stars!
