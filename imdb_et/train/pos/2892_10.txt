Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I haven't been watching this movie for the last five years. Magic remains. There is something that definitely includes this storytelling, the songs entertain and the secondary character is please. The wicked step sisters are totally evil and evil. Then all Disney is the most magical, the mice that dress and know the rest. All in all, the four Disney princess movies are great, but it's a magical magical experience, watching and enjoying. Oh, and of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you think Disney movies have really lost their charm. In the case of Elene Wood and others, this film has such a feeling, you just can't help but smile. They say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, there are some believers in the real world who are others. In this movie, it's even more magical than his rainbow smiles. <br /> <br /> And of course the rest ... Cinderella
