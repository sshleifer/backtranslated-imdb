"Holes" was a big movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I talked about said that they loved it. All the cast was suitable for the part they had, and Shia Labeouf is actually the future. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, just as I imagined him. anyone who has not seen it, I recommend it and I guarantee you "Dig".
