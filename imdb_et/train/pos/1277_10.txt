I think this movie is best for Mike Hammer, Biff Elliott's final is Mike Hammer. The Harry Essex script is great and contains many improvements in Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he uses light and shade well. John Alton's work is top-notch, as does Franz Waxman's score. Many veteran players are cast as well as Peggie Castle, which is memorable, like Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the best private eyeglasses ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have had more opportunities. I've always appreciated this movie.
