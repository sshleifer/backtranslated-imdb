"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on a cable. Having seen it for a while, we decided to watch this comedy. Based on James Van Druten's Broadway strike at Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer's vehicle in the early fifties, the film was screened by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the game into a pleasant comedy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, based on the comments made by IMDb, IMDb decides that the big problem seems to be the tying of two stars who collaborated on "Vertigo" released the same year. The release of the film did not reflect the difference in age when this film was released. In fact, most of the aging men of this period were always involved with much younger women. <br /> <br /> The movie in Manhattan at Christmas is a delightful comedy that is fascinated by viewers. Kim Novak was at the height of his beauty because it is clear that the camera loved him, no matter what he played. As a human witch, Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays the Shep 'Henderson publisher, is also his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows here why he was up. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles feature an excellent feature film Elsa Lanchester, which is a welcome film for every movie she shows here. Jack Lemmon's Nicky Holroyd, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also considered a writer for Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great opportunity to spend the night at home watching the Bell Book and Candle.
