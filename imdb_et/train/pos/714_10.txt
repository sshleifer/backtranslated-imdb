Even if you are not a big Ramones fan, Rock 'N' Roll High School * is still the biggest rock 'n' role movie ever made. Why? Because it is treating all camps with contempt for contempt and barely teenagers who often (and justifiably) feel the adult world of the boring, foolish, fascist establishment. This last scene is one of the most famous and uplifting recent scenes I can ever see in a movie. "My eyes have seen ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
