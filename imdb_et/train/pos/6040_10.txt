I just don't want to see FREEBIRD. My husband was extra, so I took part from the beginning. We've been in touch with Joni and helped promote the film on both Cinemas and DVD. Even if promotional cards are distributed across cross-border ferries and different locations across France. FREEBIRD was expertly written and focused on the perfect combination of fun and serious moments and choice. Only Phil Daniels could fit the role of Grouch. A great privilege to meet Joni and the party with the president in January. Anything else you just want to ask Joni, either by email or phone, you know how to get me. Sue xx
