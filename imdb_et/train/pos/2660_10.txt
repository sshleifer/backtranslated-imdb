When I first went to see The Shining, I was expecting a good movie of what I heard about it, and I liked a lot of Stanley Kubrick's work, but when I started watching it, it was so much better than I thought it would be. Sometimes I felt a terribly ridiculous discomfort and I could not keep the screen on my eyes, although the movie is very disturbing. Now, some people don't like Kubrick's The Shining version because it doesn't fully follow Stephen King's book, but I think both Kubrick's version, the mini series and the book are all great. Jack Nicholson has a great result. looking for a good original film that keeps you mindless after movies and watches The Shining.
