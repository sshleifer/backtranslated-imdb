A lot of undervalued film about a young musician caught in the ever-decreasing spiral of domestic violence. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is hard to see, while Morris Day is portrayed as a misogynist, princess as a knight (motorcycle) is still called twice by a woman as a manuscript. The fact that he can do this and still manifest itself as a faulty but legitimate hero is credit in writing. The prince in this film is so free that he is not just a narcissistic megalomania who wins women, but his most famous song is fictional as his father and Wendy & Lisa wrote. Moreover, two of his compositions - Computer Blue (undoubtedly the weakest album in the album) and Darling Nikki - are shown as songs that kill the audience. Perhaps the only honor for Princely ego is a map that lists (slightly shorter than Prince) Apollonia than 5'6. <br /> <br /> Almost complete amateurs are mostly band members who play themselves (and reviewers who slip participants in conditions that they have never appeared in other movies, this point is completely inadequate) and are doing their way. Morris Day gets most of the tiles for his nice ham, although Jerome Benton must also get credit for his good bounce, especially on the stage that is fun. Day and Benton even go so far as to make Abbott and Costello routine funny, which takes some things. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's a prince. Although I admit that it is biased, I think he is a pretty good actor capable of showing himself a low-key version. It's not his profession, it was a movie for entertainment, so anyone who drew attention to the fact that the leading man is not Robert DeNiro and thought they were making a point is unfortunately misled. I don't want this review to be an attack on other people's comments, but I've even created this movie with low budget and darkness. How then can we film about domestic violence? High altitude and CGI dinosaur walking? <br /> <br /> Is the film almost perfect for the timing of neon light and lean bindings? Until you remember that it was actually made of curly perms and tin in the syntax world, and it's not some retro entertainment. Prince's best film with Oscar winning music, he sees him on his musician and is sad to understand that although he does some good albums, he never misses that high score.
