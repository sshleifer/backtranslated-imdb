I was pretty young when it came out of the US, but I saved it on the TV and watched it over and over until the whole thing was remembered. To date, I can quote it myself. The exhibition itself was fun and had many famous symbols from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone, Mr T. The voices were great and sounded like the characters they represented. The dolls were well done, though a bit creepy. I was surprised that I recently learned that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, which I also show that I also have a lot. As the other person had previously commented, I was also a "friend" of this friend's robbery who borrowed it and did not return it. I would certainly like to have enough demand for this exhibition to justify the release of the DVD, but I do not think that enough people have heard of it. Maybe I'll try e-bay ...
