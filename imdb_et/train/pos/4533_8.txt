The first time Buster Keaton's first feature film and I have to admit that I liked it a lot and just wish I had it for years. At first, the Rohauer blurb warned that a three-year-old single nitrate printout was rediscovered and rescued in 1954 just before the burn, and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued were separated. So, it's rocky viewing places, but I've seen and stayed much worse. <br /> <br /> It would have been as short as three short films, but if you are intolerant, it is an inventive and funny finish from the beginning: rocky with baddie Wallace Beery Elephant and good-kink Buster pet brontosaurus; In the Roman era, Buster rides a wheeled zipper with a wagon adapted for sledging. In this technological need for speed and greed, his car falls beautifully on the first flank. Both her and Beery are after the girl ever. Favorite Bit: When a cave man knocks back over the edge of a cliff, but blows a kiss on the camera - an amazing second or two!
