I saw it recently on cable TV. The film is great; it is one of the few music I've seen that does not fear light and darkness. It depicts some of the glory of age with a lot of mess. Some pieces of dances take place so much that I don't know where to go. One day I go and see it on the big screen, so I see what's going on. But what really raises to another level is Oliver Reed's presentation as Bill Sykes. Not just a thorough and threatening person, but something else, some inner demons. He gave me the impression that if you put him in the corner, he was able to do something. It was almost the same as Sykes's mark on the edge of madness, but waiting for the trigger. I've seen Robert Newton's Bill Sykes movie of 1948, and I thought he was "just" a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's presentation frightened me in my living room.
