Roseanne's last season was crazy mountain biking. This last episode does exactly what the previous comment says, it tells us that as much as we could have thought we knew the characters we didn't do. Roseanne comes back to the season and tells us that this show has been the transfer of her life. He says in this last episode that he is exchanging events and people when he does. Scott wasn't really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David married their spouses in real life and Dan died when he lived. When events occurred in his life, he changed them in his writing. Don't we all want us to do that. Do not all of us have the time we want, so we can just use the extinguisher and change our liking. That's what he did with the whole episode. And to the second comment, I wouldn't feel deceived, the family was real, I just changed the way things happen in my life. A +, ending with A + show !!!!
