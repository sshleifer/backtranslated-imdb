I only saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but it has haunted me. <br /> <br /> One sequence is especially memorable and could only have been designed by a big director, as Michael Cacoyan undoubtedly has. Context: The weight of history and the mighty army and fleet are all on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. The act of holy holiness has blessed the seas, threatening his great expedition to Troy. He has said he has to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia Apollo to bring wind to thousands of ships. At first he stood, but he went around and tricks his wife Clytemenstra to bring his daughter to a Greek camp to marry the biggest warrior Achille. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia will be able to sacrifice and rage against gods for protection and revenge. In the meantime, proud Achilles discover that his name has been used in such fraud, in an unfair form. He climbs the mountain to tell Iphigenia that he is protecting him. <br /> <br /> Shooting: The camera circulates two young people without looking at each other. They blame their destiny and the weakness of men who cheat their loved ones and the body war. Suddenly they look at each other and for a moment we feel both our power and beauty, and the irony of the unstable - except the camera - that at some other time, in another place, they could love each other and be married. It is a sharp and sad epiphany that only lasts for a moment. <br /> <br /> What direction! What a camera! What storytelling!
