"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" was a disguised dispute before it ever existed, and this contradiction can conceal the achievement of the film. <br /> <br /> Those who criticized the movie they didn't see did so with good intentions based on mistaken thinking that it would be too sympathetic to Hitler. But they realized incomprehensibly: the humanization of evil Hitler is not a compassion with him. It is much more annoying to understand that the inexplicable acts of one of the greatest rogues in history have been committed by man. Sick, sick maniac to be sure, but man is still. You need to know the story of how Hitler came to power to prevent it from happening again. makes Hitler a human without ever being redeemed. Carlyle feels flawlessly about the appearance and motives of the Nazi leader, while never allowing a personality to become a comic or a distant one (something Anthony Hopkins could not have put on Hitler's "Bunker" yet another good TV set). film). Although Hitler's fear and virulent anti-Semitism have rejected them, Carly gives him some magnetism and power that true Adolf Hitler must keep. After all, though else would the people follow him? <br /> <br /> Among the various sub-blocks, the most notable features are Matthew Modine's reporter Fritz Gehrlich, who makes his life work to draw attention to the reality of Hitler and Nazism. Although Modine's play is a bit inclined in Part 1, Part 2, that she's settled down, this character gives us a real hero in a full-length movie. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also support strong support. <br /> <br /> Part 1 of this two-part mini-series suffered a bit of inconvenience, including a look at Hitler's childhood that lasts only for the duration of the opening credit. And in Part 2, the parts that describe Hitler's relationship with his brother and his lover Eva Braun are less successful than the central plot, but give us an additional insight into his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, no Hitler movie can understand us. The average person is fortunately capable of ever realizing a man who would try to destroy a whole human race. "Hitler: The Evil Rise" is trying to make us less aware of Hitler's understanding and more to understand how he came to power. This is an important story to be talked about, and it is impossible to believe that someone who saw the film accuses him of having something other than the best intentions and the ability to do something other than good. > 9 out of ten. *** 1/2
