A good Korean film not only from Taekwondo, but from what it does is good, like the way of hell, can not win the Taekwondo guy in his sport, because there are rules like life and school, and this film is a concept with this undertone. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in this movie aren't that good, but it's satisfying and enjoyable. Friends who continue to do something they repeat will become stronger than the mind and heart. This movie is not meant to be too serious if it is tiny, but it also carries a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie from Korea again.
