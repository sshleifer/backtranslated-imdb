I thought the king Solomon's mines were beautifully made. My only reservation was Alison Doody. His acting was great, but his makeup and hair were not from time to time and he always seemed to look next to other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see that flavored, tough looking actor in this role after sitting through the movie after the movie honest hair, fair skinned actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt etc. She was a great choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version cannot be compared to the 1950s version of Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a TV movie. I thought both Quatermins were believable, but these two media should be kept separate. I look forward to it again, and I hope that Patrick Swayze will look again at this type of role.
