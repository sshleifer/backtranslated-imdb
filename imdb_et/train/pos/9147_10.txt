As a Prince fan of the last three to four years, I really can't believe I just got to see "Purple Rain". The special edition of the new 2-year anniversary Special Edition led me to buy. Wow, I was really looking forward to watching it, but I wasn't ready just how it really is. Prince's musical performance in the whole movie is nothing amazing - he really is in this movement. I am very familiar with (repeated) hearings of the classic "Purple Rain" album and all its songs, but in the context of the movie, to see them, your stories and lyrics change - like COMPUTER BLUE, BEAUTIFUL ONES, DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN itself. For the scenes where Prince and Revolution occur, there is something hypocritically hypnotic. Final Songs BABY I'M STAR and I would like to show UU how much energy and talent alone in the middle of the mid 20s (he's full!), That blew me away. It even makes Michael Jackson into his lifetime even in his peak years. <br /> <br /> The Prince will show you how to win your dream girl - ride her lake, make her jump, drive away - absolutely fun Some scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally fun, but it adds to the overall charm of the movie. Morris Day is the coolest cat (and fun) and when his group The Time fills BIRD, you see Morris Day and Jerome Benton illuminates the Minneapolis funk style - I love their dance in this bit and how Benton offers Morris the average performance of the mirror. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see it again, I really can't! The extras are terrible - especially when you see the young Eddie Murphy before acknowledging Beverly Hills Cop that he is "Prince groupie".
