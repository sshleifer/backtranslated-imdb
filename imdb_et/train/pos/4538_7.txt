I didn't want this movie even after reading Maltin's review and 1 1/2 star rating. I watched it on my son's advice and found it much better than I expected. I'd give this 2-star star a 4-star system. To understand everyone, you need to watch the movie more than once. If you don't know much about religion, you will be much. I finished the high school year when the film was made, so maybe I can better communicate with it. Yes, there are some complaints in the movie and it is somewhat strange, but it was what you expect in the 70s. I see why people don't like the movie; but i don't understand that people say it's boring. Film is nothing but boring. You hate it or love it. If you find that it's boring, you're probably dead.
