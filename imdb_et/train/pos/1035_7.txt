This film was chosen as the best picture, but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas beat Humphrey Bogart for the best actor. I don't see why Lucile Watson was the best actor, I just don't think she did a great job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave for Mexico and come to the United States in the first scene of the movie. They drive by train to relatives of Davis. Davis and Lukas were underground to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need to rest. But when they get home, there are the Nazis who can't do it. It turns out that the Nazis only care for the money and are ready to deal with Lukas. They are more on the plot, but you can find out for yourself.
