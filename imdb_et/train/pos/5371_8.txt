I first commented on this movie almost five years ago. Then, the ideas in the film seemed to be fictional when they actually appeared. Not anymore. Politics, Society and Media Running Manis really seem very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors that were mostly absent in 1987 (the year when the runner came), which is today: <br /> <br /> worry, as Richard Dawson's character Damon Killian says "traditional morality". CHECK <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort by competitors. CHECK <br /> <br /> Cameras everywhere. CONTROL <br /> <br /> Limited travel for citizens who are in the gloom of a government government headed by a centralized computer system that includes passport-code passports (in "travel agencies") and is punished by national security. CONTROL <br /> <br /> Increased confusion with blood vessels, government, and media. CHECK <br /> <br /> Computer-generated graphics that are sufficiently developed to manipulate real-world movie material (such as the "digital matte" stunt-double of Ben Richards's image). CONTROL <br /> <br /> Preventing inconsistent objections or pests by the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> Expanding a significant economy between rich and non-wealthy countries; an increasing number of political parties that are reacting to tightening up the big government; Citizens' riots brewing on or around almost every major public event, regardless of its origin or will. CONTROL, CONTROL, CONTROL <br /> <br /> Then it may be just a movie based on Stephen King's short story. But to be safe, I moved to Switzerland.
