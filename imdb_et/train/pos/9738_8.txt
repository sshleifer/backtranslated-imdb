Oh dear we don't like our super-hero love interest developing the brain we do? <br /> <br /> Something has happened to people, they have lost the ability to enjoy, a simple feeling, a love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed at least five times loud and I was not ashamed to say that I had a tear a few times. Cast, act, and scripts are great, I watch a lot of movies across the table and I didn't see any success in such a genre. Those who disagree, tell me where I find some! I'm sure this book is good, but I think you have to evaluate it yourself.
