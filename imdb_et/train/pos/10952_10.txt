Sarah Silverman is a dangerous female! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read the second comment of this exhibition, but also the things on the bulletin board, and people just don't get it. Something that appears to T.V is not an accident. Too much money, time and work is put on T.V. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid. This show is a minor because Sarah wanted it to be a minor. I thought the jokes were big and the themes and other musical numbers were strange. It's a lot like Pee-Wee's playhouse, which is wrongly regulated, twenty-something glue sniffing, Future Pornstars of America Valley. Cast is awesome. Scenarios and activities are well developed. I hope this exhibition will succeed because Comedy Central will not let David keep his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? He is not on the front page of the exhibition on the front page of the exhibition. I would like to see my views. Does anyone know about their future show dates or DVDs that can swim there?
