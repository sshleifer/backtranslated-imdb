Of the three remakes of this parcel, I like everything, I have all three VHSs, and there's a copy of it on the DVD. There are just enough variations in the scripts to make all three entertainments and follow up. In addition, are all the other films rebuilt every three stars? Of course, its most important stars are big but supportive actors are also great. I especially like William Tracy as Pepi. He was a stageer I was looking for to find other movies he has. He appeared in many, but most are not available. As with other comments, I also say - buy it.
