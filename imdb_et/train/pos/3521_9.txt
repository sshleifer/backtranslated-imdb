The other reviewers have well summed up the movie noir. I just wanted to add "Whew!" comment on one reviewer who made Elisha Cook's apparently coke fuel drum episode. It was nice, I have to say. Cook deserves praise for his amazing action. A little trivia I say: Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 Barbara Stanwycki movie "Fire." He was a waiter in a nightclub where Barbara sang and the legendary drummer Gene Krupa was drummer, most energetic. Is it too much to assume that the drumming of Cook spazzy in later film "Phantom Lady" was inspired by Krupa's work, as Cook showed 3 years ago? <br /> <br /> When you look at the Krupat under the "Ball of Fire", I think you will notice some clearly similar body movements. Of course, he hopes that at no point did HE influence any drugs!
