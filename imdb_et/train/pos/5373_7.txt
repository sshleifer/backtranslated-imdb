Maybe this is not the absolute biggest entry in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it will definitely win the prize for the most inventive episode! "The house that Bled died"? I can tighten this title all day without ever getting tired of it! And after a wonderful title, this short film will also benefit from a well-written scenario and a handful of truly alternating moments. This may require additional viewing before you understand the peculiar end-to-end wrestling, but it is definitely short for the original idea's horror. The story opens with the older couples who drink their tea in their middle-class house. The husband kills his wife sadistically and several years later the "damn" house is still for sale. The young couple and their cherubic daughter move and start to recover, but mysterious events take place and affect the young Sophie in particular. His beloved cat is even killed on his birthday, when one of the pipes in the house suddenly sprays the whole blood of the guests (especially cooling it!). Is the old house haunted? Maybe the seemingly helpful neighbors are causing the horror? The answers to these questions are presented in an original and rather unpredictable climax and there is even room for real shock. The tension is masterfully built and the title house is full of terrifying landscapes, such as a couple of rusty machines used by the spouse to kill the spouse. However, a small warning is that the queue with the cat is hard to see if you are a lover of animals. In conclusion, the second Hammer winner of the short TV series!
