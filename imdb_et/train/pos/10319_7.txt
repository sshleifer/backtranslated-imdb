Having read many other comments on this film on IMDb, the purists are clearly in agreement that this film is not like the books on which it is based. At this point, I can't comment after ever reading some of the main characters. However, what I can say for sure is that it seems to me that many of these reviewers must definitely go through the sense of humor; Let's face it - this movie is just so much fun! <br /> <br /> OK ?? .. so I have to admit the point that the film is probably not characteristic / characteristic, but we put it in a clear perspective? .. Are the same people who are on this movie also annoyed that the classic classic 1960s Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book? Or perhaps STILLES is in the same turmoil that the 1980 Flash Gordon film version was too much of the original series? <br /> <br /> It's important that this movie is an incredibly camp, but it's just that charm! <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays a hero in this name (and carries more than a passing similarity to Gary Busey to launch it!) and is supported by a large supportive cast who all seem to have a role with their roles . Also look at the very short but very welcome look of horror movie favorite Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> The best scene? Too many to choose from, but look at the fun facial expressions received by the waiter when Savage and his men take the final form of ordering coke, lemonade and milk! Also often labeled at the end of the movie, where Savage deals with her genius in Captain Seas using a variety of martial arts specialties that are labeled on the screen! ? Priceless! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie doesn't take anything seriously and is even more fun. Great fun from start to finish! (and you will sing John Phillip Sousa custom theme song a few days later!)
