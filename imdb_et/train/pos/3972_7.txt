In the G-Men tradition, House On 92. Street, The Street With No Name, is now an FBI story, one of the carefully monitored films that showed the best of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Although the 48-year-old director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, it is not shown in any other light. <br /> <br /> Don Whitehead's book based on this film is a straightforward history of the office. from its inception in 1907 until about the time when the film "FBI Story" appeared. Sometimes it is important to remember if the FBI was before it was led by Edgar Hoover. Part of that time is also in the movie. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers did not make a documentary to give FBI flesh and blood that created the fictional character of John 'Chip' Hardesty. Hardesty, played by James Stewart, is a career FBI man who graduated from the Faculty of Law and practiced in the early 20s with an office. <br /> <br /> In real life led by Burns, Private Detective Bureau of William J Burns. In fact, it was an extremely political operation, as shown in the film. Burns was on the outskirts of Harding's administration scandals. When Hoover was named in 1924 to bring professional remedies and high standards of competence, he did just that. Through the Hardesty family, Stewart and Vera Miles, we see the history of the FBI. In addition, we see a lot of our personal family history that is fully integrated into the FBI's own story. Stewart and Miles are definitely all American couples. We follow the FBI in some cases where Stewart is involved, arresting a plot of Ku Klux Clan, a plot to murder oil-rich Indians, lowering the thirty-year-infamous criminals, their involvement in Nazi sympathy in World War II and the Communists. Espionage during the Cold War. <br /> <br /> There is a certain type of prologue, where Stewart tells the class at the FBI academy before going into the office's history. This includes a bomb placed on the airline by a son who bought a lot of his life insurance before flying. Nick Adams gives you evil when the offender and story are unfortunately relevant today. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the FBI story is written and produced today, it would reflect something different and not American. However, the FBI has a story to say, and it's not negative at all. <br /> <br /> The FBI story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films, but it's the first thing I've ever seen as an actor with my favorite, so he has a special affection for me. If the whole FBI had been formed by Jimmy Stewart, I would feel much better about it. Murray Hamilton is also his friend and co-author, killed by baby's face with Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles did not marry Stewart but married a FBI movie showing. It is dated mostly, but it still has a good and interesting story.
