Roman Polanski is considered to be one of the most important leaders of our time, such as the classics such as "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown". Polanski's cinema is likely to make it very interesting that although he can create commercially attractive films, such as the above-mentioned masterpieces, he is also a very personal character for the creation of de minimis films. "Le Locataire" or "Tenant" is one of those films; horror / temporary story of paranoia and obsession, one of his best works and probably the best hero films ever made. <br /> <br /> Polanski himself plays Telkovski, a young man looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds it, he finds it empty because the previous tenant Simone Choule tried to jump out of the window. After Simone's death, Trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with him, believing that his tenants were the cause of his death. <br /> <br /> With the same claustrophobic knowledge, his other "apartment-related" films ("Repulsion &" Rosemary's Baby ""), which focuses on a bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely with Trelkovski's head, are a catastrophic consequence of paranoia and an odd obsession with it. with the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Trelkovski's descent into the darkness is perfectly portrayed by Polanski, although first his appearance seems strange and wood, slowly it turns out that Polanski is acting in this way, because Trelkovsky is supposed to have acted almost as it did A life who strives for himself in the madness of the submissive world where the strange collection lives, the supporting actors gave life to people who create memorable signs. It is also very important for the success of the film. <br /> <br /> The beautiful film art of Polanski also helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to a beautiful building that is Trelkovsky's cage. Pictures that Polanski uses to convey confusion and madness is supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive. <br /> <br /> If there is an error in the movie, is it definitely a bit slow. it may seem like a shutdown, but actually the slow pace of action works great because it mimics Trelkovsky's own boring life and how he gradually enters another area. Also, the complicated story is not understandable due to many complex layers. But more than a mistake, it is a pleasure to face a provocative plot like this. <br /> <br /> Although the "tenant" may not be all, those who are interested in psychological horrors and the surrealist lion's experience are happy. Le Locataire is indeed one of Roman Polanksi's masterpieces. 10/10
