Personally, I think the film is pretty good. It describes the actual situation of the Hong Kong triads and gives the viewer the opportunity to organize triads. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the trio and why the police are not just going out and sweeping the triplets. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is quite violent because of the methods of killing and torture. Nonetheless, the film remains true to the real world, so violence is only a reflection of what is actually happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to every Triad / Mafia movie fan. Another good time would be Dragon Squad. This film has more weapons than it does, because there are more knives than weapons in this movie (I really don't remember seeing a single weapon).
