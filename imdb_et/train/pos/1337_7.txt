......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Don't get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or even not) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new theme for Bollywood. The subject was accepted, but it is far from Jism, murder and Julie. To tell the truth, the subject is very clean. But the plot has a number of clicks. The beginning of the movie is presented in a very "movie" way. There are some very small plot holes. The movie gets once when Rani has a break in her pregnancy, where you feel you are watching something other than a regular film. Otherwise, the whole family's order seemed superfluous at first. Operation would not have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses and sometimes lets you down. Here he gave one of the best performances. In addition, his role is so well written that you praise each time he solves the problem. Rani Mukherjee was enough. Throughout the film you will feel the most characteristic, but it is overshadowed by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is the perfect picture. Of these three, he gives everyone money for his money. His surprising how he can be as convincing as he is innocent. And trust me, Madhubala is far from your girl. This role is one of the reasons I appreciate his high. Supporting cast is like a family you see in HAHK, where they don't have any importance on the plot, but I found them acceptable here. The songs are pretty nice. The title song is my favorite with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (See the World's Eye) are two songs that fit perfectly with the film. Preities cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been shortened, while No. 1 in Punjab was boring, although he had a good dance. Otherwise, the movie is definitely worth watching.
