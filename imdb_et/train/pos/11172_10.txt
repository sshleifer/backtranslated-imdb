I personally love this movie and the novel (I read the book first and decided to see the movie). First, the plot is truly original and original. Action is also great and I love pouring. Judd Crandall (played by Fred Gwynne) is perfect for his role and really sells it to you. There are also some shiny lines (Idk when they were meant to be a crown), but they really ease the mood and give a good laugh. The ambience of the film is really the perfect place to film this movie and it will draw you to the whole movie. Not only do you love it, but you want to see it again and again, I recommend it to 100% for every spooky fan!
