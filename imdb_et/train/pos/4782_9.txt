Well, it's definitely the opposite of anything else that was staged by Lynch. No supernatural things, no violence, no fear. However, it is a beautiful flick. It's a little slow, but maybe it was deliberate because it's a story of an old man's 6 weeks (that's my best duration). The characters are everyday people and so they are plausible. The performances are good and the last scene was very touching. Anyone with a brother can be involved. Lyle and Alvin don't even have to say anything. For a moment they have come back in the old days and all the battles have been forgotten.
