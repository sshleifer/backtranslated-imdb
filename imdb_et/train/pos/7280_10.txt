it's like a baby. Although I probably think it is terrible now, it was a kind of horrible thing because I was just seven or so. I also remember when I look at it on Saturday-afternoon, so I didn't pay much attention. Nevertheless, the scene of the current boulders has since burned in my mind. I have asked many people when they have seen this flick, but without results. 12 years ago, one person mentioned that he might have seen it, but he thought it was just a dream; obvious piffle like wind. It's not a dream, my friend. Don't dream now. Again, I haven't seen it since then, but I can't wait to find a copy and that would be my videotape. Something that can get stuck in my eyes for 23 years is worth 10.
