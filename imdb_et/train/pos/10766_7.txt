A thin story with lots of fine frames. Here are three women who are D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the man involved. Traci Lords makes a convincing out-of-the-box business for a woman who is going to poison the world with antrax. The original in this film is a breastbomb bomb put on a photographed member of the D.R.E.A.M. Of course, he will save his fellow three seconds before the explosion. Although James Bond 'Goldfinger' and 'You live live' are clearly borrowed, this climax always works well. All in all, a nice watch, James Bond replaced three Charlie angels here.
