Sandra Bernhard is without you, a film released in 1990, followed by his 1988 off-Broadway performance concert products ... which he and others refer to in the film as his "smashed one-woman show". "<br /> <br /> Monologues and one liner made many changes and the film version visually breaks the story of Sandra's excellent existence as a successful performer in New York, at the time she calls her" superstar summer "illusory, almost desperate to return to her at home in Los Angeles - his fictional director in the movie refers to how Sandra returns to "roots" to ... dear dinner clubs like Paris room. "Here's the point. Sandra is trying to criticize her liberal worldview and sometimes the tougher American pop culture for an audience that can't see it. In L.A, he plays mostly black audiences trying to associate his ideas when all these people want it to be a "Shashonna", a Madonna-like stripper. And even when Shashonna danced the drum strokes that resemble "Like Virgin", the audience doesn't have much to say about enjoying this show. The whole scene of the film has dried up as a bone. The funny scene you can catch is the audience guy who helps Shashonna out of his pants. <br /> <br /> But when he goes down, Sandra does with style and power, delivering everything from insecure trust to penetration ... right to the point where she is naked (literally), asking to accept and still have a swim its a transparent stardomi pool. His images of interactions with Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we believe are) Warren Beatty are fancy and fun. <br /> <br /> Sandra starts her show at her most uncomfortable moment, performing a silent but mysterious Nina Simone song "Four Women", dressed in muff and other African clothing, singing like "my skin is black" , "my hair is woolly" and "they call me Sweet Thing." He raises and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of Andy Warhol's property prices: "Stay with Andy to have wisdom and sensitivity Hours and the workforce that went to the Indian product ... that they have been so happy that the whole thing of Santa Fe is happening. "He talks about Hollywood's excesses, then comforting an innocent friend, warning him," Mister, if it is for Ishtar, then I will rise right now and walk my life forever, because it is too sensitive for me! ‚ÄùSandra illustrates the expectations of women at the age of feminism, dressed as a Cosmo girl, she talks about the fantasy of her young girls to you to become executive secretary and marry his boss. Eventually he gets relief: "I can never be statistics, not me. I'm under 35 and I'm married!" <br /> <br /> Sandra expands the opening of sexuality in society: "If she touches you at night, she feels good, or does she feel real? I'm saying it looks real ... MIGHTY line." <br /> In the end, he cries out in a progressive American society for the change, spreading the disco holiday Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and saying, "Finally, all funk!" <br /> All of this is a shiny, schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performance written by Billy Paul. Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro, but some. At the same time, Sandra floats in an ideal, fancy embodiment - a mirror image created by her - around the city, a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers, reading Kabbalah, learning chemistry and listening to NWA rap music. br /> <br /> Without you, Sandra Bernhard explores the emotions and existence she played with Late Night as a regular guest with David Letterman. His almost child-like enthusiasm for shock, exhibited in the 1980s, is discarded in the face of subtle temptation, and his confidence in materialism and American fame is refreshing. This approach to comedy would make Sandra head forever and celebrate a more mature, more pleasant entertainer who comes. <br /> <br /> If you like exquisite humor about making internal jokes about glamor, fame, sex, loneliness, despair and low expressions of love and kinship, this film will keep you in the sewing. It may not be funny everywhere. Perhaps it is somewhat regrettable or even ugly. But consider the world of negligence with Sandra's colors and understand how funny and brilliant she really is. <br /> <br /> But look, without you, I'm having a friend "knowing" it's definitely more fun. Before you know it, you have two trades with Sandra's barbers, and you get confused by all the others.
