Overall, I was pretty impressed with the pilot. The first 15 minutes were worrying because they felt that the creators were trying to create a version of OC's science fiction, but that fear was corrected when a terrorist incident arose, and here are the topics and situations that I rarely see in television. The BSG dealt with topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but they were mainly subtitles where the viewer had to think or ignore if they wanted to. On the other hand, these topics are focused on the exhibition and I personally found myself in works like Ghost In The Shell and Matrix as reference points for viewing and surprisingly how well the topics were discussed. I think if you are two of these fans or other movies / TV shows on the topics I mentioned, I think you'll find at least something here. <br /> <br /> The starting point for explaining how the situation we learned in BSG thought they were doing in a very interesting way, especially how they explained where Cylon's faith in God and the creation of Caprica was just enough advanced and modern technology that has come to appear in the future but is not stranger to us as a viewer. <br /> <br /> The only real weak spot I noticed was the relationship between Greystone's parents and the actor playing Lacy Rand. . Although I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, it seemed that their scenes were missing from chemistry, but now it may just be for their characters to develop, but that is something I think needs to work. I also found Magda Apanowicz in his role incredible. It may again fall short of the experience and the time needed to develop, but throughout the episode, his actions seemed to be forced and not completely sure. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot, I hope to see where Caprica will go in the future and hopefully it will do what BSG once did.
