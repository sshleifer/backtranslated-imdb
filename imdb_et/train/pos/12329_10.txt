Before watching, make sure you've seen a living dead night ... This may be the best 7-minute parody I've ever seen! An absurd, funny "special effect" (rope, rope !!!) and bread baking slices ... what else do you need ??? <br /> <br /> (Don't look at this movie while eating bread ... you may be scared!)
