The shower keeps itself in so many ways. Almost all of the films take place in the old town in the old days, where the deans provide humor, stamens and emotional touch. The love and friendship of the owner and his retarded son are deep and moving. The way an older brother pulls into this tiny world seems impossible and convincing. The plot is curled, full of surprises and irony, and it generally touches on what I have to do in the neighborhood to interact with performers and conflicts. This is a movie I pull out when I want to believe the world again.
