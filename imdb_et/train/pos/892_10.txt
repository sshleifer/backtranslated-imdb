sammo must be 10 out of 10 for this movie because he has it all. great story, big fighting, big characters and big blacksmiths. <br /> <br /> This film sees fatty and nail fat. sammo takes a casuade of casinos in the casino, losing a fight, but what the fight is full of high tempo and comedy elements. <br /> <br /> Some great and moving moments on the film, Lam Ching ying opens up a cameraman and can be killed off - gutted. <br /> <br /> The final order comes back to the scroll button as it is one of the best end-of-the-line fighting I've seen. sammo takes loads of boys and reaches the square until it is very small.
