This and the "Hidden Castle" are the most expensive for me in Kurosawa. I'm not out of 10 like candy, but it definitely deserves something. Although it is quite long (like all Kurosawa quite a lot), it agreed with the problem that most of my movies make a mistake; the story is often too loose and slowly evolving, including scenes that are unnecessary or simply prolonged, without the actual purpose, style or description of the characters. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience as "Hidden Castle"; Despite its length, no minutes were cut out. <br /> <br /> This is also a very unusual Kurosawa movie with no story but a lot of independent stories based more on other Kurosawa films I've seen so far. It also relies heavily on the dialogue it uses perfectly (especially the story between the father and the son who is planning his new house). What makes it a masterpiece is how the subject is as tragic as it is, to be able to describe it so humanly and compassionately, without anyone seeing a finger at any point. From start to finish, it gives the whole emotional scale a laugh to a perfect balance.
