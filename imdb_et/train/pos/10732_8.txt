I saw that this movie is super He didn't surprise himself when it happened for the truth, in the way he flew to what it was not, but that's just a conspiracy theory, right? <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie when I was a kid. I am interested in what happened when it turned out that such a flight was really, certainly not because of faith, because it denies logic and reason. Who in a healthy mind sends a space shuttle to children orbit. I like to read the topic, American and Soviet space programs very much. I know that the CIA provided some space shuttle clauses with the TOP SECRET clause, which are definitely my exits, but who knows?
