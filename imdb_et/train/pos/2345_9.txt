I really enjoyed the first episode and look forward to more. Slightly soft offense (it is almost an afterthought and not terribly suspicious or refined) but thought that the angle of romance was wonderfully charming. Surely watching again! <br /> <br /> I hope they have a bigger role in the aunts who are wonderful actors and who were somewhat underestimated at that time. An actor who plays an assistant / speaker (also think of Bewitched) is very sweet and bubble-free and comes as nice and sweet as stupid and annoying, which is very nice. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
