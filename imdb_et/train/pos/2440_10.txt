OSSA. I saw this movie at the Irish International Film Festival in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both letters were present and were later available for questions. WHAT IS THE MOST FILM! Although it is in the midst of Catholic / Protestant antagonism in Ireland, this story could have happened between any two groups that hate each other. Fear of how fast people can throw their anger and anger into a beautifully humorous humor and fun-moving love story. If it doesn't rise in the United States, it would be most regrettable. <br /> <br /> As for letters and supporting players ... FIRST RATE. I heard they are Ireland's Meryl Streep, Orla Brady. I think he's better than Meryl Streep. They should call American Orla Brady Meryl! And Liam Cunningham's persistent and powerful image of a simple and private person who was sucked into political warfare was brilliant. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS MOVI.
