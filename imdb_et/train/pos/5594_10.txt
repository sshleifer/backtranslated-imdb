Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Hedy Lamarr (like Hedy Kiesler) deals with the world. an English wedding dress screen. It was supposed to be the beginning of a legendary career. It was our brilliant introduction to the most beautiful woman to whom the silver screen was loved. <br /> <br /> The Eva (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seem to be interested in her romantic success. She returns to a lonely bed and in a beautiful scene she hides her wedding ring when her marriage error is overcome. The man seems to be more interested in purity and order than he loves. Gustav Machaty uses beautiful camera angles and pristine shots to capture Lamarri's remarkable talent and beauty. If the film is not spoken at the beginning, it will be able to understand the sympathy, the heart and our support. This is the combination that made the 1930s audience what they saw when the movie opened. "Ecstasy" was considered a shocking time ... Some thought it was scandalous. <br /> <br /> He returns home to his father's estate and divorce. The next day he awakens the feeling of total freedom and happiness. He just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and the fresh air. Eva goes horseback riding and happens over a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamar was the first person to ever look naked on a big film. Her stupid forest and her skinny-sudden adventure in the lake were legendary scandalous. But the audience could not stay away. As with many contemporary films, the contradiction caused this film to be seen. <br /> <br /> Eva's naughty adventure introduces her to a beautiful young man who helps her find her horse that had run off with her clothes. After an uncomfortable meeting, they eventually fall to each other. Their first romantic reunion was almost as controversial as the naked scene of erotic waves. But Machaty does a beautiful job in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one pleasant moment when Eva seems to be literally her new lover using a wonderful early camera. <br /> <br /> It cannot be overestimated by the bravery of Lamarr. Many may have assumed that this is a suicide for a career. Instead, he got his worldwide fame and eyeed Louis B Mayer, who signed the contract with MGM. There are even truly erotic moments in this film, even with today's dirty standards. It is impossible to imagine how they became in the 1930s. Again, Machaty was very smart with his imagination, leaving a lot of imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is very well done. <br /> <br /> Eva's former husband and his current lover are perhaps inevitable. But the consequences of this meeting are not. The film takes a couple of unexpected moves in its final act, and it all makes a great story and a lovely debut on Hedy Lamarri's film stardom. <br /> <br /> I recommend this very controversial, now we make a movie and invite you to look for it in a restored DVD. It is well worth it if only the joy of seeing Hedy Lamarri. But the story is also convincing and the direction is ahead of time. Ecstasy is a memorable early treasure. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler Movie Reviews !!!
