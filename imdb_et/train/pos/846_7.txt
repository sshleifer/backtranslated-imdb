Two years ago I watched the movie "Matador" and I loved all this movie. Apparently, I was completely impressed by Pierce Brosan's excellent role. Yesterday I tried to film this movie again on TV, so I looked a little deeper. Now I can say for sure that this movie is not so special, but you have to love it for one man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan, in my opinion, is raising his grade amazingly with Julian Noble, a tired striker who has no friends. Soon Julian will meet with Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, who has a bad luck: his son died in an accident, his job is not working well and he is not sure he can keep his wife Bonn (Hope Davis). br /> <br /> I always liked such movies; criminal movie with a great sense of humor. Mostly, humor comes from Brosna when he speaks of a funny dwarf who has a big d ... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I see Bangkok as a whore on Sunday morning after the naval left city." Brosnan says this to his charm when he drinks his margarita as usual. I also like Greg's 'typical American face' in Kinnear's loser role, which is very lively because there are many people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So I suggest you look at Brosnan ever. He makes you smile and admire at the same time. Big Brosnan is not an equally big movie.
