If the answer to this question is yes, you should enjoy this great movie. I've just seen it a few hours ago here in Paris (where the film's going on) and I still feel a great trauma ... What a visual shock! I've never seen such a beautiful black-and-white photo and such a drastic change in the way the animated film is made. I firmly believe that before and after the "Renaissance", like what we saw with Pixar's films or with Akira's and GhostInTheShell's experiences. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films and I hope this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with some young people who had a dream called "Renaissance" ...) gets the success and recognition it deserves. Vive la France!
