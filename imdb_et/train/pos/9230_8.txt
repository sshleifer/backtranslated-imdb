There is so much to say about this movie. This is not your typical nunsploitation. Of course, nuns have nudity and sexuality, but it is almost always a story. <br /> <br /> It is set in the 15th century in 800 martyrs of Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians is a good part of the film. It was interesting when everyone went to the Muslim levers, that the mother's boss asked, "Why are you afraid of Muslims, do nothing that Christians have done to you?" There was certainly enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to the monastery to defeat her father. There are many things that are witnessing and going on in the process: slave burning, rape of a local woman by a new Duke, torture of a nun, who was crossed during a visit to Tarantula's sect, and whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew. Torture was particularly tough when a hot wax was poured on a nun, and his nipples were cut off. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia is definitely still in trouble because she doubts the man's dominant society in which she lives. He even asks Jesus why father, son, and holy spirit are all men. <br /> <br /> Finally, he joins the Muslim leader as his lover and they offer a monastery. Here is where you can see more meat than you can enjoy at once. But the tragedy comes. He succeeds all, including the Duke and his father, in a sweet revenge, but finds that the Muslim lover treats him exactly the same. She's a woman and that's all about it. <br /> <br /> I do not describe what the sacred men of the church did at the end of the end, but that was before the torture of Saw or the hostel. decades. <br /> <br /> Nunsploitation fans are pleased with the treatment, but film students find a lot of meat to digest.
