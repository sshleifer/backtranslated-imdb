True story (occurred in Kansas in 1959) about murder (Perry and Dick, two former prisoners who broke the rainy house at night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks led the cool and disturbing Capote book about the causes of these children (Are they born as wild killers)? The crime scenes are very cruel and haunting because of the lack of senses and the reasons for the witnesses. Wonderful black-and-white filmmaking from Conrand Hall, a superb road music score from Quincy Jones, amazing performances in two main roles with Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, and for the first time in the film, a sad comment on the death penalty at the last minute before their death. Jones, Hall and Brooks (director and custom scriptwriter) are candidates for the Academy Award. One of the best films of this decade is captured, superbly targeted and scary
