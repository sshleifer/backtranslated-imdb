This program is fun and the title song is so memorable that I can't get it out of my head. I find that when I get old I pull those wrinkles who do things and these four are excellent in their quest. Part of what they do is outrageous, but brilliant, because now our number of days with our PC world can never do it in real life. I always learn something from exhibitions. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and little forensic work, then you love this example. It reminds me of Quincy, ME one way, and Barney Miller another way they work and react to each other. They turn a lot, but they get the job off and it counts.
