Although I tend to agree with other comments made by this film, I am ashamed to say that I like it. Often, such a big 80s pair can not find Whamis outside! video, so it's definitely worth watching (0.79 euros per night in my local shop!). See that the monster costume has gently visible seams and zippers. The fact that the hero looks like Keith Chegwin and the classic lines like Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "Finally we meet Kor ..." Kor: "Exciting, isn't it?" <br /> <br /> Amazing! I also like the fact that although the video box looks quite fascinating about the city surrounded by scary seas like a bird with a safe hero hero (among other things, "interesting and interesting" suggestions in the real movie, none of them actually happen.) I'm not kidding ... there's not really an angry sea or wild bird, it's just trying to interest you ... classic in my opinion.
