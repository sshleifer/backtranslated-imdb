It was a cutting-edge film with a cutting edge game. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and especially Christopher Lloyed are in this fascinating movie, dealing with real angels, helping the angels' baseball team. You never know, it can happen. I loved the role of Lloyd in that. He was fun. The story is about switching your life, because the child's faith in angels helped turn the angry, tempered and nervous leader Glover, who sees the best in people. The film was well done and also how to see people the best and achieve their dreams. It was funny, charming, touching and sad, all very well done. You like it (or love). I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
