I really liked 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996, five years later, when I saw 102 Dalmatians in 2001, I thought it was fantastic, but I think 101 is better because I think it's more funny, more humor and also this movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred single games (1961), I don't know if there are 103 Dalmatian plans. I hope it is, maybe yes, maybe not, All of us fans must find if there are 103 Dalmatians in the future.
