I tried a little on the public television of this concert and knew I had to do it. The boys give all the Royal Albert a great, often excitement. Also clean - no synthesis, smoke-coated lasers and strobes, a grandiose entrance (and a familiar, serious and grateful audience who all left their bottle rockets at home). <br /> <br /> is a Cream fan (or just heard of them); if you are a blues fan; if you are a fan of rock 'n'; you don't have to be disappointed when you watch and listen to this DVD. You will never lose this DVD because you won't lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get your own!) It's too good and too repetitive; you want to reach it easily.
