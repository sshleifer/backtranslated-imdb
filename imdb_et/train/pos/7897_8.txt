At first glance, this film does not seem particularly large. After all, Bette Davis movies with only 166 voices per IMDb and a rating of 6.5 are quite bad. But the film was a wonderful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> You should initially assume that this is a normal average typical 30-year movie with a formal love story, but the film is surprisingly well designed and has an unusual and original story that will also make this movie very enjoyable . <br /> <br /> The story is played by two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. They are mostly assisted by an amusing character, but the film mainly covers them. Their character is related to the most unusual and intelligent story of written love, which also works humorously. This makes this movie a pleasant little comedy that is completely fun. <br /> <br /> The film is quite short (just over an hour), which means that the story doesn't waste time on drawing lines, development and characters unnecessarily. It also makes the movie fast at a pace that helps make this movie perfectly traceable to today's standards. This sometimes makes the movie somewhat easy, but it never goes at the expense of entertainment or fun. <br /> <br /> Pleasant pleasant, simple romantic comedy worth seeing more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
