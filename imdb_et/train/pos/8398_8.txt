A realistic image of youth love against a college set, as well as an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs and twists and it made me tear or two. We rarely see black towns that can turn to older, not black audiences, and show more real life to younger black adults. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in a college campus and in a city where two people meet and fall in love. There are a variety of friends in the background and situations that affect them better or worse. A typical plot of some might say, but it was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself staying in a couple relationship by seeing my past in my past. The moments of deep thinking and revelation came from the performances of the actors. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant film that I would support for those who are in love and are in love or have never fallen in love. Great movie. I'm looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
