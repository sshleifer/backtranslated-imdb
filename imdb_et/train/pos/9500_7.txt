I saw this movie on television and impressed Jennifer Mccomb's beauty. It was a clean film and you can watch it for African beauty and of course Mccomb. At that time, I was excited about watching this movie and since then I've been trying to get the VCD of this movie, but I can't find it. The huge lions of Africa make their film look and we are a spell that is simply limited to the size of their animals and their grace. The whole audience can watch this movie, especially if the children enjoy it. However, some Mccomb-related scenes force parental guidance for this movie. It's an enjoyable holiday movie for everyone and everyone.
