It has been around 50 years since the film about romance and mystery has been made. The only two films I think are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films used great actors, not stars. In both films, all the actors gave their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is about four English women after the First World War, who are happy with their lives and find happiness in Italy during their holidays. This is an amazing "Enchanted April" made in 1992.
