The usual cat and mouse game is abundant until Jerry jumps into the invisible ink bottle. He gets a clear idea of ​​torturing Tom without knowing him. The cat gets wise and tries to do things to "see" it, even if it's not foolproof. Of course, Jerry Butch, named Killer, will be named Spike for the dog (even if it's short, and his contribution is really minimal) Brilliant animated short, which reminded me of a white mouse that scares Tom so badly. Most of the gags work and are all violent, like all good tom and jerry should be short. This fun comic can be found on "Tom & Jerry" Spotlight Collection DVD <br /> <br /> My Class: B +
