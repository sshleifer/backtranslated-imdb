The main problem with the first "Vampires" movie is that no character was compassionate. Carpenter learned his mistake and this time used a vampire vampire and a charismatic vampire. Women's Vampire Una is definitely the coolest vampire from Blade Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, there are some good concepts like the cool slowed restaurant scene (why didn't Carpenter use it any more?) This movie is not nearly as good as it could have been. I was expecting to see strong vampires and at least one long-lasting choreographic order (for example, inside the city) and I was a little disappointed. Although "Los Muertos" continues faster than its predecessor, it still pulls in some parts (though not nearly as bad as "vampires"). Like the "Vampires", the climax of this film is not very intensive near the end. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may seem like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but it is definitely not. It is generally enjoyable and belongs to a better genre. It is not a non-original version of Dracula (like almost all other vampire films), nor is it an unseen action game like Blade II. It could have been just a little more excitement to use. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a third installment made by Carpenter, but this may not happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING The end was too predictable. Una should have gone - it would have made the film quite unusual.
