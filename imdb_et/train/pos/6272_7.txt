<br /> <br /> I saw if no man was (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and I found it ok. The film is about a boy who steals only Porsch. Thirteen seconds have passed 13 years and adds something to it. In fact, it has many scenes that are worthless. The end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> Sphinx has a magnetic screen that should have been better used ...
