Entertaining music, where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to build a floating crap game to attract Sky Masterson to try and get to Jean Simmons' rescue army girl to go with Masterson to Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons would once again be a missionary in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry". There she was Sharon's sister, and here's her sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is the evil Nathan Detroit. She has been with Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she doesn't want her gambling habit. <br /> <br /> With a real pace change, Sky Masterson played Marlon Brando, who actually made his song here! <Br /> <br /> The movie is recorded with superb choreography. These dance and song trips are fabulous. These are especially performed by Stubby Kaye, such as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very nice production.
