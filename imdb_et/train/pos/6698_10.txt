I loved Sabrina The Teenage Witch and I've seen every episode. I remember when I sat at 18.00 every night and waited for Nickelodeon to arrive, but when Sabrina left high school, the show began to fall. The best series must be when he was with friends with Valerie (I'm not sure what it is). From there, the next series (friends Dreama) was still really good, but when he left high school, it didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant he didn't have so many old "sparks", but the first series, where Sabrina is in college, is still relatively good and observable, but when Aunt leaves and Sabrina moves in her house just isn't right . He is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is not right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh's shows it doesn't seem right, especially when Sabrina is getting married to someone who is not Harvey. Thank you for coming in the last five minutes of the last episode to take him away. All in all, I'm still glad to watch the old episodes of Sabrina's old teenage witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left Sabrina's high school. Because after that the exhibition definitely lost its magic
