No garbage - not where even near garbage. Not the original? this is the last thing you could say about "2.4 children". definitely not! Although it was somewhat unusual for the BBC, it was fun, funny and witty. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - who I believe they were wonderfully designed.Gary olsen was also very good and so all other majority members ... I'm never quite new to why he was able to hope until Gary Olseni here today I was relatively young about death. I wish they would do more of this comedy, much more of them (and show them here in Israel).
