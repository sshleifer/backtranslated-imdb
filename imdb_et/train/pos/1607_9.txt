As someone else has already said here, the scene of each of these films is a pearl. Most movies are happy that there is one scene that is perfect, but director Jewison hit home every time. Just got the perfect script and Dick Hyman's musical settings for opera and other music that fit perfectly. It is hard to imagine how they kept the exact mood during the long production of the film. Comedy is subtle (mostly), and camera work reflects every little emotional inflation in the narrative. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (who I know mostly through the role of Frank Lorenzo in the whole family until I saw him in this, and then in the 80s Broadway) deserved a much bigger stardom than he ever got and Aiello's unlucky loser is just the tip of the iceberg, when it comes to giving this immense pain. Has the Jew ever written about this film? <br /> <br /> It would be nice to read. It's hard to figure out why the average IMDb rating is so low ...
