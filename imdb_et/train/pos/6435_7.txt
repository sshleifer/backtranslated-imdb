I think most people who have commented on this movie do not understand how to watch the film and / or feel the elegance. First, to evaluate the film, you need to understand the extent to which all the film works together. Modern feelings require great drama. No, I do not mean setting large characters and plots, but they seem to require emotional trails that are very tragic or very comedic. This is a fine film. Its beauty lies in its fineness (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are easy in this movie. This is a beautifully filmed film that gives the most opportunity to combine sensuous, politics, human weakness, perseverance ... you call it. The world in which it is set up would be a stranger and not understandable today ... a world where you have to hit it now with the TRANSLATION and LOUDLY, even if you think you have it. Many people today don't realize that Victorian society wasn't really Victorian, because people understand this term today. <br /> <br /> This movie helps you to record directly.
