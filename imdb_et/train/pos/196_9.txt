It was a wonderful introduction for Marion Davies' talents and beauty. She is not only proud of this movie, but fun. (I believe that Lucille Ball may have modeled her later career in Davies' style, which could be called "beauty of beauty".) Vidor's direction is a light but firm hand, of course the story is chestnut, but the actor is wonderfully modern, and for the silent era fans star viewing with many lights adds to the overall fun. It combines slapstick elements with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well. For all film fans who have a knee joint reaction to watch silent movies, sit through it and change your attitude. <br /> <br />
