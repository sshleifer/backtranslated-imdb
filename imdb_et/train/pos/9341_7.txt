Sandler is again amazing ... I've already become a Sandler fan. This movie is the curse of Sandler. Its expression is fantastic. I shouted more at the Click, but there are some similar points. Considering family value before losing it and "I Love You" are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's tough, it's real ... and actually there is a real owner of this success, Binder. I don't think another director could give these emotions in this way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites after Crash. Don't wait for a laugh or a lot of positive atmosphere ... If you're ready to deal with reality, don't miss it.
