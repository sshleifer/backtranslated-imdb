Sunday is not a Sunday without an action movie, and if you want an intense fight, you turn to Tom Berenger (Platoon). <br /> <br /> Here he plays a sniper in the jungle, followed by rebels and drug owners. Life is a bitch, so she gets a green office type (Billy Zane) to support the mission. The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who put Anaconda up. he doesn't do much better here, but Berenger is worth the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it may be a bit long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but it's a good, tense activity when the time is right.
