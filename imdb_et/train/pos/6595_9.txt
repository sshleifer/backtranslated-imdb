I borrowed this movie from a friend who knew nothing about it, and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary on the journey along the ancient ship across the large ocean. Thor Heyerdahl had developed the theory that the ancient Incas of Peru were able to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, relying on certain relics found in both places, some type of old seagoing ships, which we know have an ocean and wind flow analysis and knowledge, that the Incas actually sailed some undetermined quantities at sea. <br /> <br /> To test your hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his team will build a ship as close as possible to what the ancient Incas were available, using only Balsa wood and other materials available at the time, and went to Lima, the capital of Peru, to reach about 5000 miles from the Polynesian Islands. <br /> <br /> His theory, like so much of ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but their journey includes strong support for being right. The film is really a narrative of the footage made during the more than 100-day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of what it was, and the trials and tribulations they encountered. I often want the Academy's award-winning documentaries to be easier to find, and more than 50 years ago it's still as interesting and informative as I am sure it was when it was first released.
