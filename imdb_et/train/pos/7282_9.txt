It was a very good movie and is completely unfair to evaluate it, without taking into account the release time. There are some films that aren't outdated, but it's clearly outdated. But I saw this movie when I was a boy and for more than twenty years, both the pictures and the story for me and most of my friends were unforgettable until we could reassess it on the DVD. In fact, I remember this movie as a topic of multiple conversations and meetings where old boys talked about common things. That's why the DVD was finally feeling disappointed and even sad. First, the theory of how our generation was naive. Secondly, I think there's more. I would like this film to have something that should be of interest to all modern filmmakers, especially those who focus on the degrading horror genre. This is a distortion, an idea that gives the film coherence; the fact of human distortion gives deeper fear than death and torture. I remember how sick it was when a monster hung out on Kuri's hand. And at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Another remarkable thing is the ill atmosphere that dominates without the loss of intensity throughout the scene, whether it is a secret lab, a lonely street where a car man is looking for a female body, a stretcher, and so on. There may be a reason why it is no longer a good movie is just technical things. For example, at the accident site and the man who rescues his groom's head, it might be interesting to do more work for another and a modern head of unit. The same thing for all activities, including Kurt's hand. What's more, something could be done with a monster. Some remakes have been good; I think it would be worth trying in this case. However, black and white tones should be retained.
