I saw it flying to the US and at first it was a little skeptical because some people said there were so many signs that you didn't know about them. But I didn't find it at all. The film is fast, but it is due to the nature of the director and the star. Chase scenes are great and yes, it can be predictable, but for most movies it's not. The main villain is a bit let down, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he might have been, but it said it is still a good movie.
