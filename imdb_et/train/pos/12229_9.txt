There's something so tempting and nostalgic about low budget sci-fi. As a child of the 50s, it's all there. In 1957, with my father, I saw in the movie "The First Man in Space". It was Marshall starring in Thompson and some other bad fools who got the title role. It is also a space mission that went bad when an astronaut becomes a grizzly killer. Scared me good and a lot. The memories of these hebrew jeebs still live inside me. The incredible melting man is almost entirely in a fresh color, ie where the scenes were well lit. Just have to love it for what it is ...... just over an hour in the dark with illuminated scenes, nasty noise and this eerie music. Bravo!
