Many American people would say ... What ??? to my opening comment. Yes, I know my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to fans of Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is correct. We have a peasant who goes to town looking for help from a grasshoppers band who wants to steal the village's harvest. The big difference is how the story takes. In our samurai, the band of circus performers, as in the original, is a very complex mixture of personalities, but eventually the village is needed, HEROES. Look again at this incredible movie (probably seven samurai) and find another movie that has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect as Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. Tip is a 13th warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied this story to write his best seller, but he could not find the third leg of the cat.
