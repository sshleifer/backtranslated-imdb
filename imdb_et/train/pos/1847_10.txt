Whatever you do in your life, you should never forget that you have roots. This is a story of true facts made for a beautiful and moving movie! Dare to say that this film is undervalued. It shows us the reality of life ... the more evil you surround, the better the person you get. True to your instincts and know that the ideal of life is to live it happy ... without fear without living under the "stone". The film's concept is more interesting ... combining storytelling with real events ... keeping us all aware of the facts ... against the emotions! Bless these people and make everything happy! Look at this, I recommend it to all young people. It's not racism, it's how to live your life!
