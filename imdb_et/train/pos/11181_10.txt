This is one of the most terrifying, frightening and heartbreaking horror movie EVER! Dr Creed (Louise) and his family moved to their home with their new wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage). Everything seems normal, until Dr. Creed loses one of his patients with a terrible head injury, then worships when Victor takes him to Pet Sematarty and shows him where the dead come from. Louis does not know if it was all a dream and is talking to Ellie, who was worried about his cat, what a truck could kill, and then Rachel tells Louis that it is very difficult to talk about death because of his sister Zelda, who was really sick ( As we see in the setback, when her sister is sick, it was really and it is one of the most frightening events ever!) <br /> The next day, Louis Jed will call him, saying that the cat killed by the truck and Jedi took him where Victor Ghost he spoke not going! And the cat, her husband and children have gone to see her grandparents and Louise is alone in shocking to see that the cat is back and now it is in the eyes of the evil, so she goes to see Jedi, then Jed tells her she's that matt it. also the dog there (as we saw another setback). <br /> <br /> Later, in the "Family" with a picnic, Gage plays dragon and Gage says I'll put it down, "The wind blows down the road near the bar, where a fast-moving truck, Gage gets closer, Louis rushes to him, most HEARTBREAKING scenes in any horror film leaves his jaw on the floor or Shivers goes back when you hear Louis shouting Soon he wanted him so much, Louis then buried Gage in the same place where the cat is buried. <br /> <br /> The most frightening thing about this movie is that some of the scenes in this movie aren't far from life. <br /> <br /> This movie is just amazing and everyone's action was great!
