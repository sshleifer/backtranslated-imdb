A beautiful piece of children's cinema that is buried in an archaic Celtic world. A story about the famous book of Kelsi, believed to be formed by the monks of the small island of Iona on the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> A story about young abbot trainees leaving the forest looking for Crom-Cruic, a harsh rider of pagan mythology. Hopes that the lost artifact will recover. <br /> <br /> The real beauty of movies lies in his animation. A bright and inspirational, deeply complex style cell that causes appearance is less easy. The secret of the Celts creates much of the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series "Samurai Jack" because it is a brilliant use of sign making and background depth that consistently creates an emotional Celtic world that lives in the shadow of Viking invasion. <br /> <br /> History can be intense and lifestyle is a lack of realism, but these facts are completely irrelevant, as the film is a world of fantasy and Celtic-revivalist mystery. A forest girl is a great additive and I think she's taking a picture of what it is when she slides from a branch to a branch. It looks and disappears like a mysterious nymph whose characteristics are similar to Alice and Wonderland's legendary Cheshire cat. <br /> <br /> The secret of the Chelsea is absolute treatment. For all sexes of all ages, this is a lovely family cinema. <br /> <br /> Don't wait to be awed but just impressed!
