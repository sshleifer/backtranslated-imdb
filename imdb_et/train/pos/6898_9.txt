This is the tongue in the cheek film from the very beginning with a voice that will entertain everything in French and then be produced by quite na√Øve but very brave hero Fanfan La Tulipe. Gorgeous Gerard Philippe depicts a frightening young man fully believing in the fate of Lollobrigida's predictions - that he is married to King Louis XV's daughter! The problem is that La Lollo will soon discover that he is in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> A movie that moves by sword fluctuations, cavalry, and other moody lines of action moves at a brisk pace and with moments of many comics. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the film is so light and so serious that I could not give the second thought to these shortcomings. Pay attention to Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy French film, trying to steal La Lollo, making himself unpleasant and feeding the script to a lucky man who reads La Lollo's hand! And what pearl Marcel Herrand is like a megalomanic and lustful king of Louis XV! It's not all: so many beautiful women in one movie want me to be in France and 1952! The film may have come out this year, but its verve, cheek, wonderful narration, impeccable photography and memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it will be viewed today and with joy. I do not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, let alone anyone who loves movies in general and especially smiling! See it!
