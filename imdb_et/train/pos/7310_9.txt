There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best movies ever, not only in its genre, but also outside. would do. This is a movie I enjoy very much, especially from Halloween. John Carpenter is a very professional director I love a lot of his other films, but there is no doubt that his best-known film is Halloween.Oh, and if your thinking about Rob Zombie's remake isn't there. The 1978 version of John Carpenter is better. Michael Myers is one of the coolest killers in any movie and it's very well known. So watch all the masterpieces you like.
