It was one of the best war films I've seen since it focuses more on the characters than on the real war. All of the cast actions do a great job, and since most of them are relatively unknown, it all makes them more sensitive. The camera's footage is great, it was both pace and editing. This movie gets to you and causes the audience to care for them to do it.
