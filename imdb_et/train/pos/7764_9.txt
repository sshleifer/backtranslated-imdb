Another classic study of the impact of wealth on the southern family is masterfully illustrated in the book "Written on the Wind". <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. Richness, plane, you call it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always done it in trouble. Mitch graduated from college, Kyle was thrown out. Mitch is not a wealthy home. Kyle's family, Hadley Oil, controls most of the city. <br /> <br /> Kyle meets N.Y. with her dream girl well played by Lauren Bacall. After a rotating romance, she marries her and brings her home. There he meets his father-father who warns him how hard Kyle gets. Kyle is sleeping under his pillow with a gun. Bacall's character meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a tramp, once she was, played by Dorothy Malone, who was given the best supportive actor. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays a loyal friend Mitch. br /> <br /> The year when Kyle and his bride stopped blessing ends when the doctor informs Kyle that he has no children. Just when his wife discovers that she is really pregnant, she goes to Kyle, thinking that the child is a Mitch, a drunken drunk and unintentionally dead in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch, is trying, but failed to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In the scene of a memorable courtroom, Malone pulled all the stops, finally admitting that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. Surprisingly, Robert Stack, who was great as Kyle Hadley, was the best actor and Anthony Quinn, like Paul Gauguin, in the loss of Lust for Life. br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk was the master of soap opera films from the 1950s. The exception from the wind is no exception. *** 1/2
