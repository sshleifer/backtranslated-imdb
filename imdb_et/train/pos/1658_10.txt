Once you've seen this movie, you've been to Puerto Rico. I have lived all my life in Puerto Rico and I have to shamefully admit that we (PR) are currently living in real chaos, drugs are the main reasons why we have almost every day shooting and killing. These people shoot someone, anytime, anywhere, and that's why many innocent lives have been lost. We no longer feel safe and, in addition, our so-called "justice" no longer passes truth and justice, but money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real, unfortunate facts and really represents three main problems in Puerto Rico: drug-related killings, money and power manipulating our courtroom, and innocent people and children are being corrupted and even dying. Ricardo and his wife Poli, along with their true life and award-winning direction (**), were brave enough to present all that bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country that lives in a nightmare that doesn't seem to end !!! ** They recently won the "Copper Wing Award", the best director of the World Cinema Competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
