You never know where the idea of ​​the novel novels and the other released papers come from? Based on Jake Speed, they are based on real people who live on the adventures they write and publish. This film is high quality family life, moderate violence and worst clothing. Language is not a problem, and jokes are funny at all levels. This is "Austin Powers" look at "Indian Jones" without over-the-top antics by Michael Myers. I recommend this film to children between 10 and 15 years old.
