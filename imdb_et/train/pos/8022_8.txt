Jim Henson's Muppets was a favorite of my childhood. This film makes me feel like a child again. Okay, Muppets is back with Miss Piggy and Kermit Frog and their friends. The prerequisite is that they will try to show Broadway in a musical show where they are not in New York. You can see the lights of Ed Kochi, Mayor of New York. In any case, the film becomes 25 years old and I hope that today's children will learn to appreciate Muppets Gang's light heart. The problem with the exhibition is lost on Kermit and the gang must find him in New York. It's worth seeing children and even sentimental adults like me.
