I love old Burt Reynolds films. They are more funny and better than all other movies. They could also stop making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I think they would have known that there was no more good anymore? This movie is good for me. Burt Reynolds has to dress like a chicken and ride a lot on the racetrack, and the luxurious Loni Anderson is within easy reach, in the eighty way. Burt and Loni, these were the days! I used this magazine with Loni Anderson, who advertises a vacuum cleaner. Definitely loved this ad! In addition, it is part of a movie where the racecourse audience is disturbed by something that Stroker Ace (Burty R.) does, and it shows that one pub in the pub bends his finger and sees his frustration to show his frustration! I laughed so hard that I almost died at night! If you find this movie, rent it! And then never look at another movie because I'm telling you right now: there's no point.
