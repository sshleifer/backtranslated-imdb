After reading some other comments, I waited for something really awful, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not so good. I think some people remember it more with affection than they deserved, but apart from cars and Daisy Duke's feet, the scripts were weak and bad. The Duke boys were too intelligent, and the cozy, shrunken Boss Hog for the woodpeckers was too sad to be evil and Rosco was just a glimpse of just the moment of the screen. It is amazing that the series lasted as long as it happened, because during the first series this story was empty. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you look at this movie in your law, not as a direct comparison to a TV series, it's not bad at all. The actual letter is, of course, General Lee. Car moves and stunts are excellent and this is actually D.O.H. is everything. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self, and together with Seann William Scott, like Cousin Bo, makes this movie fun in the fun-filled Dumb-And-Dumber, like the TV series never achieved. Cute Jessica Simpson is a doll like Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds is doing much better with Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey is incredibly disgusting Rosco P. Coltrane, as she should always have been. <br /> <br /> If you don't like humor and crazy cars, you won't watch this movie anyway, because you should know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want some good smiling entertainment movie that is not brain-charging, check out this pleasant romp with an open mind.
