However, I liked it. Warren Beatty is the only comic book hero. What records this movie is set, incredible cast, and it creates a mediocre script. I was really expecting something somewhat more important for action or plot, but I got very little. The main reason for watching this movie is to look at the biggest stars of this unusual film, Hollywood. One person who did a terrible job and didn't even belong to this movie was Madonna. He was not in this movie and his exemplary work was pretty bad. The movie at some point stood easily. You waited for more and you have nothing. Al Pacino really plays a bad guy and he's pretty good. He and Beatty make a great good man and bad. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a movie other than Isthar. I didn't see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is good, but it could have been so much better. I liked it as a child because I thought it was cool, and visually the film is amazing, the sets are incredible, writing is just fair, and I'm still a little better at casting such a movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I especially thought the final wasn't big enough. It was interesting, but for such a large-scale movie, I thought it might have ended up with a bit more bang. The reason for watching this movie is the atmosphere. Only 7 comic book colors are used in the film to make it more visually appealing. <br /> <br /> Costumes and makeup were also flawless. The face makeup for the villains was great. Beatty isn't just as big as the nature of life. However, this is a good movie that could have been much more. It's better than Batman, another comic book that came out at the same time. Of course, this film was a much larger gross amount.
