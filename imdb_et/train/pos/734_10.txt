This movie is punk rock fun, from start to finish. Ramones, Punk Rock, ruled until the end of the 1970s, appears on his own. PJ Soles stands for Riff Randle, a rebel high school girl who lives and breathes from a rock roll. The reef is obsessed with writing songs to Ramones, his favorite rock band. He keeps the school rockin and encourages his fellow students to join him. She is a long and scary woman on Amazon. And he promises to give the students a cord. He even has a couple of students who act as monitors to report dirt to their classmates. Ms. Togar has especially decided to rifle and stop Riff's anarchist Shenanigan. But Riff has fixed ways for Togar. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Mary Woronov's excellent performance, in his role as Togar. Mary is the legendary B-film actor. And in this film, he plays Fascist Togar, who is bright. PJ Soles as a Reef, switches to an electrifying result. Clint Howard, as a duplicate Eaglebauer, has a lot of fun with his role. <br /> <br /> Ramones performs a lot of his hit songs in this movie. So the viewer sees why Ramones was so influential in the 70's Punk rock scene. This is definitely a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you are not a Ramones or Punk Stone, this movie is energetic fun (literally).
