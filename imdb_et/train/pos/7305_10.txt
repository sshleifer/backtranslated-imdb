In 1978, the phenomenon began. John Carpenter's "Halloween" release got people blocked to recognize evil, which is Michael Meyers. Critics loved it, the world loved it, imitated and fallen as one of the greatest cinematographic films. <br /> <br /> Plot: 15 years after the murder, four friends (all women) have babysitting (and with their friends) at Halloween night. After escaping from the hospital last night, Michael myers returns to his hometown to steal those people. He murders 3 of them quietly and finely. He's not talking. He walks slowly. He hides .... <br /> <br /> Only one of his friends flees after Dr. Loome has rescued (Michael's pursuer and doctor). <br /> <br /> There is one reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We don't know where Michael is, we don't know why he kills, and he scares us. They are the only reasons we are afraid. <br /> <br /> John carpenter wrote the film and directed it. He builds intolerable tension throughout the story and scares to such an extent that sometimes we cannot watch. And the climax is truly amazing. <br /> <br /> Fear is very important. It's terrible and well-behaved. It's also mysterious. Michael is power, not human. A force that cannot be denied. <br /> <br /> The conclusions focused too much on Michael and his "history". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Perhaps this is the masterpiece.
