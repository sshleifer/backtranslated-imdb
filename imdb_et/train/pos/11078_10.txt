I watched the movie today and it just blew my mind. This is a real masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most people think it is garbage. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your ego and then you have the real power! It was the main struggle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie has shown it perfectly. "The biggest enemy hides in the last place you ever look at" - do you remember that movie? Because our true enemy is inside us - this is our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, which gives us our pride, telling us we're not giving, but just taking what creates our aggression that wants to be in control, which creates all the negative feelings and thoughts. GR said this idea amazingly and has shown that the only way to get real control is when you lose control and you just release your personal importance. Great movie!
