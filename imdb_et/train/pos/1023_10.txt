This exhibition has been a flight of reality over the last ten years. Unfortunately, I leave it away. Although Atlantis has filled a small hole, the latest SG1 (on television) episode has been nicely done. Robert wrote something that seemed close to reality. Just as he would try to explain what was in the show. (Everyone works closely together for as long as it is up and down. But over the years they have become a family). I thought it was a great way to stop, despite criticism from someone else. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special, and over and over he took over the limits of beliefs and surprises. Wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. One episode was hooked. The mix of action, science, drama, and especially comedy worked so well that I wanted more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words that could express this example to me completely. I can only thank those who kept the exhibition so fresh and fun for so many years. It has inspired me to do a lot of things I thought it was impossible. <br /> <br /> I look forward to watching movies next year and I hope there are many. I don't want to show you ever die. Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
