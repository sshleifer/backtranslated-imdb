There are many police dramas that make the round. I'm not sure why. This is probably related to the old topic of good old and evil. <br /> <br /> This movie is a documentary style by following the heavy recruitment of raw recruiting Anne to the police unit in the Baltic region. The police are not trying to glamorize. They are indeed on earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, on the other hand Anne has a soft heart, perhaps a little more understanding of human condition. Against all rules, he sometimes retains the guilty information found in his band searches and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a pleasant movie. No one who would relax you. There is not much optimism here. The police seem to be involved in losing the battle. Tomorrow there will be more pools, more murders, more family breakages and more afflicted children. Let's face it. It's the world we live in. <br /> <br /> As Anne's Day goes closer to the police and their families they are investigating. The only real heat of the film is what the 12-year-old symbol of Benny's broken family offers. Anne has her way to fast things. He turns his eyes on Benny's shop and tries to help him in the best way. I was surprised that he went so far as to attract Benny's father. It made me wonder whether it was taking into account my father's or his own needs. After all, the film has clearly shown that it desperately needs a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well cast, but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
