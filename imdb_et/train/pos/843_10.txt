Not to mention Pierce Brosnon's best result. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when is he really bad? I think this movie is incredibly underestimated! The use of colors in this film is very different in today's film world, where every other film has a free blue filter. I also love how they used the Asian song. Prove that even what was once thought to be cheerful can be properly positioned correctly. <br /> <br /> I made my first function when it came out. Since my movie was hit by a man's movie, I had to check something out of the genre. After seeing it, I'm sure it affected me through the process. It was pretty cool when my film got to IMDb that I would recommend this movie if you liked it. As with any of these, I have no idea what makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
