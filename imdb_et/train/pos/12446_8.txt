I heard about Modesty Blaise before, but never read a novel or comic, my wife, and I liked the movie. It gave a good introduction to the character and its background in a fascinating way. Unfortunately, this is also the case when there is a big shortage of the film. The intimate game lives on the abilities of its participants and unfortunately only half of them are delivered. Though Alexandra Staden did a great job with Modesty Blaise, her colleague Nikolay Coaster-Waldau - like the villain Miklos - didn't do it. Smileing her way through the plot, if it is a long-lasting toothpaste advertisement, she can't create an anxiety that would have turned the film into a masterpiece. The supportive majority is somehow similar to some of the stereotypical gangsters and sluts to Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
