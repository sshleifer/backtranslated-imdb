I don't know what this film is about. But the film's history or religion is always criticized for their accuracy. Of course, it's not 100% accurate. Nowadays it is difficult to make 100% accurate films, even if "experts" do not agree. Therefore, I would rather evaluate the film according to what it is trying to say when choosing all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I'll start by saying I liked this mini-series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years went too fast. The series should have been a three-part story, her childhood being the first part. But if they do not have more money to capture the more story that I have criticized ??? <br /> <br /> There is only one real problem with this film and that is the fact that it is the way of the book in history. Particularly the second part, which is just the sum of the events. Rather, I would have liked to see Hitler's more humane (more scenes where he doubts himself, etc.). Noah Taylor did more in "Max", which seems to be better. Nonetheless, I am glad that it has been done and owns it on a DVD. Just to remember the more lively things that happened, and look at Carly's best. 7.5 / 10
