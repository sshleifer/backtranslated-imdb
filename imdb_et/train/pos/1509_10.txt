The British horror film was coming to an end in the early seventies, but three of the darkness came out of our darkness. Wickerman, the blood of Satan's claw and the house that bleeds, made the future rosy, although many people knew there wasn't one at that point. The THTDB has a variety that could easily form a wish list if it wasn't really put together, but in the gloomy backdrop of 2008 you might be waiting. Waxing is the most remarkable of the four readings, and this is, of course, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are closely linked, so you can't say where the result ends and the pain begins. One might think that this role influenced such a delicate, sensitive person. Death and maid. RIP Peter.
