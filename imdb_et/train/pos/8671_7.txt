Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> The latest PPV <br /> <br /> 2006 Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> Match Matches ******** <br /> Let's start with the Inferno game. Kane v. MVP. That was okay. Nothing to wrestle here. It was about visuals. Generally it wasn't bad. Here were some close places where Kane came too close to the fire, but finally Kane won MVP for the first time with fire. <br /> <br /> A nice opener. Continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces new team title titles: London and Kendrick Defend: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Competition Two: Fatal Fourfold Ladder Match. It was a complete carnage. Four of the four teams are waiting for chaos. The spots were amazing. The whole festival. One point Jeff went to Poetry Movement and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Soon after the words, Jeff is set to top the rope with two ladders near as MNM was going to kill Jeff, Matt makes a save and Jeff hits the "saw" shot by Joey Mercury! Mercury is painful. His eyes are closed quickly and are broken open hard. Mercury is taken out of the competition and Nitro is still there. He's fighting for titles alone! Regal and Taylor then grab London and suplex him in the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro over the killer, dropping the ladder through Jeff! Awesome! Finally, London and Kendrick retain the title of the team team. What fits !!! <br /> <br /> It was crazy. I can't figure out why WWE hasn't reported so far. Buyrate would grow enormously. I'm sure the value of replay is good. <br /> <br /> Mercury is facing broken nose and eye damage. She's in the hospital right now. Get a good boy. <br /> <br /> Nothing else here goes beyond. <br /> <br /> Next up: The Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) It was not suitable. Will Boogeyman ever wrestle? Miz sucks too. After the mad crowd it kills them dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit Chavo. It was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit one point killer superplex! Benoit also hit eight German suplexes! Benoit wins with a sharp knife. Good things. <br /> <br /> Helms Yang-Cruiserweight title championship. It was a good game. Unfortunately, the stupid fans didn't care about it. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and wrestled well. I agree with JBL. He pulled the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to evaluate or come out. Mr Kennedy v. Undertaker-Last Ride game. Not too much here. It was a slug festival, with a few exceptions. At one point, Kennedy threw Taker at the top of the stage. The site was good. The reaction was disappointing. At the end of the spot, Taken's tombstone was Kennedy with stones and won the game. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. They both work hard. But Kennedy needed this victory. The Undertaker should have lost. Creative hanged again. <br /> <br /> Next is a stupid god. I like women. Not that. At least Torrie wasn't here. It's refreshing. Judging by the crowd, Layla should have won. WWE wanted Ashley. Think about it between your bathroom. Next. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Price & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. It was also a match. Focus was on Price v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can't work well together. Finlay is trying to make Price out good. The finish was botched. Finlay hit Batista's knee and chair and Batista didn't sell the stroke and finished the game. Lame. Not usually the main organizer. <br /> <br /> In general, Armageddon would have been less, but the ladder is the main event here. That was enough money there. Some others were confident. <br /> <br /> Last word: Good PPV, where the ladder fits into the rescue. Smackdown is not a bad show just not weighty enough. Smackdown must stop Price. Let Smackdown stand with his two legs. This exhibition proves that Smackdown can.
