This film shows the life of a young French girl in North Cameroon from the viewpoint of France's Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial (French) government and whose family is one of the few white families. It gives an idea of ​​what life was for the colonists as well as the natives with whom they were connected. It's a sense in line with another movie I've seen in Africa in a similar time period (Nirgendwo in Africa (2001)), but I don't know how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the movie - but the plot is underestimated. Instead of making their conclusions, the observer leaves the filmmakers compelled, although the story as feedback from a woman's visit to Cameroon as an adult visits a certain perspective.
