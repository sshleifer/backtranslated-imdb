Ten of the 11 short films of this movie are masterpieces (I found only Egypt's disappointment). All except the Mexican director urged to portray the problems of individuals or groups with regard to 9-11: Afghan refugees, Kurds, Palestinians, Srebrenica widows, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochet's coup and the ensuing bloodstream, suicide attacks in Israel, paranoia and the country's persecuted Muslim Americans in the US, living alone in old people and the consequences of World War II in the heart of Asian soldiers. This can say something about the limits of empathy in both ways: directors may feel that Americans ignore the rest of the world and care only about their tragedies, while doing the same with their short films. br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I found Sean Penn one of the best in the collection and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also think of his depiction of Ernest Borgnine as a half-crazy old man who flourishes a New York apartment experiencing the happy moment of her widowhood, when the Sun shines through her window after the "collapse of light from the WTC", I think it can also be one of the most offensive if the American general audience sees it.
