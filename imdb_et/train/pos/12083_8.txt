Another feature concerns a young woman in London, who desperately wants a job that will happily accept the position of an older woman and her secretary with her son. Thrillers, where people keep their house against their will, always make me a little uneasy - I feel like a prisoner, but this pretty stylish B movie is neither harsh nor claustrophobic. It's far drawn and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast on her feet. Its restoration in 1986 (when the "dead winter") did not make sense, because the land elements are not modern. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short for 65 minutes!), But it stays well until the over-hitting climax that looks a bit sloppy. *** from ****
