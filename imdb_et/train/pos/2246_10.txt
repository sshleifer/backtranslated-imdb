A wonderful surprise in Spanish cinema. I've never thought that Jordi Molla could be such a big director, but I really don't care about his choice of films. But this movie was absolutely fantastic and was not at all predictable ... something I always enjoy! It has not been a very good press and I really don't think it will ever be released in the US market. We have to equip ourselves with a DVD or VHS, if not even that ... I don't want to talk much about this story because I don't want to spoil it for you, but basically the movie is a homeless drunk who is going to be a new fair that is only for blows and get the money out of it (like so much) before he knows he's diving into life he doesn't read.
