Eddie Izzard is nothing about the comic genius, and that's Eddie's best. Her material is extremely funny and fun and her delivery is one of the best on stage. Instead of listening to the viewer's intelligence, he relies on his humor, Hitler, the moon landing and the British to get his wardrobe preferences. With so many memorable laughs, none of his lines can be repeated. Always more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the most funny things ever delivered. Every top-level comedy fan must see "Dress Kill". Eddie Izzard has successfully won in life. But his lack of commercial success in the film should not show how talented he really is. "Dress To Kill" is a treasure that fortunately has found its way into home video and what can and should be enjoyed over and over again.
