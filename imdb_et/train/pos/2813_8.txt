This is a complex documentary that shows a lot of Gay life early. With that in mind, Gay was the word used for the gay-sexual revolution, and not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used today? I believe that most of the film dates from around 1968 to 1989. It appeared in 1993, so it has been around. over the year. Love, expressed in a way that can only be true love. There are many incredible empathy and pain scenes with joy and joy. In gay-sex and life life scenes like gay. The film itself was a work of love and I believe it is a diamond. <br /> <br /> At least one of this movie will understand the devastating effect of AIDS. When I write this, I mean, how much earlier this movie has been set for me. The advances in medical, political and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film (about 15 years ago) are amazing. Of course, AIDS has not yet been made. Heck I think we don't do it on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a pretty good documentary. I would encourage anyone who feels they do not understand gay life, gay issues or the destruction of AIDS to watch this movie.
