This movie is completely ridiculous. The plot is not only terrifying, but acting is terrible. Special effects are asinine and the whole film is set in an apocalyptic desert. But this is by far the most entertaining film ever to be authorized. It's 101 minutes to laugh thanks to the fact that we all know that there is no fuel in the 3000s or any El Camino. There are other aspects that I do not break, but because they make the movies so wonderfully moral. I recommend this movie very simply because of idiotics. I have no idea who would look at it when it looks to be a quality feature, but how good laughter is, what you need, see Year's Destroyers 3000!
