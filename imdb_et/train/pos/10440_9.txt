This movie is intelligent. This means it is more than most other movies, it is the least common denominator - it is probably not understood by stupid people. The story is largely based on dialogue. It has some parallel Lost in Translation, though before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract and just better. The actors play perfectly perfectly. I have rarely seen a movie where the script and the actor have completely melted it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue moves to very personal issues, which may be slightly up. However, it remains on the right side almost all the time, although I found some moment a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing this fine line requires surprisingly talented participants. Sometimes it gives great results and in general this movie is just amazing! Only very rarely is "love" in films depicted in a way that is reliable and realistic. Every time it's achieved, the result is fantastic. I think that the fabulous and apparently timeless beauty of the female actor helped quite a bit in this regard. She still looks stunning in this movie 12 years after. <br /> <br /> It's just a movie pearl that you can't forget. One of the best movies I've seen in the 1990s!
