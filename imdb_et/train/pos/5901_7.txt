This is the transformation of many recent films, because it only has fewer stars, fewer complications and more fuzzy feelings. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol) meet at a friend's wedding, where their own marriage (not sure) begins with their own organization process. After a while, the two strangers are married and sent to the honeymoon, where they meet other couples who go through similar movements. When they spend time together, secrets are revealed, the hearts are broken and / or corrected and loved by the flowers. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishqi, you've seen this movie. The plot is twisted, there are no surprising elements in two and a half hours of the film. Everything is predictable. I just enjoyed it because I had seen "Darling" (seeing the leaders of Deol & Khan) earlier and enjoyed their chemistry that I said "why not" when my sister also suggested "Just married". <br /> <br /> Look at it: because Kirron Kher marks the letters and is his usual sweetheart himself. <br /> <br /> Leave it aside: because you have all this nonsense of pairs of painters! <br /> <br /> C +
