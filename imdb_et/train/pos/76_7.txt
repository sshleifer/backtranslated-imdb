The sequel to Vincent Price HOUSE OF WAX (1953), a film that affirmed his image as a horror image, revolves like bitter? though inventive? showman. Although this is a remake, the former (filmed in Technicolor) remains a great effort; that is, apart from some resistance to candy relief, a mandatory remedy for cheap tricks (this was still a 3-D showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (which happened to a lost bag that allegedly appeared in some police station that contained the separated heads?) as enough Grand Guignoli type of excitement and overall camp value (the price that prevents it in various shades as the inventor of illusions who embodies the "lost" star impressions that had been exploited by their genius) to stand on their own feet. By the way, Director Bram's involvement here does not just prove coincidence? Since the narrative contains elements of two horror texts (both played by Laird Cregar), he had previously looted LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). Young leaders are played by Mary Murphy (Price's ing√©nue assistant) and Patrick O'Neal (like her police detective boy). She is a leader in a similar position, HORRORITE CHAMBER [1966], which I have just acquired in time to be part of it. Here is an interesting side-effect that the latter has introduced a novel detection method, fingerprinting, which is crucial to achieving a price drop (predictable but inconvenient hot spot), although survival of his amateur crime novel is at least as much in the long run! Looking at the stars in a measured role, a lot of fun appears on the film? especially compact 73 minutes.
