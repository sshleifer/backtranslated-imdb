This is a rather thrilling, exciting, tragic story. Quite good and mostly pretty accurate, given that it is a TV movie rather than a documentary. They create some fictional characters and united several real people into one sign, but otherwise this is a very tragic and dark story. <br /> <br /> The last moments of the movie, which represent a massive suicide / murder, are almost directly taken from Jim Jones's sound recording. This recording took place in the last 44 minutes of the people's temple. It is available in several places on the Internet. This part of the film is almost inappropriate in this regard. <br /> <br /> To sum up, the documentary is not. But it covers most of the folksong story of the main elements.
