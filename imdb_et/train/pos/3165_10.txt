It was one of the funniest and biggest sitcom to hit national television. It is regrettable that the exhibition is not among the big sitcoms where it really belongs. The actors did a great job and there were six seasons between the seasons. Although the seventh season was not so big compared to the previous six years, it was funny. The 8th season was a real problem. Without Topher's grace or Ashton Kutcher, this show just opened. Not to say that the other participants were not big when one of the two main characters was left, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and tommy Chong are also great) to show that it would have the same effect. And the involvement of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help because the fans of the exhibitions did not receive it well. I believe that if the sample ended a year ago, it would certainly have been one of the sitcom awards. The 8th season was a bit boring, but the final was great. I don't want to show, I just hope I wake up one day to find out that the exhibition is the same with the 80s show, because I don't want to leave this hell out.
