Two adventurous teenagers, the best friends, travel to Thailand for one last experience before separating and leaving college. It seems to be a fun time to explore exotic land until they meet an attractive stranger who attracts them to Hong Kong and puts drugs on their luggage. They are detained by the local police and find that the administration of justice in the US is very different from the justice of the US. <br /> <br /> This is the main story of "Brokedown Palace" and it was good. The film is a decent work that represents the arbitrary and corrupt legal systems of the peoples of the Third World. In fact, portrayal was quite easy because prison conditions are often much worse than depicted. It is a reminder that no matter how bad we think our legal system is, it is pristine compared to many other worlds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie had too many understandable situations. it prevented the story. The whole escape attempt was a fake fantasy. To guess that friends could bring bribe money into a cushioned bra and were not discovered by guards who systematically checked all the things raised by visitors, guards or viewers expect to be perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is also unable to close the nervous issue of getting drugs from the Alice (Claire Danes) backpack. Did he agree to transport drugs? We're left to think. It was intriguing to keep girls guilty of the whole film, but we're never going to finish the movie without really knowing whether one or both girls might be guilty. Except for this remarkable mistake, the end was excellent and the results were unexpected. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale worked very well and well. The Danes, who are superfluous and overturned, came to this film as an actor. Although his depiction was often immature (as was his character), he improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more acute. Beckinsale, on the other hand, has flown under his radar all his short career and shines as good-two shoes that suddenly get into jail. His film was the best result in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman was confused as a lawyer. His funny and extraordinary style is an asset in films like "While You Sleep", but when a lawyer in a third world country crusade to release two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong personality. <br /> <br /> A tourist's look at Thailand was interesting, but it didn't make me want to go there. I gave him 7/10.
