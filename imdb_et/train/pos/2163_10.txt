I just love this movie. This is a great example of the outstanding surprising northwestern Asian cinema. This movie was recently a Hollywood remake, Richard Gere and just a terrible Jennifer Lopez. Please don't mix two movies. The original Japanese film concerns, fine and wonderfully worked. The Hollywood version is exactly the opposite. I was amazing when I first saw the US version of the remade and who was in that starring role. This is a typical Hollywood unique crass commercialism in the worst case. Transformation cites the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The only reason the original movie was no longer viewed is the US audience's reluctance to subtitle. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why this film would never work for American Americans is that the reserved, extremely socially conservative public film character is in this movie. Certainly, the main character awakens a more complete understanding of living life through dance, but half of the film's tension comes from Japanese stereotypes and ridiculous dance dancers. <br /> <br /> Please try this movie to see it is in its original form, not a terrible full screen. And don't miss the US remake ... it's a low travesty compared to the original Japanese movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know the "original" movie is a lot older and it's just a Japanese language, but only two people will soon see this new and US remake. Monsoon Wedding I will list it first for a reason, an outstanding film! 2.Johnny Stechino-very funny Italian erroneous identity flic! 3.Shiri-A Korean game that mixes both Asian burning and US style. 4.Run Lola Run-German film that integrates this techno score brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Well, just a quick list: -)
