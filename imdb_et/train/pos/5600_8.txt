This is my movie. I am interested in strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that. But it is also a dark comedy. While I see it mostly as a horror / thriller, there are others who can see it as black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But in both cases it is an exciting descent into madness. At the end I got off the guard, but what's the end! This leaves a lot of thought to the viewer. br /> <br /> Personally, I think I have to look at it several times to collect and understand all the nuances that are inside. But this is a movie that is a joy and not a chore.
