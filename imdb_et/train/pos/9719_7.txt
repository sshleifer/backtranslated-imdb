Going to this movie had heard good things. Coming out of this, I wasn't really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a pretty childish character like his other films. Here and there were a few laughs - something too funny. Probably my favorite film is when he dances on the club scene. I have to try it next time I found myself in the club. A few stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, this chick from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite fun to see a stage shot on Thandie Newton's scene. He is, of course, in the previous movie Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a stroke, do you enjoy it somewhat or find it a little numb. I can add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
