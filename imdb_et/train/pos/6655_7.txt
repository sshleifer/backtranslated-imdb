This is one of the best Indian films I've seen lately, not crappy songs and dance or slum dog movies. All actors have shown the right emotions at the right time at the right time. This is a good feature of a movie that turns the viewer's theme back into what I was checking in Harilali. I always have Akshay Khanna's exquisite style of action and, interestingly, she had a relatively complicated relationship with her father Vinod Khanna, though not as dramatic as Gandhi and wondering how it helped this character essay. I was impressed by Anil Kapoor's direction and 2 thumbs to create such a stylish film.
