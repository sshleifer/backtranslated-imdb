Many classic films from the late 60s have not retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience. "In Cold Blood" has not lost an ounce of its power. His extraordinarily well done force forces the viewer to think. Some have complained not only about the film, but also about the "non-fiction novel" of the Truman Capote source that the central message is indisputable. This may be true, but it is certainly a case where the lack of clarity does not diminish the film at all. It is refreshing, especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas to see the film with a convinced political voice who is not afraid to force the audience to look at its position. Frankly, I'm not sure if I agree with the film's central message, but I admire its fame. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with the death penalty message, there is much to admire about the film. The actions of two drivers are terrible. Scott Wilson (still another undervalued actor) cools down as a nihid leader who uses his charisma to conceal his weaknesses. Robert Blake also cools what is more sublime with these two and conscience. His character is clearly justified by his voice, but he is scared of Wilson (there is a good deal of homoerotic subtext in his character). Cinematic art is terrible, sleek and sharp and gives the impression that the viewer is watching the documentary. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
