** Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I know the violation of the historical documentary is difficult, but I will publish some backstory and methods.) <br /> <br /> but also because of the story behind it. As Naudets did not plan to talk about the story of September 11, but the story of a rookie fireman, the emotions and the visitor's relationship with them are more realistic and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In terms of filmmaking, "9/11" is a textbook. If events were real scripts, they would be great if the characters were created, then thrown into the curve they need to respond to. This is even more amazing given the raw materials that the directors had to go through in order to capture the story, pain and emotion. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie looks at life at the fire station; specifically how the beginner equates himself with the veterans' team. This part alone is quite good, and if the documentary was allowed to ride, it would probably have been strong. The brothers seem to be realistic about the NYC firefighting process. <br /> <br /> Then all hell breaks open. Chaos after WTC attacks is obviously visible, because the different signs we have known are invading scary situations. Seeing not only attacks, but also primary reactions, a very moving image of extreme human emotions. <br /> <br /> After firefighters are lost and found, the top of the human theater is. Life and death hang on balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer not only looks at who lives and dies, but cares for them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say is that Robert DeNiro (whom I like) was unconscious, unnecessary, and didn't tell the story at all. They were probably only added to attract more viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: The best documentary I've ever seen. Raw images of human emotions and drama. 9.5 out of ten.
