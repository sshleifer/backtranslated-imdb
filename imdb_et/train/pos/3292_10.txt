Paperhouse is the most moving and embarrassing film I've ever seen. Often it is classified as a "horror film", which I think is a serious mistake. Sometimes a press called it "a man's nightmare of thinking in Elm Street" and although I agree with the logic of my conclusion, I can't help but think it is a badly earned and misleading label. Those who see only horror are really lost here and only show that they don't really think at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, simply classifying this excellent work is probably a bad idea. Just, Paperhouse is perfect in every fine detail and always has a special place in the heart. Like someone wiser than I once said, "The film will hit you at a completely emotional level," which may in some way explain why my comments are so unsuccessful. Quite frankly, I do not apologize for the fact that if you feel that my words are too saccharides to taste, stop reading now because there is more. <br /> <br /> It is so rare to find a movie with his heart in childhood pain and heartbreak and a struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can kill us in this fragile era of life. It is even more unusual to find child actors who can actually perform their tasks so that they are all working. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers, we had inspired pain, and Paperhouse's lasting influence is largely due to their ability to gently and convincingly present childhood melancholy and alienation (often neglected). <br /> <br /> And both of these brilliant young stars seemed to be in the studio and have disappeared. <br /> <br /> Add all this incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you've probably heard and you can understand why I have such affection and affinity for this movie, that no number of words can be expressed. <br /> <br />
