What happened when a depressed policeman worked on a probationary period? May be a lot of fun ... This film sets the argument for the genre of cinema activities / comedy in Argentina. Dear characters, the likely story and the pace that laughs sometimes, is somewhat exciting. I recommended it for pleasant entertainment. Peretti and Luque try to fight against the cold and brave enemy at a time when it is difficult for anyone to trust. This film surprises you, "Analyze me" on the other side of the coin, but not the same, with jealousy. And if you want to know Bs.AS where there are few scenes from downtown and downtown.
