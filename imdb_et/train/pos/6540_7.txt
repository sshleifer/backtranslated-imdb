Frankly, I had to look back at this movie, didn't expect so much, but hey, I wasn't deceived, I had a good time. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is such a fresh breeze, despite some facts that they tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but it reminded me of those 60-70-year-olds in Europe and Quebec where they succeeded in children to communicate with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to do justice in trying to resolve the death of an actor who died 25 years ago. Anyway, if his father had a business in Hollywood, why not rent a home hidden behind the doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts is doing a good job here. Sure, like a chubby boy who originally naively brought his sister's anger to support Nancy, but in the end Nancy found it cool enough to hold her, even in her affairs ... <br /> <br /> The other supporting casts are big and happy this time saw Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role: a single mother (she did it in the rescue of the family, but this time a mature woman is playing ...) Anyway, don Don't let it, it's fun!
