Jack Frost is a row-killer, who is known as death. On the way to his death penalty, the prison truck he drives collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that makes his molecules snow on the ground, making him snowier. Being a killer himself who would make his killer snowier. Jack now wants a revenge sheriff that captured him. Jack is now starting his rampage again, killing people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I don't think Jack Frost has the chance to become a horror class, but it's a fun flick. Put your brain on hold and enjoy it, but just don't take it too seriously.
