The life of mistakes is a good film. But for me it's not really comparable to movies like Toy Story and stuff. Don't make me wrong, I liked this movie, but it wasn't as good as the story of the game. The film has visuals, laughs and others that the story of the toy was. But the film didn't feel that way ... I don't know, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Mistakes in life ... I don't want to say this is a movie that I can't remember. I saw it years ago. Of course, I haven't seen the toy story for years, but I still remember. I shouldn't have reviewed this movie, but I am. I'll give her thumbs, though that's not exactly Pixar's best job. <br /> <br /> Life of the error: *** / ****
