Director Douglas Sirk once again appreciates what is the grandfather of all dysfunctional family movies. This lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece that unites beautifully all the elements of Sirk's soy and puts them all in one movie. "Written on the Wind" obviously affected the TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty" in the 1980s, as it is basically the full-length version of their later soap soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, wonderfully and exquisitely, is played by Lucy Moore, the secretary of New York, who marries Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is both in love with a quiet but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family mansion in Texas, where we meet her white trash bunny Marylee (Dorothy Malone Oscar winning ring). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly - from romance to roofing, it's a camping trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight for the feelings she has for her best friend's wife, but Marylee is trying to sleep with everyone because she doesn't get her true love, Mitch. Kyle learns he is impossible but somehow Lucy's pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This movie is one of Universal's most popular films and one of the director's best works. Part of the dialogue is absolutely spicy and the visual metaphors are thrown in any way - the subject of the wind is great. The cast is great, though Bacall has been completely under-charged for Hudson. He allegedly destroyed the Stack Oscar. He considered it to be his best results and probably wasn't too happy to lose. And he pointed to a staggering alcoholic. What a wonderful movie! This movie proves what I have been thinking about the era - Sirk is the master of classical melodrama. Where's His Oscar? <br /> <br />
