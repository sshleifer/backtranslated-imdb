I haven't seen this movie since the late 80s and I decided to get this version of VHS. The plot is very slow and the actors in this burst class seem almost robotic. Music, hip-hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scenes make this movie special. Breakdancing is actually better than Breakin in this movie, but I have to say "Breakin '1 & 2" carries the screen energy and excitement much better. This is a movie that I keep in my library, but it's not a movie that I can watch again and again, only once in the blue month.
