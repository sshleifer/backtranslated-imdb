I remember it more than Nausica's wind in the valley at the age when this story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected her release in the US to avoid confusion with her broad Hispanic audience, is the caricature of the director's debut product, Conan. In fact, Pazul Conan's thick bones and immortal vitality - who jumped a thousand songs that wore their girl's hands and landed on their feet and then started running. It makes him the most animated and pleasant character. Nausica techie fans can fly bugs and retro technology to disappoint through Laputa - the only exception can be a robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and the Valley of the Winds, the theme of Laputa is not directly related to environmental protection. If it has a topic, it's anti-war. Of course, the importance of living - it is related to a flying castle, will soon be discussed and not really over. All in all, I now have a piece of respect and lean intersection.
