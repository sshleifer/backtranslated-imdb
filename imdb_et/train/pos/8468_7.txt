Surprisingly interesting meditation about the nature of regret associated with paranoia. There's a lot of it to last for just 74 minutes, but it works. Fears are very fine, not jumps that seem to have been populated with the latest Asian horror movies. How "scaring" is similar to disturbing moments "The Invinvited" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, led by Su-Leon Lee), but it's not nearly the same caliber. The film does a good job of balancing the classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what you should do. I'd like to check it out if you have the opportunity.
