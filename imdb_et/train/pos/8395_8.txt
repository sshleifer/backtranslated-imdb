*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder, which has ever been made, and even with a wonderful script, the film improves Hanna Schygulla's excellent performance. The film starts with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch), who are just getting married when bombs continue to fall and Hermann is sent to war-falling days, and now Maria and her mother and sister must survive. Maria decides to work as a dancer / prostitute in a club that meets American GIs and meets a black army soldier Bill (Greg Eagles) and they are starting to see each other continuously. Maria hears that her husband, Hermann, has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill. But one day they saw Bill close up at the door of Hermann. He is not dead and when he enters the room, a scuffle is created and Maria breaks over the bottle with Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and is sentenced to jail for a long time, so Maria tells her she can do something and get her out. The war is over and Germany has to rebuild and one day on the train Maria will meet Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) who is a successful businessman in the textile industry and uses his charms to get the job done. Maria has decided to do well and climbs the ladder of the company and becomes Karl's lover. She tells her she will never marry her, but she's in love with her. Hermann goes out of prison, but goes to Canada to try and get over everything Maria has done since her lock. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Mary with all his will and Maria buys his house. Then Hermann finally arrives at his wife's home and they are both ready to start marriage, even though they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas stove and the house is still exploding. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this movie that one of those movies that can be explored and spoken with great length. As with all Fassbinder films, color is used in a very interesting way. When the film begins, the tones are brown and gray to represent the war-torn Germany, but when Maria becomes successful, they become a bright, rich color like red and white. The construction of Germany with all the building sounds is only used as a backdrop and the film is focused on Maria's use. Fassbinder wanted the restored sounds to remind us of what is happening in Germany at that time. Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a smaller actor, this would have been another interesting film, but Schygulla is so strong that his performance raises this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria very determined and intelligent, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity she wants. She is not embarrassed and does not feel guilty about this issue, and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria a woman who practically sells her soul for survival. Schygulla was not nominated for the Academy Award, but he gave a great result, which is a test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a football player and his mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I've heard a lot about the end of the movie and it's related to whether Maria deliberately left the gas. Later in the bathroom the water runs over his wrist and he seems to be sad. It's just speculation, and if you think I'm wrong, send me an email. I think Hermann was very excited at home and left it at random (remember he put his clothes on for no reason?). Then, if he is going to read him at this point, he learns that Hermann and Karl have become friendly without his knowledge, and I think he felt that everything he was doing was nothing. This is the reason for the bathroom scene. So if the house explodes it randomly. But I think Fassbinder's reason is to show that someone who sells their souls has no business. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also very passionate. In her opinion, Maria cannot use it in both ways. An exciting movie.
