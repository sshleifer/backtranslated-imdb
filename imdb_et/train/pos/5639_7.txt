I have read other comments and found some comparisons of the real life of the film (eg to enter a music school), Britney Bashing, etc. etc., so we focus on the film and the message. <Br>> <br /> I have rated this movie from 7 out of 10 to 8 to 14 years and family film. The average adult man .... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I'm 45. I know about Britney Spears, but have never realized that she actually sang stronger until I read the credit and these comments. I didn't know his poster on the wall, so I didn't worry about any "self-promotion". <br /> <br /> I watch entertainment movies. I don't care about casting, lighting, manufacturers, drivers, etc. What is a movie and whether it attracts me. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for this message. The biggest epidemic in the world is the low self-esteem (which is the second story) that the message means, because it is an interesting area. The film is light, bright and windless, great for kids. I found that Texan's twang was lost throughout the movie, and of course there are so many ways to give up the opt-out / don't give up the message, so yeh, it was a little predictable. The big message ... should be more of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family film, but when he watches, he gets Hannibal.
