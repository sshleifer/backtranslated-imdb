I'm honest, I was younger in high school when this sitcom first appeared on ABC, which I didn't think I'd like at all. But inside John Ritter, I felt that it had little chance, and besides, I had something else. Acting was great, not much terrifying for the 2nd-class comedy, John Ritter always plays his game when it comes to comedy. It was a great show and I'll tell you why it was a great show. My father, who doesn't look at a laptop at all, looks at movies, sports, laws, and queues, and sat with my 3 brothers and 2 siblings, mom and myself, and watched the example I thought John Ritter had. I honestly believe that this exhibition is still working when John Ritter God is resting his soul and I wish he was not dead.
