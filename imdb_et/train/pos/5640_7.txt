I really think this movie is great, personally. But every movie is in decline. Now, some of you haven't looked at Hilary Duff's "Raise Your Voice", but if you think of it, these two examples are very similar if you know what I mean. In "Brave New Girl", Holly wants to get to Haverty in the Conservatory. "Raise Your Voice" wants Terri to go to L.A. Conservatory (do not remember the name of the winter garden there). They are both in the field of music and they both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two movies are alike. I like "Brave New Girl" better than "Raise Your Voice".
