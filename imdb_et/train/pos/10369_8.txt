"Not in the dark" is a masterful cinema, haunted and incredibly provocative. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who saw a terrible sight in 1980, seeing that his 3-month-old baby was brutally taken from their family tent when he was in Australia. Azaria (the baby) has never seen her again, and her terrible disappearance caused the madness of real life all over the world. Meryl Streep does a perfect justice to Lindy's role as she always does. But one thing that will help A Cry in the Dark ever fall is a brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this mixing case brings your eyes to the eye. The concept is nothing more than scary, and after that you have been haunted, but also inspired.
