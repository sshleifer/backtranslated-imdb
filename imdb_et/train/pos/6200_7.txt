Henry Fool is a better film. However, this is a great way to watch a movie like "Henry Fool". Take Henry very seriously, his "lie" and his mysterious aura. Even the "Henry Fool" overture, when Simon puts his ear on the ground when Henry is walking down the mountain, is better expressed through "Fay Grim". The general jokes, which are more or less meta-jokes (about writing a movie and jokes), are good, but the opening of the film is somewhat saturated. Also the use of Hartley in the Dutch corners of the whole film is jarring, yes, it is intention, but it seems forced and overused, it goes beyond what I would call annoying. This is a bad movie, but you have to see every Hartley or Henry Fool fan. <br /> <br /> And don't listen to stupid comments, don't look at it if you haven't seen the first movie. The intrigue, satire, and mind of this movie have disappeared completely if you haven't seen Henry Fool. This is a sequel. It's just stupid.
