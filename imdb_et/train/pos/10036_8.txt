The Titanic is a long-lasting, but well-made tragic adventure story that takes place on a ship that is undisturbed by an unbroken journey. Writer / director James Cameron has done an excellent job of making a story of fancy love between two very different people and combining that the Titanic actual event that drowned after the iceberg hit on April 15, 1912, claimed thousands of lives lost in the icy liberation of the North Atlantic waters. The film's two leaders are excellent in their roles, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make a good pair of screens. DiCpario and Winslet also had a real chemistry that gave the romance that eventually flourished between them a lot more credible. They both showed true talent when it came out and both have continued to show it in their latest films. The other supporting cast works, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton, are equally impressive in their small role as their characters who help to make the film live. The story of love, action, intercourse and special effects are perfectly done by that time. The situations where the characters were, felt so real because it really happened, so you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The stimulation was a bit slow from time to time, and it was a bit long, but the rest of the film was a few drawbacks. Titanic makes an excellent date for a movie that will definitely make some girls cry every time they watch it. The fact that it really happened to the movie definitely gave you the freedom for all the lost life when Titanic sank in the Atlantic after the iceberg hit. In general, the Titanic is a tragic heartbeat story of two people who fall in love, while a bad-failed ship that has revived extraordinary productions, especially DiCaprio and Winslet, who will definitely make time to watch this movie.
