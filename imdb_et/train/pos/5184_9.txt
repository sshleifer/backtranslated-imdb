A deeply humorous, yet comedy series of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are called back to Tomawka, Ontario Camp a week by former Canadian spouse (Alan Arkin). Writer / director Mike Binder led his experience in the same camp, which is a meaningful and delicate and understandable yarn. The film also has a lot of funny moments, some of which are just as strange as my favorite. Newton Thomas Sigel ("Common Suspects", "Three Kings") gives the film some impressive shots in the Canadian desert. Among the exhibitions here is "The Evil DEAD" films and "The Gift" by Sam Raimi, who is the right-hand man of Arkin's bumble bee. One more thing, this movie assured me that the camp didn't have to be a bloody murder.
