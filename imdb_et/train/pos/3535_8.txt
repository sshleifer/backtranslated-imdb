** WARNING - contains a spoiler! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I liked this game. I got some clues for parents after two months. I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that a single player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best games when you are at a party in London and some evil boys are robbing the prime minister's daughter. Of course you have to save her and it's pretty big, but you should take at least five minutes. The best part, and I also think it's the most fun part, when you're in a jet-pack, and people are banging Big Beni. Just equip your jet-pack with the most reliable rocket launcher and blast the clock face and enemies down. Clean fun! <br /> <br /> The remaining levels are very good but quite short. There are four mini levels that you can open, and this is one of the downsides, because only the first two of them are really fun and the last two are just "25 killing enemy targets, mind, c" ​​mon! We got a lot of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus tasks are very bad! <br /> <br /> Multiple players, myself and some of my friends, are very good and challenging, even if there are no bots. Halo had no robots, but it is still a fine player! You can be a burden for bad guys and you go against each other, you can also set traps that are the best way to kill people without their character. <br /> <br /> Playing - 8.5 / 10 (levels may be quite repetitive and reward tasks can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is strange bad graphics, but it's not very common). Multiplayer - 10/10 (no comment needed, just great, you can drive in jet packages and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Replay Value - 7/10 (The only levels I return to is the Loondon level and the first part of Istanbul). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <p> It may be a little better, but it's still good.
