This is perhaps the best rockumentary ever-British, better This Is Spinal Tap. The characters are plausible, the plot is great, and you can truly understand some of the events - like Ray's problem with band installation. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great. The real time, even if it is in the same key, you have some songs of the day. What I liked was almost all British cast, some favorite names. Ray's husband is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The film never pulls, it just goes at the right pace and has some really funny sections. Generator with some very good catchphrases! <br /> <br /> This is a hidden diamond.
