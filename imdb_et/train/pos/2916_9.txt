Of all the films I've seen, and most of them, it's the best that is mostly related to the US Navy Aircraft (Blimps) during World War II. Yes, there are other good LTA movies, but most of them use special effects more than real-time. This man's navy has many real-time shots of blinds, etc. True, a lot of brilliant dialogues, but that makes even more interesting Hollywood movies, even today. P.S. I spent 10 years (20) and had over 5000 hours of naval airships from 1949 to 1959. A proud member of the Naval Airship Association etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
