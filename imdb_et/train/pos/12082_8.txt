Having been watching this movie strictly based on the evaluators' evaluations, I was most pleasantly surprised. Although this is clearly a low budget, it is an example of the inventiveness. For example, when Julia wakes up in a strange house and looks out the window, I find myself thinking that her insulation feeling is enhanced by an outer surface that focuses on her face and then moves back to add the house and its isolated location. And look and see! the next scene was precisely that the last blow of the house was on the water's edge alone. There are other examples of how a smart director can bring his movie to the level of a truly enjoyable thriller. Savvy viewers will definitely spot them but should be sure they are not disappointed. As for the performances, George Macready has his usual horrible self, hardly maintaining his innocence, but suggests the ability to unadulterated violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a nonsense girl who wasn't going to play without a fight. But Dame May Witty, his boyfriend, even doubted me in his eyes and believed he could get out of his evil schemes. <br /> <br /> This is a real tough diamond that should not be missed.
