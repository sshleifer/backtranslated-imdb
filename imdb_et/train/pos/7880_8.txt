This pleasant MGM music plot is being created and it is only occasionally fun, dealing with espionage and romance, but the focus of the film is correctly marked by dark spots that show enormous talented and athletic dancing Eleanor Powell, supported by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, where is Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares the biggest bill with Powell and he and Sidekick Bert Lahr are given most of the comic minutes, although Skelton is more effective when he believes he fills Powell's love interests. movie humor as a dancer companion. Powell's technical brilliance has been proven in one incredible scene where Buddy Rich helps his drumming skills and has to be seen several times to allow his breath to catch up with his precision. Director Edward Buzzell uses his big frame to move the action nicely, despite the rather scattered manuscript he has to deal with, and allows Powell's inability to happen if appropriate.
