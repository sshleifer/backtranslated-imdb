Great family film ... gives you a lot of thought ... There's nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is great - it is ... real ... such things can happen in everyone's life. And don't forget to act - it's just awesome! Just look at Frankie and you know what I was thinking ... This picture is a real lack !!!
