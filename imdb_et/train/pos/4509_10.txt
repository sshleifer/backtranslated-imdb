The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada casts doubt on the freedom of the fearless ESKIMO hunter. <br /> <br /> W. Van Dyke, the peripatatic leader of MGM, was responsible for this fascinating look at the life of the Arctic among Inuit people. His production was filmed from April 1932 to November 1933 (although some annoying rear projection effects indicate that some of the shooting took place back in the studio). Although it was considered a documentary, we would probably call it "docudramaks" because it is written with an intriguing plot and storyline. <br /> <br /> The film shows Eskimo's everyday life both in winter and summer, and actually begins during the warmer season without snow or ice. Continuing to strive for food, the viewer can watch exciting hunt for sea buckthorn, polar bear, whale and caribou. Mother tongue is used for all title cards; Only English are spoken by the cormorants and the mountains that Eskimo faces. In fact, the arrival of the White Men is both good and bad, and the change they make in Eskimo society, which is the main element of narrative. <br /> <br /> This pre-code film is a refreshingly sincere way of Eskimo's moral code, especially the practice of sharing with their spouses, which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the whole film can be seen as a valuable gaze for a lifestyle that was lost early in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> No cast gets the screen credit, which is a disgrace to some remarkable performances. Most important of all is Ray Wise, who plays the leading role of Mala Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was of Inuit origin Alaska origin and is absolutely wonderful and completely believable in what was a very demanding part. Like all Hollywood stars, he continued to show Ray Mala's name in a sporadic film career, often in small unfulfilled roles. <br /> <br /> Cute Japanese-Hawaiian actor Lotus Long plays Mala's loyal seconds with a woman; the names of the fine actors playing with her two other women are now hidden. Director Woody Van Dyke takes the camera as a North-West certified police inspector. Two decent conscience, who must give Mala Canada justice, are Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing, both long-term characters of the character of the film. The Danish writer Peter Freuchen, whose books were based on a film, has a short, lively role in the evil wooden captain of the feet, who unreasonably incites Mala to the harsh anger.
