First of all, I want to make it clear that the inability of the average user to assess imagination is terrible. What makes this example so unique is its hyperreality. You don't need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead or why it might be just one minute. Where the strange stories of childhood have gone, like the rush of time. <br /> <br /> I say it is a refreshing original because it is a polar opposite of the whole-out-television masses. does not leave room for imagination or wonder. <br /> <br /> It's nice to add some escapism to the television experience. <br /> <br /> Hyperreality is my favorite placement. The beginning of the 1950s, innocent and rare characters and landscapes and physical conditions that are not meant to be a pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show disguises death while others have it. As entertaining, other TV shows are back on the shelf for this series. It is the curiosity, imagination and miracle of the television again. <br /> <br /> Daisies pushed quickly to the top of my list.
