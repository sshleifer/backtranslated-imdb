The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack compiled a documentary film about 50,000 Bakhtiarian people and their creature on summer migration for grazing in winter. The main value of this film is the time capsule of "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we knew in the West about "roaring twenties". The steeper contrast could not be imagined. Powerful river and barefoot mountain trails are brutally realistic and animals that die underwater will actually die. To ensure that the audience of the era thought the story was happening, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered at the end. The version I saw was exciting Iranian music that can be independent and appreciated without a movie. Having said all this, the film is probably more valuable to an anthropologist than a casual viewer looking for good night entertainment. The team had barely enough stocks to take the recorded shots, and there was no fancy camera work resulting from multiple repetitions. Western titles diminish the experience, but are actually part of it, as they show how Hollywood tried to put his spin on the lives of his indigenous peoples so that the day's audience would be welcome. Emergency police entertainment is a "police ball". Manufacturers made a dock-drama Changi (1927) and a completely commercial King Kong (1933). The subject of migration is again used in the wind (1976) and the Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting - and then highly recommended to them.
