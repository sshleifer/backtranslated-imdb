Fun movie. I saw this movie at the 2002 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival and laughed from beginning to end. It was fine but very funny. I'm not quite sure about the "Real World" effect, we don't get it here, but the movie keeps up without understanding this exhibition. Heather B steals every scene he appears, especially when he is rarely speaking with a red composition. Highly recommended. I'd like to publish it in Video / DVD in the future.
