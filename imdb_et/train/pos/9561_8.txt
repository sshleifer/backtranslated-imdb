"Ranma Â½" is Rumiko Takahashi's favorite anime, she really knows a good story that is not only comedy but also anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenage boy who is also a martial arts expert. Ranma is involved with Akane because of the orders of both dads who are very good friends and who have been trained for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is a younger and more violent Tendo sister: Profit is the oldest and most sweet and Nabiki is in the middle and loves to win money, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane are fighting all the time, especially as both are very bad and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl sprayed with cold water and her father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations will happen, as well as the transformation reason: in fighting Ranma and his father fell in a damn river, but not only did they have such a fate ... <br /> <br /> When you looked at '' Ranma 1/2 '' and liked it, I would recommend to 'Inuyasha' 'and' 'Maison Ikkoku' ', two good works from Rumiko.
