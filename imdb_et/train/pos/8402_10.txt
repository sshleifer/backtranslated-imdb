VAN is a simple teensploitation image made specifically for the drive that comes out of the way you feel comfortable, offering lots of opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small but rich role as a car wash driver and almost steals the show! All managers work well, the character is complicated and routing is quite competent for this type of picture.
