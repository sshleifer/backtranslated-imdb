"Rich in Love" is a lifelike film that takes the viewer into a somewhat peculiar Charleston, SC family event. "RIL" washes over you like a summer breeze, because his senseless curving breathes into the characters of life, so you feel like a friend of an old family at the end of the movie. <Br /> <br /> A superbly designed character from the "Driving Miss Daisy" director "RIL" is a somewhat hidden "sleeping place" that attracts the most mature audience.
