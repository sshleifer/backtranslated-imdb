Evaluating this movie is totally pointless. It would be like condemning (or praise) the newborn for her future life. Instead, look at it as a powerful meditation in what might have been and has been in the past 100 years. One hundred and eight years of cinematography: what has become of a child? I like to think about what would have happened (creatively) when Europe was not interrupted twice by the great wars of the twentieth century. His ruins were a fake neon slope of non-creativity and reactive circus. Before 1914, French, Italian and Scandinavian cinemas were both financially and naturally creative. Especially the French film was already very original and creative, which, if not interrupted, could change some unimaginable ways to the medium of history. One wonders what the history of the film would be like if it wasn't adhered to by Hollywood's 80-year-old commercial and cheap political agenda, which Chekhov could define as a rage of greed and harlot ... So be it at least known if La Sortie is the key (or at least one of them) to the "kingdom". So the birthplace of the cinema is Lumiere Brothers Factory, Lyon, France. Date: March 19, 1895 (there is also a copy of the reel in the summer of 1895, so if you notice summer light and lighter clothes for workers: this was the version that was shown in VERY FIRST PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GIVE USED PICTURES * Louis Lumiere: Creative Ideas , cinematography, the direction that was all of Louis's own domain, because Auguste took care of the rest (money). * The first film rolls were all fifty seconds: a camera (= le Cinematograph) and a camera man (le cinematograph), with only fifty seconds, * Probably Le Institute Lumiere has managed to preserve about 1,500 of those first films that have been made by cinematographic brigades traveling to Loumiere. *** So, all the stars in the sky and the minute silence, which is probably the most magical of human history (so far) .
