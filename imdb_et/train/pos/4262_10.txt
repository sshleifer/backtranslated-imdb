I saw it as many times as I did before leaving the scene. Pleasant and fun movie with some of my very favorite names. Just wish I could find it again! Certainly I would buy / watch it if I could. Please, somebody, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was a perfect patriot during World War II and his leading ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially the June Dude, were beautiful and charming. It was musical, but also romantic, funny and smart. It was my favorite movie starring June Haver, although I always liked it. His dazzling smile came on and his beauty and talent were useful for every film. Supportive casting borrowed their individual roles. Well balanced and light film; just wish we had more!
