Writer / director / co-star Adam Jones is in the big direction. That was the idea I had after seeing my feature film "Cross Eyed". Rarely does an independent film leave me as good as her. Intelligently written and masterfully managed "Cross Eyed" keeps you involved from start to finish. Adam Jones may not yet be a renowned name, but he will be. If this film had one or two "named actors", it would be a Box Office feeling. I think it's still possible to see the mainstream audience if only one movie distributor takes the time to work on this movie. Regardless of where it comes, if you have the opportunity to see it, you will not be disappointed.
