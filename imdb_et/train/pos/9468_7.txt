I saw this special idea today. I have to tell you that I am not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I had no expectations in this respect. I enjoyed it a bit. <br /> <br /> Dan Real Life has a widow who has 3 daughters who spend the weekend with their family. When visiting a bookstore, she will meet her dream woman only to find out that she is her brother's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty well done - sound, cinematic, and acting are all top-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem was mainly that there seemed to be a lack of character, mainly Dane Cook's character. We don't see the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt that it might have helped a little to show what Dan's internal conflict with Dane's girlfriend was like. In addition, Dan is sure to be a real, sweet movie in real life - definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've received this year.
