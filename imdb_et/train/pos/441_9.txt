This is a great movie about looking for some bliss in everyday life. This tempo, camera work, emotion, haunted musical result and the pure charm of this image make it visible. An immature or emotionally complicated one is not easily appreciated. The only mistake I see about this movie is that it wasn't taken in a technically perfect movie format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and a very good sound format. (An intimate film can be made seventy millimeters.) The beautiful influence of Italian villas on its inhabitants would have become even more lush and small beautiful moments would have seen and heard even more beautifully. As it is, it still requires attention as a sweet moving small film. I can't stop myself every time it comes on a satellite. Transforming characters into closed, tight and distrustful is always a pleasure to watch and I should recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> Casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, it works surprise. It is a film about middle-aged and human choices. It is deep and thoughtful without the beating of a heavy hand. Look at it in one session and let it affect you. If you can't, you may not have lived enough or something else is wrong with you.
