The books by James Michener, which took readers to distant places with strange sounding names, were probably the most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His stories from the South Pacific became a big break for Rodgers & Hammerstein's Broadway hit. The South Pacific was headed by Joshua Logan and he was natural to make another Michener success, Sayonara's film adaptation. kindly. I am sure that people who are fighting the Pacific War were not able to change attitudes overnight. This and the general non-social policy with the occupied nations in general is the main part of the story of this racial romance. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is an important film today. The military has always kept the personal life of its staff so that no civilian employer can legally get it. In America, Sayonara still had laws on irregularities in many countries at the time. Today the military gays are a big problem. Someone can one day make a movie like Sayonara on this subject. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was in a familiar country. In the South Pacific, racism was also part of its plot. A solid hand was given by Logan's beautiful story for excellent cast and craft. But the Eastern people are stealing the picture. Miko Taka hits Brando's love for a great deal. But the real stars are two, both supporting the Oscars, the Red Buttons and the Miyoshi Umek. <br /> <br /> Buttons are a member of your everlasting man-air force. He falls passionately into Katsum, played by Miyoshi Umek. They marry and the army brutally does all they have to crush them. They expect they know what's best for buttons and Umek. The buttons were a TV comedian and a fair talent, but he never got the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Miyoshi Umek Oscar was the first to be given to the East. This was a great deal of attention, because at the Academy's awards, Miyoshi starred at Broadway at Flower Drum Song. I had the privilege of seeing it on Broadway, the first Broadway show I ever saw. I still wear it. <br /> <br /> Oscar also symbolized something else. Our war with Japan was really over and we saw a great people in Sayonar with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakakura, a Kabuki theater actor. If Sayonara were done today, Logan would never go away with it. But Montalban is good. <br /> <br /> Great Location Photography and Great Story. This movie should be revived because it has great morals.
