My supervisor friend is a well written romance comedy film that has something similar to My Sassy Girl. Hollywood should learn more about Korean production. Sex is not always good for a romantic movie. <br /> <br /> Film is a light-hearted tone with occasional CG scenes mixed with the film. I like this part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. A more fun moment is when Ji-Hoon was hit by Su-Wan's first love because he shot Su-Wan on another girl and she will soon be a father. How he got his father appeared on the next scene that brings the audience a smile. <br /> <br /> Stomach points: 8/10
