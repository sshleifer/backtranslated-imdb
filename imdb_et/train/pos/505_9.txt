Very good start. I was a little surprised when I found that the machine wasn't quite as developed: it should have been a cruder to match the original series. The cast is interesting, although the Vulkan lady comes over too few people. She needs the Spock school, which is the model of this race. Too bad for them not to be able to choose Jeri Ryan. I like Mrs. Park, Korea (?) Lady. The doctor has options. There are no other men except the black boy. He's really nice. Bakula has to find his niche - in QL his strength was his sense of humor and his willingness to try something. He is, of course, a great and strong hero. Heavies were fine, although I didn't like their make-up.
