Enchanting, romantic, innovative and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost incomparable, surpassing the more well-known "death romance" like Ghost. Although we know intuitively that Peter and June find their ultimate happiness at the end of this long staircase, it is a pleasure to travel. The story of morality is of course timeless: love conquers everything. But the victory for achieving this is played in the heavenly sight and grasping greatness. With more than 500 suitably covered extremities of different ages and cultures, directors' vision of the sky is still memorable six decades later, far from the CGI era. <br /> <br /> Yet all the cosmic scales Powell and Pressburger knew the most important truth: the best story is spoken at the lowest level. The wonderful, decisively romantic aspect of "Stairway" is busy with the ultimate simplicity: the tear of June that has been preserved on the rose petal. <br /> <br /> This movie, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.
