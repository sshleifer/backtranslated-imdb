This is one of the best films I've seen for a long time. Anyone who sees this film as an absolute sh * t obviusly is not intelligent enough to grab all the subtle humor that this film offers. It shows us that in real life and in "fictional" action there may be a winning combination. Also for romantic comedy, two people have one of the smartest ways to find each other. Call me another movie where you can see both this and Donald Sutherland's song, "They're going to find their anus on Mount On Mars".
