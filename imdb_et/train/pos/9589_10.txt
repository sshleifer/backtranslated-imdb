Growing up in NYC in the late 1980s / 90s club club, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries that have been made to cover this place during this time. No Madonna found the Voguing idea, but that's where she got it! Instead of taking each other's violence or fighting in the middle of cats, voguing allowed people to "fight" everything that touched each other (which would justify automatic disqualification). Seeing such exceptionally talented / well-organized "throwing" clubs there was nothing remarkable and all the big names that day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Dupr√©e, Xtragavaganza, etc. everything is commemorated in similar periodicals like the song "Deep in Vogue" by Malcom McLaren ... it doesn't matter who you were or where you were, because when you walked through these doors into this "magical kingdom" you sorted out, you became part of something bigger / you were important / and most importantly, creating your own moves and imagination ... and somebody can get anywhere according to the king (or queen). The words and the mind were as sharp as the movement on the floor. With this film, all the energy of this very city, NYC, is gathered for tension, excitement and magic. BRILLIANT !!! PLEASE RELEASE IS A DVD To See The World! Thanks!
