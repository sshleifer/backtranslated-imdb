An amazing, wonderful look at the films that inspired the wonderful Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he is talking about are easy to relate to his works, especially those of the past, with a silent time. Very enjoyable, though I'm a little long, I found it to be one of the best documentaries on film. Requiring a look at Martin Scorses and his work admiration.
