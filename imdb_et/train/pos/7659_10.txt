You've just finished watching the movie that really disturbed me. It has been twice in South Africa when it was set up. <br /> <br /> It's definitely hard to hit, and the scenes that open will tend to "set the scene". Slow but steady increase in pace does not allow for a break and there are definitely few moments. <br /> <br /> Nigel Hawthorne can never be seen again. He came together as a very twisted individual and I found myself more than every time he appeared. <br /> <br /> I fully agree with Steve-Thomp's wording and well thought out comments.
