If this film was better put together, it would be the best of Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it is a good movie, but too long with a tedious sub-block, ie Randolph Scott, who loves Rogers sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (this is Ozzie Nelson's wife you baby boom). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two navy men. Scott meets Hilliard for the first time when he looks like a stereotypical librarian and later after Ginger Rogers has asked his friend (blonde but unmistakable Lucille Ball) to decorate him. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up where she and her old dance partner left. The result is some great dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers, but also separately: "I'll put all my eggs in one basket," "Let yourself go" and "I'd rather run the band." Hilliard is sweet, but a bit lethargic, because ordinary Jane turned to a glamorous girl, although she sings her two songs well, "But where are you?" and "Get behind you, Satan" - one poster didn't care about this song, but I love the title. Rogers is lively and youthful Astaire is dynamic. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie is at the end with "Let's Face the Music and Dance", which is one of the most written and most beautiful songs. one of the most glorious Rogers and Astaire. In it they describe the glamor and fantasy of the 30s. It's really dignified and observable over and over again.
