This film has scenes that come back to me in the most strange times - the intense scene that Mr Muckerji tells Ms. Melandez that someone with whom she spoke with the witnesses whose girl pulls out her window is one that rolls around - how does she name her refers to the - Greek accent "Mr Muckerji" - and when Boyer discovers that he has just taken the poison, and gives him one last smile to his head before he dies - its a pleasure! "Fools - fools - all my life" ... etc etc - get a point ... I have to buy it. I love Dan Seymour's actor - he usually plays some external sultan or police chief and appeared in Casablanca and with many great pictures.
