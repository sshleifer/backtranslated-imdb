Here's how I do it. I appreciate movies with 10 components. Each component starts with a 5 point point. It can then lose or get 5 points for a possible 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Fashion: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Effort - I'll give this component 10 points. It balanced all five aspects. The activity was fun and departure. Romance was not superfluous, but still very emotional and mobile. I laughed hard for a long time and I was still fascinated by the difference between fantastic drama and riveting. <br /> <br /> Plot - I'll give this component 10 points. I thought all good fairy tales have already been said. I found myself in the theater, back in my childhood, and in that moment I once again believed in unicorns, evil witches and falling stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. Although the film hit the story very well in most corners, I found myself more than once trying to find out what happened to the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give 10 points to this component. I love that they used C.G.I. sparingly. Epic scenes were plausible. The magical powers were terribly realistic. All in all, there is less, and that was all! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and experienced participants so, the majority was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully annoyed, Charlie Cox made a living for Tristan, Claire Danes gave the stars emotions and I never look and Robert De Niro the same. <br /> <br /> Act - I will give the 10 points of this component. Even the novice actors played the perfection of their rolls. Again, I never look and Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Make a mark - I give this component 9 points. It seemed a bit hasty and I think if the film had been a little longer, they could have made the characters a little better. <br /> <br /> Dialog - I give 10 points to this part. Dialogue was smart, witty, fun ?? even the wall had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this component 7 points. I can only honestly remember one little music from the whole movie. I'm not complaining beyond that music could be more memorable. <br /> <br /> End - I'll give this component 9 points. Almost perfect end! I feel that certain aspects of the end should have been more pronounced, while others might have been more modest, but no one was unbound. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy DVD? HEL YES! Look at this in the theater? Definitely! Bottom Line: Great for Everyone! EPIC! I suggest seeing it in the theater, I know I'm going back a second!
