Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) has spent most of her life taking care of her father. Now that he's dead, he's free - but he doesn't know what he wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has escaped from a monastery to taste more life. They meet randomly in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But she can't leave her past and she can't live without her ... <br /> <br /> HOW TO EXCEPT HORIZONTAL HISTORICALLY HARMFUL CHALLENGES AND Situations. Dietrich and Boyer are doing their best to give good results, but NOBODY can get some of them! Yet it's classic. It's fascinated by the fantastic Technicolor (try to see it on the DVD), where every frame is beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed in the nineties (even in the middle of the desert) and hysterical images to show off his clothes and his body. Boyer walks just watching the victim (not shock). I was never bored. I was admired to watch, and the fool-free dialogue had to sew me. The end result was almost my chair because I laughed so hard! Now I love delicious romances and give them a lot of space, but really --- it's incredible! It also takes a very short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Like the classic in the camp, I'll give it 8. 8. As a serious movie - a 1.
