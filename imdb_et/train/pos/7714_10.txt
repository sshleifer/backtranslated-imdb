There were a lot of 50's science fiction movies. They were the big drawings of the drivers. Many of them were even dirty then. This film and the The Day of the Earth Stories stand out and both are well-off on their roads. From the very beginning, your planet has been banned from the horror of the dramatic music score (which is still strange since it has never been used), leading you to a place where no person has ever visited. Talking about Star Trek, this film contains so much material that came to Star Trek's TOS, as is the pilot of this series; interactive captain / chairman / doctor, mad scientist, aliens, baby short skirt, computer information; it is now rigeur, but it was the first of its kind. Moreover, it has a well-functioning and well-made work of art, which even today represents imagination. Think about how a huge Krell machine is depicted with real depth. I saw it as a child (0) when it was a new film and it frightened me. Of course, every movie that was even scary, but I remember it is an invisible monster. The Forbidden Planet is a movie that a sci-fi fan can watch several times and find something new with every view.
