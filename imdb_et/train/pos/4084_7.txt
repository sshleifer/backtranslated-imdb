I think it's meant to be a "beauty and beast" for reprocessing or upgrading, but I can't say I've ever watched a movie that started with a few minutes of graphic horse sex. Wow. Anyway, it looks like a young woman and her ...? You traveled to France to the castle where the woman must be married to the castle owner's son, a man who takes care that the horses can get their stones off. It seems that in this beast area there are legends that were rather funny, I think I could say, ladies or at least one. There are all sorts of references in this regard, but every time a young young bride gets her curious little hands on one, the groom's father removes it. Anyway, the young bride-to-be goes to bed when the family is waiting for the cardinal to show her wedding (family member, I think) and when she dreams that she dreams that she is in the forest with the forest that is with her. The impact on this holiday is little desirable and any erotic attempts (not that I know much about it) have somehow become ridiculous, especially when certain highlighted appearances appear as realistic as bedspread or baseball bat. It has a rather strange and steep but complicated end, not really any clues or much to build it up, but it was kind of suitable and certainly not what I expected. I don't know, it's kind of tough, but it's my moments and is definitely weird. 7 out of 10
