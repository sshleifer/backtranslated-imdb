I saw this movie when it first came out. This was the official choice for Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for it for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is hot as a psychotic but challenging Amanda. It's not your ordinary psychophile. The genre has many interesting and original features. Amanda's Fatal Attraction Collection, which has some great blues music, is married to a higher and future blues singer who has less time for her husband during her career. <br />
