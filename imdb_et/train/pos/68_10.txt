Why a stupid, boring, dirty overpriced movie line like "Star Wars" gets all the leap and a really amazing movie like this, goes completely unnoticed .. is out of me ... This movie really opens the eyes to a dark, disturbing, sad and scary world where we live ... <br /> <br /> Unlike the boring "elephant", this movie is not one of those "just a typical day until someone pulls the trigger" movies ... this movie focuses more on what's happening after the event ... <br /> <br /> Deana, played by a very hot and very talented Erika Christensen, is a lucky and healthy direct student who has great friends and great life ... until ... she is injured on the day of shooting, head shot. he is not killed, but is seriously injured and must be hospitalized for a while, causing him to have a lot of emotional pain, in addition to physical ... , with a cold heart, rebellious, anti-social gothic girl who doesn't have any positive line ... and she's unharmed when shooting happens .. because it turns out she was FRIENDS with the shooter and knew she was doing what she did ... what if he refuses to tell the police if he knew the shooting was going on, they would stay in the house constantly to try to convince him ... and he wouldn't, so the school director would do he is deceased to a funeral of a student, and after he walks through ... decides the main enough, and forcing him to go to the hospital in Dean. say something. look at her ... <br /> <br /> Lonely, traumatized, and physically and emotionally wounded Deana is more than happy to hate anyone to visit her, but of course, Alicia is nothing but happy to see her. only here because he's forced and he's not going to be friendly at all. But sooner or later this intention will change ... (and that's all I say :) It's really one of the most mobile movies as well as one of the darkest and most annoying. link it to "American History X" as disturbing and at the same time mobile ... <br /> <br /> WARNING: Watch this movie at your own risk! It contains very graphic scenes and pictures! COMPLETE AND CRIMINAL UNDERSTANDED FILM! I am so ashamed that I am pretty much the only one who knows about it!
