A lawyer is directed to a cat and mouse deadly game when he is involved in femme fatale in this Grisham novel. Altman creates an arresting Gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. Branagh is a convincing lawyer for southern pulling and Davidtz is tempting as his desire. Downey is like a private investigator. Duvall has a small role that doesn't allow him to do much of his strange character. Hannah and Berenger drag an impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the film strikes down and does not really fulfill its original promise, but Altman is always worth it.
