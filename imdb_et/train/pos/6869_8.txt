This movie may seem like today, but remember that it was made in 1974 - before Saturday nightlife, before Howard Sterni, when George Carlin was just beyond Hippie Dippie's weather and a heavy satire of humor. This movie is the grandfather of all of them. Enjoy this historical value as well as the value of this great entertainment.
