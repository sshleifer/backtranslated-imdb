America in Paris has an integrated musical meaning, meaning that songs and dances are perfect for the story. The film was inspired by George Gershwin's 1928 orchestral work. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is mixed with Gene Kelly's choreographed dance stops set for popular Gershwin stories. Songs and music include "I Got Rhythm", "S Wonderful" and "Our Love is Here to Stay". It set a new standard for "songbook" music with dozens of Gershwin stories. The climate is Ballet The American in Paris, an 18-minute dance set by Kelly and Caron at Gershwin's American in Paris, where there is an impressive dream in the style of different artists. film. Ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars, which was a fabulous sum at the same time. <br /> <br /> It's funny to think of an artwork born between a pool game by Arthur Freed (SINGIN). VILJAS, OIZI VILLA, CITY, ME ME ST ST LOUIS and BAND WAGON) and Ira Gershwin. It was Freed's idea to buy a title so that he could use Paris and Gershwin for the idea of ​​using only Gershwin's music. <br /> <br /> The original story was supposed to be Cyd Char, but he discovered he was pregnant before shooting. The main reason why Gene Kelly suggested Leslie Caron's female leadership was that she felt that the film needed a real French girl playing Lise, not just an American actor. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caroni while being on vacation in Paris where she saw her in ballet. When he got a call, he said, "Who is Gene Kelly?" According to Leslie Caron, some censorship was held in an introductory dance that included a seductive dance with a chair. Gene Kelly directed the short sequences of fantasy dances shown as Lise. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier in Georges Guétary and "Celeste Holm" in "Nina Foch". > <br /> Minnell was a groundbreaking music director with Meet Me St. Louise (1944), America America, Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He used colors and songs in a way they hadn't used before. He used space and time imaginatively. Best of all, however, he promised to cut himself off to end all his ballet sequences ending in his films. Paris American American Ballet may be his best work. <br /> <br /> Although Vincente Minnelli is the only director, he is sometimes involved in his divorce from Judy Garland and other management projects, leaving Gene Kelly in charge of management. <br /> <br /> Other highlights include Guetary's "Stairway to Paradise"; Oscar Levanti's fantasy in organizing and conducting Gershwin's "Concerto in F" (why it was Oscar Levant's favorite). <br /> <br /> Ballet order, now that we know it was successful, everyone now wants to take credit for it, Freed, Minnelli, Kelly? but before the movie was finished, MGM told the New York office that it would not spend half a million dollars on the ballet. So Freed himself went to the master's thesis for Louis B. Mayer and agreed to him, New York said no. Finally, Gene Kelly showed the office in New York how the British film RED SHOES used a long ballet sequence and that the film became a global hit? and is now considered a successful art film. Well financial girls finally gave and signed the check. <br /> <br /> After November 1, 1950, production ceased when Gene Kelly started the choreography of the ballet. By the time the production of this final sequence was resumed on December 6, Vincent Minnell had finished managing the second film - Father's Small Dividend (1951). <br /> <br /> Irene Sharaff designed the style of each ballet set, reflecting a number of French impressionists: Raoul Dufy (Place de la Concorde), Edouard Manet (flower market), Maurice Utrillo (Paris street), Henri Rousseau (trade fair), "Vincent Van Gogh" (Place de l "Opera" and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (Moulin Rouge). It took six weeks to build the backgrounds and 30 painters worked alternately. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert said after a recent restoration, " America's Paris has many qualities, especially its famous ballet production number, Kelly and Leslie Caron symbolize the whole story of their dancing. "From America to Paris is often compared to SINGIN in RAIN, which is the biggest musician she has ever done, and one critic put it best when he said, "SINGIN" in RAINIS makes me happy and in American English Paris makes me feel good. "Ballet represents Kelly's fantasies represented by excellent French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy) The organization of such a tiring Raoul Dufy, an actor and producer screening, came to an end. There they found that they found an artist, moved to tears, asking for a second time in a helpful finale. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture (comedy or musical). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was awarded the Academic Award this year for her versatility actor as a singer, director and dancer, and especially for his great achievements in choreography. " It was his only Oscar.
