*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Packed with memorable moments (such as Primus), Deliverance talks about four men traveling to wild forests to ride ferries and stay away from the big city for a while to find their fun will soon take a bad move. It's not a Hollywood movie. There are hardly any specific effects, the setting is extremely realistic and nothing is candied or made beautiful. The city boys look like the townspeople, and even the harsh man Louis, exactly what Burt Reynolds is depicting, is in love with nature. This is the perfect example of what a movie is. What if some friends traveled by river rafting in a forest area where nobody was familiar with them, and desperately ended up trying to avoid being killed and convicted that they were forced to save their lives? The film clearly has a very strong element in the social and class structure and the relationship (or absence) between rural and urban peoples. When four men arrive at the beginning of the film, they do not know clearly how to communicate with the people who live there, and they talk to them as they do not know whether they understand or can communicate. This communication block is best illustrated by the dueling banjoes scene, where they try to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downstream. Although Drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally handicapped boy in the cube are dynamic with his guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis has trouble buying gas and Bobby comments on genetic defects and how pathetic it is. When a boy turns to Drew, who had offered his hand after their amazing jazz session, Bobby tells him to give the child a few bucks, knowing that none of them is quite sure how to react. <br /> <br This is something we see in freedom that puts so much of the tension to follow. This wonderful scene with lots of fun (including a more fun "redhead dance" scene, until O Brother, where art?) Ended up with an uncomfortable uncertainty about what to do around each other. These people are apples and oranges and live under completely different living conditions. People who meet Louis, Bobby, Drew, and Ed in the mountains grew apart from modern society and modern laws and live by natural rules that do not contain you to kill. Confused about their uncomfortable behavior, four friends along the river, hoping that fun and fun will start. <br /> <br /> (Spoilers) If they are separated from each other briefly and Ed and Bobby fell into the mountains, which quickly become unpleasant, uncertainty about how these people live - which was the scene above - plays that create the most tension on the scene. I think it is a good sign that such a thriller is that the tragic element of the film, namely attacks and actual murders, takes a very small amount of screen time, but remains the most memorable part of the film. There is no free violence here, it is all obvious to achieve the goal and it has an amazingly powerful effect. <br /> <br /> The movement is a violent confrontation between two very different people and what can happen if they get into a war with each other involuntarily. The rest of the river's attack after the attack, which takes most of the movie, gives you a pleasantly effective tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat, but does not bombard you so much that you become numb. This is surprisingly effective when we discover that Ed is very well dead on the false human rock, and the tensions in the film don't let even when the three surviving crew members reach the bottom of the river because they give the police a questionable explanation of what happened on the river and why the vice chairman brotherhood is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing movie that shows its success because it is quite obvious that such a movie is intended to tremble people. Hillbillies is a human (i.e., more realistic) version of the human rednacus, which is seen in children's, but rather similar, films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, neither of which can ever be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance. If we follow these four men through our fateful weekend in the forest, the natural element is so real and we know men so well and finely that it is almost like us, like the audience. Team Fifth Member. It is often not that a film can meet in this way.
