"If I wanted to slip, I'd call the sister." <br /> <br /> "Don't you have enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "You got me a choice." <br /> <br /> "If I start to die, please remove (cowboy hat) I don't want to remember it." <br /> <br /> Some wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotes on this charming and often insightful movie. Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. Both have a relationship with their father / father and son who determines the person to whom Arthur gets. Does he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth? For over twenty-five years I have returned to this movie with joy and joy. This is a movie that returns time and time again and remembers what is important in life, as short as it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
