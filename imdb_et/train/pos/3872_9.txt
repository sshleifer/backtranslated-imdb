If you have seen this little pleasant and comic movie, you will feel better. Greet Yves B. Pelletier for having given birth to this little excellent film time, which, in my opinion, is recognized as Quebec's 2004 label film. The actors are Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon. I could compare that wonderful story to you, what Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain gave me. So if you like Jean-Pierre Jeun's great movie, I'd say you also like the first movie Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
