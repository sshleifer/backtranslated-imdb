I am Italian and when I recently watched this movie, I was amazed at its beauty: for the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate this adult mind and feelings. Now I understand that it was a masterpiece of the special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.). <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic movies are good ... for fun. Perhaps this "Odyssey" was not an English version because it is not funny enough ... not suitable for pop corn and coke audience. However, it is suitable for Homer sins and existentialist reflections. <br /> <br /> Italy has recently released a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL, with great colors. You can find it in some file sharing, but only in Italian and without subtitles. Too bad: dialogues and voices in this movie are also remarkable.
