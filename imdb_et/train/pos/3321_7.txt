I saw a "Fever Pitch" type accident; it played on an airplane that went over to Europe. It wasn't really half-bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the # 1 Red Sox fan in the world, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can tighten it. Film is a rather interesting look at how world events can affect people's relationships. This is especially eye-opening now that Red Sox has completed its 80-year loss. I think such things happen all the time and we just don't know them. Not too bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie, which is an unusual link to baseball, is the 2000 Frequency. Check them out both.
