"Magic" is not too strong a word for this movie. You'll find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent light ... Every film that civilization has had on viewers deserves serious attention. It is pleasant to moisten such beauty. Like it wouldn't be enough, it's funny. The performances are exceptional, but special attention must be paid to the wonderful Miranda Richardson and to the wonderful Josie Walker - both with roses. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie not on DVD? It is worth living forever.
