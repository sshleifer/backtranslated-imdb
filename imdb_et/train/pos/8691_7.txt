Master Cinéaste Alain Resnais likes to work with family members who are part of his family. In the same film, we also see Resnais' family members, such as Pierre Ardit, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant, who deal with serious issues such as death, religion, suicide and their general. consequences for our daily lives. The nature of the shared formal relationship between these people is evident even as friends, they communicate with each other in a formal way. In 1984 Resnais occasionally worked with L'amour à mort. , memory and space to destroy the mysteries of the fundamental question of human existence: is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago in 1968 that Resnais made a somewhat similar film, Je t'aime Je t'aime, which was also about love and memories. The message of this movie is clear and clear: true and deep love can even scare the dead lovers back to their lost lives leaving doctors to take care of their reputation. L'amour à mort is like a game that is not at all didactic. is the perfect tandem for your pictures. This is one of the reasons why this movie can be easily grasped.
