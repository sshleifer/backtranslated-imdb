This film proves that film noire is a permanent style and viable. For me, this is the best example of a movie from around Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it never gets the credit it deserves. It was never properly advertised when it first appeared, and it was supposed to build its fans' frame through places like Vanguard Cinema and Ski Rental Guidelines. <br /> <br /> I recommend people who are looking for more than meaningless entertainment to rent this movie and dare this very complex plot.
