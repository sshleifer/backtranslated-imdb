I remember watching this child in the UK, the story was told and the narration by Laurence Olivier. We wouldn't talk about anything else at school the next day. I imagine the ratings of the first show were great. It is just the best, most comprehensive series of documentaries, even though they had to hit the story, so they were able to capture so much. Interestingly, the British and North African battles were central, but the Americans are not familiar with it. The series speaks of rivals between Mountbatten and American generals, the suffering of German troops in the east, the abuse of Japanese war prisoners by American troops. The pictures of the Holocaust made me, a non-Jewish European, ever to blame for the treatment of the Jewish people. I don't know why this is not the first in IMDb rankings. Maybe they show off against documentaries. Spoiler - we win.
