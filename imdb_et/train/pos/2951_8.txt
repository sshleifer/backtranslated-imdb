Yeah, it's a chick flick and it's moving slowly, but it's actually pretty good - and I find myself a male man. You need to love Judy Davis, no matter what she is, and the girl who plays her daughter gives you a natural, convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The landscape of a small, coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the main theme of the movie. Unknown (at least unknown to me) actresses and actors offer reality to a movie that pulls you and keeps your attention. In general, I give him 8/10. Look at this.
