I love watching this movie a lot because of the scary scenes of all predators. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite items are those where the reporter looks behind the pillar, because it reminds me of a scene consisting of 13 on Friday with a girl eating a banana. <br /> <br /> I love this movie very much because computer graphics seem a bit fake, but that's okay, because when you get to the movie, you hardly notice what's going on and I think it's a good ending, even if I didn't understand what was going on for me The first couples looked at it over time and this is an important part. Another important part is how scary dinosaurs can be when you first see it. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie.
