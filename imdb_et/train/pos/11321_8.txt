When I started to look at the exhibition, I said, "Oh, no! It's as funny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody!". And indeed, tuning is almost identical, a single young boy who lives in a big house himself, then suddenly getting into a fantastic adventure while sexy girls live with him. <br /> <br /> But this is where similarity stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as Inuiyasas, while childish notes and behaviors are very limited. The magical tuning is a bit daunting because it is about seven people, against seven servants who fight for the Holy Grail, all the servants are famous, half of all masters are from the same school, the rules of engagement, and so on. blur and vanish the drawing and the script beautiful. <br /> <br /> I actually looked at all 24 episodes in one day and without it, compared to the one I liked more, but which were from other genres, I have to say I was very pleased.
