I was very interested in seeing this movie when it came out for the first time in theaters, but I couldn't stop it. Finally it hit the shelves and I got it up. I don't know exactly what to expect, I put the music player on the DVD, I went into the murder night and played in the press. The following was one of the most interesting pairs I've seen in the last couple of years. <br /> <br /> * SOME SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is a story about murders that led to LA sowing parts and directly to the 70's biggest porn movies, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was stuck from the start and the feeling of the movie kept me up to the very bloody end. I was surprised that the film focused less on actual murders and events and research that had taken place before. In addition to some blood-sprayed walls at the beginning and at the end of the actual showings of the murders, the film was a more or less interesting big dialogue and a great show. Val Kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star and even "beautiful, but it's" Bosworth was delighted to watch (and just for her look, mind) <br /> <br /> I personally felt the best film aspect was as I mentioned, about the lack of showing murder. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere so you could not fully see the brutal starvation on the sleeping triangle. What's more, the sound effects of these murders were more than enough to appease my appetite. They beat the clapper, there is not much more to say. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was the short appearance of Carrie Fisher. In my opinion, his idea of ​​a superficial religious figure was a bit of a revelation. Maybe this person was actually a part of the story, maybe not, but I wasn't sold, and for some reason Fisher seemed too little "." <br /> <br /> Overall, a great movie is worth a look, even once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
