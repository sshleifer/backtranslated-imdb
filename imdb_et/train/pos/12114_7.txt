This film is obviously a low budget and filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that came to make this movie convincing (California and the late 60s) were well prepared. I believe this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that plagued the town of Vallejo and the Gulf from 1968-1919? (He was never caught). Next, James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (historically believed by Arthur Leigh Allen, who has been counted after DNA and fingerprint removal) are playing cat and mouse again. Scenes Together, Anyone Trying to Unleash Another Emotional Revelation. The life that dies from certain types of terminal illnesses and knowing Dzundza still made it completely obsessed to lose his family and become a full-blown alcoholic. completely unforgettable and self-absorbed (like all serum killers) who were left to kill again. The only disappointment was "up", which ended otherwise quite accurately. If you type Hollywood or are interested in the Zodiac case, look.
