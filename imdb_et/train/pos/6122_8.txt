this movie is completely fun. Basically, the plot revolves around, because the B-film caused a chemical accident to become somewhat snowier. then he drives the city and terrorizes the local people. it is with the local police chief and some other characters to stop him. It's done on a wee budget and it definitely shows, but the big thing about this movie is it knows its garbage. Styrofoam and polystyrene improvisations, which mimic the giant killer of the snowman, are classic, and this is clearly the intention - one of the few films that has their main selling point. with comic sticking, there are some other great comedy moments - listen right at the beginning that your dad died of your children, and the funniest rape scenes ever devoted to film. Fantastic sticky fun
