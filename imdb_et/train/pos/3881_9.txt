This movie captured me with an amazing opening sequence that tried to turn me into a full perspective, so I was hooked for the time the title came. The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to reinvent themselves, but not in a complicated way like identity or ordinary suspects, but as we all try to do any banal life, we're a little more interesting. Scenes from chicken stores are remarkable. At one point, Jorgen (who owns a chicken farm) is laughing at the seminar, where he is the worst student. His discomfort allows you to see the depth of your longing to change yourself. The film made me think of the hidden mysteries that lie beneath the surface of the most common people every day. There's not a lot of land here. Thinking about the old man's secret is quite simple, but the fascination is trying to guess what all the other characters are doing when they understand it. This film brought me the same way as Sideways, although the characters can no longer be distinguished.
