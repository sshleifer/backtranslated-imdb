For the first time in the Subiaco cinemas I saw an ice age when it came out of '02. I was only 13 years old, but even then I liked it. It was some kind of heat. <br /> <br /> We've been on the video for several years now, and no matter how many times you watch it, it's never boring. This is due to one element that makes it different from other 3D animations made at other times - the characters do not contain any specific home they leave. They are nomads, and it's really refreshing and exhilarating to watch. <br /> <br /> It also seems that the individual character of each surface has just been put together, but they are really all good friends. All characters also have their own charms (even bad guys). Sid, who is stupid, is charming in his tedious, redundant and naive way. Manny is divine in his depression, reclusive nature and so on and so on. <br /> <br /> Another great movie about the movie is the beauty of animation. All the environments and signs were originally designed from clay, giving the film an artistic edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the film's feeling is that sex means very little. Female characters are scarce, but you do not realize that until you watch it a few times, and even then, it doesn't affect the way you watch the movie. Consequently, there is no mention of a family of nuclear families, which would really be pathetic in an environment such as ice age. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the ice age is a great movie and shows how much effort was put into 3D animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles.
