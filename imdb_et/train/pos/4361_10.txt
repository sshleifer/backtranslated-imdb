It was probably one of the 40's best made films - Warner Bros. Sol Polito photography is probably his best achievement - gorgeous compositions and delicate shade lighting. Max Steiner gives his most challenging and beautiful result - his classical method of finding. Music adds a lot of emotion and excitement to the plot and is subtle and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same film crew who made this film immediately made "Now, Voyager" later this year - a fine film that won prizes and prizes and went as a historical favorite, mainly because he was Bette Davis. In my opinion, "Gay Sisters" is a much better film - it is better done in all departments and more interesting, more complex and more enjoyable. The most unusual film that attracts those who take it instead of designing their own modern creative feelings or high-tech hyper-critical standards of perfection. Every thing has to be judged about your pastime and what it is trying to achieve under its own terms. Most of the complaints I've read in these reviews are both childish and completely missing. If you're hungry for the perfect fillet, don't go to the bakery counter and start stacking and complaining to fluffy pastries. The art of film criticism has indeed disappeared from a large population. Sorry people - maybe if this film had been made by Rolling Stones and a hundred complex and soul-seeking sub-blocks, everyone would be happy to be happy. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual claims on the day of the week!
