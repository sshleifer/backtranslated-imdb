The 1986 TV movie "Spirit" was a potential series pilot. But Will Eisner, the creator of the Spirit, did not like the film and therefore no series was produced. I thought it was a very fun movie and captured a comic spirit with modern twists. I'm sorry it didn't turn into a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was the perfect Spirit. Nana Visitor was nice Ellen Dolan and of course she went to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps, with the release of the grand screen version of the Frank Miller Spirit, there are more people who see this rare history of the Spirit. It seems that if Hollywood makes a movie of an already created character or idea, someone will inevitably look for earlier versions of the property and release it to the video to make a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas joined Zorro's mask, we got a large version of earlier versions of a hidden hero on the DVD, such as Alain Delon of the 1970s (although all the copies I ever saw were poorly edited). We hope that someone will soon release The Spirit to the TV adventure DVD.
