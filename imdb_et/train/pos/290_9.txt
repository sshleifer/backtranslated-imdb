Edmund Burke said that "all evil needs are good, that I do nothing." Hollywood often gives us a trash because families are not enough to watch high quality movies. This film was a resurrection story of the loss and restoration of faith. It had no violence, no maladministration, and no PG rating. The western landscape was well filmed and some views were just breathtaking. The actors were a bit young for their parts, but otherwise they believed and talented. The music score was too loud and in some places drowned in the dialogue completely. I'm rarely surprised at the end of the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes good guys will win and they will win with honest effort. We liked the movie and the message and recommend it to the whole family.
