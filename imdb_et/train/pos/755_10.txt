Dirty Sanchez is a more extreme British version of Jackass, where four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) are hurting and humiliating. The reason this show is better than Jackass is that most tricks are not planned, which makes the reaction much more fun. The show has 3 series, the first of which follows them and takes a long time in their lives. there is an episode of their love life, jobs, etc. The second series sends boys to try different professions. The third is followed by their European tour. The boys seem to be more and more courageous when the display is progressing through the series. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I say if you have a week's stomach, DON'T SEE because you have easy to see the right amount of blood and every episode.
