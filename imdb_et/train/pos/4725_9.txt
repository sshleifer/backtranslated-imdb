Despite the lack of logic, Kill Shot is a very enjoyable movie. Through mobile performance, Kasper Van Dien presents a perfectly emotional gap between a working wealthy father and his misleading son. Each member of the supported casting site has a solid performance, highlighted by the lively action of a young Asian man whose name I can't remember. An exciting tragic ending can weaken some of the younger viewers, but the entire Kill Shot really gives a blow to death.
