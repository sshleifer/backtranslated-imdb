"Xizao" is a story about the clash between modern life and ancient traditions and its impact on the family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman who returns home when a letter from his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) believes his father Liu (Xu Zhu) is dead. He found his father still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father's old business, public bathroom. <br /> <br /> Movies focus on Da Ming's family, and how he must learn the importance of his father's work, which he always considered an old tradition that was about to die. The film also examines his relationship with Er Ming, who is in a spiritual challenge, and the problems of a small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the movie, family and progress issues are very well handled, and the film never loses the point it is trying to make, both of which are very well developed and we see Chinese society and customs. > <br /> Director Yang Zhang speaks his story in a simple way, letting characters work on the characters. This is a very simple approach, but it fits perfectly into the movie and I doubt very much that this style would fit into this movie. Zhang has tremendous potential because he can talk about the story without the help of visual burns or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The actor is distinguished by its natural approach, each acting in a very natural way and almost as if they were filmed by real persons. Three main characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming definitely steals the show. <br /> <br /> Even if a movie could have stuck in a patronizing "old day much better" message, it takes a balance of stance, saying that progress is good, and we need to move forward, but we must not forget where we came and kept a balance between modern life and old traditions. <br /> <br /> Amazing and touching the movie. 8/10
