For an independent film, it is surprisingly well done that Insomniac's nightmare paints an amazing picture of what he wanted to suffer impatiently. Wonderful is well written and directed, it creates a dream atmosphere because the viewer is taken overnight in a sleepless life. <br /> <br /> Having dominated Dominic Monaghan as Jack, we can see everything he sees when the long hours of a lonely night drag. Narration is almost hypnotic and it is impossible to turn the opening line. Amazing and lightly disturbing, it shows how no one can sleep between balance and madness. <br /> <br /> As each corner turns around, Insomniac's nightmare turns provocative and interesting. This is highly recommended.
