I went to the film with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard that they were easy to miss. I knew it seemed good, but it was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they looked really strange as ordinary people, if that makes sense. I am sick of movies that show teenagers that they are like cookie cutters like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique, but still very human and normal enough. I recommend this movie to all my friends and I look forward to hearing it from the DVD. Go see this movie with your friends who can laugh in the funniest parts of life! I plan to see it again in the theater and I don't see things more than once very often.
