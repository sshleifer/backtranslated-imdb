One of my favorite films with a very nostalgic ending. The film is related to the Sullivan family, probably Michael Sullivan's (father's) main mafia member, killer to say it and an expert. One child wants to know his father's job (terrible mistake), so he hides his father's car and well, he sees Tom Hanks so to say so. <br /> <br /> There are no Mafia rules, no one in Mafia will win if they want you out, they'll take you out. Of course, you see someone who works in a mafia house with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but you do the wrong job or do something your "boss" doesn't want, and you're fired You see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr sees something What he did not see, and well, almost all his families are killed for this "wrong thing" for his son did. The movie is really fun, you can see how Sullivan lives after the mafia or some of it has been pursued. <br /> <br /> This movie is a little sad, reveals us revenge, the black work that people do, almost everything you like. Hopefully this man reads this comment, doesn't work for the mafia, and if you work in the mafia, do it yourself and put the hell out of the country before your boss and their employees die. <br /> <br /> This movie is: 10/10
