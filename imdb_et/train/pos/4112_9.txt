The title is onomatopoeic, a track-stopping tram sound. It is a metaphorical for all those people who don't live in the dump. The misery of these people is illustrated by the passage that represents the relatively inaccessible rich life of the middle class. The little boy and his beloved, but unfortunately the father of the mad father is most concerned. It was Kurosawa's first color film and she uses beautifully shocking shades of colors that only dreams see. The film is surreal and transcends beauty. Compassion for humankind is submissive, but as always, Kurosawa focuses on capturing the beauty of the film. This is a masterpiece of a cinema gene.
