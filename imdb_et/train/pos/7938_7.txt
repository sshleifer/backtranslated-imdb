Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and the kids who don't see anything like either. <br /> <br /> Basically, Robil and Josie-l are wedding vacations on a drunken night during a Vegas vacation. They come home to find that their children already know the wedding of a tabloid-like non-feed. They, Rob and Josie, move both and their eight children to one or another house. <br /> <br /> Rob builds furniture that I think is close enough to Frank Lambert's (Patrick Duffy's) construction work, step by step, to justify eternal blinking. <br /> <br /> Josie is the queen of making a cookie, although it doesn't look like cookies. Not close enough to Carol Foster's (Suzanne Somers) hairdressing work to justify mockery, but insecure enough to justify cruelty. <br /> <br /> Unlike step by step, they were a couple before the holiday and actually knew him for another surname, or so one would expect their serious attitude to the trip together. <br /> <br /> In any case, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L., and Andrew B. I personally think they should have just called the younger Andrew Andy. <br /> <br /> There are many product placements, especially soup in hand (which is nasty) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some stupid, pointless moments. It's not a great movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! This completes my review of "Step by step ... on some very bad medicines". Look at Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes. There are some very beautiful eyes.
