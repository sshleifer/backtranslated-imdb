I was happy for one when I saw Jim Carrey in a movie where the attack was not a goal. His character is like all of us. Wishing more - better things that would happen to us and wait for God to get them. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and a true love feeling, each of us is ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself. <br /> <br /> I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a bit too vulnerable and an understanding of Carry's basically a central TV anchor who wants to be, but that's the way it was written. <br /> <br /> I think the previews destroyed a number of potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what came before it happened. /> <br /> I have read a number of comments and it seems that some people look too little. It's a summer comedy and it's not meant to solve the world's problems, although we have some messages that we can all take to heart. <br /> <br /> Funny movie.
