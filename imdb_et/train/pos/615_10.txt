This is a fairy tale! Crooks are totally evil and heroes are refreshingly clean. The Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are great, as well as a new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Excellent performance, pleasant magic, funny and dramatic and perfect fairy tale that makes this movie completely stunning! I'm not so sure that all content is suitable for younger children, but there are many fun nuances for the older audience! Previews do not make this movie fair! My groom and I were quite skeptical, but we were so excited that we took this movie with the chance that I could only hope to confirm this movie to the garden to try it!
