I found myself in the sixteenth and seventh when I saw it. Altman's touch on and off zoomed in and I expected these devices comment on the characters and situations. Unfortunately, when I saw them, they were sometimes free, sometimes witty, often rude, because they didn't show any ironic or other connection. Especially puzzled is the Savannah gold-plated dome. To be fair, some of the images going out to Branagh (out and ins) raised his character's confusion, la Pudgy McCabe or Philip Marlow. All in all, the zooms were good, inconsistent and sometimes even tiny. <br /> <br /> Other Almanesque devices, such as multiple glass panes between the camera and the subject, made it possible to refer to the sollipsism or narcissism of the signs or the opaque state of knowledge. Car windscreens, windows and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently, I felt it back on the player and even LONG GOODBYE. Some memorable jumps, especially for recommended TV commercials, reminded me of such use in SHORT CUTS, a sardonic effect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the mismatch between the very personal style and size of Altman's genius, Grisham's genre, couldn't excite me. This director's masterpieces of the 1970s changed and deconstructed various classical genres, including the chandler's detective film, which he recalled in some ways; this time, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytical skis to hit any meaningful blow to the soft area of ​​this beast's genre. Perhaps the mammoth manufacturers were able to worship him? Or am I missing something because my weak knowledge of the genre he takes here is? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, casting was great everywhere: Tom Berenger (for his terrifying forestry), Branagh for his (deflated) hub, Robert Downey Jr's pheromone fog, Robert Duvall's trash method and Davidtz's femme death fever almost perfect choices. And except for some slip from Georgia to Chicago (brunette?), Daryl Hannah, the accents were convincingly southern. <br /> <br /> The excitement and mood were involved, even if the story was not real viewers. The mood of the barometric jumps of the prehistoric hurricanes was finely, carefully thawed - I felt I was tempted by the defendant to turn on the cooler pronto. <br /> <br /> The tower, finally I decided it 7. <br /> <br />
