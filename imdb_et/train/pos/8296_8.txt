Suburbia is all idyllic when a small family moves because the father has a new job in a new computer company. But no paradise would be complete without his snake. Strange things happen when a family joins a local country club without a spouse because it definitely has secrets. The Father is not a joiner, but joining is a pressure because everyone in the neighborhood and at work is all members. Robert Urich's good twitch is a bit dull, but Joanna Cassidy is a good-natured housewife who is nasty sizzles. Standing and well done cooler with club chair Susan Lucci. See a little bit of a liar about Michael Berryman. The film captures the feeling of paranoia and the special effects finale is expected. I've seen this movie a couple of times.
