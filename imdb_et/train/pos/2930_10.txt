The film is splitting from the beginning, Eddie just seems to bring this uniqueness to the stage and makes the most elemental joke that ice cream is a tradition for an old family. The film is very rare in this country, but insecure in other countries where I have searched for many websites and are still lucky, calling companies looking for rare videos for years. So they are very welcome. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees the video, it's worth the money and can't go far.
