I didn't like the terrible and overpriced Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite Vietnam War is The Deer Hunter. The deer is focused on one part of the war and then focused on life before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too thin compared to deer. The story has never developed so that the audience can truly understand and feel signs like Deerhunter. Vietnamese returns are not as engaging or involved as Deerhunter. That's why I can only give this movie out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think it was a failure. DeNiro and Harris are really amazing actors. They put themselves fully into their characters and expressed the great concern of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby. Harris's character is a half-dead alcohol hiding the guilt that he has lost his life in Bobby, trying to save his life. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. The city probably cannot handle Vietnamese veterinarians well. Like many small towns, it is quiet, humble and businesslike. However, the character of Harris cannot be one of these things. It is interesting how wars affect people. Some people pick up fast while others never rise.
