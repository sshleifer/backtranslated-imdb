Blonde and Blonder have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene, and if you want more movies, you're totally unjustified. It seems like the late era of Carry On, when the series was no longer a relaxing trail, but was still more fun than not, think Behind or England and you're not too far from the brand. Pamela and Denise are effervescent, charming and aware that it's not a masterpiece they do, even though you get me the many things I like. Supporting casting is energetic, even if some of them are not very good; I don't see a couple of odd movies that have almost forgotten to make something big, so just smile. I really think Blonde and Blonder are ace and I hope you hate me for that.
