Just funny. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is a green grassland in New York, a young optimistic Cowboy (almost Forest Gump-type) Joe Buck from Texas. It does not take long for Big Apple to swallow him and his ambitions mercilessly, and very soon Joe is against both the cold and street hell of the New York Islands. Given his pure heart, he is unfortunate with one of these criminals, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves with him in an apartment wreck and two literally struggle to survive. <br /> <br /> Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, best described as a tragic comedy or comedy tragedy in my opinion. Above all, it is a beautiful film that is stylish to capture the modern hippie vibe of the late 1960s, along with the compelling cinematography of Warhol's party and its comparison with the city of New York. Cowboy Joe Buck curses the film somewhere, emphasizing his position on the spot. We feel like he is fighting to match, but also just getting enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy brought tears to the eye as it is also rich in essence and projects a lot of heart. I imagine that this film must have inspired both Forest Gump's pure heart and spot-on, and to some extent Crocod's Dundee films, as it addresses almost exactly the same humor - contrast between countries. cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitans. A very convincing and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
