Cut a short story. I loved it every minute. Great fantasy with real Arabic night style. There's an evil magician, a pretty princess, a djinn, and everyone is happy. Modern Hollywoond is sure that this classic has one or two things. Just beating: special effects are dated (loved by Sabu with djinn)!
