The film has a clear (albeit brutal and harsh) humankind for its entire frontier - the jerky / lyrical result points to the comic side of these inconveniences and even when they are in their worst situation (for example, terrorizing a woman on the train), the semi-merciless vulnerability never loses far (Dewaere sucks on a breast like a child). The more distant starters where Depardieu can rape Dewaere so that we are never sure how to explicitly read the obviously homoerotic aspect of their relationship - so that this is the beginning of their relative humanization (so the movie could definitely read pro-gay, though this can probably read the pro-something you want). The film has many sexual-political objects and points, and it is probably best to take it as a general comic for fans of both sexes, making no sense of the whole sense of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting numerous potential abundant points, based on the fact that if you shoot enough shots, some of them will hit.
