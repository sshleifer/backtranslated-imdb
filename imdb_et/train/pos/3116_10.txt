The last installment of the action franchise is precisely the fact that it is probably the hardest to hit these three films. To play against the Bond, it goes further. Bourne does not like what he does and wants to know about his vague past. All this film hits nail cinematography for choreography / stunt work until the script runs. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a boom when Bourne runs from the Moscow police. The story seems right where the first movie was left out. Or is it? Time is a bit confusing, but we get the fact that Bourne remembers things. Maybe the backlash, trying to get rid of it, gets him shut, but he does it and doesn't kill anyone. They're not his goal. From there, with the new player Noah Vosen, we get more of his past intrigue, who seems to know everything about Bourne and protects it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons, who also seems to have Bourne in the past. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is virtually everything after your face. Car chasing is even more intense if it seems possible than the first two. And the veteran cast Bourne is great as a beautiful part of Albert Finney. It also has small political confessions in terms of transfer and other government policies, but it is small and well integrated within the plot. All in all, this is the best trilogy of this year, if never the best logic of action.
