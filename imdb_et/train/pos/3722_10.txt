First I saw this movie without knowing it, I just knew Joel Schumacher did it and it was enough for me. A friend and I went to see it at a Danish film festival called Night Film Festival, which is a wide variety of films that will be shown after an hour when the festival specializes in showing films that will not otherwise be shown in Danish theaters. Anyway, my friend and I went to see it, and we were surprised how real it seemed and that it really struck our feelings, we really got a piece without having to understand the end that is a big plus in our book. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish dogma 95, initiated by 4 Danish leaders, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In Dark). <br /> <br /> All in all, watching a movie is really worth it, it gives a different perspective on how things were coming out of Joe's school for the United States Geographical Indication, to serve his country in battle far from home. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is also an extraordinary film I've never seen before, but I can't wait to see more of him. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
