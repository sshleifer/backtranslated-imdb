Wow, I loved this movie. It may not have received funding and advertising from the latest Hollywood blockers, but it packs an emotional punch twice. The story revolves around this single family from Utah and it is a connection between family people who offer a movie with their punch. The main leader (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his part very well, he never leaves you to believe he is acting all his feelings. It's her brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me. When the two were in scenes, they narrowed their lines, giving fantastic performances. Great cast, great movie.
