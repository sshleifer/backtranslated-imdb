I remember that in 1965 it was special when the channel was surfing. I've never heard of Barbra before. When the show was over, I thought, "This is probably the best thing I can ever see on television." 42 years later, which is true. Here is not so amazing, so frankly amazing as the talent shown here. You can talk about all the super stars you want, it's their ultimate, <br /> <br /> You call it, it can do it. Comedy, sin, seductive seduction, ballads, Barbra is truly a storyteller. His ability to pull everything he tries is legendary. However, this special was at the beginning and helped create the legend he quickly got. Even though he has soared in such a short time, he has fulfilled his promise, revealing more of his talents than he did. But they are all here from the beginning. You will not be disappointed to see it.
