I read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for years, but I only got it at the beginning of last year when I went to buy a crazy movie, and for whatever reason it has been in my mind lately, although it is a few months after I watched it . <br /> <br /> This is a striking film located in Italy somewhere in the 15th century. Definitely a medieval time (though I don't think any particular year has ever been given). This is the time of the Christian uprising, when age is timeless madness, and the film takes it very well. <br /> <br /> Our main character, Flavia, is a young lady who meets a fallen Muslim on the battlefield. He seems to be a warm and intriguing companion and he is with him right away. His father, a soldier of some stagnant family, comes almost immediately and murders the wounded person directly in front of his eyes. But she still sees her in her dreams. <br /> <br /> His father sends him down to a monastery that looks like an open-air shelter - the population, so severely repressed by medieval Christianity. , slowly crazy. Flavia comes under one nuttier nun. But in a crazy world, it's only wise to be crazy, and this sociopathic nurse clearly recognizes the insanity around him. It takes a time when they live, to hit the Flavia with a chord that is young and apparently hidden and starts to doubt everything about the world in which he finds himself trapped. <br /> <br /> The film is insecure about depicting a world with many inconveniences. We see a horse, one lord rape one of the women of his lands, the divine torture of a younger nun. Through all this, Flavia follows and asks, eventually rejecting the Christian dogma that creates a parade of such horror so that it would criticize the anachronistic appearance over the years of the film. I do not agree with this criticism. Flavia's views, sometimes expressed as vaguely reflective, such as the modern feminist commentary (made in 1974), revolve around what are really obvious questions. Perhaps it is hard to believe that he can spend as much fish out of his time, but that is a little point he does not. Flavia has been written so that people of our age or of any age can resist their situation. Attacking such a question would be missing for the disability. <br /> <br /> Flavia is cordial when Muslims arrive in rural areas, and he finds his new beautiful version. Islam, who still visits his dreams. He almost ended up with him, allowing him to run his army practically, becoming Joan of Arc in full combat, and directing the invaders to pull out of Christian society and revenge on all those he has seen evil. /> <br /> Is he a new and better world listener? He may think this, but the Muslims of this age were not great for feminism, because he learns quickly. As they say, answer the new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is just some of the pictures that take place in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The film is rather grim and very slippery, rather a frustrating end. There is definitely no public film at all. It is pretty good and does not belong to the "nunsploitation" piles, which it is often neglected. I think there is a lot of value in the last film and I'm glad to see it.
