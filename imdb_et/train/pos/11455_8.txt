This German documentary is Scottish sculptor Andy Goldsworthy in English. He does the art of the objects he finds in nature. For example, we see the film early, that it takes parts of ice cuttings and "glues" them with a little moisture that carries a serpentine shape that appears repeatedly through a vertical stone. <br /> <br /> Of course, icebreakers melt, but this transition is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to the site and feels it, judging intuitively what to do that day. She says she has a "dialogue" with the stones and other materials she works with to work *, not against them. It can be stones, flowers, leaves or sticks. Sculpture can last for minutes or years, or it may not be long enough to be ready and photographed. Work seems to be a process rather than a goal. <br /> <br /> Film and work are beautiful, inspiring and thinking. It moves quite slowly, which is suitable for the material, but you should definitely go if you have a good night's sleep. But do you have a chance if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the web for another Andy Goldsworthy page or read about your local sculpture at Stanford University. Several books are available with his sculpture photographs. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: skip reading this section if you want to find what this film means to you completely independently. I remember a couple of ideas that appeared to me when watching the movie, which I thought I would share with those who are still reading. First of all, Andy Goldsworthy reminded of the temporary nature of the great work of the natural and sudden flow of human life. We are born, we live and finally die. This is natural and is, of course, part of Goldsworthy's art. <br /> <br /> Another idea was that Goldsworthy managed to integrate his passion and work in his life so thoroughly. Most of us have the best job we hardly live in, and the passions we really want to spend more if we even remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has been able to create amalgam of all aspects of their lives that look like it works very well and nourishes him and the people around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Revised 8-8
