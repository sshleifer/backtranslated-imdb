It was one of my favorite bands when I was a kid. The Swedish broadcaster decided to relaunch this couple of summers when I just finished my first medical school semester. I was surprised when the depth of the bodies was explained. Of course, some things are simplified, but most of it was right (although it was done 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I would recommend that all medical students soon follow it. This is a very good way to learn some basic medical words, for example. Now I'm in my 7th semester and I think I'm looking back at the series as soon as I have bought a DVD box :-)
