Full disclosure: I'm a cynic. I like my endings sad and my clothes dry. I didn't shout when Bambi's mother was shot. Will Smith's new film "Happiness" looks like a desperate claim to an Oscar. Basically, I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So, why didn't I like "10 or less?" Maybe it was double espresso I before the show. Or (more likely) perhaps it was that even the toughest film fans could use random sweetness. <br /> <br /> And it's sweet. From the moment "He" meets "Scarlet" (an event that is not far from Nora Ephron's "lovely"), the view is taken with an intimate trip with two strangers who learn to take care of where their life is. (Kindly using Phedon Papamichael's cinematic-style camera work.) <br /> <br /> The main argument about the movie is that it is too far drawn. Is the movie far removed? I do not know. You tell me. I have not yet met Adrian Brod in the market. (But not due to lack of experiment). Do I enjoy the adventure that can happen in this important event? Darn straight I do. . where most comments on "10 items or less" are incomplete. . they don't take into account that even our cynics have fantasies. Heck, sometimes it's worth the price if they allow them to live, 82 minutes at a time.
