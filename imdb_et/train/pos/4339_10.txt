This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It seems to me that the topic that the film is going to convey is very touched. One phrase that I have in mind is that "history repeats". Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they do not seem to be their parents, their spouses; people have every excuse that they will not share with their children the longest time; people always have to work hard to support the whole family, but they may just neglect the delicate feelings of their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven when their hearts are full of love for their love; nothing is more important than the blood relations that people in this world share, and one is never too late to talk to the people they know under their hearts to get a better understanding, so if life is to end one day, people should not apologize or regret because they have kept their words and there is always hope - a new life. Actors and actors are fantastic. They have perfectly understood the director's intention. The fascination of the film lies in bringing the audience into the skillful and excellent combination of tears and tears.
