"Still Crazy" is undoubtedly the greatest stone comedy of all time. It has been mistakenly compared to "This Is Spinal Tap", which he does not have. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and frankly, it is not very good, despite the fact that it is a trip to many cliff clich√©s). Unlike "touching", "Still Crazy" is populated by big actors, big songs and great human situations. You care about people who are "still crazy". It's all important. Oh, yes, the music is also pretty good, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The American audience was already familiar with Stephen Reale (The Crying Game), but only later did Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Acently, Caribbean Pirates) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter Films).
