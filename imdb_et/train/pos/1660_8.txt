I'm a fan of ART, I like art, I like paintings, sculptures, and so on. This movie shows this, so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint something from art, especially naked bodies, but she can't do it because of her strict family (father), naked at the beginning of the film, but she wanted a man for her paintings but his family does not let him paint naked men because it is moral. Even so Artemis could paint his boyfriend and his art teacher completely naked. He falls in love with his art teacher and it seems that the art teacher is in love with him so that, at the end, he sacrifices his freedom by lying. He said he raped her, but it wasn't true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but when he says he suffers a lot, because in a trial where Artemisia, his father and art teacher were, someone wanted to tell his artistic hand the truth. I think this is a great film about art and artistic love. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she works very well, I also like her performance "Lady Portrait" as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
