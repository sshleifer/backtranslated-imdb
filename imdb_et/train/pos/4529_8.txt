As is well-known among long-haired young people who are incredibly interested in Herr Graf's quiet beads, summer aristocrats want to travel to exclusive and prominent places to avoid the heat and camps of coarse people. Such bizarre trips around the world are also taking place in the "Three Year", charming and elegant old hand, namely the quiet work of Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. <br /> <br /> Of course, this German number liked the most the first segment focused on the Stone Age, as this aristocrat feels at this ancient time. favoring the second segment that occurs during the glory of Rome (it should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, ie the barbarians or the same thing, the Germans). Of course, the third segment is taking place today, but this Teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago it should qualify as a modern one. <br /> <br /> A leitmotif that moves Herr Keaton and his companions to travel and worship. Fun events for three different ages are looking for love, a very difficult topic for aristocrats who prefer to look for money and their own interests. Every time "Three Years" is shown in Schlos's Theater, it is always a pleasure to watch a funny, witty silent film (even for a serious German census), a work full of gags and gadgets, puns, pratfalls and acrobatics, visual and amazing technical tricks, absolute a quiet delicacy that fits perfectly to withstand the various, rough summer difficulties. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I have to temporarily take my vacation because this German Count has to flirt with an old German heir who doesn't look at his age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
