This is one of the best comedies ever! Writing this soap parody is brilliant and cast, just look at the cast names and understand why it is so big. If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he will (as always) do a fantastic job and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you don't see this movie, you don't have any sense of humor.
