Another reason we fight in the series is focusing on Hitler's Sudetanland and its quest, as he makes Neville Chamberlain out and starts his European conquest. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this meant that propaganda had become an informative documentary during this time, and most of the "allies' prejudices that turned out to be a historical fact. Fuhrer raises himself to his petard, where he tells his people and the world that he is saying one thing and doing another when his army moves eastward. The Czechs and the Austrians won fast, but the Poles made a heroic struggle against overwhelming odds. <br /> <br /> The difference between Hitler's military power and Chamberlain, which resembles the Munich treaty as a white flag, declaring "our peace for our time" to this day, is a lasting propaganda trait. Here, in its original context, it is even more resonant when the darkness of the World War lies in Europe, leaving the American viewer with two possibilities, freedom or slavery. In 1943, this simple truth was not circumvented and the Nazi strike made this point effective.
