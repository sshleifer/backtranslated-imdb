When I first discovered that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to understand that I've seen and loved this original. So I had more reason to look. Well, I looked. It was actually better than most TV movies. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you know yourself) and I didn't like most of the characters, Brian's. However, the film needed cheesy and annoying and jerk-like symbols to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine once more. Finally, I was delighted with Stanley and his own happy ending. If you liked the original salon by the lake or if you like horror movies without blood, I would recommend watching it.
