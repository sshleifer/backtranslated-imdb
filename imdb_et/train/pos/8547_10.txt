Many people hated this movie, but I blame two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first couple of American Pie movies. and 2 - they're trying to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> What I found was the best of all six and I love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I say it, but then what teenager comedy is? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds etc etc, all of them are incredibly predictable but still funny funny! I say it's worth watching, I love it, I find it fun. Just don't look at it when comparing it to the first one, because it's not like that. <br /> <br /> After watching Naked Mile and that, it became clear that all American Pie films were about and only about. Stiflers. What is FINE by me. <br /> <br /> See. Enjoy. Love. xD
