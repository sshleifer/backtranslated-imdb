Excellent P.O.W. the adventure that Eric Williams adapted from his book (a copy of which is part of my father's library) and inspired by real events; it can be the first one of its kind and that's why it's a lot? not only the examples of similarly rigid-top ties, such as ALBERT, R.N. (1953, which I am currently viewing), COLDITZ STORY (1955) and OHT (1959), but higher-profile publications from the other side of the Atlantic, namely STALAG 17 (1953) and GREAT ESCAPE (1963). It is quite firm: the British soldiers in the German camp are developing a brilliant escape plan, lending a sheet of Greek legend? A horse under a horse used during physical exercise and a full view of these prisoners! In fact, the film is divided into two parts: the first deals with the slow process of digging a tunnel, culminating in an escape, while the last stages represent their success outside the camp when they catch it in neutral Sweden. Typically, these British films are mostly established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and come (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) to say something about countless trusted characters (Anthony Dawson) Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell). Three leadership / escape is Genn, Steel, and Tomlinson: The first two will be together, the latter will go its own way? only for safe access. As can be expected, the narrative involves a lot of tension and excitement; like most men in the middle of P.O.W. also swords, female interest is kept the least. Director Lee did not have a long career? ALICE (1956), his most remarkable achievements, similar to this and somewhat similar (albeit both in terms of configuration and perspective) change? but in any case he milked such a thrilling situation (even though the known delay in filming saw that Lee gave up his job prematurely, leaving producer Ian Dalrymple with loose ends!). Anyway, it is worth mentioning fine lighting (especially at night time).
