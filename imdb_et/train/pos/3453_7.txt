Although this film has first-rate fine actors, special effects that are great, and a story full of surprises, it wasn't taken to distribute the studio and went straight to DVD. Maybe it contains too much "anti-police information", or maybe it is too many activities that appear during gluten, but regardless of the reason why big screens missed the opportunity, luckily there is a new concept that allows you to free DVD directly enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The theme is old: the rookie reporter opens the inner circle of the corrupted police - in this case, the FRAT (First Response Assault and Tactical) team, a group of well-trained police officers designed to clean Edison's mythical city from its low crime, drug, prostitution, etc. From place. Working involved the temptation to prove the staple of confiscated goods and money, and now, 15 years after its creation, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people, and so on. The leader dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terribly real gangster!) And his partner Rafe Deed (LL Yes, J more than usual and proving he may be a sensitive actor). Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) is trying to "bad mistake" the wind and announces his theory of fraud and corruption to his boss, Ashford (always a trusted fine Morgan Freeman). Gradually, Polack Ashford and then Wallace (Kevin Spacey, an actor who is always a subtle character) assists Pollack in reporting this investigation. The closer Pollack comes to the truth, the more surprises and bad incidents that happen, and the story goes towards unexpected results towards the log center. <br /> <br /> Timberlake has no charisma to lead, especially at such a company. experienced participants. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey, and McDermott keep the movie down to the end of a rolling oiled machine. No, it's not a great movie, but it's one that makes the seat slip with the edge of the action.
