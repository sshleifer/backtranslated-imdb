Although I like EE's "Doc" Smith's books and David A. Kyles's Lensman's books, an anime, which is widely based on books, is quite fun and somewhat innovative. <br /> <br /> Although the story may be for Sci-Fi, it seems familiar / fantasy buffs, such as a child on an isolated planet, from mysterious forces and avenges about the death of his family, but it is quite fun. Plus, Lensman was the first animated movie that used hand-drawn and CG animation at one time. Of course, it may be a bit out of date, but it is still innovative. If it wasn't for Lensman, none of this would have happened (personally, I think computer graphics will look better at animation that is actively living.) <br /> <br /> Too bad that they only released a few countries on this DVD / VCD mainly in forms that are quite different and different). I just want them to release Lensman's movie and TV series from DVD / VCD in all parts of the world, not just in certain parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worsel Rules! I think he's so amazing and clean.
