I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best "National Lampoon" movies, and it's a very memorable title that summarizes what the whole movie is talking about .... Men in White !!!! The story is a scam for many movies, including Will Smith's movie, as you would have thought, "Men in black." I don't end there, but it has a very good ending - very funny (humor by Leslie Nielsen) from start to finish, especially a bit from the beginning when there are trash bins on your street. They also have a pretty cool trash truck in this scene (garbage collection truck). It's not great, it's not really good, but it makes the movie funny, it's comedy, relax! I love the story, partly because it has been pulled so far and partly because it is interesting to see how fine (Or if it should be Un-subtle), then they cut all the other movies. I'm a very serious fan of the junk movie, but I'm also a fan of the real thing and it's hard to decide what is better, a movie that mainly hangs (mentioned earlier in this review) or the real movie, but even if you really did comedy films, it is indeed even harder, but this film is successful. The two garbage men are so funny, reminds me of an example of a television series in the UK called "Little Britain". This movie is essential for your collection and is one of the best, most fun, funniest, best events, National Lampoon movie!
