After starting Chicago I began to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then came to The Flock. So far, it's like a nice smile and a couple of stock gestures will get you, but she has proven to me that she has finally got her handicraft and can do the best. Clare Danes was also his "trainee / substitute" super. Some have suggested that there is too much unnecessary violence, but I don't see it. Nothing I saw did not reduce the power of this film. I was really shocked that I had not heard of how it was released in theaters and that Blockbuster had come across it. A truly extraordinary film that has just the right action, break, excitement and social consciousness. As good as 7even? Maybe. And you can see Gerest acting better than someone who has ever left Pitt.
