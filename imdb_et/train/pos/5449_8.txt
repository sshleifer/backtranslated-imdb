Did you know that the father of Anthony Kiedis (singer Red Hot Chili Peppers) is in this movie. Blackie Dammit, is Anthony's father. I noticed it after reading "Scar Tissue" from Anthony's autobiography and saw my father's picture. I thought, "this guy looks like this guy from the movie I saw in the eighties. Then I read more and he said his father was an actor with some small roles. After checking this site and checking this site and searching online , I realized it was his father in the movie, it's funny because somewhere in this book he doesn't mention him in the movie, maybe his son is ashamed of his father's action on this flick, but he needs I think his father, Blackie, did excellent work.
