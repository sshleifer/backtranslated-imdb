"Scoop" is still the funniest movie for Woody Allen in 2000. Although Allen was finally looking for his age, he is the lowest-eyed magician in the game of Sidney Waterman. Its one liner and behavior is fun. Don't let critics boost your opinion. "Scoop" is the upper border of "Woody-Lite" image. <br /> <br /> The classic music score is a great compliment to on-screen activities. Scarlett Johanson sees pride in this swimsuit. Jackman is in trouble. Cinematic art glows. "Scoop" is a wonderful fare from start to finish. The last shot of a movie alone is worth the price.
