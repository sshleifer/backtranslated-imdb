Cheers! A cosmic film that does not take itself too seriously and anyone can become exciting in a race that is a space camp. The film begins slowly, the usual blend of idiots and high mirrors blending into a malevolent soup. But if it gets tough - tough we get out and it's not an incredible change in the characters, because you can believe that there is a certain responsibility in their young minds. The only mistake in the movie is that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying as "I'm right and you're all wrong" instructor. I recommend it in a nice evening in the movie and 7 votes.
