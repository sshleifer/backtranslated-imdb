It's short and point. Star Trek: The story used for Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Action is all over the map, but the main characters of the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has lasted almost 7 years and ends in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to repeat what has already been said about the set and the graphics. Given that it's all voluntary, without profit, it's pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> If it were a professional production, I'd have to give it 5 good stories, but a terrible set. But as a fan-based production, I have to give him an excellent rating, because by way of exception there are some other efforts, it's his own league. For volume alone, I don't think it's matched. Congratulations to the cast and the team for their many admirable efforts.
