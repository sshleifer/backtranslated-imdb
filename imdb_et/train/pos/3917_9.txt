I saw this movie for the first time when it appeared in the US in 1984. I've seen it many times. What captures me about the film is the inclusion of the trial procedure in the characters and the visa ban. Throughout the film, intertwining and sometimes never sure if a person looks at the life or scene of the characters. It continues until the culmination of the movie. All these years later are my friends and I still love to discuss whether "Carmen" is really at the end. The reactions of other characters to the stylized murder are open for discussion. The passion for dance, the quality of the actors, the love of art and the glory of the performances create a great film that unites and transforms life and art.
