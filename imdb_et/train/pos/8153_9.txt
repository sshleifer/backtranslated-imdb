It's really a funny movie, especially the second, third, and fourth time you watch it. This is a pretty short film, and I would definitely recommend watching it more than once, you will get it the second time. <br /> <br /> It's like a spinal cord, but a rap version. There's a lot of attitude in this that can be negative in rap-affected movies, but it's just a total of ** and it's not a problem because of the irony it produces. <br /> <br /> A lot of stand-out bits, one of the kind of movies that you find familiar with your companions, and that raises laughter. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite is the "Central Guerrillas" section. Great video, great!
