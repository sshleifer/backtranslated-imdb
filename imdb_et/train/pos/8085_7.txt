One thing I can say about this movie is very long, very long! I recently bought this movie a few months ago, seeing a new version appear. I was delighted that it was done in 1978, because the 70's (though I never lived them) are actually one of my favorite decades, especially in music! When I watched this movie, the story was very good at first, but then after about 50 minutes it started to be very boring and repetitive. I'm impressed with this animation! it had never been seen before and was pretty cool to see. but the film can be honestly a little better, it could have told him a lot more and a story than just a 15-20 minute scene that was just fighting. then in 5 or 10 minutes the movie got up and got good but ended unexpectedly. I think it was extremely long. I know it for 13 minutes in 2 hours and it's still a comic, but since most of the movies were boring, it seemed like it was 4 hours long !!!! but in general it is okay what i think, and I look at one of them "do nothing" again. I see the new one and I hope it is better!
