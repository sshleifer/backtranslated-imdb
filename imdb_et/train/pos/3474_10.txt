This film is worthy of Jared Harris's outstanding depiction of John Lennon. It doesn't matter that Harris is not exactly like Lennon; his motives, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best Scene: Lennon in a local caf√©, which orally spoils the fan whether Paul McCartney & Wings "Silly Love Songs" is worth 1 in America.
