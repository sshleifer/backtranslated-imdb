This movie was great! It was a wonderful fairy tale. The animation was somewhat strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected when singing wasn't for the Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Wallpaper was magical. It was a different job for Disney people. Some characters were tiny, but it was more than the beauty of the landscape and lushness. The music was largely instrumental, but it was ideal for the film. It was definitely not a movie that would require characters to sing. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10
