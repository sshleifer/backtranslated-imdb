If you're looking for the ultimate biography of the boxer James Corbett's life, it's probably not a movie for you. The famous boxer gets his life "Hollywood" in the 1940s, making the story much more fun and interesting than real life. However, as the performances were so good (especially Errol Flynn) and the script was so pleasant, the film's decorations can be forgiven. - A man who became a boxer in the world in 1892. The film goes from his humble bases and follows his career against his winning John L. Sullivan. Although it might have focused mainly on competitions, most of the film is short (except for the final title match) and the emphasis is on Corbett's personality and his relationship with the lady played by Alexis Smith. Throughout the film, the excellent supporters of the supportive actors (such as the multi-year-old actor Flynn in the films, Alan Hale) are really supportive, and the writing really contributed to the lives of these people. <br /> <br /> It is especially nice to see Flynn as a boxer in the movie. Although some pictures are double, almost all boxing scenes are from Flynn and he did a convincing job as a pug list. It was a nice departure for Flynn, who usually played "real boy" roles or swashbucklers, and it shows just how tough his character is. For more information, try to read his biography - he was quite tough and drummer before reaching Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Now, as REAL James Corbett, read on if you're not afraid of how the movie is not accurate. First, Corbett was not a bad man who came from poor families but was a college education and bright. Second, even though he got Alexis Smith at the end of the film, they left a few years later. Thirdly, the last scene of the film about Sullivan and Corbett was probably the best part of the film, Sullivan was a jerk and it had never happened - in reality Sullivan was no more egomania and Corbett was not fat-headed guy whom they depicted in the film - though it was a beautiful film.
