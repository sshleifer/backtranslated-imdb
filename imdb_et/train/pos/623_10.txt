There is no such film that has given me the feeling that Stardust did throughout the film. Like magically a fairy tale like Princess Bride, Stardust is definitely the most amazing fantasy game of the 2000s and 1990s. Particularly interesting, fun and equipped with amazing images and unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro are particularly challenging to see this movie without a smile. In the first ten minutes of the film, you know very well how it ends, but it is a journey and not a destination that attracts the viewer from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, not a decimal, less.
