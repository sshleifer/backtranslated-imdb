Great Warner Bros.'s effort to play Errol Flynn in one of his best screen shows. This is often called his best, and I can't really fully appreciate until I've seen my "Dawn Patrol". But his work "They Died With Their Boots" takes beating. I'm a big Flynn fan (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps him in Aussie) and I think he's just a wonderful, great screen and also a great actor. He is the central part of "Gentleman Jimi" as a legendary boxer with a fictional footprint, but is also supported by a literate, warm and funny script and the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've seen has never lost its pace, he was a really born filmmaker. Walsh runs the scenes beautifully, as he does with lighter moments and its terrible, endless scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to this great product value ("Gay Nineties" never saw better!) And lovely support and it's pretty much a perfect entertainment. Alan Hale usually played Flynn's sidekick, but here's her father and it's still working. Alexis Smith is the interest of Flynn's love. The couple is in the head who love fighting with each other.
