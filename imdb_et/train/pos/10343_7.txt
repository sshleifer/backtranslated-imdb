"Amazing Mr. Williams" stands for Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His wife was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who made five films this year, three of them together! Douglas is Williams, and he and his companions are presenting the body, and they have to understand what really happened. Viewers recognize their associates - actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) always played by the authorities ... senators, bank governors, police officers. The one who has this dunn is comedy - police officers always throw themselves at each other and even Williams and his girlfriend fight orally. Some fun gags - Williams even takes with the man he was arrested with his girlfriend. There are a lot of fun things to do, so go ahead from the slow start and wait for the funniest things later. Don't want to give up a spoiler so you have to get it in classic Turner movies. Director Alexander Hall mostly made comedies and announced that he had been engaged with Lucy at some point.
