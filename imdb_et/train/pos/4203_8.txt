This is another sharp and weighty film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual about his earlier films - with some letters. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Richard Kiley in this film celebrate a group of Communist agents trying to hide America's secrets - and they don't let anything succeed. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a Peters subway ride, followed by federal agents. They know he is a link in the long espionage chain. It is not known to everyone that there is a wild card in the equation - a small train (Widmark) is also on the train and it can steal the secrets that Peters carries. Widmark thinks this is just another purse he has been talking about - he will only realize later how seriously he is stolen. Now it's Widmark itself - with Commies and FBI on the hot track. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are extraordinary and the movie grabs from start to finish. Although he didn't get the best score, special attention should be paid to Thelma Ritter. This supportive actor apparently had a lifetime presentation as a dove in the stool. It failed to give him a lot of opportunity to act and I was impressed that his ability to play a split and sad old lady. - but with one small exception. At first I loved how Widmark and Peters interacted. This is one of the few cinemas where you can see a smiley square in your mouth! Now it's tough. Later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close - too close to be credible. However, there is so much great drama and such an effective film like Noir that you can ignore it. Watch this movie.
