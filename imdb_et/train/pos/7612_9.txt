OK I was honest when I first saw the trailer of the program, I thought it was an advertisement for some sunscreen product. Everybody goes around the beach. Nevertheless, I decided to look at it, thinking it would be a new show that I could laugh at. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> <br /> In the first 10 seconds of the program, I was hooked on why he was lying on a tree, why an airplane crash, and so on. <br /> <br /> It is not everyday that an exhibition comes together that combines intelligence, humor, action and intercourse. But "lost" manages it all. With great cast and teamwork, beautiful spots, and pretty decent special effects, "lost" anyone who is listening to stories will try to see anyone who is sick of cheese refreshments and the devil's reality TV. <br /> <br /> Lost on Tuesdays at 10am on Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
