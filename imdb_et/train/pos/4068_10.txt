breathtakingly, this is undoubtedly the best anime movie ever made. I saw the castle for the first time in the late 80s and left a lasting impression. I went for years and I forgot the title of the movie, and only by accidentally browsing the Internet did I find this masterpiece again. after reading the reviews and analysis of other peoples, I am not surprised that he has such recognition and so much touching that it gives the impression. A real fantasy adventure must be seen by all children and adults. the best thing about this is not to tell me that this movie is a clear and open mind. if you have children treat them this promise that they will love it. there is not much to say about this artwork, but if you haven't seen it, look at it and have fun.
