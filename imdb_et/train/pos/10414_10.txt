For the first time in the early 1950s, I discovered the fantasy of Alexander Korda (1940), the BAGDAD SHORT, which was presented in turn as "The Wonderful Exhibition of the Century!". Miklos Rozsa's music improved both films. Every Technicolor was very beautiful! BAGDAD'S ACTIVITIES have remained on my list as the best fantasy movie ever made. Over the years, the color of the film became more complicated in the way it was originally presented. True Technicolor gave the Eastman color process in the mid-1950s. Both Cinema and Samuel Goldwyn published the film both in theater and video. But Eastman Color prints were naturally pastel and suppressed the original Technicolor's vividness. The laser disc of this title is also pastel - nice, but not as it should be. Now the M-G-M DVD arrives (December 3, 2002). BAGDAD'S SHORT-TERM is again a great Technicolor, which looks like a DVD that is nothing STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to see it again after watching the DVDs for the second time. The only "extras" is the Spanish version, both subtitles in English and Spanish, and a beautifully made original trailer. Thank you M-G-M for releasing this exclusive DVD. Now you can count on FOUR FEATHERS and REPEAT JUNGLE BOOK (reused for bad bad printouts) in the near future.
