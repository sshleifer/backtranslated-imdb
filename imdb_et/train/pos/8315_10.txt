The standard rises to a hearing aid with some high points. The first, Lonette McKee, as a sister who gives a stunning star. The fact that he never became a great acquaintance after that is next to me. Unfortunately, he is supportive and we are forced to focus on the wonderful character of Irena Carter, Sparkle, whose rise to fame is simple, boring and convincing. However, when girls enter the stage and perform, the film comes to life. Curis Mayfield's original music must be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The quality of the picture was quite low and the production results I think. All in all, it's worth deaf.
