I never saw it on television, but I rented a DVD via Netflix as soon as I discovered it was available. I had great expectations and was not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is great. The level of quality that I would have expected only from feature films, I am surprised at some of the bad comments about it. Maybe the DVD version had an improved animation? One bonus on a DVD is that both versions of the pilot were fun to see. I am an adult and I really appreciate that this is for adults. Not only do children love cute animated characters. It's not nearly "dirty", as some have said, but I see some parents don't want their toddlers to see it. I'm very disappointed that it was canceled. I want them to produce more episodes. Or film.
