Recently, I searched for a recently released FLY AWAY HOME Widescreen DVD and came up with an interesting title I've never heard of: GRAY OWL. It was Richard Attenborough's film that attracted my attention (he was responsible for fine films such as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the scenario was made by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "special edition" was full of interesting material and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I forced it and bought it. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan stars like Archie Gray Owl, real life trapped in the 1930s, who came to love and respect the natural lands of Canada and worked to protect them. Brosnan (who played in James Bond's film) gives a shady, warm and vigorous result, such as Annie Galipeau as a young woman who loves and influences her feelings for earthly beings, especially the beaver. The beautiful photo by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and Roger Pratt is a great result for the film's effectiveness. And the additions to this DVD are something else! Contains two short short seals made in the 1930s with the actual Gray Owl, as well as the commentary tracks of Attenborough and producer Jake Ebert; 2 full-length; and many other fine additions to PLUS options for those who have access to a computer with DVD-ROM functionality. GRAY OWL has been released directly to DVD in the United States - the fact that Richard Attenborough attributes something to Hollywood's lack of interest that is not burdened with much violence and sex. This is a movie that not only does not know and entertain, but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling in the movies - and a whole new love and understanding of the beasts! GRAY OWL is a very good movie - it's worth a look! This is one that I expect to share with others.
