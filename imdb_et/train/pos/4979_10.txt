This is the second Baby Burlesque short to be released, and probably the most popular, is the silent movie "What a Glory" of 1926. <br /> <br /> I watched it and I did not understand the child porn it was seeking. It's just a cute little movie. I've seen the family show that I grew up in the 80s and 90s that they had little girls who were more provocatively dressed in a "mature way". It was more provocative because they were dressed in diapers. There is nothing provocative about diapers if you don't have one of these fetishes. (just joking) I read this film description and where he says that only the pedophile enjoys watching it. It's sick. For me, if you look at it and bother him, you may have to look at your psyche and try to find out why it is bothering you. This is an innocent film that was made into a parody of another movie. All B.B. the movies were parodies, nothing more. Today's parodies / spoofs are graphic in nature and have real almost pornographic scenes and a pretty vile language. Shouldn't they be more horrible? I can look at those who don't have the problem, but they sometimes take children 's stories and turn them into parodies to defile. It should get under the skin. Not that they adopted an adult film from 1926 (not the word, I know) because we know how these silent films were PORNOGRAPHY? Not to mention those "forbidden Hollywood pre-code films" that are both dirty and dirty. They never do such a mess today? (mark sarcasm)
