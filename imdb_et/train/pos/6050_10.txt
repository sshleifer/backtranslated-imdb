Finally! A decent British comedy that does not focus on some of the bankruptcy robbers or has been cut off from the TV series. John Ivay's film is a psychoactive story of discovery, dressed in a biker movement. These three main characters are delicate fools who have a tendency to fail and everyone in their lives at a turning point, giving the trio of sensitive and emotional subtleties to sew delicate comedies. There is a sense of chemistry between the three amigos, and this makes it a fun dialogue with a reflective companion and some classic moments of comedy. It seems that part Withnail and I, part of the American werewolf is in London and part of Quadraphenia (but only thanks to the bicycle gangs and Phil Daniels). In fact, Phil Daniels' lovable scammer resembles a dealer in Danny Withnail and his scientific approach to drugs. This is an excellent film, especially for those who have been involved in psychoactive substances in the past, who are involved in the film. A personal favorite is the brilliant scene of the Welsh Corner Center, where you buy munchies when they get into laptops. This gentle comedy warms your hearts and you laugh out loud. And you don't have to ride bikes or even like them. But it adds when you do. Brilliant.
