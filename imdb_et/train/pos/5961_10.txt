I can be biased, I'm the author of the novel The Hungry Bachelors Club, published in 1994. The scenario was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor teacher Fred Dresch, who was inspired by Marlon. I was not happy with the trailer, I hope to see the movie as a whole and I will comment further. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, is my character. He carries most of the emotional vehicles in fine form. I couldn't do better! It looks like real people, hardly misrepresented and fortunately leads my statement against racial prejudice at home, gracefully and heartily.
