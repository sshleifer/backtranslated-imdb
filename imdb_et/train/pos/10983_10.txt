"Gray Gardens" (1975) is Maysles brothers who are a strange documentary about Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis' central aunt and the first cousin living like pigs in East Hampton, Long Island. "Big Edie" Bouvier Beale, 78, witty and dry, and her daughter, "Little Edie" Beale, 56 (emotionally about 13), still a beautiful woman who had a promising future, lives apart from the rest of the world washers in the attic. They entertain themselves all day by beating, listening to the radio or singing each other (they don't even have a TV) Their fall from society is amazing to learn and the viewer is learning these two very special, though obviously dysfunctional,. is still a cult classic.
