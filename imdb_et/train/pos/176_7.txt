Keep the spoilers. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were two of the best. Okay, so an alien boy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with his clothes was funny. This boy's boss was also good. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have much more time on the screen. They're chemistry great. Bathroom scene WOW! Romantic, sweet, yummy. Hawn is a silly cocktail offer that saves a foreign man and ends up in the middle of a white house in the middle of a plot thanks to the greed of politicians. Talking about Sarandon would do much to give up. SPOILERS This is a rather atypical romantic / political comedy that satisfies somewhat more political than much romantic. It concerns political issues and simply plagues the romantic regions. <br /> <br />
