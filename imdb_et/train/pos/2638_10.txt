One of the best movies of all ages. You will never be able to look again at LION KING without thinking about the extra history of this movie. Almost 40 years old, I watched it with my wife and two sons after working today and I didn't laugh and enjoyed the movie for so long. <br /> <br /> Take your time and watch it with the kids. It reminds you how Disney used to be when you were young.
