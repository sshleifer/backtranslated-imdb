I rented this movie from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood I thought it would be a foolish 50s sci-fi-asco and it's the first full-length Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I discovered myself thoroughly and very pleasantly. <br /> <br /> The experimental oil well has penetrated the earth for about six miles and has been closed by the sponsor. Lois and Clark show that they are getting a scoop, but are disappointed that the deepest drill is no longer working. A day later, the strange events are good for Superman to be more than Clark Kent. It seems that the radioactive Mole Men has penetrated its six miles deep from home to the ground. <br /> <br /> Supermen and Mole Men are a simplified but well-made piece of social realism. In 1951, a major shareholder who served in World War II, it seems to be moral that Americans are as capable of becoming fascists as anyone else. To get this point home from the usual simple Superman, Reeves even accuses the gang of hunters being "Nazis" at one point. </p> none. A six-mile drilling through the continental shells would not have even penetrated the upper casing, let alone a 'hollow ground' - which in any case does not exist. Forgotten - remember that this movie is based on the golden age comic book. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit uneven. Although Molemen is interesting, with a bit of a horrible and nice image, there are a number of Corman scenes that spend too much time showing us our strange behavior. The script is smart and economical. According to today's standards, the costume is fair, but during this time the special effects and costumes of this film were quite good. Cinematography is also generally very good and the actor is much better than expected. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
