If I could go back, even as an adult, and live in my summer camp days ... I would be there so quickly. The camps I went to were not even great. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes were actually taken away, but we had horses and fishing. The film's cinematography was amazing, the characters funny and believing, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raim's character and sub-antics were invaluable. So who ever thought this movie was flat ... I'm very sorry because they can't stop their beliefs long enough to portray the camp as an adult again, or they're never children. The whole point was that these people had the opportunity to revive and become minors, and so they did all they could. I wish I could. It was funny, intelligent, beautifully written, brilliantly cast, and artistry takes me back so I just want to look it over for the landscape. Sorta like dances with wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies, but in the wilderness the character becomes as much as the actors. Rent it, watch it, buy it and watch it over and over ... never get old. ; 0)
