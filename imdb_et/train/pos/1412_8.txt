Why do you need to study the earthly documentary "Earth"? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain it to you? OK, I do not extend my review of the study on "Earth" to infinity, but I have to stand on the ground because it is "must see". The documentary carries the nature back and forth on three animal families on migratory routes: the female polar bear and her boys, along with their father's real subdivision, dare to walk around to separate food on their isolated path, which is the mother of whales. his baby whale, who kidnaps the kidnapping of a predator, and the elephant's mother, with small (or not so small, elephants) offspring who migrate to Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield also worked out of the ground to record the survival skills of many other animal species beyond the magnetic field of the main characters of our three animal families. Richard Brooks's cinematically qualified team of Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were in the camera of animal-inspiring nature objects and animal instinctive behavior; not to mention that the prey of the slo-mo animals was shining. "Earth" is also a lesson for the learner about the effects of global warming on animals; Papa's polar bear is the result of the poster's boyfriend. So fellow citizens, it's time to make a documentary trip to visit today "Earth"! **** Good
