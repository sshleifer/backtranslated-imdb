Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports poor people in his country can be respected in the US with such low respect. His worst "sin", in my opinion, is caring for those who are in the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad? I've always been interested in the US government + media reaction to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good boy (about 1959) when he went to Batista. Soon Castro companies in Cuba began to change instead of poor cats instead of poor cats. We are a decent country, but why is our media and government having such a problem of poverty sharing? If these men are "dictators," we could use more "dictatorships", especially if the poor live in the world.
