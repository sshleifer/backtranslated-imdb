I don't remember many details about the show, but I remember how passionate I was about it and how I decided not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately, there was no video recorder at this time so I haven't seen this series yet. But I remember strongly how I felt when I looked at it and how excited I was every time it came. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors for the day, mainly because of his appearance in the series. I would love to buy / steal / download this series, I think I'd go a long way to see it again and have long gone childhood ... Any ideas? Does anyone know of a series dedicated to the series or episodes on the tape of their first incitement?
