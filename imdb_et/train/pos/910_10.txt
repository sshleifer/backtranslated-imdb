It's nice to see that Suraj Barjatya is back what he's best. A story surrounded by marriage. It's nice to have a movie that doesn't have any scene that you shouldn't look at with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new elements, it is still a film, a presentation, a performance, and actually a whole treatment. Hats off at Suraj. The film says that engagement brings love. Imagining changes in the way you think when you do is great. The director has definitely given it a lot of thinking and the actors have done it perfectly. Though the film is slow, you don't mind it because you get so much of the story you want to continue with this recent joy. involved couple. As a typical RajShree stuff, it has many sentimental scenes that are likely to make the viewer tear (especially ladies). But when you come out of the cinema hall, you are very pleased and feel that the ticket was worth :-).
