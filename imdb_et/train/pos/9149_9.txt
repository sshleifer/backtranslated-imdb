I've never seen Richard Thomas playing bad. I wasn't sure I'd like it that way. And I wasn't sure he could pull it out. But it amazed me. He sent a shadow to my back and made me look at the street people. The film is tempting and fast paced. Bruce Davison is convincing, but everything he can really play is a nice guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The end was a bit clumsy, but maybe it is a fight for real people ... If you are a fan of Thomas, you must see him here with his best fish!
