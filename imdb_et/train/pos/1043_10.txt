Since I remember and I'm only 18 mothers and I've been watching older movies because I think they are much more satisfying in the long run (but can't get me wrong when I love the movies we have today just not as much as I love 40- and 50-year-old movies) Anyway, now I have to say when I started watching the movie, my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course my favorite character was grandmother playing Lucile Watson. But I loved how Betty Davis and his family were depicted. Children ... did not act as small as children. But there is a good reason for this, mostly by hiding and running their lives, seeing the terrible things children saw by destroying their innocence. So people say "oooo i hated how the kids did ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know they saw what the kids don't see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... dear Paul did an amazing job !!! Now I know that many people are mad about going to the Oscar and Bogie was not, but hey they both did amazing jobs, so I think it could have been that way. But Lukas's performance was so amazing that at the end of the film I was teared down. I loved this movie so much and wish it to anyone !! :-D
