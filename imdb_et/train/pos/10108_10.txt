Absolute Classic !! The direction is flawless, the actor is just great. Words are not suitable for this great work. The most final film about the Mumbai police. This film has been a test of time. <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a star, Smita Pat has no less. All the actors have done their best and film competitions at all moments. This film shakes your whole character badly and forces you to think about many of our societal issues. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a police officer (Om Puri) who starts his career honestly but eventually degenerates into a killer. The first attempt in Bollywood behind the scenes and revealing the revealing truth to the Mumbai police. Kudos Nihalani! <br /> <br /> After this film, released Bollywood films appeared, discovering the link between a criminal politician and the police. So this movie was indeed a trend monitor. This trend dominated the Hindi film scene for more than ten years. <br /> <br /> This movie was hit by a moderate mailbox. <br /> <br /> Necessary viewing for movie fans.
