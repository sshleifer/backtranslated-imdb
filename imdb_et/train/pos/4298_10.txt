This movie scared me so much that I look at it at least once a year. Sometimes it's uncomfortable. Sometimes I find this to be leverage. And I always find those characters who are human and real. It is a film that shows you LA's living reality, starting with the search lights of repetitive helicopters that scan the threats that are so close to the normal life the characters are doing. It is also a movie that shows you how a stranger can change your life and give you the opportunity to change. The Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether planned or not, has a strong impact. I found this film in many ways similar to the short films of Robert Altman's short films. Both had a full list of perfectly cast actresses and actors, and both movies allowed you to gradually see how these characters interact and interact with each other. The Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a unified message (hope of desperate reality) than the Altman movie, although I found both of them intriguing in their own way. This movie is sure must see !!!
