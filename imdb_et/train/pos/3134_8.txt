It was a well-written story about Batman's Sitcom making and, in fact, our heroes are joining with great ambition and offering their TV shows. Unlike the Brady and Partridge family documentaries, we look at not only Adam's and Burt's past and present lives, but also see them again. Batman, full of Kapow and Roommates and Riddler (s), has said well that the story not only provides a satisfactory result to the Batman series, but also fulfills all the Hollywood stories that have been heard about them for 35 years. <br /> <br /> Tissues !!!
