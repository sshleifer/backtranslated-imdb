A good film with strong performances (especially two leaders). The film is about two American girls caught with 6 kilos of heroin at Thai airport. They are both thrown into prison and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer trying to get them out. All they have to do is find Nick Parks who put drugs into one of two girls' bags. So far this is a story that is not so original (it has many similarities to a better return to Paradise). <br /> <br /> Actress and Newton's Thomas Sigeli's beautiful photography makes this movie worth watching. 7 out of ten.
