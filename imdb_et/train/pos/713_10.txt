this movie is fantastic. in some sense. It really says a lot or does a lot, but it's a fantastic movie to watch because it's stupid. High School takes over the evil ms.togar, which hates one thing that all students love, rock & roll. Reef Random Get all the tickets in Ramones show, and this movie peaks along with take over the school led to my reef wrist & ramones. this movie has everything, a bad script, questionable routing, bad actors (ie clint howard and pj soles), a fantastic soundtrack, extreme campyness, these elements and many more come together to do that, classic. > <br /> Note - During live ramoons, note that the bacterial workflow is on the front of the crowd. pure-o.
