It's one irresistible big cheerful and technically very big movie! <br /> <br /> The film has some of the biggest searchable kits you can see in the 30's, though it's too clear they're in real places. Often, if the symbol falls or shakes the door in the mailbox too aggressively, the whole set will probably move. This shows that René Clair's true heart was in making a silent movie. Overall humor is very good in this movie. Of course, musical moments were more than big. It is a truly enjoyable lightweight and simple pleasant early French music. Although the best moments are quiet moments, this does not mean that the film is not filled with a great humorous dialogue, which the main actors get very well, all of whom seemed to me to be participants in the stage, which in this case worked very well for the film in an atmosphere of general style and pleasurable concerns. . No wonder it is so well developed, because this film is actually based on the stage by Georges Berri. <br /> <br /> This is a technically gorgeous movie that also has some great innovation cameras and some really great edits that will give you some quick and enjoyable views of enjoyable sequences. There's never a dull moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> René Clair was such a smart director who knew how to create comic moments in movies. This is a very creative film that, despite its simplicity, still looks like a completely original and cleverly designed film that never takes entertainment. <br /> <br /> Over the past half hour, it has been an unforgettable experience, without too much damage, and it is indeed the time of the earliest comedy films, the most creative moments. and they were probably cast because of their appearance. All of this adds a pleasant light comic atmosphere and brightness to the film. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
