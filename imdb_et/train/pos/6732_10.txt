It was the best documentary I've ever seen! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta and I was surprised and happy that it was one of his films. Great work for Stacy! I was back at work last week, bored O * & ^% less and this movie came. In the 1980s, Orange County grew up and down on the local beaches, and so did my father as a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I took the surf, the boogeyboarded went on from there. This movie is just exciting for me. It was five before my time, but it was fantastic to see what these men went through .. TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is the object of the collection.
