This movie pulled me up as it wakes up in this bravely different movie's main male life dream. <br /> <br /> This man, John (Ben Chaplin), takes a small secure English bank to his mid-life secure banknote, until the amazingly proud, wild, girl-die-for-Nadia (Nicole Kidman) girl from Russia ordered by email to his life to get his beloved wife Johns plan. However, the disorder will rise - Nadia will not speak John. Although John is outwardly calm and unfamiliar, he is so keen on Nadia that instead of using a full refund policy for a suitable service, she buys her vocabulary to start a communication process. <br /> <br /> What Happens In The Ground The poor Johann pulls a genuinely charged secure sense of slumber into a poor John character with a decent mind, giving the viewer an unconscious message "you would have behaved". <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz are doing an excellent team of Russians and they are almost distinguishable from the real, "almost" only due to the small accents that are in their Russian dialogues, but small enough to astound the hard work of their mother tongue. that the words are correct. Nicole Kidman proves her talent again, playing a completely different character from the previous role, at least from a cultural background. <br /> <br /> The movie's pace is fast and enchanting, and you are definitely not ready to stop watching when the end titles appear, rather you are in the middle of the line, leaving the desire to see it as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go and get this movie right now and watch it and enjoy it. To sum up, it has an unusual plot, a great deal of action and an idea under the surface. Like the idea that the "silly awakening" from the roll-up of a secure secure routine in a social machine is the life that the fighting club members wanted to give up, and the machine that Pink Floyd sings ("Welcome to the machine!"). I bet John was finally out of sight with Sophia when he never met. <br /> <br /> Thank you, writers, for a great story and all the others for a great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can set it up and name it wherever you are, because the authenticity of a place is not significant for 99.9999 percent of potential viewers, I'm sure.
