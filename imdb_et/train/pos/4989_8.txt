It's very dated, but it's part of this 1933 movie. The same can be said for most pre-codes; they are just different and usually interesting. <br /> <br /> It was a short driving time, Spencer Tracy's wonderful actor and Loretta Young's character's beautiful face and sweetness that kept me watching and enjoying this stagy-but-intriguing film. <br /> <br /> You would be hard to find a more beautiful girl than "Trinna" played by a 20-year-old who had already made her 50th film! (She started to act as a small child. And the fact that they made the movies quickly in the old days.) The camera, although it was soft with the whole film, increased Loretta's face and eyes several times and I was fond of her beauty. <br /> <br /> Playing a cynical person with a cynical outlook on life, Tracy's "Bill" slowly became a loving person thanks to Trinn. Spencer gave his lines here so naturally that you barely knew he was acting. <br /> <br /> Although they have small roles, actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl, and Glenda Farrell support long-lasting impressions after a 75-minute movie. I was especially fascinated by Connolly's role as a camp minister / father figure. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit far away, but hey - it's a movie. This story is about two lonely victims of the Great Depression, who are trying to survive in the "Hooverwire" type camp and this is a very touching story.
