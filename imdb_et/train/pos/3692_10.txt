I watched this movie a few days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. It was my last night in the French capital and the best good thing I could have chosen. These twenty episodes made me imitate the impressions I had in Paris in a warm-hearted way, without the chip or sentimental schmalt. Each episode is full of surprises, strong emotions and desirable pictures, and each short film is directed according to the rules of a short story. For me, such a movie needs a lot more talent and director and storyboard writer than any epic two-hour drama and they all succeeded perfectly in their tasks! The stories were carefully selected with regard to their suitable Arrondissement and were perfectly expressed. Each episode was seen differently from the ankles, a different theme, a different style, and another twenty stories being a harmonious orchestra of films. In my opinion, the most notable advantage of the episode movie concept is that you can exchange many different feelings and moods without the risk of overloading, on the contrary: the melancholy of sadness, the pure joy of melancholy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion that gives this film a unique freshness and harmony. And not to forget the whole topic of love! Love between characters, characters and Paris, as well as the love of directors and actors / actors for this project. I don't want to get into the details of episodes because there are so many, but I have to highlight the world's most famous actors and actors from around the world and their approach to this project. Some played their picture, some broke it completely, and some interpreted the stereotypes associated with their homeland or the roles they used to play, so that intertextuality was given through the film. All in all, I can absolutely recommend this great collage and look forward to publishing it on DVD.
