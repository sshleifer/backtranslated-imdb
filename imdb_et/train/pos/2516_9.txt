On the basis of Gackt's idea, Moon Child was in Mallepa, a country suffering from poverty. The futuristic timeline was followed by the story of two major characters, Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt), and their friends. <br /> <br /> Despite some action, it may be too much or perhaps humorous, I firmly believed that this is a film of friendship. Even among all the difficulties between nature, they all wanted them to have someone to find their friends. <br /> <br /> Unlike most vampire characters, Kei was a vampire looking at the idea of ​​living. Vampire found a young boyfriend of friendship, Sho, who is not afraid of Kei. Regardless of what some thought, I see Kei as Sho's father's face. Kei was there all over Sho's past life, he took care of him and taught him to live in a world where the rivership control their lives. On the other hand, Sho, who may be a young man with an innocent enthusiastic style, grew up as a man who realized that life is not all the fun and games that death exists and can take its loved ones <br /> <br /> the part where Lee Hom, who played the Son, first appeared on the screen. The way they met was pretty cool. The son also plays a big part in this film, the fact that he has made quite a lot of friendship in the film from different races of Taiwanese citizens. The way in which friendships were developed despite the background differences is perfectly portrayed in this film. <br /> <br /> I believed that every actor did a great job because it was their first time on such a big screen. Both HYDE and Gackt were able to operate quite well and produced quite incredible signs. Unlike movies where the musician was filled with actors and songs, they have made great shows! Moon Child really influenced me, it has given friendship a new meaning and a way of thinking that we must appreciate every friendship in our lives. There is a lot of hope in the film, despite all the bad things that happen in their lives that there is always hope. Life can be cruel, it seems that hope no longer exists. It also shows a very strong friendship with each other, even when the Son became an enemy, Shol was a joke in his last battle. Finally, each of them wanted peace, no matter how far they have changed. The end of the scene showed it to us.
