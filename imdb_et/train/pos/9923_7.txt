I read several mixed descriptions and several of them caught the movie directly. Originally interested in this project, it was led by Tony Scott and I am very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a big impact on me. Before I begin my review, let me first say this ... it is wonderful to see that this movie could have been boring and ordinary, but writers and Scott chose a different approach. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> Simply put, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies provide "tried and true" plots that they know they connect people, often making a movie and increasing the likelihood of profit. This plot was one of the most interesting things I could see for a while. I just watched I recently looked at "men" and "war for Lord" and when I say these movies are great, and I enjoyed them both enormously, both films are boring in these films and they are told exactly how you think they are told . They do not take any chances and they are extremely predictable after watching a fair amount of American films. The Domino graph is so interesting and spoken in a way that keeps you thinking, "Oh man, they're now screwed". And I feel it has been missing in many recent films. I think it has a lot of depth and it gives you a lot of questions while watching. In general, it is so interesting to me about the film. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt that the characters were accurate. Knightley did a great job of depicting a beautiful woman who was nothing but inside and wanted her to be seen as she was. It was obvious that he wanted to prove himself and he took all the tools he had to do. <br /> <br /> Choco was also a very plausible, Spanish-speaking use of inappropriate situations, his reaction to Domino's absence, as well as his jealousy problems in the team ... they were all real to me that made me feel like his character was so more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it was still true for me. He seemed like an ordinary man who was trying to make ends meet. I hope that what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with him, because I got out of it. He did a very good job of showing Ed in the middle Joe, who has made his mistakes but tries to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe they offered a much needed heart story. They were not just the people who get the money to buy Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem and they were looking for others to achieve that goal. You could feel them with empathy because for them the illness of this child was another problem. These characters had to show real people who were less fortunate to get confused because they needed help. <br /> <br /> Mobstrid: They made the story much more sinful than just the mob. And I really liked this part. They also cushioned the story with small complexities that made the plot much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 Boys: <br /> <br /> They gave comic relief to a very serious movie. Walken's uncomfortable statements to ceaseless references to the 90210 boy who has been a bee. Their participation in the film made it much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... cinematography. Here it seems that this movie has lost many potential fans. But in my opinion, I thought it was a genius, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was, in my opinion, very effective. I thought it was a method that was properly realized, but can always use improvements like anything else. I congratulate and congratulate Scott, editor, operator and director on the real possibilities of this film. Not only did they go far and wide with the presentation, they went further. The use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark, gave the film a "look" to the evil and grunga look that accurately depicts mob, life hunting and less fortunate life in a way that shows that their life isn't like peachy or "clean" like everything others. If you notice less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks at all. This shows that Scott and his team tried to do something with this look and they didn't do it just for that. I understand that most of the people who watched this movie did not expect it, and this causes many movies to turn off this movie, but I think it was great that Scott took this approach. Hollywood movies have grown predictable and blissful. Most of them are made in the same way with the same twists. And I'm glad Scott tried to do something else. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone, but to say it is a trash and has nothing to offer, it is completely inadequate. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and I'm glad that I spent money on it. I would recommend it to everyone, but I'm sure it will only hit a few chords. I have to agree with the previous poster when he said that many of those who refuse outside the MTV sphere do not know the movie, but I think many people do it. We should all try it because Scott and co. took some opportunities and tried to offer something different and unique. With that in mind, I think he succeeded tremendously.
