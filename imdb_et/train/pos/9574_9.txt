It must be one of the best movies to come out of HK for a long time, I was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just by looking at the title. This exhibition has many fantastic actors and I was particularly impressed by Sam Lee's incredibly incredible crazy behavior and Edison's imagination of a killer machine that completely reversed its normal idol image. I would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and functional packed film. But I have to warn you, this is also an equally depressing film, because the character of each movie is stuck somehow and struggles on its own and makes breathing more difficult. Makes to think what life really is.
