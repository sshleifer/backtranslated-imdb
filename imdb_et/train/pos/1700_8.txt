I loved this movie. You have to respect the medieval dressed as tiny Martians. Of course, this story is occasionally thin, but you can't do it. I watched it over and over when I was 8th in her childhood, and besides, it has ever had the biggest bids. Blanzee's "Home on the Range" transfer is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Well done when you ask me, 8.
