I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was great and he had a good plot. Max (Jessica Alba) escaped from X-5, manticore, trying to adapt to normal life but still "saving the world". And hunt for the whole season, which gives the series some extra spice. <br /> <br /> The second season suddenly got a bit strange compared to the first one. The plot disappeared and the series lost some of its charm, mostly because of all the strange creatures. Don't get me wrong, the second season is good, but a little "mantis". At the same time, they managed to return to a new promising plot during the closing episodes of season 2, where I had a lot of hope to see. <br /> <br /> So I really want them to start new episodes. And behind James Cameron, it can't go wrong. To sum up, this is a great series, but I hope for the third season!
