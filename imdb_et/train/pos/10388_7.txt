I'm a big fan of the Dukes of the Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this flick. I liked much more than I did with other summer blockers. <br /> <br /> This is a funny hearing for people who kidnap this movie with excuses like "flat plot" and "it's a lot of cruder than show." Does everyone remember the depth of humor in a pilot episode? Daisy makes fun of the incest, and Bo says Luke was probably hired by half of the children in the orphanage. The only reason it was cleaned up is that it changed earlier and earlier. <br /> <br /> And when the plot goes. It was the perfect duke's plot. In fact, it is likely to be more realistic to the source material than any TV show that has traveled to the big screen. <br /> <br /> Although Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not exactly like their small screen versions, they do a good job and work very well. However, I was not against Burt's Boss Hogg. And I would have a little more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the film, Roscoe is a little ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who didn't have a smile on his face when General Lee runs through Atlanta's streets and Hazzard's rear roads? <br /> <br /> People, let's enjoy a movie that's just an excuse for nostalgia, bikini, and motoring, you won't excuse me. It's just a very stupid movie!
