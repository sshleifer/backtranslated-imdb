Since I'm not a fan of almost every post, "Desperate Living" John Waters films, I warmed up "Pecker". After he had left the underground, Waters produced his own version of the trash bin ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray), which fans looked and tasted like a soaked liqueur. "Pecker" he doesn't try to get back on premature progress, is a light, silent, modest comment on celebrity and artistic claims, because the waters know this thing clearly because he has also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most amateur pop art never created that you could not imagine anyone being able to give up if it wasn't taken under the name of Waters. Edward Furlong is good because the "Pecker" and Waters' hysterical style is content with the subject.
