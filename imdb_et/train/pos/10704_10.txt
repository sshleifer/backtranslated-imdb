Are you a giraffe? ... ask John for Nadia, and he replies well: yes. In this way, start communicating between a man and a woman who do not know each other and at the same time have questions and doubts about "birthday girl". The movie I heard a lot, but I dare not see ... up to two hours to write it. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is a passionate film that makes me fall at the same time that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actors (besides she's beautiful and intelligent) I've ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is a story about a lonely and routine man looking for a woman on the Internet. The woman she finds is from Russia. She seems to be this delicate woman, normal, no more. One day his cousin and his friend suddenly arrive on his birthday. The man starts to discover certain things. Since then, he has no intention of being a lonely and routine person who has always been. <br /> <br /> Much of us think this movie is just plain, with a piece of land. Many of us think that action and excitement are certain and not novel. But the "birthday girl" is just the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and an unimaginable plot I have never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with a funny touch is a great natural film with many such films. "Birthday Girl" has a certain beauty and thickness in her scenes, but at the same time it has a certain touching nature and makes it so deeper. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but in the end it is completely satisfactory. And I'm not sorry to say it's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * We apologize for the errors ... well if there is.
