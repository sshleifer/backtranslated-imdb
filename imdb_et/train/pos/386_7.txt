Tsui Hark's visual art is in the form of this film. Unfortunately, the terrible action of Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the penetration to look at it, it is so bad) is hard to look at at times. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I saw it for the first time, my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought I had never seen anything like it, but it is that it should be done to make full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical kung-fu novels! Undoubtedly, it is one of the most outstanding Chinese historical kung-fu epic. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, Tsui Hark hasn't been much improved in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are rather minor (his obvious obsession with the foolish and too long images of the evil boys doesn't help either). To make it worse, this film is very badly cast. They decided to use "hot" popular Hong Kong idols as leading figures, but unfortunately, both Ekin Cheng and Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuitable for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobles and mystics that such characters should contain. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are endlessly better. <br /> <br /> I wish that one day Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark could join forces and produce a film with Tsui's visual art, but Zhangi's poetry and story-telling ...
