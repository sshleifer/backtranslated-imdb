A wonderful and delightful drama of the notorious Russian serum killer Andrea Chikatilo hunting. The Russian government, especially the old members of the Communist Party, who want to maintain a closed society, is an excellent presentation of the forensic investigation by Stephen Rea. /> The film has the main theme of the fall of the communist society, and progress in the killing of the killer is reflected in the progress made in Russia's social and political transformation, which has been subdued. There is a conflict between the old and the new ways represented by the two positions of the ruler of the Rea (played by Donald Sutherland) and the Rea himself. They are initially polarized, Sutherland is looking down, and Row 'low' on the ground, looking up. But do they have a common cause? Throughout the film, the relationship between the two is evolving, and the tension is gradually eased until the film Rea and Sutherland and Row and Sutherland are intercepted, the killer is caught and Glasnost symbolically comes. Great script. <br /> <br /> Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is great and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as a killer we despise, but can't hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is convincing as a humble psychologist who threatens his reputation .
