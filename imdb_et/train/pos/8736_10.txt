You'll be amazed at the incredibly complicated computer animation and the novelty will probably not disappear in the first, second, or third viewing, but you will pull in such simple but intriguing characters. in fact, I take care of them unexpectedly, which may or may not be a bit childish on average. <br /> <br /> Disney continues firmly titled "The Biggest Animation in the World" with "Void? Life", one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative extras that are the "excerpts" at the end of the movie. The DVD has two sets of extracts where, as I said, the VHS cartridge has one alternating version. The DVD also features "Gerry? S Game", a delightful little PIXAR short, which was also shown before the movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which is fairly good, but there is nothing about animation and story development and characters. When you look at the star voting for both movies, "Antz" is mostly cast with a big name called "movie" with some familiar "TV" star sounds, where "Bug? Life" is just the opposite, loaded "TV stars with Kevin Spacey as the only one" but the difference in quality is clear and obvious. <br /> <br /> But dreams cannot be blamed or surprised if you have to head off with Disney, you have cut off your work for you. want me to have kids sharing it, don't think it's just a movie for kids.
