The movie is just fun .... maybe more fun for those who were young and fans of "The Ramones" at the time of the movie. I watched the movie over and over again with myself and my friends, and it's still fresh and funny. In the case of too serious a threat, a band's big fan of the concept is timeless and the boredom of high school students with some classes of humiliation is timeless. <br /> <br /> And there are some pearl lines / scenes in the movie ..... that refers to how our "permanent description" in high school monitors us through life. (Let me assure you that I've been in high school for a few years and it doesn't follow me) ..... famous "static" line ("I'm getting some static" ..... "Not as much as you get ", like Togar's main approach) ..... a member of the school board who is so dirty, the sisters are participating .... The Nazi Hall is watching the love for" body search "...... Prime Minister Togar," I will give you the final solution "and burning Ramones documents (note: documents were in front of CDs) .... and of course Joey Ramone said:" Things have definitely changed since we're out of high school ", followed by Togar, asking," Do your parents know <br /> <br /> Just one tip ..... don't see where the stars are now ..... Joey Ramone died young. Dey Young, who was the main hottie in the movie, reminds us that we are all ages .... PJ Soles's career has never evolved as we could have expected ......... Marla Rosenfield, if another the student apparently appeared only in this movie (one of my male friends dies over him every time we watch the movie), although I will present my performance more than enough and should have brought more movie. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So, look and enjoy ..... don't believe .... just fun!
