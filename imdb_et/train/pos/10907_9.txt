Turned around the TV and HBO showed a double incredibly frightening medical condition, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, it seems fun," - I really love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought that Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that because of his condition he never went through puberty, thus with a high voice and a smaller body. He was in a crusade to raise money for his money. She had the most wonderful sense of humor with a sense of beautiful spirituality ... I cried, looked more, laughed, got another Kleenex, then I cried. When Jonni Kennedy's "time was", he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned from this life and was free. I highly recommend it. If you do not love this man, you have no heart.
