I have not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30-minute version may be abbreviated. I'm curious about it myself, because the later parts of the movie didn't even make much sense to me, even when I looked at them again. It also seems to be a very short 30 minutes for the 1917 movie. "Poor little rich girl", which was the next movie from Tourneur, is 65 minutes long and "Clan's Pride", which was her previous feature, was 84 minutes long. So I'm easier to see that I wasn't crazy, there's got to be a part of this movie and that's why the resolution didn't make much sense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see or comment on a movie that can only be seen in half ... but I would still recommend this movie because of the truly exciting views that give us the inside of the historical East Coast film studio. This is an earlier film I've seen personally, based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick, who was later the main actor in Hollywood and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges' films. He plays a western actress who may be vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, who is somewhat reminiscent of Warwick. After being really exciting in the studio, we'll see them on the spot where she discovers a girl in the country (Doris Kenyon) and persuades her to come to New Jersey with a screen that goes very badly. After that, the film seems to have no big pieces in the form we currently have. <br /> <br /> Again, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of movies from documentary value, but in a form like we do. It doesn't hold a movie and is not a particularly good example of Maurice Tourneur's work.
