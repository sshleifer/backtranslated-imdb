This review is almost 30 years late. However, I have to mention that I took a copy of this movie in early 2008 and looked at it repeatedly for 4 months straight away! I just had to write about it! I got stuck and forgot that when I saw this movie, there was something else. How ironic it is to see the toughest male main character of literature, who is seen by the most beautiful man! Yet what is welcome in irony! It was perfect for me and more, because Timothy Dalton made his role fair. He gave an amazing and triumphant performance! I've never seen anything like that before! All other participants are also very good. The whole movie was put together beautifully. I don't care what anyone says about this movie. I just love it and love it! It made me happy and happy. It crushes me a bit to say it, but I prefer Jane Eyre's 1983 A&E P & J, which I think is the ultimate mini-series. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre's extracts called me back at school a bit. I never got serious about reading a book, knowing the story so well. Seeing this particular production gave me a story of life and brought me close. The scenes and the voice of Mr Dalton haunted me endlessly and eventually led to a serious reading of the book, which is of course a masterpiece. Bravo for the whole team and especially for Mr.Dalton! This movie is now my part. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a rating of 10/10.
