Our song is a great example of a passionate film making in its aesthetic way. In fact, this is a real film of wonder; pervasive and insightful artwork that crowns the lives of three young girls (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) in their lives in summer, when the difficulties of their approaching adulthood force all of them to make a difficult life, choices that are likely to redefine who each is, as well as how they in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and narrow. In this film there is no fun, free, sentimental or clich√©. What we see here sometimes seems to be a heartbreaking real. There is naturalism - reliability when you do it - in our song that crosses giants of other genres, including American Graffiti and Cooley. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit in the movie spirit goes to its main players. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. It would be easy - and obviously horribly - to leave, as some are probably, the performances of these three as apathetic or insensitive. In fact, their silent charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unusual intelligence, are completely riveting on the entire film. Young people's behavior should be completely "touched" or completely indifferent to the fact that these three youngsters remain on the screen. Similarly, the supportive majority, especially Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, congratulates the work of the three girls and the overall tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie that must not be forgotten! for all ages.
