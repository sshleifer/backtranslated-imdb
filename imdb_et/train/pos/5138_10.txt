In 1994, I had a very long holiday at the end of July - something like a 17-day line that is paid for two weeks, weekends and holidays. During that time, I stayed in the city, hanging a lot in my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I didn't have a TV in my apartment, so I watched my parents' tube. I had just finished viewing the X-Files segment when the program was called Personal FX. I was instantly closed. I had always been thrilled with the objects in our home that had come from the inheritance of my parents 'home and relatives' heritage, and often thought about their history, value, and so on. <br /> <br /> After a long vacation, I went to my people's house at my lunch hour to catch my personal FX. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode during which the co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment, where the series was filmed, was renovated and that when the renovation was completed, Personl would return to FX air. <br /> <br /> It was never! Personal FX was the first and best collection exhibition. And it disappeared from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still hurt. <br /> <br /> How to go, FX.
