In 1979, I was a 12-year-old boy, my parents just got a box that was quite new in our neighborhood. As a 12-year-old boy, I saw it for the first time on television. I will never forget the joy of these times. Racing cars, the whole parents' bath, the waterbed, the smoking of herbs, the hot 70's chicks, the "makin of love for my Chevy van song" were all so new to me. A complete movie with all the memories you could count on. I own it and enjoy it about once a year. When I watch this movie, I want to get my skates, with four wheels, not in the line, go to the park and hunt some kids with hairy hair. Really great memories of young adolescence!
