I enjoyed this movie, maybe because I haven't seen comments, etc. It was a pleasant and a bit of a romp. I don't know why it didn't do more splash than it was. As far as the story is concerned, I can relate to certain aspects of Paul Reiser's character and I can see my father's Falch character. I liked a lot of the past when I was a child and also listened to my grandparents. If you liked movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. In my opinion, "sleeping place" and one of those sensitive stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles, but nothing was overrun. I'd say it is at least 8, maybe bigger.
