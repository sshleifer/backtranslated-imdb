I used this film in the class of religion I taught. The golden fish floats happily in the top floor of its bowl. Young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy has got money to buy milk. While at home, he stops at the carnival for playing the game. Next to him is a black man looking a little scary. The boy drops the bottle of milk. It breaks. A black man gives him money to replace milk. This scene changes to what's happening at home. A black cat rises fire and enters the apartment. He (?) Detects the fish and looks at it. Fish swims energetically and pulls out the bowl. Nowadays, in my class, a bunch of teenagers have fallen in love with me. The cat takes the fish in the mouth and we all hold our breath. Cat falls into fish bowl. The double story contains a suspicious man in a black and suspicious black cat. Both inspire bias. Both are innocent. It was a great debate in my class.
