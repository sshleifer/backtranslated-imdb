I recently got the chance to watch The Waterdance and really liked it. I really do not understand why he called it, because there is really no dancing except maybe dancing near the club. We introduce the film to the main characters, the disabled in the hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically furnished boy and a healthy woman, a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you can't see such movies today. Im not "stuck in time", im not saying that everything was better in the early 80s and 90s than today, but I really think the film industry is getting worse and we can learn a lot from old movies about old movies. anything from 1920-1998.
