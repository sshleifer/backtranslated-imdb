Don't forget the soundtrack that is currently playing. <br /> <br /> However, Debra Winger is always interesting, and although it was an earlier role for her, she is pretty good as Cissy, the wrong girl on the rails, lived in a trailer from Bud (Travolta), which was replaced by the city comparison Madolyn Smith for a while . <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier review of Scott Glen, he is only used for a plot that has been mixed to create a relationship; the story is predictable and lively. <br /> <br /> Even though I am from the east, many of us didn't like "Saturday night", while his moments were, persistent stereotypes are not critical to this point. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting Debra Winger; she is still so pleasant and has never received this Hollywood personality, who is subject to too many actors today. 7/10
