One of the best comedies ever coming out of the UK. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are terrible actors and actors who seem to be communicating dramatically at home. They support their writing partner, Jeremy Dyson, with the most memorable characters of recent years. Little Britain is insignificant because of its imitation of ideas. Consistently original and groundbreaking I am sure that so many people hate those series as they love them, but I am equally sure that no one could comment on the log. I haven't seen a movie of a movie yet, but I've heard good things and bad things so I reserve judgment. The original radio series from which LOG came were as innovative as the TV series. I don't know if it came to the US in the TV series, but I'd be happy to see how the strange English languages ​​of humor found the American audience
