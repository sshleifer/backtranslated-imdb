In today's world of digital production, there is no computer capable of replacing the actor and writer. Unfortunately, this type of "character-driven" movie is too rare these days. Duvall's performance and James Earl Jones are faithful to the high expectations of their audience. I don't know if this movie is made for television? It has a personal quality that is "close" to narrative. It is inaccurate to say that performances are all outstanding. The only thing that keeps this cinema as a masterpiece is the big lack of operator, but the beautiful pictures aren't all. How can Jones and Duvall's talents continue to do such fine work at an age where actors are digitizing?
