Jim Carrey is good as usual, and while there are quite a few "Jim Carrey moments", it is definitely not "Jim Carrey's movie." <br /> <br /> This is mainly for kids and I managed to enjoy it as such a movie. In Israel, it was promoted as the second Jim Carrey movie, so those who waited for the strange comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has good moments and works well for kids. I can't say I loved this movie, but then I'm not the target audience yet!
