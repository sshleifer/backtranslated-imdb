I really do not understand why people are so disturbed and put in the movie! Remember people, this is an SNL movie, not something that should be unpredictable and original in the plot or direction! Ladies Man is a fun movie, though from time to time foolish, with mad outflow and as usual, WONDERFUL performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible, but comedy! I really do not understand how no one could laugh at this fun movie. Anyway, all I ask is that people take it like this - SNL, stupid and unfair comedy. Something that will win prizes but still modern comedy gold. "10-4 apricot!"
