Okay, let's start by saying that this movie is not an exact transfer of Andrei Chikatilo's crimes and legal action. Although the Politburo may have had an "official policy" that the USSR did not have successive killers, the legal system was in fact dealing with others and "Killer X" (as he was actually called) was already looking for when Fetisov brought Burakov's case. In fact, as soon as it was understood that they had several murders, the authorities set up a team of dozens of officers to monitor and end the human smile that did not match the parameters of a normal serum killer. It is good that the director and the writers consistently remind the viewer that this story is only "based on real events" because it is not so. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br /> <br /> This is a good example of a fast-paced Hollywood-style thriller that is still over what happened. It's easy to track and has just enough truth to make this version of events do compelling viewing. Yes, Chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults, both men and women. Yes, dirty laboratory work made her free to continue killing for years. Yes, innocent men were accused of murder and the police were strongly accused of their crimes. Yes, at the time of the crime (although Burakov's dedicated help), the homosexual community was harassed. And yes, Chikatilo did not admit the confusion of the special prosecutor, Gorbunov, but with the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovski (although Gorbunov was indeed close to the egotistic coin depicted in this film). Any truth and truthfulness, all of these events are dramatized in a way that constantly strives and fears. </p>. Stephen Rea's growing emotional involvement in killing and developing knowledge by identifying clues, Donald Sutherland's snarky manipulation The Soviet party is hacking and the fine back that appears when it is needed, the terrifying fear of Jeffrey DeMun, hidden by fear-filled behavior; all sharp dialog and sharp editing in a way that cannot be underestimated. <br /> <br /> What it is, "Citizen X" is almost perfect ("almost" thanks to one moment of congratulations, which ultimately doesn't fit. It is highly recommended if fiction is good, not the presentation of facts ... but given junky "serum killer" movies, which Hollywood usually exposes, are good enough for me.
