I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again as soon as it was finished. The cast was great, the plot was fun and entertaining and it was just a general enjoyable movie! I would appreciate it as one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls were really cute, especially Denise Richards. He was very ornery at the whole movie and gave him the character OOMPH!
