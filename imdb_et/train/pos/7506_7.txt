I do not lie. Despite an interesting view, I watched this famous Bettie page because I had heard (and it was quite obvious when looking at the event or something about the film) that Gretchen Mol got naked in it. I've never been a fan of Mol, but I can't stand to see that an attractive woman takes off her clothes. Yes, it may be perverse, but its theme and the central part of the film's core, and it helps the film be much stronger than it should be. <br /> <br /> The Chronicle of Bettie Page (Mol) is the life of his physical and sexually abusive days as a southern school high school and his new life in New York. He wants to be an actress, but he also has to pay bills. After taking a couple of seemingly innocent shots on the local beach, the Page becomes slow to model and jumps quickly from recommended photos to sexually provocative pin-up photos. <br /> <br /> I know the shortness of the movie (just ninety minutes) is both a curse and a blessing. On one hand, the film never goes beyond its greeting. You get to know the page within minutes and then it gets directly to your modeling career and doesn't look back. But it also film the film, because we never get the chance of everything that is going on. He just jumps between the modeling forms and the contradictions that they create before jumping directly into the big screen, which takes a large part of the movie's final act. You just sit there and try to take it all and just to you. It seems that the filmmakers wanted to get too much material together with too short a film. It comes up for longer sequences and asks for even longer explanations. It doesn't know the speed; it just doesn't know everything there. <br /> <br /> Another little nuance, though with some curiosity, is the use of color throughout the movie. Most of them are black and white, but often splashes and color sequences occur. But even though it may have been made as a symbolic gesture early, it becomes a bit annoying as it appears continuously before black and white. It becomes confusing and becomes quite annoying to be distracting than anything else the movie continues. <br /> <br /> Although this may be a bit of a confusion with your actions, the film sticks to your themes. The page I don't know about is played innocently and his world is exactly the same. With the exception of some shady characters during his teenage years, everyone he meets is innocent and all he has is innocent. I've never thought I'd look at full front nudity as something that was nothing but vulgar and exhausted, but here's something to really wonder. All at once is beautiful and innocent. Even at the most sexually perverse moments in the film (although it is annoying compared to today's standards) they have an innocent and English feel. There's just something about how Moli's naked body is depicted, that it just captures such a different chord as naked bodies in other movies. It just seems so natural and wonderful that if there were any reason to watch a movie, it would be seen the outstanding images of Mol's body when he was playing Bettie's page. <br /> <br /> Another reason is Mol. Like the Page, he shows that the southern belle of the 1950s all know (or can at least imagine). Despite his profession, he is still a normal person and still looks religious. Mol plays him with exactly the right amount of pure cleanliness to make this character authentic from the 1950s. He plays him in such a fact that you would be hard to guess that Mol was actually Bettie Page himself. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is very little time to shine in supportive pain and they have completely overshadowed Mol's excellent performance. None of them do anything particularly pleasing and none of them really have the same strength as Molil. It is not the fault of the participants, but rather the fact that they do not have much work to do. Many of them are perfectly recognizable, such as the Oscar candidate David Strathairn (a role that is a bit better than one of his best performances), Sarah Paulson (the last Golden Globe candidate for Studio 60 at Sunset Strip) and the character actor Lili Taylor, but you would be hard to put your performance on anything other than okay. None of these characters have really evolved, and they really just stand as the characteristic passages that Mol runs around when he starts evaporating in his brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this film is worthy of its portrayal of nudity and the excellent result of Gretchen Mol Bettie Page. Everything else is a bit too confusing and uncomfortable if it should be. If more work had been done to develop the film, not just the story, it would have been a much better biographical film. As it is, it is only a means by which Mol really emerges as an actor in the stratosphere of popularity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
