I thought this movie was very well done. In the mid-1950s, everything went fine for me. It was well cast and plausible. Usually, this type of movie does not care much because they do not have the depth, but I felt that the film was characters and you felt how they felt you really know them and care about them. This led me back to my youth and allowed me to recall more innocent time. This movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and all age groups. After the movie ended I wanted to have another part there. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and his family. This movie is classic. If you haven't seen it, you should try it if it is on TV or rent ...
