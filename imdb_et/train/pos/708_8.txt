Ok movie discount syndrome. The mother of the twins one is very sick the other is good but she has downs. The mother does not believe she can lift her to give her some people who have 15 children 11 who are somewhat lower! Mom doesn't like it and she thinks she should be with her family (i also agree) that they take it to court and the family breaks down and grandparents lose, it never says when mother and daughter makeup? I think this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, it's still good and has some unintentional laughs!
