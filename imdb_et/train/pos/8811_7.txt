Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world are collected in this movie to showcase their views and ideas about the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you can see in every movie. Such films are rarely made and rated. This film tries to touch all possible WTC cores. Here are some of the most important stories of this movie that make this movie so unique. <br /> <br /> There is a story about Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran), where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for attacks from America. There, the teacher tries to educate his students by informing them of innocent people who are killed in the WTC massacre. Then comes the story of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), where a filmmaker gets into a face-to-face interview with a dead soldier in WTC and a dead heavy-core terrorist who took part in a WTC attack. Then we see the story of Idris in Ouedraogos (Burkina Faso), where a group of five innocent children sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win money from America. Then we will see the story of Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico), where you will see a black screen and slowly see the arrival of WTC buildings. And the people stuck in the building jump out of it to save their lives. The second most important story is Mira Nair (India), where her mother struggles to honor her dead son, whose name is mistaken for the WTC massacre! After the September 11 attack, our heartbeat starts to pump automatically when we hear two names around the world. First is the World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This film completely changes our perception and strengthens it, claiming more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves such home video collections. Certainly, every penny spent is worth it. But please do not wait for more than DVD Movies. Of course, filmmakers have filmography, but there are no extra features.
