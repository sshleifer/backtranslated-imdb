Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite film tends to be flawed - the back glass seems to be a bit stepped from time to time, Chris Elliot's character on the landscape does not work, the music score in the best years of our life is too cheesy, the start of Cabiria's nights is a little too slow - but this movie is done perfectly from start to finish. The script is brilliant, acting is great everywhere (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), inspiration and photography are inspired and the music score touches without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every sad moment really moves, every moment of light smiles at me. It's really one of the best movies I've ever seen and I want more movies there. I'm glad Reese Witherspoon has gone on after this movie, but I'm sorry that her latest movies are so preconceived and stupid as this serious movie about real people. real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! Black-black.
