I often wonder why this series was so much. I thought it was great and very cleverly written and executed. I think that in the future it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is, if they ever give it out. There were many and upcoming young comedy actors in it, and everyone went to bigger things. Perhaps this fact makes people aware and must be released. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and at least Julian Rhind-Tutt from the very successful Green Wing. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comedies of modern time. Anyone who can produce comedy, like Father Ted, could not write something that is not worth publishing. If it's ever been issued, I'll definitely buy it.
