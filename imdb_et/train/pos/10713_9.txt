His grandfather takes care of an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents. Together, they find a common ground in the Gaelic folklore that has been passed on from generation to generation by the islands. Although tragic episodes containing stories, such as the Highland distances, have a surprising amount of humor and joy. It's all filmed in Skye, so there's a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking and it is a rare opportunity to hear the Scottish Gaelic spoken. I am English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of the Gaelic is still great. Performances are just what you expect from carefully selected non-participants - in other words, you look at the real thing - people who care about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially Skye, worked on countless small miracles to make this film. Anyone with the least interest in gel, folk culture, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism, or social justice should watch this movie.
