I think there was so much courage for him. Unfortunately, when celebrity suffers, it helps people the most. But it was remarkable for him. I've been in the field of mental health for five years and I think it's great that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I believe it helped. I thought he was big and always wanted. I'm glad he wrote this book and the film was made. She is a remarkable lady and I hope she will continue to act. He has been a lot and has faced it. I really would love to see him work more with kids, especially with kids. His trial should not have happened and I think he would be a great mentor for young people. The film was so touching to me that I was very touched. Suffering from TBI, which caused my disorder to begin, and who had PTSD, it's good to know that someone has the courage to show his life. I believe it helped this people and people in general to understand that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you to Mrs Duke or to Anna, whoever you prefer.
