I enjoyed this movie very late late on the late TV and it keeps my interest through the whole picture. This wonderful creepy but mysterious looking English home where bad looking ornaments and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder why anyone would want to rent this home or even have it. There are four (4) stories about this house, and the inhabitants of each home meet with all kinds of problems. You can see a nice beautiful lake and pond, as well as the sweet song of birds, but don't let it fool around, there is a horror all over the place. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", 80 gives an excellent performance as one person's life at home and even Christopher Lee's "Crimson Altar Curse" 68 and his little daughter Chloe Franks (Jane Reid). wonderful exciting story together, her daughter loves to read WITCHCRAFT BOOK! If you love creepy, horrible and mysterious movies with many surprises, it's FILM FOR YOU !!
