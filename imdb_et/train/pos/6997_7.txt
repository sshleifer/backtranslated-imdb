One thing is for sure ... you shouldn't watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who must live with sin that he cannot. The story lies in you, not the usual dumbed down explanation, so it keeps you wondering what's going on. Finally, the points are connected and the performances are reasonable. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith was another good day in the office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that many moral questions have to be asked, but if you just accept and buy into your agony, it is easier to accept what he has decided to do. Whether you agree or disagree is not relevant. The journey that takes you is interesting enough if it's not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A good enough movie that leaves a little sad at the end. I recommend this movie if you like where you have to think and not just look at explosions and struggles.
