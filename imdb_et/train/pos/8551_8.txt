Ti% s and As *, many boobs. Some great characters, fun horrors and well-assembled teen action from the Amercan Pie franchise. It really looks like an old school. It seems a bit like Porkys in the 2000s. Some great funny characters with some very humorous situations make this a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Although the original cast is all except one, this movie is really fun. Lets not get too excited, you have to take it for bachelor comedy what it is, but what it is, it stands out. The stars are nice and funny, girls are hotter than hell. Fun and games are fun, some things I've never seen in comedies, they make me cringe, but at the same time laugh. <br /> <br /> So ignore the enemies and give it a run and see what you think. Don't wait for the classic American Pie, but wait for something that should make you laugh and pay your attention within one hour.
