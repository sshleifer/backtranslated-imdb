Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe "How to lose friends and transfer people". The romance on which the plot is based has mostly shifted the story of more interesting "clothes to riches". Although the story centerline is somewhat rushed, many screen shots make sense; Get "nitty gritty" off the road, focusing on those key relationships that make "office policy" and use these almost insignificant scenes that are used purely for comics. But it works so well, especially on the front seat with Pegg. The film is ultimately very clever, playing well with the transatlantic relationship Pegg shares with its co-stars and connects quite well and quite refreshingly the cross between a large and a low-life society, which, despite predictability, is a somewhat unique journey. The different characters in the movie are well presented and casting is definitely a plus point in the movie. Both "trading venues" between Pegg and Hust and the "love, hatred" relationship between Pegg and Dunst work as well as a better word, charming. Even Fox, whose main asset is, of course, a sex appeal, punches that turn out to be quite dark, and works as a "bimbo" role. It's one of those movies, where every little detail gives tribute to great work. From the transsexual removers to the amazing soundtrack, all eyes are nicely described as smart comedy.
