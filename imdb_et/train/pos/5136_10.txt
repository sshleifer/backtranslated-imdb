Maybe the biggest movie about jazz. <br /> <br /> It's jazz. <br /> <br /> Opening is still worshiping. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, Jo Jones is always a joy (see also The Sound of Jazz). <br /> <br /> If possible, search for music; it is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All jazz and movie lovers should explore this huge jewel. <br /> <br /> What shadows and light - what music - what a hat!
