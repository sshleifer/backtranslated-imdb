"The Lady in Question (1999)", starring Gene Wilder, is a well-functioning mystery drama that reminds me of the old series of black and white Raymond Burr Perry Mason. Both Perry and Money kept me out. There were many suspects with the murder motive, but I had no idea what kind of character it would be. <br /> <br /> Geen Wilder has a special charm in her, even in her facial expressions and vocal relationships that make her fit for that part. The parts of the film depicting the actors took place very well. I'm sure it's an additional challenge to trigger. I'm not surprised to see that he was part of writing a movie. Even his song was a joy. I like him in this role more than his former "sillier" roles like "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka." I hope A & E will continue this series. They should call it "A & E Gene Wilder mysteries". <br /> <br /> Music fits with time. I liked the cool live combination and swinging modes. I was a little unclear at the beginning of whether we saw a setback or whether it happened in that period. And I do not agree that it is necessary to add a conviction for the scanning flow. For me it is always disturbing. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed my husband and I was well-designed at the beginning, which we hope many others - like one of our favorites: Raymond Burr's Perry Mason.
