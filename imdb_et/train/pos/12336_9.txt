An excellent period was murdered by melodrama, Fontaine effectively played against his earlier naive wallflower type, becoming known to Olivia DeHavilland. It's fine because Fontaine is wonderful. Written by Charles Bennett, who had written to Hitchcock in the thirties, and later he won an excellent script for the British Night of the Demon. Open a scene where Ivy visits a happy fortune teller, played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (James Whale's celebrity), a tour de force, and the film retains interest in many embarrassing mechanisms. I hope I will see this movie one day on a DVD, but it will never despair because it seems to be a vaguely hidden movie. Fortunately, I have to see it in the AMC about seven or eight years ago, but I haven't seen it since then. Get it if you can!
