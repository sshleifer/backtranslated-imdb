This film is not just about school teaching, it has never really been seen. But it just adds to the power of this movie. It is related to people and tragedy. I know it was shown to Columbine's surviving pupils and it gave them a lot of fading. Action is great. All three main players (busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I recommend this movie to anyone. It's one of those movies that makes you talk about it after that. It provokes discussion not only of school teaching but also of people's emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a tear-jerker, but it's worth it and one I look over and over again
