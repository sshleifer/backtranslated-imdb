I'm not a fan of newer movies, but it was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could look at it together - as unusual! My aunt liked it. It was laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, Oz's wizard. Hero Paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and frustrations, always keeping in mind his decision to find his friend Marie. Highly recommended.
