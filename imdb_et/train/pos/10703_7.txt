This movie is definitely a strange love story. Although this film may not be a lot of shouting, Nicole Kidman herself carries the film, the rest can simply be forgotten, although Ben Chaplin does a good job of Hertfordshire Life with St Albans & Hemel Hempstead's shots in the city center, which represents the true nature of the region. What's going to look like a regular episode of the British TV series "Heartbeat" will soon become a tough gangster escape action. In this simple little movie, nothing really memorizes and ends up as a relatively decent weekend entertainment. Good to see, and if you like hero John, there is a single thirty something you can find something related to his character.
