The characters were alive and interesting, the plot was perfectly occupied, the pyro-effects were masterfully completed, and it takes the story of the basic love triangle and captures the science fiction element. I can logically rationally identify with many characters and their motivation in logic. <br /> <br /> The camera's work was great, the sound was clear and precise, the background music was perfect, the singing firefighters are a nice talented, memorable strangeness, brilliantly designed kits and professional effects made with qualified talents. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed at how the whole mini-carnival chain parked in a batch gets food with one bulb. It seems impossible to say. The struggle near the brother at the end of the movie was still great. Playing Jim Varney in the role of a non-clown was also a wonderful touch, as he played very well the carny's serious role.
