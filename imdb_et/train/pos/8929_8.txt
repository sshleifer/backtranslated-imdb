First of all, I liked the very important idea of ​​finding "intruders", others fragile, at different levels - mostly subconsciously, but sometimes more allegorically. In fact, the invaders are all over the film: on the Swiss-French border, where the enemy leads a lonely life; his recurring dream and nightmare; after his heart transplant inside his body in difficulty .... In the last half of the film he becomes an intruder, returning to the ancient French colony in the hope of reconciliation of the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is bitter, not pathetic, full of regret and guilt, the feeling of failure is more or less dominant. It's a rather grim picture of the old, seemingly independent, but hopelessly empty and lonely inside. The director composes more images to convey the transient feelings of anxiety and desire than any explicit meaning. Some of them are mesmerizing, but they do not leave humor, but such absurd play that can only be found in somnambul can be visualized.
