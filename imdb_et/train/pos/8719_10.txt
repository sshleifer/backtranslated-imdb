I was surprised by the improvements made in the animation film. When you sit near the screen, you will see details of the structure of the grass and the surface. Details, colors and shades are at least better than Toy Story. How they could pull off the shade, I never know. I hope that PIXAR will present a documentary about the creation of the film, so that I can learn how it has been achieved. Based on this movie, I think future movies will be judged on this film.
