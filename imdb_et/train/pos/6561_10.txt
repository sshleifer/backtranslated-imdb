To be honest, this is the best reality figure someone has ever come out of. To win money, you really need to be an INTELLIGENT. Not just that you have to be bold, sporty, cunning, etc. Not like some flat-axis shows that are these days. And yet they have only two seasons! Bull ... they have to take this show back !! <br /> <br /> Although they have a difficult time pulling Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was great. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was an amazing show. You never knew who should go. And it was so fun to try to think of the mole! It was an exhibition you could play yourself if you wanted to! <br /> <br /> BACK TO MOLE BACK !!!! BACK MOLE BACK !!!!
