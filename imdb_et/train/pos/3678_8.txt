this is a very nice movie and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - The song level is high. some scenes are very big and some are just boring. Many stories are not independent (when you compare yourself to coffee and cigarettes, where every story is a point, message, punchline or yet you want to name it), but most of the stories are really good, some great and general it's one of the best movies this year for sure! <br /> <br /> It is annoying that I have to complete at least 10 rows, I have not yet said, and I don't want to start by analyzing individual sequences ... <br /> <br /> Well, I think it's so !
