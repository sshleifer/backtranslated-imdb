I loved this movie! It's really weird, extremely funny, sick, witty ... It makes no sense to talk about the content of the movie, because then I would give the result out! You have to see it without knowing what it is! Everything is connected and it has its cause and cause. It starts finely, and then things start running faster and faster until they culminate with the worst outbreaks you can imagine! It's even more fun to watch the movie the second time you know all the tricks. The actors are great, especially Ivan Trojan, whose latest scenes are a real masterpiece! I recommend this movie very well, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
