It's a hard movie to classify "10 products or less". In general, I'm not interested in defining genres, but there is something about this movie that makes you put it in a specific category to convey, even if only one word, your feelings about it. I recommend this movie to every person completely, and if you really enjoy cinema and enjoy life, you want to do the same as soon as you watch it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and pleasant, admitting that it is not perfect, but it does nothing wrong. I don't want to sound like I am against myself, but I believe that the writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was doing when he finished writing this inspirational script. I'm sure he wanted to get a product that didn't have anything perfect: a product that would be as simple, attractive and uncompromising as the title. He's done it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, the leader of long, complex and dramatic movies, such as "Angels City" and "Moonlight Mile", proves "10 or less", which closes in just 70 minutes, the passion he owns for his work and the faith he has. Silberling's suggestion here is to put the actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of his wife (Paz Vega) in a grocery store and take them to exactly where ordinary life takes them. <br /> <br /> I can't tell you anymore, because the obvious simplicity lies in the idea of ​​a provocative background that should not be underestimated. Because everyone here is exposed: the camera focuses directly on two main characters who share an endless conversation with car stops that are not endless just because life is life. And let me express my praise for how well Silberling solves the situation by saying that it will take less time (not only during the film's duration, but one day when the film develops) and, in a smaller place, what type of relationship between the two characters Sofia has. Coppola generated "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> This film in Tokyo also met an actor and wife and had conversations about moments where they lived their lives. It is in conversations where we perceive "10 items or less" provocative quality, and as in Coppola's film, the naturalness of every situation never disappears and pictures with all music, and no word seems to be forced or involved in the image to buy time. <br /> <br /> In this aspect, Silberling and his photographer Phedon Papamichael are co-operating. The man who shot the beautiful landscapes "from the side" and focused on every emotion "Patch Adams", is delighted by the visual passages of true natural beauty here. <br /> <br /> But the final beauty of "10 items or less" can be found in its two main parts (Avy Kaufman). They are the ones who convey the feeling I first mentioned and I can't refine; we know their connection and we can say that they have fun and that they can even improvise things. Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman, who is also the film's executive producer, simply stands there and confirms his current film industry status and what is well-deserved: a quiet man full of wisdom that can easily cry when he can laugh at you. And beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said she was "big in Spanglish")? Here he proves that he is the real thing, and Hollywood is not small for him.
