I call it a big movie. it lives through the skills of fantastic actors and a simple but humane story. there are real signs that can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel as lively. the bus driver and his son collect people through the country (Yugoslavia) on the capital of Belgrade. Funny and cruel situations that happen on the road connect people and pigs traveling together. <br /> <br /> Look at it and remember it for life ... its full of Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> And another reason for this magic: it's hard to get!
