This film blows your feet off. This debut film by Tom Barman, a Belgian rock band dEUS, introduces you to 8 intriguing people, the building blocks of a tempting movie jigsaw. They both live in one day and one night in the metropolis of Antwerp. Barman paints his symbols very much and knows his individual stories, a tournament that resembles the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. Anecdote mating surprises, moves, amuses; dialogues are so natural that they are improvised. An extremely funny duo of Matthias Schoenaerts, Natal Broodide and Gent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogd. Sam Louwyck is a memorable "Windman", a stranger who dances all over the film. Sam is also responsible for stunning choreography, and of course Tom Barman himself took care of the ultra-cool soundtrack. We were really impressive: Any way the Wind blows is a film that blows you off your feet.
