Nowadays, the actors are joyfully coloring their hair, dressing like slippers and losing their glamor role, and Bette Davis was probably the actor who started this trend. Even though a real young woman, who occasionally wore designer clothes and Constance Bennett-type movies, was ready to destroy her, to create both the interior and the inside. his determination here is widely demonstrated on his film "Of Human Bondage", where he celebrates Leslie Howard as Philip Carey. Davis plays Mildred, slutty, manipulative, greedy bad life on Howard's masochistic, club-footed Philip. He will meet him first when he is a waitress, and he will let him take him to dinner and to the theater when he is with a rich parent (Alan Hale Sr.). Indeed, the Philips club club is against Mildred. Philip, for his part, seems to enjoy his open flirtation and his coolness against him. He allows Mildred to finance him financially between the boys who threw him off while he is blowing a couple of beautiful women (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee). When he starts to throw him out, Mildred wakes his apartment and robs him, forcing him to retire from the medical school and losing his place of accommodation. Although Leslie Howard was an excellent actor and attractive, her exemplary style is a more formal old school and as a result she tends to go somewhere. After "or" Petrified Forest ", which requires his technique, his dated actor is even more obvious here, because Davis created a new ground with a sharp, nervous force that would really put his name on it. Contrast this performance with your Henriette limitation, warmth and gentleness "All this and Heaven too" or the sin he brought "Dark Victory." He was a real actor and a true artist. Hell; Mildred's deterioration is absolutely pathetic, because Philip seems to be a force when his spirit fades. <br /> <br /> A great film to see the growth of one of the biggest stars in the movie.
