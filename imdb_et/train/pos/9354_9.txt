Like someone who has never given Adam Sandler talents as he has done to him and many comic artists like him, I went to Reign Over Me, waiting for a big movie, not only because of his presence in the movie, but because I thought it it seemed very good overall. Even someone who already thought that Sandler was able to provide an effective dramatic performance, writes here that I was amazed at how fantastic he is in it. He makes you cry, especially with his purposeful sudden and unexpected monologue. What is amazing about his role is that it is a character that is hard to say what we have seen before. We have seen many signs of emotional love, many people with intellectual disabilities, many individuals, many passionate self-centered artists, but Sandler Charlie Fineman is none of them. He may have any of these flavors, but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. It is a pleasure for the audience to be emotionally drawn and anyone whose problems, thinking and provocations are completely different from most of his similar characters is drawn. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle delivers interesting performance at a completely different level. He's every person. He's the most common person in the world so you can't find almost any character like him or at least what he's playing as he plays Alan Johnson, whose name is even on a conveyor. Cheadle is brilliant because she's funny, hitting, smart and stupid, so many ordinary people are. <br /> <br /> The rest are populated by actors and actors. in smaller but fairly colorful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is an over-refined middle-class upper woman, Donald Sutherland is impatient, but a surprising judge, Robert Klein, is Sander's desensitized father. <br /> <br /> The Mike Binder script is quite brilliant because it says something quite in-depth communication in all its shades. It's a lot finer than saying, Babel, and has a much closer home ideal. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the reality of its images, not just the style. This movie hit me like feedback in the 1970s kitchen sink style. Cinematic art was grainy and left open, but it was his charm. This does not mean to attract us to the camera and the gloss that would have diluted its stories like this. <br /> <br /> The music that plays an important role in the movie and its title is very powerful. It's close to the beginning that you feel like you are for another Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine that has some sort of soundtrack, but soon you realize you're more than that. In fact, the film has a lot of music that stimulates many of the most emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over We are an important statement not only for society but also for film. This shows that even Blankman's director can do wonders.
