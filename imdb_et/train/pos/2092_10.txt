I watched this film's curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserves Oscar. I came out of thinking about the movie YES! Having seen Muni in only one movie, where he was quite hammy, I waited here for the same type of performance. Luckily I was wrong. Although some may criticize him because he is too childish and stereotypically simple for the Asians of Hollywood, I thought he was right in that role. Keye Luke, if he had been given the chance to play a leading role, could have played him much the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the use of camera work and crowds, especially in the palace camp, where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and gloomy atmosphere of the fire crew and drought made it epic, unlike the other times when it was glitz and glitter. I looked at this film from the beginning to the end enthralled. I can't say the same about today's "epic".
