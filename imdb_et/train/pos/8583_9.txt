The Korean War has been referred to as the American Forgotten War. So many unanswered questions were buried with 50 thousand men who died there. Sometimes we are treated to playing with a film that deals with this far-flung, ghostly frozen cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the best. It's called "Sergeant Ryker." The story is from American soldier Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin), elected by his secretary. His job is to injure North Korea and provide his services to UN forces. His cover is so successful, he turns out to be an invaluable enemy and is given a major. After that, the Americans are caught, prosecuted as a traitor and spy. He noted that he had told the defect that his chief executive had been killed and had no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He has been convicted and punished. But his conviction is questioned by his prosecutor, Young Captain Young (Bradford Dillman). To make sure that Major General Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) is certain of his suspicions, he will be given a new trial and executed if he is convicted. The courtroom drama is top-notch, as well as that of Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Felli Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was a distant place, but the possibility of communist conviction and his hanging hit the home in the 1950s. Thanks to its excellent script and powerful message, this drama has become a classic salon. Great viewing and recommended for everyone. ****
