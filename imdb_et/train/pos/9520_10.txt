This is a beautiful movie. The true story of the bond between father and son. It's far from Tom Hanks's best. Tom Hanks is really out of this movie box. He usually has nice boy roles. In this film, however, he is a bit sharp in this film, but still appears as a rose, even until the last scene, to kill his character. The cast of this film was well put together. I also love the part that Tom Hanks character is full of silence and kills all Rooney group men. There's something cool and even deep that there is no sound in this scene, just an emotion. I love the picture of John Rooney, Paul Newman's character's face as he realizes before he sees him, that Tom Hanks's character gets revenge and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie, I blew away and knew I had to go out and get this video and I've done it by adding it to my all-time favorite movie collection. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor so this movie is a special place in me.
