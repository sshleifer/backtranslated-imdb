I have to agree with everyone else who has posted. <br /> <br /> I looked at it some time ago, but I tell you when I hear a certain anime about this music, I remember the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I got when I looked at it, and it makes me cry (such a happy but sad feeling). However, I find this love story nude in haste, and they didn't explain things properly, but it didn't break any viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I was so much in this anime that after the end I just had to do some research (and look at the end several more times) and found all my answers and more. I love how they set historical legends to fit into this anime, it was amazing and just made me look much more. (I'm always interested in some historical data about this anime) <br /> <br /> I think it should have been a longer series, but if that's all they had to do, they pulled it out. I recommend it to anyone who loves an emotional anime with a great story, well-built characters (some mysterious) and a bit of fantasy action. <br /> <br /> Also, although it was based on the H-game, it has no such stuff and I would prefer it in this way. (I have no mature anime problems, mostly prefer it)
