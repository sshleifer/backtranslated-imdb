Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / cooler since 1990, which appeared here in the UK on the "New World Video" label. <br /> <br /> This is a desert-based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying over the weekend to kill one by one an unknown force that drives a threatening black truck !!! This movie has some scary scenes and some gore here and there, but I have to say that the actor was so flat, even with a low budget! But the film was strange addictive and I liked it, and I never slept or ever turned it off, which is always a good sign! I gave this movie almost 6/10, but when I saw it build up the steam along the way, there were some good gore and breaks, good nudity and the fact that the main female role was hottie! I'll give him 7/10.
