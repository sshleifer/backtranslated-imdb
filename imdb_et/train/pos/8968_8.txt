This movie was like all Jimmy Stewart films, witty, charming and very enjoyable. Kim Novak's performance, like Gillian, a beautiful witch who yearns to be a human being, is great, her subtle facial expressions, her every step and gesture all create Gillian's unique and somewhat ghostly character, he left us hanging on every word. I should not mention Ernie Kovack and Elsa Lanchester's very praiseworthy performances as the world of magic (Kovacs) and the passionate lover affirming the latter as a loving aunt seems to be using magic even if it is forbidden. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautiful and the chemistry between them is great, but when the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading woman is bad!
