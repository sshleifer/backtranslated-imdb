Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music movie that looks at Michael Jackson with different segments. I rate each segment separately. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens a movie with a music video. The music video is a Michael Jackson concert featuring the song "Man in the Mirror", music videos also show historical figures such as Gandhi, King Martin Luther, JR, John Lennon and others. The first segment was a good choice to open the film and I liked the editing of historical figures. I even loved this song. I'll give the first segment 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows Michael Jackson's start from Jackson 5 to his soloist. I thought the assembly was well done, I liked the animation they put and I also loved their choices like "I want you back, Beat, Thriller, do you know it and how you know me." The only thing I want them to do a little better in assembly is "We are the world". The reason why you all see is the drops of rain and the drops contain pictures of Michael Jackson and the Choir of Celebrities, but it is hard to see the choir. Other than that, the segment is still good. I'll give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the song Bad. You think it's Michael Jackson's music video bad. This segment is a music video, but has been edited by Kids again. The segment was cute, but it was not as good as the other segments. I'll give it 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music movie that takes place after the child's version of Speed ​​Demon. It is short that Michael Jackson is wanted by his beloved fans and the media, and he hides himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to get rid of them. The order of friction was great, but some of the film's Claymation characters saw a little fake when they interacted with real people. At the end of the clip, Michael Jackson's rabbit costume doesn't come alive and dances with it. I liked dancing, but it was like somewhere. Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy winning music video "Leave Me Alone." The music video speaks of a media that puts his nose on Michael Jackson's personal life, and Michael Jackson feels that they will not leave him alone, no matter how innocent he is. The music video really speaks out (but keep in mind that this happened before the child's disappointment about the rumors of the 80s.) But I didn't feel that this video should be in this movie because it's a child's movie and I don't think that the child understands what he is singing. I'll give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 brings us to the main story of the whole movie "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his power as a criminal indicator to protect children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from Evil Mobster named Mr Bigg (played by Joe Pesci). The segment that I thought brought the film out especially when he danced and sang "Smooth Criminal" with criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The strange thing about the segments is why kids hanging with an adult man. Joe Pesc's character also talks about drugs and what he is going to do with them. I mean, why would you talk about drugs in children's movies. The other wise was good. My rating for this segment is 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the last segment of the movie. At the end of the movie, Michael Jackson is singing the cover version of "The Come Together" of the Beatle song, and then we'll see Michael Jackson singing at Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael made a good cover for "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to include a good singer with his talented music. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie that I think brings out the imagination of children. The film is almost as imaginative as the Beatles animated movie "Yellow Submarine", if you like Michael Jackson and you're a movie with a lot of creativity. The overall rating of my movie is 8/10
