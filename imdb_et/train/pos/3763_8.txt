Now, that's more! The first film had a nice dialogue and some weaker actions, but the team behind it seemed to have got their things together and set out a strong, thoroughly enjoyable, fun and creative comedy that keeps everyone on the edge of their seats. Seriously, it's just full of good things that are creative, and it's less of 80's movies spam at the same time. Hell scenes are great and also those in heaven. It really wasn't missing the crazy cap with the adventurous romp that it promises, and you never see another such movie. Even the final act of the hammy movie is not as bad as the first one, being warmly warm and enjoyable in its extremely clich√© repertoire, where the family has a fun movie. And even Keanu Reeves, despite about 30, is not so bad here. <br /> <br /> It seems to me a good thing.
