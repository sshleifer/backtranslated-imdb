108: Tarzan and His Mate (1934) - published 4/20/1934, reviewed 8/8/08. <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escapes from prison and robs bank in Iowa. Bonnie & Clyde kill two road patrols in Texas. BIRTHS: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: After being quite disappointed with the original "Tarzan Ape Man", we discovered among co-users and historians that the second film "Tarzan and his mate" was the best in the series. It is true. I got a big outflow of this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as a vineyard, a wild dueling animal, a super-hero, and Maureen O'Sullivan repeats his role in Jane's fantastic woman's love (who sports two-piece clothing for the first and last time here). In my review of "Ape Man", I looked at Jane pretty well with her obsessed clothes and her ceaseless yelling, but she has been redeemed for me. Don't make a mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie and Jane is the most capable character. He acts as Ambassador of Holt and Tarzan, can act excellently in the jungle and come together with animals, and he knows how to keep the angry lion proud when he is out of the balls. She has even been able to shout her jungle. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. He's completely trained. Cheeta is also very charming, taking Martin out of a cigarette. The plot is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to battle the jungle's most charming animals, especially lions, crocodiles and nose. Impacts, albeit always visible, are much more dynamic and cooler and work well. Oh, and you can't talk about this movie if you're not talking about a naked swimming scene. All I can say is: Yes, she's naked. Very exciting stuff. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. When it comes to a sub-dirty / pre-code / adventure, there's nothing to keep the candle "Tarzan and His Mate". The unavoidable sequel of Tarzani, Ape Mani, is a kick-ass, violent and risqu√© jungle race. I doubt there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that will not take prisoners as it is. You would find it difficult to find a complete scene in the movie that would have been approved by code, or the animal rights that have been approved on this issue. Frightening violence does not wait until a happy jungle couple appears before it even pushes the boundaries of today's adventure movies. And after the T&J enters the picture, there are many early mornings and the ass is floating naked in the afternoon. See it yourself if you don't believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan the most in this movie. In the first film, Jane seemed like a walking conflict, as did the writers not knowing how to portray such a character. But here he is the great predecessor of the woman of the later cinema. Although he still needs Tarzan's help to get him out of most jams, he does much more than just waiting to be rescued. His personality is completely believable for a woman who lives (relatively) a year in the jungle. I watched it with my mother and I enjoyed how much Jane had "trained" Tarzan, as Jeff Foxworthy did. He's completely on the prowl with him and every caller. Although the entire film has many dated optical effects, there are still many hair-raising Taran and predator battles that are executed (mostly) real. This and the men's monkeys are more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The movie draws when the jungle breaks with the shocking animal kingdom violence that leaves Tarzan and Jane's only two people still breathing. While the couple is riding over to the sunset again and wins, I can't imagine how this story sees the next safari who hears a lot of people who went to Tarzan and Jane and have never heard of them again. ** END SPOILER ** One thing that still disturbs me is Johnny Weissmuller's smooth, hairless coat and over-style coif. In addition, it is a pre-code action adventure, which you should definitely not bypass. <br /> <br /> Last movie: It happened one night (1934). Next film: 20th Century (1934).
