I consider myself a huge movie buff. I was sick on the couch and beat me in this movie. Directly from opening to the end, I looked at these great actors scary, I never saw a big word. Filming was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope this message will be heard on other bad comments. The director has a heart and he strikes his participants. Thank you for making such a movie. Just cumbersome, beautiful characters who are both faulty and graceful. Just great. I can't play it without 10 lines, so I'm just saying I want more of this director, more of all the film's participants and more of the writer. I didn't want to finish it. End
