When I first got my N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with it and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved it! The graphics were great by the time, a good plot, great courses and all that, the best music I heard in Nintendo. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the plot completely, but I think Bowser will rob Princess Peach and Mario must save her. The game is to get 120 stars from the churches to the castle. Each had about five or six challnges to get the stars. There are secert parts of the castle where you can get more stars. * I think it is possible to win Bowser on three levels. * Allows you to start with characters. Mario is the main character and gets useful tips so that he is basically one of your only associations. I heard Luigi and Yoshi are the main villain in the game, Bowser, and there are a number of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really big. <br /> <br /> People say gameplay is more important then graphics, and I agree perfectly.But with him a big plot, there's great graphics. Especially it's time.I have a whole host of other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics Not Compared to Super Mario. The right colors, great effects and fantastic sound effects. I found the water graphics very good. The next Bowser world is the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now, music. This is my favorite part of the game. Growing up when I played it at a young age, I'll be happy to play the game all night so that music would make me sleep. Especially the music of Jolly Roger Bay, which was calm and wonderful. There are others who are great, too, again, with the worlds of Bowser. are the ones that stay with me the most and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite time as an evolving player and I love it. This game is 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GAME GAMES!
