The Vignette series, most of which violate the 1970s television, but also some excavations in government and corporate America. One of the longer segments, "sellers" is not funny to me and I don't know what this is a parody. Some others, however, are absolutely half-split. I especially like cooking show. Most of the known nasty words are used in the movie and if you do not agree with full front nudity, stay away.
