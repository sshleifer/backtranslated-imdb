I looked at this example when I was a little girl. Although I don't remember much about it, I have to say that it was a pretty good show. I also don't believe I've seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I remember the theme song. Everything was perfectly cast, the costumes were great. The performances were also top-notch. I hope some networks will bring this series back one day so I can see every episode. Before I seal it, I would like to say that I always remember this memory forever, although I don't think I've seen every episode. Finally, when and when this exhibition will ever be returned to the air, I hope you get it one day before it gets into the air.
