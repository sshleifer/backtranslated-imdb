It's great! Robert De Niro and Cuban Gooding have created a powerful and very influential film. This is a true story of the first black US naval diver and the obstacles he faced when he obtained his racist Master Diver certification. Along the way, he has to face all his classmates who don't want him in his class. They go out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he gets certified and continues his excellent career as a US Navy diver. Check it out! It is a great courage and honor. As the story comes out, let's see that racism is slowly dispersed and everyone starts to respect men one by one.
