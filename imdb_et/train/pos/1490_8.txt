Everyone has first love, and while it is difficult to define that feeling when you are younger, it is within you. That's why Malaysian filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad wants to prove it in his fourth film, which proves the most emotionally simple and straightforward emotions. <br /> <br /> This approach is particularly convenient in this case because the love story at the core of the film involves two children of twelve years old and therefore they try to make the "deeper" analyzes viable and pretentious. That they are also not witnessing the amazing performances given by the leading non-actors, Sharifah Aryana and Mohd Syafie Naswip. The former plays Orked (already in Ahmad's previous picture, Gubras), a living, almost rebel girl who may have been influenced by her "British" upbringing (mother studied in England), despises playing with dolls, preferring to play violent sports events with boys. Then, one day, he meets Mukhsin (Naswip), who has come to rest in his aunt's house, and suddenly changes his habits: goodbye fists, good cycling and climbing trees. But what does that mean? Are they just friends or is there anything more that neither of them is ready to understand, let alone that? <br /> <br /> Considering the youth of the main characters, answering these questions is impossible, and as in many "smaller" films (remember Lost in Translation), there is no actual closure, a choice that leaves fruitful, but ultimately satisfies the aftertaste: naturalistic, The unfiltered action (especially Aryana) gets into the heart almost immediately and with strong support (most of the Orked family) helps keep the minimalist narrative fun and seductive. The approach close to the ground is not always so effective (the fun submarine of the adulterous neighbor has left too early), and at the beginning it is difficult to justify the bizarre Pulp Fiction reference, but the emotional strength of teenage romance is enough to make it an interesting independent cinema in Asia.
