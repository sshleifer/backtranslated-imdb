I have to agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? drama? for me, this bowed slightly to comedy. I could have been a big movie without a comedy and it was terrible. Jamie runs to Julio and his name. How many times in New York did you find someone you know in the center of Cleveland. And how could Robert Pastorell gold conceal the Yankee stadium. Again, comedy or drama? But it was still fun, especially on Sunday morning. I liked the performance by Kimberly Elise, probably a beautiful actor, and she seems to be taking her craft seriously. She is a younger actor who is viable.
