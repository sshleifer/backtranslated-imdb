So, what's the reason? Is there any kind of brother against this AWESOME show or related person? Why would the best year I have seen? I'm addicted. I accidentally saw this show last fall and loved it right away and watched it every week. Then it went away and I tried Tivo, but it was not transmitted. So I forgot about it for a while until I found episodes on the ABC website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - the rest of the television is refreshing to see something so round and advanced. I look at Boston Legal with his eccentric comic and House for intellectual mystery. My wife loves Gray's anatomy for her "realism" and I love / hate the show, but it can't prove to me any more. Too much drama. Everything that can go wrong. But once there is a drama that is really real. Real people, real problems. Of course, there are some extreme features like the former gangster is good, the girl from the mobile etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are really there and I am each of them. I don't seem to be enough. I just hope ABC gets its head out of its bean-counting butts and continues this show. Take no respect for the existence of a QUALITY Drama. It can be one of the best exhibitions of all time. If anyone just allows it.
