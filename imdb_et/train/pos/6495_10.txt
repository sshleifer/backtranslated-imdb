Of the 10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary must be visible, war films that people haven't seen for years until it was screened in 1974. something, some clips left me dumbstuck. The entire series is longer than 20 episodes and Sir Lawrence Olivier is a narrator and talks about a stunning war. It's still probably the best documentary of the war, and now the over 25-year-olds are still capable of packing a huge blow. You have to watch it for a while, even if it is some episodes, even if you are still blown up by this documentary for those who have suffered and died under the name of war, in the war world.
