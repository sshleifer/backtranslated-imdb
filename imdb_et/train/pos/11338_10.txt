I saw it in "Dancing with Movies" and it was fantastic. I really felt Jake. Talk about adding insult to injuries! Your parents are not divorced, but after that there is a monster. <br /> <br /> It was as cordial as it was scary - there were several moments where the audience was screaming. It reminded me of the Japanese horror film except that the story was actually good. <br /> <br /> And that is what separates the "Jake cabinet" from the usual indy movie - a great script with compelling characters. Also, when the horror elements are mixed with family drama, the film gets the best of both genres and avoids both clich√©s. <br /> <br /> If it's not in the theaters, get a DVD.
