Movie is frustrating, not necessarily bad. I am very willing to watch a depressing movie if there is an idea of ​​what it is and it certainly has one. It is often a heartbreaking story about a Chinese man and his family because they have many difficulties and many years. BUT, I have to warn you that it may just be Hollywood's most depressing film that came out in the 1930s, because the life of Chinese peasants was little to say. Get ready to look at segments of famine, death and disease. <br /> <br /> The only downside, except the constant tone, is that the leader is Paul Muni. Although he was an exceptionally talented person, it is really shameful that Hollywood is always playing European leadership in Asia in this era of Europe. If we pay attention at all, it is quite obvious that Muni is wrong for this part.
