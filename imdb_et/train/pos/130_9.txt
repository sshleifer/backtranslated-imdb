In October 1945, Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in Frankfurt after the war, and his bitter Uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) becomes a sleeper on the Zentropa train line. . Studying his train, his profession, he sees the destroyed occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of a former powerful transport operator and owner of Zentropa Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between the Allied forces and the Germans and finds out that there is a terrorist group called "werewolves" who kill allied supporters and execute allied forces. He falls in love with Katharina and earlier he says he was a "werewolf". When Max commits suicide, Leopold also pushes "werewolves" and must take a position and a decision. <br /> <br /> Europa is an impressive and appealing story of Kafkania from a large Danish director, Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style that resembles Fritz Lang and alternating with the great black and white cinematography with colorful details, this film describes the difficult period in Germany and some of the problems that this great nation faced. Very impressive action by the occupation forces, destroying resources that allow for a faster reconstruction of the destroyed state and corruption with a Jew who should detect Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an amazing power in the role of a person who wants to remain neutral, but what everyone manipulates everywhere. Max Von Sydow's hypnotic narrative is another class touch on this film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europa"
