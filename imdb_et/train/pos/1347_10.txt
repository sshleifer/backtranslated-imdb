A tremendous, exhaustive and passionate summary of the American cinema seen through Martin Scorce's eyes. Needless to say, there is never a dull moment throughout your 4 hour working time. Many genres, periods, and leaders are reviewed, discussed from a cinephile perspective rather than a contemporary director. For anyone who is far from interested in American films or cinema in general. Masterpiece and Best BFI Century of Cinema Series. <br /> <br />
