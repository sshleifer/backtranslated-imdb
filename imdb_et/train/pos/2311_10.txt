Reese Witherspooon's first film. I loved it. The plot and the actor were the upper limit. You are emotionally involved with the characters. I think it has to look. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, you'll see why Reese Witherspoon's career has been so successful. Other cast members also do a good job. <br /> <br /> The film is moving very well. The whole picture is not a dull moment. The man in the moon is just right. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think this movie was great. I've seen it many times and enjoyed every view.
