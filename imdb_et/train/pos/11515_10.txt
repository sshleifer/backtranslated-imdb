It has been so many years since I saw it, but I feel compelled to protect this pearl against those who are shepherding it. I think this humor is. It's subjective. It will pay you 60 000 volts through your funny bone or leave you cold and wonder why you gave it. unfair and the result is fun. Dialogue and visual comedy are beautifully delivered and two leaders (Cleese and Lowe) are great together. This was done for them. <br /> <br /> I can no longer say anything to ask you to find it and watch it. You do not have to be disappointed and in a world where there are no gentle humor, it is a classic angel and harmless comedy.
