I loved this outgoing Republic series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even hard, the picture quality was not the best, but OK. The guards in this series are also a bit bad, but not terrible. They should have done something else. As I said, the story is great! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Don Oro is! Theme music is great! This is the same man who serves the Walt Disney Zorro version, which serves the Legion's music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and so are legions! I highly recommend this series. Buy! <br /> <br /> I love Reed Hadley playing Zorro! He's funny, smart and brave! Mark: 6.
