As I said in my comment on the first part: these two films are better than most science fiction fans. <br /> <br /> The second movie scenario is not what moves because we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath of thousands of refugees fleeing in small space cans is protected by just one powerful spacecraft. . Okay, he's got a little bit of Mad Max, because everything they fight is fuel from their spacecraft to travel to find the distant Earth, but it works for me. It is an exciting Science Fiction entertainment with fine actors and decent special effects (although they tend to repeat themselves, saying at least :-)). <br /> <br /> I would have loved going on Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we got a second stage without name markers who proved that the story had worked before, especially because the feature tags were so well chosen ... <br /> <br /> So a little below the 1980s productions, but 1978. for two movies.
