In the old western part, men who live in violence and women who hold their breath always live. The famous city visitor, Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum), has been hired for citizens to get rid of weapons (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), Baronland hoodlums. There he meets (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), his boyfriend (John Lupton), Marshal (Henry Hull) and Saloon owner (Ted De Corsia). Clint has been appointed as an attorney for peace and makes some cartels say: ¨Warning of weapons or other weapons in the city is forbidden. Check all hardware in the routing office ¨. Clint finds her former girlfriend, Jan Sterling, who is responsible for the Saloon girls (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them). But the city council is afraid of Clint's raw methods. Finally, the king's land owner appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his hands. <br /> <br /> This is a tremendously exciting story of sheriff-hired workers who had yet another killing. It starts slowly in the west, but follows us with dark letters and a strong plot. The story is almost gloomy, the guy comes to town just in time to make sure it is in civil society, but later the events get worse. Burning and climate change in Saloon are highlighted at the end. The phenomenal and great role of Robert Mitchum as an angel and a bitter armed force is his entire exhibition. A lively and lively musical score by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Atmospheric Cinema, Black and Lee Garmes. The film is amazingly realized by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Three in Attic), who made a good Western invitation to the gunman and Sane Gray episodes. From this point of view, the observed results of Western countries.
