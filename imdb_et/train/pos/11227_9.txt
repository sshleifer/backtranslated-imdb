Hidden borders are more than fanaticism - it is a well thought out and organized series that keeps the Star Trek worlds alive and growing. From fun small fan projects to the present, it's a well-known network series; Hidden Frontiers has a little something for every star traveling fan. Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager Time Lines The hidden border has themes and issues raised in other Star Trek series that have stories created using well-developed characters, plots and story. The Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken stories from the social context that Gene Roddenberry failed to bring on the screen and has shown the development of characters in long-term spatial commitments - real things that take place as close as possible and exciting spatial wars and conflicts Sci-Fi addicts know and love. Produced in the studio "Green Screen"; Hidden borders bring the screen and your heart to the normal roll. The great ensemble of actors plays well together and loves giving the project time and energy. The use of green screen technology, props, compositions and costume inventions makes Star Trek's hidden boundary worlds fun and credible. Hidden Frontier has gone where he went to the sci-fi world with a little treadmill and flourished when they got there. The hidden border is a great thoughtful website bonus with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and actor staff, and a fun weekend. I recommend downloading and watching time.
