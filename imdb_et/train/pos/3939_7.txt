According to John Ford's lyrical image, Abraham Lincoln's fictional bioopia is that his biggest mistakes can be obtuseness to a woman and the ability to dance "in the worst way." The Ford camera is only commendable to reveal Mr. Lincoln's early life. But what the film does not have the complexity of the character, it makes beauty and depth of vision. Characteristically beautiful compositions of early film that could have been gorgeous still-shots, Ford has a unique eye story. The movie sings about the life of a promising young man. Henry Fonda plays contemplative and spontaneously smart Lincoln, one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film concerns two young men, brothers, who are both alleged to have committed murder. In the classic angry mobile style, the city decides to take justice and defeat their pairs until the honest Abe comes to fear. He worships them with his humor, saying that they do not rob him of his first big case and that they are as good as his boys' lawyer. The following seems to turn into a sketch of all court-murder-dramas, because Abe listens to witnesses to the joy and humor of a judge, jury and city before he stumbles on missing links. <br /> <br /> The film looks like many John Ford movies: a tablespoon of Americana, a dash of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that you are not sure whether you put a recipe or Ford did it yourself. Despite the feeling of "Hollywood" appearing on the film and the excessive patriotic torture of Lincoln's future presidency, the film is completely enjoyable and enjoyably designed to take away your drama salt with a blade.
