Young Mr.Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures one of the most respectable figures in American history. Henry Fondal had a difficult task to portray a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough to care for people. Maybe the actors are the best. See how he unanimously stops lynching-mob.Ilice Brady is a fantastic simple farmer's wife. Most of the last part of the film plays out in the courtroom, and there is the only negative thing I can say about this movie. Most of the judge and spectator characters have so many peoples humorous traits that interfere with a serious trial that is at hand. But I'm used to it because humor is a trademark of Ford. The parts supporting Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
