It's 2009 and this way, the underrated pearl hasn't lost anything it had 31 years ago. It combines quite a lot of different characters and stories without being full. <br /> <br /> Clothes and music have changed over time, but in the end it is a story that never loses its structure - the power of the game. And especially this movie does the job quite well. Of course this is occasionally cheesy, but also very touching. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster's performance is striking and shows that she is a naturally born actor who has shown her true potential especially in her earlier films. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it.
