BASEketball is fantastic! It's fun and so funny that you're laughing at your pants. I've seen it so many times when I've stopped. But every time it becomes more funny. <br /> <br /> Trust me in this ... BASEketball is a sure hit and I loved it and still love it. I hope one day a special edition of DVD will be released! <br /> <br /> Ten thumbs up!
