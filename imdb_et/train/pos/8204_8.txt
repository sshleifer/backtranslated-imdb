The sudden effect, in my opinion, was generally better than Enforcer. It was a structure to be a great movie, but then I saw the villain (s) and I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sudden effects were different from previous ones. The plot in this film was different because Dirty Harry does not take this police approach this time. We will not see the frog (s) until later, which means that there is less time for them, which is better for us all. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood once again steals Dirty Harry. . Pat Hingle was enjoyable as Chief Jannings, Harry's new assigned boss. It looks like Bradford Dillman turns his name to Captain Brigg, so he was no different. Michael Currie is decent as Mrs Donnelly, Harry's annoying boss. I personally liked Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, a young punk with Harry. Albert Popwell was great when Horace, a friend of Harry. Audrie J. Neenan was good at Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian town. Jack Thibeau was well-perverted Kruger. Now really a bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's long-time lover, was terribly unsuccessful as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just as terrible as Mick. <br /> <br /> The film would have been so much better than writing and working some parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10
