The film mainly focuses on bullying the Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who accompany him. In the midst of the capture of mediocre bulls, this is the end of a tragic era of pointless killing and is full of drama and regret for both buffalo and Indians. Taylor has been blinded by his hatred of the Indians and his na√Øve that the buffalo herds never disappear. In one scene, he lets the animal after the animal, while in another he kills the Indians and then eats with the food they feed on their fire. Under this ruthless look, there is an insecure person who is begging his fellows (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. This is not the most enjoyable film, and is considered by the drama created by it, which leads to a buggy and very appropriate conclusion.
