This is one of the most relaxing, relaxing and beautifully made animated films I've ever seen. All the beautiful music in the movie makes sound and music feel in the movie! This film is not just great for kids but also for adults. It teaches you lessons, such as never forgetting who you are, you can do whatever you do, and bold and courageous. This film can also cry from time to time, which is always a nice touch in the movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some movies will give you after you see them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With its voice, 9/10 stars for the great idea of ​​animation, music and film, it gave me the whole spirit!
