Tiempo de valientes is a very fun task comedy. After a great fist in the movie El fondo del mar and the spectacular TV program Los simuladores, Damian Szifron did another great job. Tiempo de valientes is waiting for moments in Hollywood .Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two big actors and they have great performances here. The movie is very fun and funny and has great moments. Tiempo de valientes is a very entertaining comedy that I fully recommend if you want to be great and I have to congratulate Sifron on all the talents. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
