I loved watching it. I had no idea it was part of a larger series. I had to be on TV for 6 years. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep enchanting thing that was clear about what was in the presidential bath toys stack. My parents had taken it off the TV when it was originally delivered to NBC. Also on the tape was the old Sanka coffee trade with some other. I plan to return home sometimes soon and try to save the tape to my computer so that those who want a copy can do it. If anyone would like to contact me, I think you can do it through the IMDb site. I'll keep you updated and let you know if I have a digital format.
