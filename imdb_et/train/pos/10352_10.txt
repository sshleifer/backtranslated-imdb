The religious army is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. <br /> <br /> Dingo grabbed the child and the mother tried and sent to jail because she had "killed" her child. I don't want to spoil the story, but before you get deep into the knee, you need to know the basics that caused that woman to jail. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent a movie and discover how people who are different continue to thrive around the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very moving movie with a terrible number of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with his famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his mother tongue, are outstanding. People with supportive roles are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> You remember this movie for years. <br /> <br /> Look at it!
