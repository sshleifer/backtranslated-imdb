I've been waiting a long time for someone to film H.G. Wells is a faithful version of Wells' classic "World War". Timothy Hines has finally done it! I just couldn't believe how good it was! I can't say enough about the actors, the costumes, the special effects of this world! Dramatic, intense, full of top-class performances! It must be believed. I'm not sure. And I've read all the other negative comments and can't believe what they said. Do we have to watch another movie? And those real bad comments about this vampire, whoever he is, well, he just doesn't know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, mr. Hines.
