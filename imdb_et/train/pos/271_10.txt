It's all about Mitzi. I loved her in that. And didn't he look fantastic?! I love these Lifetime Sunday afternoon popcorn movies. It's like one of those nylbitters where they always irritate the most irritating times. Richard's character was absolutely scary. I am such men. Well, not exactly that lol. I want Zack not killed. She was cutie and her eyes very simple. I love these stalker-type stories. It always puts me up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband does not usually like this type of film, but actually sat with me all the way and really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see what Mitzi's next is doing!
