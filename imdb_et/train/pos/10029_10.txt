Why do people skimp on this movie and not horrible movies like a godfather. Titanic is the 21st century's biggest film. Great actor, leadership, effects, music and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by everyone, because someday somebody said he didn't like it anymore, so most of the world decided to accept it. There's nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie is not only the most Oscar award-winning film, but also the most money that has ever been made and, unfortunately, one of the least appreciated films I've ever seen. And it's the best movie ever. The only films that are close to the trilogy of all Star Wars and Lord of the Rings or anything to the masters of Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. All of them are good films and directors, but none of them match James Cameron's masterpiece TITANIC.
