We all create our reality or we? This is the fundamental question of exploring the illusional nature of this extremely original and masterfully designed reality. Mixing Eastern and Buddhist Philosophies with M.C. Escher, this exciting treatise can take the brain's question "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?" And make it exciting and fun for 100 minutes. The film focuses on Bart, a writer struggling with his scenario "The Sea That Thinks". When he is sitting on his computer, the work begins to be nothing more than a description of his computer sitting, writing a scenario. Before long, he is stuck in a vortex where everything he writes becomes a reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a bad sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of amazing visual tricks that face the nature and validity of our perception. Ultimately, de Graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to ask whether something we see or touch or taste is really what it seems to be, or whether all our understanding of the universe and our place is just a trick that we play in our senses. .
