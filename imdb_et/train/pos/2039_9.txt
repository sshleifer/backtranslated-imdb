First of all, I would like to point out that people who have criticized this film have made some outstanding mistakes. Something with a rating of less than 6/10 is obviously pointless. <br /> <br /> Creep is a fantastic movie with amazing movie effects. The actors are very believing, narrative thinking provokes, and horror and graphic content are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> There are many mystics in this movie. Many questions arise when the audience appears on a strange and stupid creature that changes the habitat in tunnels driven in dark rats. How was Craig created and what happened to her? <br /> <br /> A fantastic movie with a great flour factor. A movie with so many unanswered questions and a movie that needs to be evaluated with others, like 28 days later, a bunker, dog soldiers, and death leader. <br /> <br /> Look forward to more of these fantastic movies!
