Vertigo co-stars Stewart (last time as a romantic leader) and Novak raise it, Stewart's second "Christmas movie", top-level entertainment. Chemistry between the two stars creates a relatively mobile experience, and the film becomes an additional revelation when sorcery is seen as a metaphor for personal pain that prevents many people from engaging. All in all, a nice deviation from the legendary characters, 7/10.
