This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese Fantasy Movies, you should love it. This film is an Asian master of rings: a story of high fantasy based on actual Chinese mythology. (I understand that many critics have called this film plot less, I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, it should be your alley. This movie is still very difficult to find in the United States, even though it was purchased for US distribution with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Worth looking !!! This DVD is also worth owning.
