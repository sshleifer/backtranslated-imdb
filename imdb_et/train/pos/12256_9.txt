Kate Beckinsale is an excellent manipulative and irresistibly charming Emma in this Jane Austen novel TV adaptation. When I read this novel, I was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist was worth reading the hero of the story: for honestly, he is so terribly self-righteous and pondering that the temptation he does not like him seriously. Kate Beckinsale's interpretation, however, rescues Emma from saying that she depicts a complete view of the innocence and generosity of all of her character, and one cannot help but like (not to say love) despite her less pleasant qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not the only, reason why this TV series is so pleasant; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, expressing this character in his personal magnetism in its entirety (which is more prominent because Ewan McGregor has not worked very well with his mother McAregor in 1996), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are all the way they should respond. In short, this production is a great achievement and one that can be seen many times.
