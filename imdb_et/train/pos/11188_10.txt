I'm a big fan of Stephen King and this movie has given me even more King's fans. Pet Sematary is from the family of Creed. They've just moved to a new house and look happy. But behind their house is a pet cemetery. Creed's new neighbour Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial behind the pet cemetery. This funeral is pure evil. Jud says to Louis Creed that if you mated the burial place of a human being (or any pet), they will come back to life. The only problem is that when they come back, they're not the same person, they're evil. Soon after Jud explains all about Pet Sematary, everything starts to go to hell. I no longer explain because I don't want to give away the main parts of the movie. The action that Pet Sematary had had was pretty good, but he needed some work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it was so original and engaging. This film has many make-up effects that make the film more outrageous and scary. One of the most important reasons why this film was shivering was actually a make-up. In this movie is really a freaky one character. This sign is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the film about three times as accurate. Zelda is the sister of Rachel Creed, who died years ago, but Rachel is still haunted. The first time Zelda appears in the film is generally not scary, because she is not talking or anything, but the second time is the worst and frankly she scares the other living ****. There's nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary offers great fears, some pretty good actions, a first-rate plot and a mesmerizing make-up. It's really one of the favorite horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10
