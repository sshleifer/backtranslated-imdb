You know? Our spirit is based on this revolution, it's sleeping ... I can explain, I think! Well ... until it happened on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have the freedom of expression, but when we got this revolution, it seems that the Portuguese people lost their opinion, we do not use our freedom of speech! It's all a consequence of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the movie ... I think he has some bugs with some character behavior, but by the way I watch Portuguese movies is pretty good !! I like it very much!
