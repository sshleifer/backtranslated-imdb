Michael Jackson is no longer popular in the US, but he still has a lot of fans in Europe (especially in Germany). Many say it is a bad film, and that is: it has no plot, it's full of clich√©s, Michael praises himself constantly. <br /> <br /> BUT, you can't wait for a plot or non-clinic in such a movie! It's a fun visual effect and the music is perfect. Smooth Criminal Fragment - The biggest song ever filled, Moonwalks, group dance and even the famous "Michael Jackson's bench-over" - makes this movie one of Jackson's masterpieces, even with good looks (and white ...) Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> Jackson fans need black, black dance fans for music fans. <br /> <br /> However, as I am an MJ fan, I should warn all Michael Jackson of hating: DO NOT watch this movie, just make your hatred ...
