Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique film directed by the animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's cinematic and it's worth seeing. This is a lively action mixed with animation that is apparently influenced by Disney's legendary southern song, almost as if it were the answer to this flick. Later, Philip Michael Thomas received the Vice-President of Miami and the Scatman Crothers, who is most famous for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, for Don Johnson's race. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes that Barry White) is Thomas's friends and plans to get him out of prison. They've stayed on the police barrier, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about the black rabbit, the bear and the foxes moving south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated and offers many wonderful things. Like all Bakshi movies, most are annoyed and do not like animation. True animation players forgive their clunkiness and love its ingenuity. The film is very violent, very sexual, and it is mostly about races between races. For a long time I thought I was looking at something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I watched it, it seemed more like a soil color that was Superfly. It's very sloppy and doesn't really say anything. Besides, isn't Bakshi white? No matter what the answer, Coonskin / Streetfight is still very worth seeing fans of animation and film. 7/10
