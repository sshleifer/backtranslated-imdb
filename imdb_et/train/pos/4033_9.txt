Many observers have noted that Pinjar, unlike Bollywood, has produced a mill. While this is true, Bollywood films are generally targeted at a specific audience and should be evaluated for their achievement. <br /> <br /> But Pinjar is a great movie for those who want to change a standard equation-based Bollywood movie. Pinjar, placed on the Indian-Pakistani partition, focuses on a Punjab girl who becomes the victim of the social and cultural attitudes of women in the age. The protagonist, Paro, is forced to choose a life between a man who has kidnapped him and a short-lived life with his family in India, ruled by the Punjab. More than the Hindu and Muslim question, Pinjar deals with the role of a woman as a wife and mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films, which are top-notch in nature, Pinjar is a film that makes this audience look at these issues during and after the movie.
