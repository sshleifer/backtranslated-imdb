The last co-operation between director Anthony Mann and James Stewart (with the exception of a few days that Mann worked at Night Passage before leaving the company with a star less than in friendly circumstances), Far Country believes in his mainstream to offer another portrait of a tortured man. involuntarily against his redemption, fighting it at every step. This time he is the head of the cattle, whose response to work problems - the challenge of challenging cows at the end of the attack - is that his cattle are confiscated by John McIntire, a judge at the Faculty of Law at Roy Bean. Stealing them back and carrying them across the Canadian border, he will soon find that he undesirably throws up a growing contradiction between the prospectus and the judge because he deceives or kills them from his claims ... <br /> <br /> Although it is not a big surprise In what way Stewart finally turns, he is surprisingly tough on the road, even using his desire to just leave an excuse to warn future-oriented directors if he has a chance because he has no problem with him. For most movies, he and McIntire are really just the width of the hair, which the court immediately recognizes, revealing the spirit of a relative in the company, as he intends to defeat him.

Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (though Corinne Calvert's young romantic interests are irritating). Unfortunately, the Canadian Rockies' big cinematography is very little when the DVD broadcast is clearly average, but only the trailer of the theater.
