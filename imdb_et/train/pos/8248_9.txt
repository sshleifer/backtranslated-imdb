When you see the cover of the DVD, you are convinced that it is a cheap movie from some B-class cheese made in $ 1,000 in someone's backyard. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> It's a good quality material and really good. It's comedy and smart. It is also very touching in places where there is a good place. The production values ​​are very good (it looks good), the participants are known, the direction and sets of the film are great. It's amazing. Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Carrie-Ann Moss, who plays against the type, is terrible, like "Helen Robinson," June, a woman like Cleaver; Billy Connolly is great as a zombie "Fido" with a heartfelt heart; Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy", and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (checks) are great, too, K'Sun Ray as "Timmy Robinson," should not be ignored either. In fact, he probably has more lines in the film than anyone else. <br /> <br /> If I explain the story, it sounds so stupid that a few of you will watch it. You just have to take the word of the people who liked it and found it to be a very pleasant surprise. However, you have a dark sense of humor; absurd assessment.
