Tony Hawk Underground came to the point where the series really started to lose its luster, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not meet expectations and really left the series that Neversoft and Activision could do with a series that was different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced poisoning, which was very cool, because it made a whole new world for fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. The second feature introduced what the fans said quite a lot and was able to get away from the skateboard, which is great because now you can really climb, run and do all kinds of new things. <br /> <br /> Levels are good, Neversoft also improved the problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of the level design. The first two PS1, N64 and Dreamcast games were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features. Pro Skater 3 and 4 have been shortened because some of the added features have brought the systems too far. In this version, they shortened these qualities, there are not so many people who admire the streets, in fact, there are almost none on some levels, and there is little, but not much, in graphics and skating physics. <Br /> <br /> In this game, there is one con, storymode is a bit short, of course this is Neversofts for the first time with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. However, it is said that you will definitely end this game in one day. <br /> <br /> Generally, the great addition is very refreshing.
