Vince Lombard High School has a new principal - the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). He is going to ban all rock and role music. He hits the head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles), who loves Ramones. Also, the school's football team leader (Vincent Van Patten) doesn't seem to be involved with any girl - not realizing that cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with her. <br /> <br /> Current Midnight Movie. It was released to the public and bombed almost immediately - but as a midwife it was a big hit and it was played throughout the 1980s. I remember attending more than some of them when I was in college - it was like a party! People sang with songs, smiled all the fun and generally just fun. <br /> <br /> Now, as an adult, I can't imagine why I loved so much. The script is a minor and full of wilting that I couldn't believe I could hear. The characters change randomly and the movie goes all over the place. It saves some really funny lines and great presentations by Soles and Woronov (who have really enjoyed themselves). Everyone is also full of energy and playing their role as they should be. As for Ramone ... I was never a fan. I like the title tune, but the other songs never hit me. If you are a Ramones fan, you can give it higher. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mostly for children (with a PG rating) who are likely to find it stupid, but fun. Especially I think they like the high school at the end! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood for the silly midwife movie of the 1980s, you might want to do it. Otherwise, stay away. I'll give her 7.
