Alain Chabat is a beautiful actor, writer and director, but maybe it is a little wrong to take the "idea" of credit for the story that probably had run into the aisles when Aristophanes learned that it was "i" before "e", except after that c '. But as I said, Chabat is a beautiful actor and she can do the magic she needs. I am also gradually overcoming the reluctance of Charlotte Gainsbourg, who is also fulfilling his achievements. If you know absolutely, the "plot" is the guy who is well into his forties and more than the individual. It does not fit well with her mother and her five sisters and get them behind her, putting her colleague's sister on an "agreement" - fifteen thousand euros - for her new girlfriend, let romance come to succeed with the wedding and then hit her by getting her hooked. Of course, they put together, but along the way there is a dueling of Benedek and Beatrice, and all things are ninety minutes quite painless and the French box works so well that the sequel may not be a question.
