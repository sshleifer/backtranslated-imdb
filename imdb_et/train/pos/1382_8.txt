CÃ©line Sciamma's excellent first feature hasn't been said. Friendship, "want to fit", first sexual feelings ... All this and much more sublimation is through underwater synchronous scenes. <br /> <br /> All three girls try to find and express their personality very differently. This is a much less violent approach to understanding teenage years compared to "thirteen" but a very valuable trip. <br /> <br /> Must see and leave all American cinematic imaginations in his door. By the way, music is A +. <br /> <br /> Bon cinema!
