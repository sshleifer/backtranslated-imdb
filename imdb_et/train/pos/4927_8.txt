Only comment on New Orleans accents ... <br /> <br /> Earlier reviewer said: "This movie could have been shot in New York or some other big city in the North, because it gives us signs that say more than" broclynese "as perhaps a southern accent that can be heard in this part of the country." There was another comment from these lines by an English reviewer. <br /> <br /> Many New Orleans people are sounding "broker". I've never found why. (This is mentioned in John Kennedy Toole's "Confederation of Dunces".) I always appreciate movies in New Orleans that contain the details as they did. Too often, this is just the Hollywood version of the standard South Accent.
