I went to the cinema with two friends and picked this movie out of the hat without knowing what to expect. And it turns out to be a very pleasant, deadly laughing experience! This is a great movie with a very unexpected story, very good dialogues and crazy humor. All the characters are probably made in the style of "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comic), but it hasn't disturbed me for a second. In fact, this generation of losers made the film quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, including Willian Macy, Clooney, hardly recognizable and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He played the role of this movie in his life! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie is so much fun that it made me smother and die almost with him! Recommended for all "Alan Ford" fans!
