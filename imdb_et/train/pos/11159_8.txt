This is a great movie ... The first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dispersed with a fun-loving display of how men's and women's bass motivation differs (Vive la different!) <br /> <br /> You can love people despite this sometimes because of their weaknesses . People are a bit of garbage, but we have big hearts and we try our best despite the temptations. It is not our fault if sometimes we cannot resist temptation, it is just who we are. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, there is consistent style; sharp photography and sharp composition, very pleasant viewing, if you add provocative content, fit music and laugh out scripts. <br /> <br /> Watch the very young "lonely witty voice" ... brilliant; wisdom for innocence that balances comedy from the human situation.
