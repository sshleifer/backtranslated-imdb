I was very happy to go to Milan's Milanese movie. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood and succeeded in printing a film with the philosophy of Milan. <br /> <br /> The film talks about a standard career pair in Milan, starting with "birth" death. Birth weddings are so typical of all the schemes that become original and incorporate all the wedding competitions into a flash story about how the couple came to each other and felt love. Milan's "urbe" life is difficult, and after the sweet old days became tougher and tougher, finally the product: a child who further strengthens the couple's relationship, as it weakens today's "peculiar effect" metropolis personality. An advertising environment with all the "creative" stress in the atmosphere helps the plot to participate well. We lose the values ​​of life and it is reflected well and deeply in the Senza Pelle director's nice and sharp film. <br /> <br /> The actors are well-chosen, Stefania Rocca is a nice and well-characterized and a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, known as the "trash" TV series: Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
