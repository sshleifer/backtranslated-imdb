The industry dropped this ball. The trailer did not make the film fair and when it was opened it was full of screens. If people were able to see it, foot work would have made it very successful. Two leading actors give great emotional performances that really draw you into the story and especially the characters. I checked it through rave's recommendation by Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great movie that has never been completely released except on some screens. What gave her no chance to see. Some movies go to the video quickly because they are not so good. It is worthy of the Oscar and it is a tragedy on many levels, most of which have not even heard of it. Perhaps the next word will come from the DVD or cable by word of mouth. If you haven't seen this movie, you should do it. Two main actors have made this film. It could have just been a school-specific second teenage movie, but it is well ahead of other well-worthy films. The girl stopped remembering. If you like it you like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls have one amazing emotional scene after another without being melodramatic. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna cries through most of the film, it is so real that they do not come as stereotypical characters or melodramatic. The film moves you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor, use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better on this traffic. I hope both actors will get more roles that will use their talents and let them shine. Watch this movie and, if you wish, recommend to friends that it will not disappear every year from the explosive death. This movie was buried while the Spiderman 2 cup records. What word do we live in? AGHhh. So the world can see and recommend it again.
