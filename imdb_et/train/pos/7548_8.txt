Short but long enough, the Cat Cup is a very wild travel watch. One day I was just looking for my wish list through the anime section and found it and decided to watch it. I spent most of my time with my jaw agap. All the time I was thinking, or I had a short scream "Turn it out!". But I didn't. And actually I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Animation is stunning. Very artistic, odd and dark. Personally, I loved it for amazing animation, but behind the seemingly liberated story is equally convincing for me. <br /> <br /> A young boy - whether a cat - is looking for his sister's soul. In the first part, he is lying on the bed in bed and will soon be paid for by some gloomy humidifier. His soul is divided in half. One is back to the cat's boyfriend while the other half is gone. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie has disappeared a bit honestly for me. I hope they go back and their world is ... maybe slowly falling apart? Perhaps the answer to this is the lack of the soul, because the rest of the film contains the different stages of entering the world. First, there is a giant flood, and then it dries into the dark desert, and then everything freezes (thanks to what is God or fate as you can see). Then I believe they will find the sister's soul in the form of an orange flower. After that, the whole world will disappear. Haha, I didn't get it, but it always sends my backbone to my back. <br /> <br /> Despite seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there's a deeper message behind it, if you look at it enough and do some research. Personally, I love things like this, and I would like to do that just to understand it. But for some people this is probably not their way. It's very annoying, so if you like your direct back and forth anime, it's not a movie for you. But if you have an open mind, I highly recommend this movie.
