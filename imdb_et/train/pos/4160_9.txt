One word can describe this movie and it is weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Well it was, the film is about a young boy who goes to the universe to get a metal body so he can look for revenge. On the way, he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide whether he wants the body or not. It is very strange if you are a fan of animation / science literature that you might want to control.
