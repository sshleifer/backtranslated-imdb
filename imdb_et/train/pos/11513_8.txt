One of my favorite exhibitions in the 70s. Recalling it went on Friday (or maybe Saturday) at night in nine nets (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together. Each episode reached its peak when Kolchack had to hand to fight against some supernatural opponent. For their credit, the writers made concerted efforts to get the most out of the usual vampire and ghost virtues. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode where the opponent was the spirit of an ancient Indian chief who / who returned to the massive power that began to kill people at the hospital. The final showdown saw that Kolchack tried to briefly describe a "foreign beast" in the midst of sparks and flames. Oh well .... you had to be there, but that was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always offered a lot of energy and enthusiasm to his roles and it was one of his best. br /> <br /> It's definitely worth a place on the TV's Hall of Fame. To quote Tony Vincenzo .... "Kolchack, of which you are ON ..." Or the celebrity gallery "IN it"!
