I look at romantic comedies without hesitation because romantic comedies have old old clich√©s that make the movie interesting. Usually in a romantic comedy there is a girl and there is a boy, both in love, then there are worries and then win worries to get married or whatever. But this movie is a different story, it's really very different from the romantic comedies I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There's a widowed man (Dan), a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookstore and sometimes talks after Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for him and if that becomes meaningful, we can twist. Marie is her brother's girlfriend. Despite the conditions, Dan Marie flirts and understands that she loves her and even Marie loves her, but their love would not be easy. The way it is possible is the rest of the story. Steve Carell plays well, Juliette Binoche is good Marie. And all the other things are well done. This is a good movie, look at it.
