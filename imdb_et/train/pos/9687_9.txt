The parrot spoken is not a huge imaginative idea for a new film, but Paulie makes a simple idea a brilliant, heart-warming film that delights the whole family. It succeeds to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel karma at the time of the separation of Marie and Paulie, and all the events in the film lead to a very satisfactory emotional conclusion. Animal training is well done - everyone is affected when Paulie first spreads his wings and flies. Paulie is a great character and should have been more successful, even though this film was not a highlight of 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan. This one and a half hour is definitely cozy and memorable. Paulie's story is moving, sad, happy and interesting - from the moment she first sees that she has joined her original owner, you enjoy her and follow her for friendship and event events. tea. No missed if you have some heart or emotion. 9/10
