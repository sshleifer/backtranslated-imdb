Having read the reviews of this movie, I began to make sure that I think it was really good. But this is one of the best films I've seen for a long time. Most of the comments I read said it was too difficult to follow because of the difficult plot. And while some parts leave you confused, there are so many loose ends at the end that you feel hit because you have forgotten so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch" in the sense that it's not so funny (actually it's pretty dark), and it's much more intelligent, as you can see parts of different perspectives (and one of the best movies from scenes, Jason Statham spends five minutes with an elevator that has an argument with himself). The way it is similar to the two mentioned films is that it is full of memorable characters, especially Statham, who gives a great result as a leader, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the movie Speedos, but still delivers great performance. If you have the time and you have time to think about the movie and even look at it again, you will really see all the symbols and clues that have been made through the film. I think it's fantastic and Guy Ritchie is the director of his game.
