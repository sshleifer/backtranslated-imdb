I saw this movie the other day when I rented it, and I thought it was just another movie where the girl tries to prove the point, but Diane joined the box because she wanted to. I thought this movie was good. I gave it to 8/10. That's so good. Plus the movie Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even she's been just six.
