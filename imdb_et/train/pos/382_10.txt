One of the best movies ever made! Why he got only 7.6 ratings is a mystery. This film is a window to the world of black experience in America. It should be compulsory to look at all white people and all children over the age of 10. I suggest you watch it with "The Long Walk Home" as a companion. If you think the work of Whoopi Goldberg is "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Square", think again. Don't miss this movie that could have won the Oscar. (And read the book!)
