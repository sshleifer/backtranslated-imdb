This film was the first British teenage film to really deal with the reality of a violent rock-role society, not the 1950s teenage life paradise. In an attempt to celebrate the work of the Liverpool youth liaison officers, the title highlights that 92% of potential criminals who have been dealt with under this scheme have not committed another crime. But it just becomes a pretext for the next teenage drama until the epilogue of the film, where we are told that we should not feel responsible or apologized for such criminals, although they may seem confused. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker has a harsh detective who reluctantly takes the position of a juvenile liaison officer. This hard-boiled character is a typical role for Baker. At the moment, as a notorious fireball known as fireflyna and not like disruption of transmission. However, as in all good police dramas, he drives back all round with remarkable events, back to his original investigation. <br /> <br /> His first driver takes him to two little children, Mary and his home. Patrick Murphy (playing the real brother and sister duo) who is committed to a little theft. Here he meets Cathie (satisfactorily depicted by Anne Heywood) with her older sister, with whom she finally romanticizes. It quickly emerges that the primal environment of such urban centers is the growing area of ​​juvenile delinquency. <br /> <br /> Murphy's older brother, Johnny, is the leader of the rock-roll group. hoodlums. McCallum is making outstanding moves as an American mixed boy who is more indebted to Marlon Brando than the previous British star. One is reminded of Brando's Johnny, The Wild One, who led the gang of leather-covered rebel riders in much the same way as Johnny, his gang. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, earlier expensive criminal dramas such as the "blue lamp" are not so obvious. Instead, we have been given several well-drawn characters on both sides of the law when the drama and romantic interest of criminals between Heywood and Baker are at the forefront. <br /> <br /> The plot, although at times predictable, gives some memorable scenes. The disturbing effect of rock-roll music was played in a scene where Johnny surrenders his music, causing the police sergeant to be threatened. The most incredibly memorable film, however, is the climate class scene, where Johnny has been intimidating schoolchildren in hostage, including Mary and Patrick. Apparently, the Dumblaine massacre seems like this scene is all terrible. Understandably, this film is rarely inspired or available to today's audience.
