Writers Perry and Randy Howze compiled a very interesting story "Opportunities is". <br /> <br /> Using the idea that a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former wife's home several years later will take the plot to unexpected, pleasant turns. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr. gives a great result by helping Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Nealina as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio is the right chemistry for this capri, playing each other in a graceful style. I watched this movie several times on television and every time I found it most enjoyable.
