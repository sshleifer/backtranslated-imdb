"They all laughed" is one of the few movies I always recommend to friends looking for something ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the traditions of the novel of the past, but it seems to be more modern. Even the atmosphere that appeared in the early 1980s is not too much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole company so light on his feet that reality doesn't bring it underground. But this means that such a sweet little movie depends entirely on the actors to continue, and "TAL" is blessed with a dream that understands such a story. This is a film that wouldn't stay in memory for as long as it wasn't the great moments given by the excellent casting: Colleen Camp's concurrent call with John Ritter and his dog orders; Blaine Novak fires all the hair under her hat; and especially when Dorothy Stratten falls on John Ritter and says, "How ... weird." This is a piece of fluff that you don't want to scare too much about it, but it definitely leaves a light heart and a smile on your face.
