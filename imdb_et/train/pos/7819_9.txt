What a movie! I never imagined Richard Attenborough having such a movie. Gandhi has always left me indifferent to Ben Kingsley's performance and I have never considered Attenborough a particularly good filmmaker. But Cry Freedom kept my interest as some movies have recently been. It is an exciting, mesmerizing political film with big productions by Kevin Kline and young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays Donald Woods, editor of the South African newspaper, who interacts with civil rights activist Steve Bike. It begins with a complicated friendship, because Woods sees Biko as a black hatred of pride against whites. But Biko, with his kind words, fabulous attitude and full transparency, wins Woods and introduces him to the reality of Apartheid that Woods knew nothing. <br /> <br /> Biko is a decent, law-abiding citizen who altruistically opposes any prejudice and system that keeps his people down. One night, of an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. The authorities are trying to step up the matter because Biko has become a huge personality in South Africa. But through the efforts of Woods, the truth comes out. But what should be a triumph can only be a nightmare, as Woods and his family become targets of the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie is an interesting structure. In fact, he has two narratives: first he describes Biko's life and death. It is an amazing first half, dominated entirely by Washington's charisma, which can be his greatest performance. <br /> <br /> The other side, no less interesting, tells Woods about the move from South Africa to escape book publishing on Biko. Woods has become an enemy of the state, a forbidden person, which means that he cannot meet people or leave his country. In addition, the police constantly monitors it. Kevin Kline is also a great result in this second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is quite simple, the other makes interesting things by editing, giving feedback on Biko and the events that show repression against opponents. Black South Africans. Some may argue that this makes it more interesting, but for me the other side is as enchanting as Woods and his family are planning bold plans to escape from South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes were so heartbreaking were tears. George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa's score was definitely related to it. Although I've never been a fan of Fenton (unable to withstand Gandhi's score), I think Cry Freedom's result is one of the most beautiful cinemas. The film, thanks to its powerful image of married music, at times reached an incredible peak of emotion. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie for Denzel Washington. This is a film that has to be evaluated as a whole. In action, writing, music, editing, cinematography, the perfect synthesis accumulates to create the spirit of humanity in the ode. This film is worthy of the films, like The Pianist, Life is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
