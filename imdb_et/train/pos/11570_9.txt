Elmer Fudd laughs while he is sitting in his armchair and reading his comic, his dog is close to the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until the flea is bouncing. (The flea is dressed in a farmer-type dress with a big sombrero and with the title "A. Flea." She gets out of her telescope and puts the dog in place. (We see a big picture of the dog's butt and flea whistles in excitement, shouting "T-Bone!" And then he sings, "There is food in the corner, there is food in the corner!") <br /> <br /> It creates this cute but unpleasant a church that plagued a poor dog. Mute is fun when he reacts to fleas. <br /> <br /> His large dental drawings alongside his fleeing fleas are clever and the dog's dialogue made me laugh a few times loud. This may be a more funny dog ​​I've ever seen in a comic! A poor pooch who threatens to take a bath to NOT react when a stupid flea causes him pain. It is almost painful to look at, because the flea uses tiny, rabbit and the like in dogs. He puts the dog pieces behind the dog. It's brutal!
