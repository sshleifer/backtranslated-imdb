Wonderland is an exciting film that crowns the participation of the x-rated star John John Holmes in the brutal murder of Wonderland. <br /> <br /> Promoting a film misleads you to think that it is a romantic image of the porn industry. Boogie Nights and it's not here. In fact, with the exception of a few news references that John Holmes is a porn star and a brief installation of John Holmes' actual material, this film has been severely dramatic about its involvement in murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the movie is misled, it is a reality. All of the cast makers are great and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is astonishing at his ability to step on all of John Holmes's motives. I was absolutely convinced that I would see what John C. Holmes apparently saw and acted like in real life. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of John C. Holmes or like Hollywood, I think you enjoy watching Wonderland.
