I really enjoyed this movie. Shakespeare's Macbeth took a pretty dark story and packed it into original, often funny and fresh, modern yarn. <br /> <br /> In Kudos, how did the filmmaker bring modern NYC and Macbeth's very different worlds to Scotland with one roof. Conflicting worlds act <br /> <br /> really play game intrigue and comedy and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a part of the choir that doesn't exist in the game, but really helps jazz up. The end looks like small indies who have seen it shut down and originality.
