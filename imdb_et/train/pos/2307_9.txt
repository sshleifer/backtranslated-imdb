I must say that this film is truly amazing and warming up from the heart. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not so bad! it is so sweet looking that Dani falls in love and it breaks my heart and warms my heart at the same time, seeing that the court falls in love with Maureen. but it is even sweeter to see how much he cares for Dan. I have to admit, though I wanted him finally to fall for Dani. it's just so cute looking at her fall to her, I didn't want her to break her heart so badly. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen is in this movie. looking at her dying, I made a cry for the whole day. I just couldn't believe it. however, Maureen and Dani have never shown a loving relationship. they can really do something. I give this movie 9 because I didn't want the court to die, but it was still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
