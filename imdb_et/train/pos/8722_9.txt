For starters, this is a very funny movie with some crazy characters running around, which is definitely a laugh (see two Russian bugs). <br /> <br /> Bug Life is a classic Disney storyline, but it is one of the good things about the movie. Family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some kind of evolution to end up against grasshoppers. And it also has a couple of great voice commands by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course), but the most amazing is the movie's animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, great colors, every ant. Look out for different, beautiful backgrounds ... And Pixar's boys and girls made it all so realistic. All in all, it is a very nice job. This is the best Disney animation from Aladdin.
