When I saw ads for this, I thought, "NONE, WHAT IS NITE NONE DONE!" because he took the "fresh prince" slots. I love the fresh prince. But George Lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how not stereotyped. Carmen is a pretty good character, it's really funny to see how silly and hypersensitive she can be. I feel bad about playing maxi, he looks much younger than he really is! but max is a fun character and worked fine. and yes, angie is a bit stereotypical, but it has its funny moments. ha ha george he has a big head! skin, but it can also be very good. funny show! it should definitely be more frequent than at home.
