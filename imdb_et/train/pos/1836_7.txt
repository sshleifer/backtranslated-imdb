Time to hit! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir-Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast-Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by -Aatish Kapadia Rating - *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen? We've probably found this year's first boom in Shah 'Waqtis. Waqt has all the necessary ingredients for a commercial Bollywood fare that would require an Indian audience to click on the film. This is a movie that makes the distributor happy and contemplates his next Phoren visit! In this "Saga of Indian Emotions" we have three happy families (not always?). Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), a post-posted millionaire (don't ask, how! dedicated father. Ishwar must make a serious decision about his son's careless attitude to life's responsibility. His love for Aditya, however, leads to the postponement of his serious problem. However, when confronted with a situation that is testing its race with time, Ishar has no choice but to throw it out of Aditya's house, hoping that a new dangerous situation might make her life more conscientious. But this assumed solution becomes a problem in itself, as the division between the loving father increases and the gardens continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that this story offers plenty of opportunities to spread comedy and drama. So, at the pre-interval, there are initially funny, later annoying comedy Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and in the meantime, between Aby and Akki, go to the moments of your body! Writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original Gujarat game "Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu" on which the film is based) to keep narrative fluid. Dialogues tend to be contradictory from time to time. It doesn't help that the songs look like teenagers like acne and process. It is clear that a few numbers could have been done. On the control panel, Vipul says he has a natural story about storytelling. "Waqt", as well as his earlier debut effort "Aankhen", keeps you interested until the last roll. On a personal note, the course of emotions was nervous for me. However, as measured by the reactions of the viewers, it worked on the target. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Waqt" is all about performances that make up one overall score! Amitabh Bachchan is reliable as always. His energy is visible and so his age! Shefali places are finely nuanced and fit with the superstar at every step. Boman and Rajpal bring the house with histrionics. Priyanka has little to do with the heroine's perfect role. But if it all goes down, Waqt is a Akshay vehicle. I've always argued that Akki is as good as a suitable role for him. Put him in "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and he's fantastic, but "Bewafa" he's bad bad. Here Akki is probably his best. Whether it's his comic timing or his emotional finish, he's almost perfect. His fans also have a scene of activities! Ironically, his previous best endeavor was in Aankhen - with the same leader and Big B next to him! <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is not a memorable film. It is not one of the best films in our industry. But this is one of the masses. And while industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit, Waqt can just be tricked! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Trivia- This is the second successive film by Akshay Kumar after "Bewafa" where he performs during the production! <br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
