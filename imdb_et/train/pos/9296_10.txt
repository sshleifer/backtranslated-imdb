I love this movie. It's crazy, funny, violent, surreal, played with a crazy head and definitely not the usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If you don't find the movie entertaining, then I think it's not just your taste, so it's hard to write a review. <br /> <br /> Some of the other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, Princess Bride and Zoolander (I only got a second time). There are others, but my taste is definitely unusual, and I'm willing to accept that most people don't like to like that. I don't apologize for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have it. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters of this particular movie are well-assembled, verbal humor is fun, situations are interesting, action is very good (as if you were expecting a pain), although the script's deeds are not very high. The overall package makes for fun, funny, traceable, but violent entertainment.
