This is the biggest film I saw in 2002, but I'm used to distributing movies. It is rich and makes 11 short films of fine art. From technical information (elected directors) I feared that it had an anti-American basis, but ... it is a kind of personal (11 times) personal respect. <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: he can't "swallow his pride" and sees this event as a well-earned punishment ... It's really the weakest part of the movie, but it shows true freedom of expression throughout to the work. The strangest thing is from the almost conceptual film of Mexico ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. 9 of you are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me smile or cry or even left me stunned. I still don't know if the Imamura fabel is really related to the 11th of September disaster, but it's so beautiful that its finale is deeply "doing".
