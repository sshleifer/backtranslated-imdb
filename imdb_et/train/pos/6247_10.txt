Trailers of this film may show scenes of violence or sexuality, but these scenes are only rare fragments selected to attract audiences. Of course, they show the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> People who are constantly struggling at their jobs and lives, using the power they may have somewhere else, against others, against the notorious oppression. And at the lower end of the oppression chain, mostly women. <br /> <br /> This brutally featured movie, such as Hundstage, is definitely hard to face, but it has to endure such a life, even tougher. <br /> The film is technically similar to the short passages, but it consists of documentary episodes with people like your neighbor playing just the way they are. Without any shine and the most annoying without hopes. Its documentary style makes the film even more annoying because you realize that such people are there and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the look of a nice look. Nowhere does the porn industry have to do its work, where somewhere must go unreported domestic violence, somewhere in the hope that it must break. I certainly know such people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie without a funny scene (some may think that a disabled woman who repeats ten supermarkets is funny but it happens to be real) and without any melodramatic look at this movie. But it disappears when you focus on the subtitles I fear because the subtitles can't emphasize.
