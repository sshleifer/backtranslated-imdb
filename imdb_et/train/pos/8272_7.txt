The family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) goes to the family to meet in a distant house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit the tail while driving. It frustrates some locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (VERY slow) wrong. <br /> <br /> I was the worst when I started watching it. Most of the reviews on this site are extremely negative. Well ... I don't agree. It's not a horror movie first. Fear does not start even up to 30 minutes. It plays more like a family drama with horror elements. At this level, it's pretty damn good. <br /> <br /> First of all - bad things: the pace is too slow; Jake Weber is a terrible actor; Too many false sequences of dreams scares; The barely numbers of Wendigo's movie and the clear view we get at the end of wendigo is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good thing: pretty good dramatic script; Clarkson is a great mother; some great directions where scary sound effects are scary; a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the plot); pretty good Sullivan actor (only 10 times!) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending. <br /> <br /> I think many people are angry about this movie because it is being pushed as a horror movie about what it is not. So, if you ignore it, I think you like it. I'll give her 7.
