At any time, in a crazy world of horror, diamonds are made and one of them is absolutely astonished by its brilliant shine. It's no less than a diamond! This is a movie that is awful, awaiting, and in a dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say that one of my favorite horror movies of my time! And, of course, it probably contains the most terrifying horrors of the horror history! Every time I see a movie and it rises to the point where you know that inevitably happens, I try to remember exactly when I am afraid of my mind, but it will never happen; I never get it right and I find myself terrorized when I first saw it !! Now we have to say to scare such a fear fan, which is not just pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British feel their nuances, they are proud of the performing arts, they do not need any special effect to convey the atmosphere, they rely on a strong story of power and fear (in this case). proposals and expectations. Every single element is impeccable, from pieces, an example, a story, a threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran could definitely make a damn spirit, that's for sure !! Finally, note that if you do not like this madness for some demented reason, you do not know honestly what the horror is, and frankly, it does not deserve it. Thanks!
