Rated for strong language, violent content, and some nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> The Black Hat is one of the funniest, most original comedies I've ever seen. Touch.It is a shame that many people have not heard about this cinematography. If you manage to find this movie everywhere, don't be afraid to buy it even if you don't like rap music. I give the perfect 10/10. The only ones I currently think of are film, Clerks, The World Of Garp, 40-year-old Virgin and Amy Chasing. This movie is a fun stereotype of gangsta rap The film is a movie by Nina Blackburn, who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group NWH (N **** z with hats). Black Hat's fear is a great comedy movie and I recommend it even if you are not a gangsta rap scene fan. It's a shame that this movie isn't in the Top 250. <br /> <br /> Duration: 88 min <br /> <br /> 10/10
