William Shakespeare would be very proud of his particular version. Not only is it the best movie version, it is also the only complete version of Hamlet. Kenneth Branaghi Hamlet is just a genius. Not only because it was written by Shakespeare, but also because he had the courage to do the whole thing, even if it took just over four hours. <br /> <br /> We all know about the Prince of Denmark and his plot for his father's death, so I don't go into the details. I tell you, however, that the best part of this Hamlet version is not a breathtaking set or stunning, but an interpretation of the characters by each character. I doubt you will find a better Polonius than Richard Brier's delicious image. In addition, you can't go wrong with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. Also, Derek Jacobi, a regular adjustment of Shakespeare, is an excellent Hamlet antagonist. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to talk about Kenneth Branagh. He won the audience when he came to the scene with his first trip to Shakespeare, Henry V. He expresses himself to Hamlet. Of course, Olivier's presence was exciting, but I think Branagh's performance is wonderful. When you look at her on the screen, it is almost the same as she knew exactly how Shakespeare wanted to play the role. The way he was not put on the Oscar is the whole mystery. At least the film got some nominations and even a strange choice for the scenario. I think they know well when they see it. First of all, you'll never find more rich and rich production than Bard's best game. It is said that the technical aspects were fantastic. If you love this game and you are a fan of Shakespeare, you should definitely check out this movie. Even if you do not care about Shakespeare, they will visually hold on during the film's duration. You may not think you can sit through all this at once, but you will soon find out that stopping this movie wants to see it even more.
