It's a really fun movie. One of those who can sit and effortlessly watch when the plot becomes more and more complex; getting funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (his day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... All these well-known, high-quality actors acting like soap opera stars / producers. If you've ever watched a soap opera and thought, "How did they come up with this idea on earth?" I've seen it several times; and every time I watch it, the more I appreciate humor, the more I understand how well it really works. Don't expect the quality of the Oscar. It's a fun movie, not an artistic attempt to find a "man's inner man", etc. Sit back, relax and laugh.
