Grace Saving is a good movie with a heart in the right place. Grace has recently been widows and realizes that her late man has left her a lot of debt. He can lose his cute house and see no other solution to his misery than to start growing marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most of the viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people, most of whom would be neighbors. There is only one thing in this picture and this is the way this portrait represents the effect of marijuana on its user. It is obvious that none of the actors or writers of this film ever smoked anything. The way the villagers smoke after the common smoking is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It is in these scenes that wit is replaced by English, and that is a film that is still very enjoyable.
