This film is one of the black and black films of that time in the early 1930s before the Hoyts Code was enacted. This is the story of a young beautiful woman moving in New York and making her way to the top using her body as a tool to get there. who really does their job very well. Lily moves to New York and makes her business room for all men. Stanwyck makes outstanding results as a strong woman who uses men as one-off deals, hardly emotionally playing as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who has no love for mind but for power and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a bit different than the other movies I've seen because the background music is hardly heard. I believe it is just because it was then that people were introduced to the people of the film and the film of dialogue. The number of times when music is heard is at the beginning when it shows how it rises up on its disk. Filming and different scenes were fantastic! The director of this movie made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this movie real. <br /> <br /> This movie was all together with the right movie. The end of this movie was not as good as it should have been, but it didn't completely destroy it. The baby's face was the slow moving and perhaps some predictable part of the whole movie, for example, with whom she sleeps next. But this is a lovable movie that can be viewed more than once and recommended to some people and friends.
