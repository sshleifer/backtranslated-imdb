The story and music (George Gershwin!) Are wonderful, as are Levant, Guetary, Foch and of course Kelly. One thing is missing and this thing is a good lady lady. Sorry, Leslie Caron is bothering me. In any case, the plot moves despite its moving with the famous (and dignified) ballet. Oh colors, dazzling red, blue, green and yellow. Don't forget the hair. ; ) I just adore the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and the ever so brilliant ballet. <br /> <br /> So I think I'm trying to say this: Please, it all means seeing and enjoying it, because while it's not the best, it's MARVELOUS. But do not forget that you will not forget this other Gene Kelly musical 20-year-old girl who was just imprisoned after that.
