I just looked at the Role and what joy it turned out to be. Toby Malone's performance really looked out, I found myself really caring about what happens to Matt throughout the film, which is very fun, very pacey and a good combination of well-rounded characters, quite an achievement, given that it's a short run time. There are also many good twists, this will keep you away until the end. The other characters you foresee are completely crazy Tiny and lousy attractive Jesse. It may not be a huge budget for Hollywood blocking, but don't let you put it down, you could do much worse than check it out, you won't regret it. Good fun. 7/10
