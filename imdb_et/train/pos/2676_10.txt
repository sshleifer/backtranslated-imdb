Every day we can watch a large number of movies, soap ... on television. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great movie with real feelings and great actors with a great realist-director. For me, there are two films that everyone must see: the first is Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. The other is "Looture of Hope". As a human being, we must learn from humiliation, from the love of others, from accepting another civilization, from other ways of life. We must also fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid making decisions, criticizing; we just have to love our country companion. This great movie helps us reach John's (Lennon) dream: Imagine that all living people live in peace. These two movies are hard to see: look at them, but be sure you are injured but better. Great movie, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry of warranty, but also better understanding of others. Enjoy it.
