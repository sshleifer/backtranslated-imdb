The second review compares it to the cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, as well as aptly. Another review explaining the differences in comedy also enjoys non-critical and black comedy, which is also worth considering. <br /> <br /> Look at the whole thing, all three series. After all, all the characters are tied and the puzzle pieces are positioned like the Douglas Adams novel. Details and complexities are incredible. Thoroughly postmodern. Wickedly funny and amazingly tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skin or lack of objectivity. Thinking. Literally, figuratively and surreally distracting at once. The blackest comedy I remember. <br /> <br /> And most probably the most amazing thing I ever see.
