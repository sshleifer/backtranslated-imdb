I read the book and saw the movie. Both are excellent. Coal diamond is among the coal of this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and transmit their character intensity without errors. This movie should have been celebrating them. Shame in the studio to not let everything they had behind this movie. It could have been just a franchise. Publishing on DVD is a mandatory and worthwhile remake to restore this movie. Look for it in your TV guide and when you see it, be it late, look at it. You don't have to be disappointed. Make yourself a second - read the book (same title). It beats you. Times have changed dramatically from these days, or at least we want to think they have.
