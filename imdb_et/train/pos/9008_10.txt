I saw this movie without knowing what it was ... I am a fan of Branagh, even more of his Shakespeare films, and at first I saw it only ... and I finished my tears with my eyes because of the great, great serenity, values , impact and brave philosophy of Helena's girl's life. Recommended for people who are bored with TV programs (at least in Spain).
