[WARNING: INCLUDING SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend for whom his parents' sexual idea is terribly restless. He remembered when I reflected the audience's reaction to "Mother". <br /> <br /> People pulled when May (Anne Reid) was trapped in bed with his younger hunk, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later he saw sexually explicit drawings. I doubt that the audience was nudity or the content of the drawings so much annoying as the feeling that she saw women in the 60s enjoying sexual pleasure. <br /> <br /> Scenic Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundry", "My Son's fanatic") proves once again why he is one of the most common narrators on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not easy to take. This searing family drama is not a movie that you can claim to have enjoyed because it is raw, complicated and makes us very uncomfortable. Nonetheless, Kureishi and Roger Michell (who led "Notting Hill's" All Things ") are powerful good things about an older woman who understands that she will still enjoy the joy of life in these years. With a wonderful epiphany moment when his son, Bobby, asks him not to be difficult, Can you shoot back: "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not, <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves the Oscar nomination for her turn in May. It's subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. Look at Reid when you see Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in the pub. Or if he asked Paula to open the door after a catastrophic date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all the anxiety and despair of May. In the most devastating moment of the film, May falls on his knees in front of Darren, who is willing to do something for him, but asking him to be kind. This is a remarkable performance by a notable actor. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Michell's natural sound, especially when May and Toots first came to Bobby. It illustrates the cacophony surrounding May and Doke, which is welcomed by his family. <br /> <br /> This film sometimes reminded me of the honesty and rawness of Mike Leigh's work, except for "The Mother" hanging on a little sense of optimism to keep it afloat. <br /> <br /> My one unshakable: Michell's decision to give May and Darren's first love scene almost almost sensitive. Lovers stay away from focus while the white curtain gently slides in the foreground. And the only sound at the end of May is passionate. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely surround Darren's role, are plowing their way so ruthlessly into roles that are unfair to hide the almost primitive energy of their characters from the audience. Especially because Michell has no competition for making later sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't have very pleasant characters. We understand compassion with us, but it also causes the daughter to suffer. But I doubt that Kureishi wanted people to have a story with a pleasant people. I think his point was to uncover a family that has already split when something emotionally catastrophic happens. It is inconvenient in your bow and eventually unforgettable.
