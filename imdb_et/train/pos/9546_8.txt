Duo Yudai Yamaguchi ("Battlefield Baseball") and "Meatball Machine" led by Jun'ichi Yamamoto is probably a remake of Yamamoto's 1999 movie with the same name. I doubt I'll be able to see the original so I just dare to comment on it. First, what is the "Meatball Machine"? The simple, frivolous, low budget industrial splash friction is full of great makeup effects and gore. It's not something you need to write a letter to, but it's still fun when you type this cinema. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" follows a well-known plot of land. The boy loves the girl but is too scared to ask him. The boy finally meets the girl. The girl gets infected with a parasitic alien creature that makes her a cyber killer. The boy, in turn, also becomes this thing and continues to save his love. Does he succeed? Who gives the fuck when there are carnage and death when I'm happy. <br /> <br /> The piece is simple, relatively cliche, but it does its job well enough to set the film course directly between the bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There is a sub-block that focuses on how the girl who infested the girl came into her life. And yes, fortunately, it shows more violence. I am happy. It is something that is not expected from the budget line. It's not painful for the ears, but it's not quite good either. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the movie, in addition to violence and gore (as I have not mentioned enough), is cyborg designs. Compiled by Keita Amemiya, who works on creating extreme creatures and costumes for movies and video games. Necroborgs, which they call "Meatball Machine", look amazingly detailed. Without the use of CGI, Amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of meat and metal, which is painful in appearance. Allows you to make different parts of your body into cool weapons, such as saws, rocket launchers, bloodburns, and so on and so on. Although you can easily recognize the cheapness of a movie, necroborgs is an A-movie class. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo Iron Man" mixed with "Alien" made in low budget and extra ketchup mode. It's a tremendously fun movie that ignores modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and nailed.
