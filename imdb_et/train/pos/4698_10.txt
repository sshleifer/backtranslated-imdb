Just like wine, Johnny Dangerously gets better every day. This clever, clever, well-acted film can be very independent - but as a gangster genre it is truly outstanding. In fact, this is obviously the best kind of film ... the funniest looting of mobile movies and even the corresponding period - although this position is probably easier to achieve if its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and dull pseudo-comedies as "Jane Austen's Mafia".
