GOJOE accustomed to the habit, but the end result is very satisfactory. The story of a murderous samurai who is trying to redeem himself if it is feminine, but a dangerous samurai is worth more than at. There is a lot at stake here, from physical survival to spiritual salvation. The film may initially look a bit like other anime-inspired Samurai movies, but eventually it will get into mature / adult territory. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed. GOJOE is one of the best samurai films that come around Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (more about www.nixflix.com movie and other foreign movie reviews)
