Probably one of the most important examples of abrupt, dramatic episodes (in this case excellent terror balance) with a lighter thing, Shore Leave is the first real attempt on behalf of Star Trek writers to create a more fun piece of sci-fi, and although the formula is not quite correct in this entry (real the triumph is Trobbles with the 2nd season), laughs pretty fast when the viewer is ready to allow all the stupidity. <br /> <br /> Deviation from the tradition of the exhibition is not a decent mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk has found a perfect planet for his team to spend their free time: a well-earned break after three months of incessant work. The Earth-like planet (budgeted fact) is very tempting, but it only takes a few minutes before something strange happens: Dr. McCoy begins the vision of a white rabbit that seems to come straight from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon other people will experience similar things: the woman will meet Don Juan with a similar character, Sulul will have a samurai, and Kirk will face a double encounter with the past almost love and the man who used to choose him at academy. Throw a genuinely genuinely-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock have decided to figure out what's going on before someone gets in. <br /> <br /> The idea is classic: an idyllic place to be far from heaven. An episodic sense of humor is quite successful, not in the case of blind events that do not sit well with the rest (of course, all ends up well) and cast a general unwillingness to show a more funny side (especially and ironically, otherwise fun with William Shatner). And yet, Shore Leave deserves praise for being another good example of writers seeking new, unprecedented things: a definition of Star Trek's success. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
