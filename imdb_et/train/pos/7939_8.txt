If it's nice to watch a movie, the whole family can look together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marry in Las Vegas with a whim and not only have to break news for their children, but then try to get their homes together (both have two boys and two girls) into a single family. What happens when a group of four teenagers, two preteens and two younger children, first makes a miracle when Carrie and Jim have ever gotten luck. The struggle between children (and one little love relationship between the two) makes one wonder if everyone can ever come. More interesting than Brady Bunch, which is a completely enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
