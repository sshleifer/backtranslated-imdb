He never realized that Charles Boyer (Luis Denard) appeared together with Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) in the film and enjoyed their great action. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) played a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that made him go. This story is about Republican courier Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and is trying to break a coal mining agreement that causes great damage to other countries. Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) assists Luis Denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then helping him escape from the Angry Mine Workers who threatens his life. The real bad guy in this movie is Victor Brann (Licata) "Beast with Five Fingers", who delivers excellent performance. Great classic 1945 movie without Humphrey Bogart.
