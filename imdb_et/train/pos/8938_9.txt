The biggest book sold and the Saksh Broadway game, which is Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters who lived for over 100 years, and a wonderful film version and talked about the story of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll have very good results, such as Bessie and Sadie. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, a white New York Times reporter whose article about nurses launched a book, and so on. Many setbacks of scenes and even many today are very powerful, if not quite inspiring as in the book. This is the only real drawback with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly, for example, the racial background of the mother of the nurses, and why their father was so harsh. But besides this, it is a very well done, superbly executed, powerful film.
