Sicilian scorer or professional killer Tony Arzenta decides to leave business and his former employers disagree. Is it fun just for fun? It is very melodic, violent, quite brutal, car rains are remarkable. "Arzenta" is a modest but very pleasant film that is much better than the current Hollywood trash that gets the same label. It comes from Delon's rather short flirting with the 70's B-Cinema in the 1970s. He is using the Deloni heavy man carefully, who belongs to the gallery of bad asses in his adolescent. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the fact that Delon made this movie that he was part of a good Eurocrime flick. <br /> <br /> The result is very good, a good introductory song Feeling that the Italians considered the film to be a synthetic work where music art plays an important role. <br /> <br /> Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out is very tempting Erika Blanc (31 years of age 73) appears as an unnamed whore. Meanwhile, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra, Carla Gravina (a star that after the film '75) virtually left. <br /> <br /> Arzenta is an interestingly filmed ambitious visual concept with some expressionist peculiar angles. The film was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari, who also made Zorro (Deloni's comedy). The first is a bloody melodramatic violence action movie - the second is a mild spiritual comedy that is more looted to fraud, although remarkably cohesive and skillfully made. Duccio Tessari directed films like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Satan's Sons, Bloody Butterfly, Â¡Viva La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
