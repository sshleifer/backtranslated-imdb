This constant theme, expressed in fantasy and outrageous comedy as this vehicle, is what Kusturica has authorized. After a fantastic job and Magnum Opus' Underground, Kusturica highlights' Black Cat White Cat ',' Life is a Miracle 'and recently' Promise Me This', in her career style. , its ambivalent arrival and attack on the traditional idiom. In the case of "Promise Me This", the paradoxical world (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) of the opposing city are. The city world reflects Western attributes that have built up a spatial and temporal environment; organized crime, sexual exploitation, split identity and frightened disregard for traditional values ​​- as expressed for a young boy - a villager. At the end of the film, this example is even better when we look at the funeral and the wedding on one-way roads. They are in a collision force; Correctly, weddings, which represent the village's life activity and pulse, that is, the traditional values, begin to collide with burial mounds, thus showing the death of traditions in this context. Kusturica explores this topic perfectly through her unique, stylistic singularity. With its resentful and enchanting style, which is the image of the vehicle.
