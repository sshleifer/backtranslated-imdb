This is the only movie I saw the prince, but it doesn't matter. And I thought he was a very big boy when I was wrong. This is probably his best result. Music is great. That's why in 1984 he won the Oscar for best music (or something). Now, under his belt, he is Oscar and Grammies. Although the curse goes by the film (make sure no small child or room is). There's not much to say without exposing it. You really should go and get the movie that your collection isn't complete when you don't have that movie. What more could be said except go and get this movie now!
