It was a good movie. It wasn't your typical warfare, but something else. This movie showed us training before the war and not the war. This movie is one of the more realistic views of war and army than most other such films. Colin Farrel did an excellent job of recruiting an army, and Clifton Collins Jr and Matthew Davis also contributed relatively well. Seeing Colin Farrel move to grade b in a couple of years, you would never have thought it would happen. I also add that in 2000, the Tigerlandists did an excellent job of filming the film and showed that it looks like the 1970s. It is good to see talent carefully and I hope to see this same talent in the near future.
