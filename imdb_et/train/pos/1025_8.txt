My rating refers to the first four years of SG-1, which are wonderfully fresh, creative and addictive. Once the cast gate went through, you never knew what was on the other side! From the 5th season the show was different - still good but different. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> "Stargate". The background of the series is based on the characters and events of the film "Stargate", where the device is discovered during an archaeological excavation in Egypt. and very creative. Many inventive stories could be easily made as large sci-fi films. The next case was always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The signs that show vacation are also well defined and well executed. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue is really wonderful and humor. They are just fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Since the start of the 5th season, the series has begun to become a constant line of struggle against one enemy (Goa'uld, Ori). Plots become more complex (more political / strategic) and interdependent. The characters were still as big as ever, but it was different in nature. <br /> <br /> One thing to mention is the episodes of episodes 100 and 200. They just can't leave it. They have a creative and wildly humorous genius that took the series through 10 seasons. If you like the evolving story between two opposing sides, you have 10 waiting times.
