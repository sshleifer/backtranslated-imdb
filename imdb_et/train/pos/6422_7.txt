Military training films are becoming so common that they get a genre. Among the most important ones are the "official and gentleman", the "top weapon", "GI Jane" and now the "honor". The fact that this happened to be true does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This film is probably the most like "GI Jane" because it focuses on the angle of desegregation. <br /> <br /> The story is actually quite inspiring and is probably the best story of human interest in the above mentioned. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) It is undoubtedly a man of greater courage and principle, and the strength of his character appears bright in this film. Unfortunately, director George Tillman has the vision of tunnels and the development of different characters, except Brashear, to show Brashear in the event of a continuous accident. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a key figure, except for the original scene, fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife, we don't know much about him. For example, Brashear sees scars on Sunday's palms, and we assume that he was working on the plow, but there is no follow-up on this. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets just one short scene that we can make him judge. The rest of his time on the screen shows he wants to move around and swing. When the director plans to make a human interest, he must humanize the characters. <br /> <br /> Gooding Jr. Cuban gives excellent performance than Brashear. This is probably the best I've seen him. It is a role and a character that is much more complete than any part it has played before, and it rises to the event. In Jerry Maguire, Rod Tidwell was an exciting but one-dimensional character with the depth of rainwater. Brashear is much more complicated and justified, and the issues he faces are life crises that make it much more complicated. This is a good recovery from Gooding's last role in "Chill Factor", a movie so terrible that it was almost part of a professional suicide. <br /> <br /> After a comic who tried his hand as a comedian ("Analyze It", "Rocky & Bullwinkle's Adventures", "Meet the Parents"), Robert DeNiro has returned to his dramatic roots. DeNiro is not a bad comedian, she is just as big a dramatic actor that she seems to be wasting her time with comedy. DeNiro gives Billy a harsh personality with a tortured soul on Sunday. It is a pleasure to follow him. <br /> <br /> It seems that every movie I watch lately is Charlize Theron. I saw the "The Bagger Vance legend", "The Men's glory" and "The Yards" to the right, and I began to wonder if he was involved in all of the 2000 films (actually he only made five). It was a small role for Theron, but he continued to do so well and was able to keep up with DeNiro. David Keith, who played together with Richard Gere, "Officer and Gentleman", is here on the top <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting features, including the reflections of the actual Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie despite the hacker and one-dimensional presentation. I appreciated it 7/10. I am for mammalian sub-stories and I have a fondness for stories where the strength of character is central. This film is especially strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting competitions that compensate for some of the director's shortcomings.
