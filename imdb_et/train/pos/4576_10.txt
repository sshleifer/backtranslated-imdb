I thought it was an absolutely fascinating film that focuses on the life of Mary and Kate and Ashley characters Sam and Emma Stanton. They both try to make themselves and their parents happy, but; unfortunately they are not so easy to do that! I thought it was a totally charming and sweet movie and if you are a true fan of these wonderful young ladies, I'm sure you agree with me! If you haven't seen this movie yet, I'll tell you you really forgot; great time, and that you should definitely have time to see it right away! This movie is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
