If you love kung-fu movies and you haven't seen this movie, you cheat yourself. This movie is one of the only kung-fu bargains that could be recommended for fans of all film companies. Usually a hard fan of the genre takes to see something in these movies, but it has it all! The story is well said and complete. Fighting scenes are great and tend to end before you are completely bored with them (as opposed to Crouching Tiger). Throw a little mystery and torture and you have one movie movie. Look at it at all costs. Heck, my wife even enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du it! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
