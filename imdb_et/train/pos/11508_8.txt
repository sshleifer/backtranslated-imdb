I would like to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show quickly went from frightening to stupid. ABC error. They moved to the exhibition on Friday evening at 20:00, then known as "family". It should never have been Friday. I was in high school in the second half and loved early episodes! It was the first police woman in NBC. ABC had big problems with Friday nights. The bad season for them in general, until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT debuted in January '75. Kolchak should have been hit. Darren McGavin asked to terminate his contract to show. Too bad that writing was not in Richard Matheson's original TV films. However, McGavin made Kolchak's own because the actors can do it. Remember when Jackie Gleason is Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker. This INS equipped with manual typewriters and TV types seems peculiar and ancient today, but it was part of the complaint. They were very happy that Simon Oakland had reproduced "Vincenzo" TV shows.
