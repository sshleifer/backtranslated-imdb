If you like "Othello", you will love this flick because half of the film will rotate around the production. <br /> <br /> The film has a great performance with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as women in Colman's life Edmond O'Brien plays an entrepreneurial journalist. <br /> <br /> A few strong players I especially liked were Millard Mitchell, a grizzled reporter who finds the corner and Joe Sawyer, a 1940 response to Drew's Carey, who plays the police case. <br /> <br /> Big raw moments where there is no reality.
