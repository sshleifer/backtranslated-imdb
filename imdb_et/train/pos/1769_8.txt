Just the hidden preview of this movie came out. It was a laugh for me every 30 seconds. The end was so funny that tears ran off my face and I had the desire that I didn't buy this big coke. Certainly there are some lullabies, but in general it is a lot of fun. The film allows Steve Carell to shine after stealing Jim Carrey's attention in his films "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: Ron Burgendy Legend". Paul Rudd is fun as always. I love being so funny in these broad comedies and continuing to work in indie drama (eg P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should do more work because he is so talented and attractive. Leslie Mann also had incredibly funny moments. I recommend it to those who just want to laugh like a maniac. But if you are easily offended, you won't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, you can't see this movie. And, please, no matter what, even if you think you are one of these "hip" parents, don't take your children to this movie. Of course, you should let your teenagers see this movie, just don't look at it with them. This would make some incredibly awkward moments.
