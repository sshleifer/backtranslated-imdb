This film moves the Cinderella story back to the early 1950s and makes it good as an eccentric, Isle of Man use as a background. Ugly Sisters have become wildly glamorous upper-class girls, and together with Kathleen Turner as her mother, they are cast in various wonderful periodic costumes. The story has changed a bit from the traditional version: it is strangely combined with the "King Lear" plot, and in later stages Cinderella is more confident than normal. It looks great and works pretty well, but it goes over at times.
