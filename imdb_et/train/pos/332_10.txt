Although I haven't seen this mini-series for more than twenty years, I still remember how I managed to achieve a balance between the character, plot and story of amazing adventures. The use of special effects hindered poetic rather than literal speaking. The two versions I've seen have been dubbed (in English and French), but the actors seem to speak their language not only in Italian, but there is a sync problem. It doesn't break the story. Among the cast Irene Pappas is Penelope's best-known North Americans. Recommended for all offspring of Odysseus.
