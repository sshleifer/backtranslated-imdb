I've seen this movie trailer several times and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like it's a great movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I couldn't pull my eyes off (it got my attention firmly). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and works for him, pieces of the period. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who's seen for another second, it looks fantastic. I think this movie has hit and is seen by many people over and over again.
