Great movie. Great actor Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in the role of Satin. This film was one of the last predominantly 70's "black" films, and unlike the "blaxploitation" films of this era, the film actually had a plot and it was very well done. Movie music sung by Aretha Franklin was popular on R&B cards.
