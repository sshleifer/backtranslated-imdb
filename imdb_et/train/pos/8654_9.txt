it is amazing that so many people I know have not seen this little pearl. all I have turned it on have come back with the same reaction: WHAT IS A GREAT MOVIE !! <br /> <br /> I've never cared about Brad Pitt (although his revolutions in the 12 monkey and Fight Club show improved) but his performance in this movie as a psychic is nervous, dark and right for the target. <br /> <br /> All other movies in the movie show great performances and slow and deliberate stimulation of the film greatly increases the process. The feeling of fear characters constantly increases as they realize what has really happened. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps it from my 10 book is what is compared to it, the end is a bit too long and bloated. but this is the only mistake I could find in this cult class. <br /> <br /> If you look at this movie, try getting a non-mailbox director for the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
