I remember looking at the American gothic when it was first incited, it came to my mind recently, everything I remember was the same man who appeared in Midnight Caller, which is Gary Cole, I don't watch a lot of TV, but I watched the American Gothic, I bought a full set of DVDs this week, & it's still as good as ever. This is one of the best TV series why I don't watch a lot of TV because it's just garbage, except Derren Brown, it's all Reality TV or soaps, like Grease, Big Brother, etc., I'm calm, got the American Gothic Kit 16 At 97 pounds for the Asda website, it is the cheapest I find.
