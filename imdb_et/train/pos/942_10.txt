This is the best film version of Dicken's classic story. I've seen it over and over again with VHS, and I recently acquired a formatted DVD version (not a wide screen). What I know is that this teleplay is interesting is the number of English actors who are now recognizable, as many have appeared in other films / exhibitions in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "Equalizer," as a ghost of Christmas holidays.
