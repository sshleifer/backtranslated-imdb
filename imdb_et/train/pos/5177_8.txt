I watched it last night after I haven't seen it for several years. In fact, this is a fun little movie with lots of faces you didn't know. Ark looks like always. See; you are not disappointed. By the way, it was just published on DVD and, unlike the packaging, it is a widescreen. The transfer is pretty poor, but at least the whole movie is visible. ;-)
