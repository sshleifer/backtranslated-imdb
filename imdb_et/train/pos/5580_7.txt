Young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries a parent (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he cannot meet him sexually and ignore him. Disappointed he goes home and plans to divorce. Then, one day, she's skinny, dipping in the middle of the lake in the woods. His horse stops with his clothes ... and he runs after that! He meets with a young and very beautiful Adam (Aribert Mog). They love and he understands that it is the man he wants. <br /> <br /> TERMINATION SPOILER !!!! Of course, because it was done in 1933, he must be punished for his sin, so that it would lead to a tragic final. END OF SPOILER TERMINATION !!!! <br /> <br /> This terrible person in 1933, but it is quite annoying by today's standards. Lamarri's naked swim shows nothing and if he runs after the horse is completely naked, it is either shown with a very long blow or covered with branches. There are only a few small shots of his breasts. Even when she had sex with Mog, nothing was shown but her face, but you see that she is getting an orgasm. These scenes were considered to be quite extreme for their day and were completely cut off from the American edition. Today they are back. This movie can easily be PG-13 now. <br /> <br /> It's just OK. It is beautifully filmed and not next to dialogue. Except for the music score, it can be a quiet picture. Fortunately, all the actors are good - especially Lamarr and Mog and they are so attractive that they just take their breath away. It's also the sequence in which they love, just one of the most beautifully filmed and acting sequences I've ever seen in the movie. Unfortunately, the scenes of sexual symbolism (there are quite a few) are obviously obvious. I really started beating one! <br /> <br /> So, great direction, beautiful shapes, attractive actors, good actor, but I wasn't exactly against it. I found the movie moving slowly (beautiful pictures don't make me a picture), somewhat dull, obvious, static and negative. I can live with the end, but it does not excuse the other problems I had with it. The final sequence is also really strange - and inappropriate. So I admire this movie more than anything else. It was well done and I would recommend it with some caution. Many people love this movie, so I'm a minority. Use your decision.
