This film documents the transformative experience of a group of young men, and the experience of viewing it is in itself changeable for the viewer. Few films even want such a transcendental level, and I do not think that it will not achieve any other film - documentary or drama. There is no other movie in which I laughed so much and called so much. Yes, it's DMD and accessible travel; in these matters alone, it is a worthwhile project, but it is more. It's friendship. It's life for yourself, living every day. And it's a great, fun and adventurous narrative. That's why God created the cinema! Watch this movie !!!
