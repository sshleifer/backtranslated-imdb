"Written Wind" is a melody by Douglas Sirki. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by Cahiers du Cinema, Fassbinder et al., Who welcomed him as chief organizer - I think this is due to the complexity of his cinematography - "Written on the Wind" offers lush colorful images and gorgeous shapes. But I ask myself: is it enough to wear a movie? "Written on the Wind" operates on a weak fair (except for Robert Stack - he is convincing as a weak and corrupt playboy). Lauren Bacall, which is usually a powerful screen presence, is wrong in this movie. Dorothy Malone as seductress, reckless "femme fatale" is OK but lacks the strength of that role. Rock Hudson is effective but steamy. <br /> <br /> The plot has very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> Rigid Patriarch <br /> <br /> His Kyle (Robert Stack), his alcoholic son (disappointed father ever loved) <br /> <br /> his disappointed and nymphomaniac daughter Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman of principles, previously a secretary, and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought with Kyle and Patriarch by. <br /> <br /> Secrets outside the door, love triangle, frustration, fistfights, laughter, death, etc. - well when I read the story summary on the back of the DVD, which I thought I was treating. My mistake! Why? I'm trying to explain: "Written by the wind" takes itself seriously and tries to talk about a dramatic story. As I have already said, it is not general, good enough - there is no intensity. Nature has many strong scenes, but the participants just work efficiently. I think that even if the Italian or Spanish actors had completely studied these scenes - they would end (for us) with an explosion of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> We have a beautiful Douglas cinematography Sirk. That's not enough for me. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, check out "Aventurera".
