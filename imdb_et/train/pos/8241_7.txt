Fidois is a very strange film. And in many ways, very good. <br /> <br /> My first thought after viewing was how do they market this thing with hell? When Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido's boy and the story of his dogs are mixed with zombies with nostalgia comedy in the fifties. Doesn't do exactly the language. <br /> <br /> Fidol has little Shaun carnage, gore & belly laughs. This is a different beast (give punishment). <br /> <br /> Fido starts with a black-and-white info film that explains the back story - people have won the zombie war by developing a control ear that lowers the carnivores as dark servants. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought we were la Matin√©e for the Paranoia parody of the Fiftieth Cold War, but we will soon be lurking in the white main colors and in the mid-fifties world class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely child who doesn't fit school. Her mother is a highly social climber and her father is nervous and divorced. <br /> <br /> To keep up with Jones, Mom (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is first of all interested, but "Fido" (Billy Conelley) will soon prove a good friend for Jimmy. Until his collar starts flashing ... <br /> <br /> Fido is not a horror film, but my problem with the film is exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Much of this humor is easy with family diversity and sometimes the plot line is too heavily dependent on the son and his dog / family. <br /> <br /> But the film has wonderfully dark, truly funny moments that, when welcoming, will provide an R-rating that is a family comedy for a longer period of time. <br /> <br /> The film looks fantastic and is done perfectly by all involved. <br /> <br /> Despite its tough tonal problems, I hope this movie will find a niche because it's a pretty pearl in this year's cinematic hit.
