This film has artistic cinematic techniques where, in place of the camera's acclaimed landscape, there is little detail on how someone appears, how a woman can wear a cocktail hat and wrap her up on a page. How your husband is wearing a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both look so free and comfortable. While provocative to a woman, this is a drawing that the director decides to let us know that she is a sexually free spirit, and that her goal is to get the joy she wants without flirting directly or with the sensitivity a man can feel. The relationship between a woman and her husband is unique. It is open, where it does not hold back, does not feel ashamed of how it has behaved and wants to share these facts with it, because its primary focus is always on the fact of their marriage. There can be nothing and no one between the two. Only fate can intervene - his imprisonment during the war and after he has finally returned. Very intriguing film that completely absorbs.
