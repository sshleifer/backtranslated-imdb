The new side of Victoria and Albert's story highlights director Jean-Marc Valle. Most of Queen Victoria's thoughtful thoughts are women who ruled for decades and lived their mourning lives. Emily Blunt is mostly capable of being a title because she gives the audience a different perspective. She depicts Victoria in her youth, resurrection to the throne and early. Blunt's Victoria is both fresh and full of film. His strong scenes are Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All actors are doing well, including Miranda Richardson, which could play a role-playing role. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a story of dramatic curves and hysterical "acting" moments, this story is still interesting to be worth seeing. Some historical freedoms have been made in writing the screen, the film tries to remain true to the social and royal structure of the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the period of time. Designed design and costumes are outstanding. <br /> <br /> This movie is most appreciated by those drawn from history, periodicals, and Blunt and other actors. We recommend heartily. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
