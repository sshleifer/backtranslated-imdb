This movie works because it looks so genuine. The story is simple and realistic, perfectly captivating the joy and worry of adolescent love and sexuality that our teens experienced during our teenage years. <br /> <br /> The actors are as natural as the documentary, but they are convincing and charismatic as experienced performers. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and luckily the references to the harsh pop culture are not fulfilled. Cinematography is also sharp and beautiful at the same time, bringing the life of the Lower East Side very tangible. <br /> <br /> At an artistic level, I love this movie because it reminds me of great Italian neo-reality movies like a bicycle thief and La Strada. Movies rarely feel as "real" as it is ... or as bicycle theft. And the only other film I've seen that treats teenage sexuality with the same level of difficulty is Elia Kazan's blasting in the grass. Writer / director Peter Sollett deserves tremendous praise. This movie is quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I am always happy to see a film that treats ethnic American members with love and respect. As an Italian-American, I hate how my people leave the cinema (such as racist, feminine, criminal genius in an irritatingly popular epic) and my aggravation of that number makes me representations of other groups and their dreaded silver screen. Especially Spaniards and Asians seem cursed to play the villains and the villains of the action film. (The good thing is that Gong Li did not try to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, we see some more pictures about ethnic characters here and there because of the rise of indie images and the influence of Miramax ... but raising Victor Vargas is one the best. Although I really like my big fat Greek wedding, this refreshing change is that Victor Vargas's play is played directly (with less exaggerated and widespread characters), still very funny. Finally! Latino characters are worth noting. I have the feeling that this is a movie that is remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now that he has made this wonderful picture of a family from the Dominican Republic, I hope Peter Sollett will be moving to make a movie about Italians soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
