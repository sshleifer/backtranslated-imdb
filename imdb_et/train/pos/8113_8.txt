This sci-fi masterpiece has too many mistakes after the editors opened it after opening in 1936. Visually, it is a miracle to see, but the script allows too much intellectual talk about war and progress. Reedmond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great actors, will come in for a couple of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as "The Boss", a megalomania warlord. The prophecy of the Second World War was very frightening, given that the world was on the brink of the most devastating history of historical humanity. I'm sure the war didn't come out like in the movie. There are some visually stunning assembly sequences that combine the jumps between different episodes of a movie. Although not as fun as I had hoped, this movie would have been seen by you for a long time after that.
