I recently looked back at Caprica and thought I could come and write a review! I saw it for the first time after I saw the Battlestar Galactica series finale (show that this is a great boys' boys who continued with me, what I can show in the universe), so I didn't know what to expect ... but I came out smile, although I have to admit ... <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically on the capricious planet and we are introduced to various interesting characters ... I don't give too much, but there is a dramatic event that dictates the story, but i suggest you check it out. <br /> <br /> You have to say ... Esai Morales is one of the actress hell who pulled out young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father Battlestar Galacticas) I found his place and I can believe he is William Adama's father from BSG ... <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is well suited for his role. ..! A special note was good to see Polly Walker outside Rome! Don't sit and look at Caprica, assuming it's like Battlestar Galactica, because the story is quite straight forward and anyone can watch it ... without having to see BSG! <br /> <br /> A well-written drama for those who love the drama there with a little sci-fi kick!
