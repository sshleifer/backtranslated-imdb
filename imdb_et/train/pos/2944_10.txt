It is hands that show the greatest display ever. I've seen a lot of upbringing lessons, a lot of up-to-date training and a look at Bet's Comic View, but I've never seen anyone who could match the Murphy skills of this show. The impressions are great, the sketches are great and the timing is perfect. You can even say that the crowd can really. When he did Rawi in a few years, it was also very good, but it is in my book # 1. It also shows that Murphy was funny at the same time, especially in the early eighties. The favorites of the exhibition are when he repeats the family barbecue and "Ice Cream !!! Mooommmm !! Ice Cream Man comes !!!!" Another big part is where her mother is like Clint Eastwood.
