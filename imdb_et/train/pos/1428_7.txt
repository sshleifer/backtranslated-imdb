Here are some wonderful, conscientiously beautiful photos of different landscapes and animals, from arctic to tropical and all in between. Camera techniques are varied and close to the aerial work in the area. Editing is tremendous and the comment is on the spot, with the right tone and dramatic and telling facts about our world. When the film falls slightly down, it tries to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal queries and hunter / hunter interactions in multiple environments. Ultimately, it becomes a bit of a bit of a bit bitter and scattered. All in all, it is worth noting, especially considering the issues, but not waiting for Oscar material.
