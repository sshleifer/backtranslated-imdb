Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created by Chester Gould in 1931. He is an explosive detective who monitors the villains' team, starting with all kinds of visually original letters like Flattop up to empty up to Big Boy Caprice. (These woolens became so popular in the 40s that Warner Bros created a Tracy-style villain such as Daffy Duck in cartoons. Tracy's comics were known for their liberal use and the advancement of lasting technology (especially the wristwatch communicator), which received the fair share of this excellent film from the time of the screen. The music was excellent by Danny Elfman and Madonna's original songs, but they were not the highest point in his career. It's strange because when you watch the movie and see the arresting moments, the film looks as much as Batman, because Elfman's memorable sound on his pieces. <br /> <br /> I love a hard-working child, Pacino is acting as a big boy Caprice (and that chin!), Madonna's horse and cinematography and leadership were impeccable. This film was made very professionally and has many great actors known for some time as great actors before this movie (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patink, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke) . The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost like Beatty saw herself in Tracy's past life or something because she really fits that part. <br /> <br /> For this movie I had to give 8/10 everything he brought to the cinema, which was ignored (for any reason). There have been many misunderstandings about the rating of the IMDb movie and I still do not understand. The characters were completely original and viable, as well as kits, wardrobe, lighting and everything in this movie. Go buy today. You're not sorry.
