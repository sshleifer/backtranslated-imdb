Finally I bought and added a copy of "Show people" to my collection. I can't comment more than what previous viewers have noted, and the character, plot and overall quality of this movie without repeating their own words. Seeing as many of the M-G-M silent stars on-site, fancy, is worth and worth seeing. I like the scene where Marion Davies plays himself and meets himself, playing the film's main character Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read his lips because there is no name card showing what he says when he sees Marion Davies, but that is something that I don't think I like! Pop corn, record on tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in the history of film making. Enjoy!
