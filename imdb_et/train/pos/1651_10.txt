I looked at its presentation in PBS in the US as originally in 1988. Assuming that the mini devices were available on the DVD, I bought the first editions of all three books of the previous year. Since then, I've been looking for series on internet movie sites. Today I found this website. I'll quit the search. <br /> <br /> I would also like to buy this full - 26 episode - miniseries. After buying the DVDs, I read every book and watch the episodes of this book. I did this with John LeCarre's trilogy of Karla and Larry McMurty's Texas ranger trilogy. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or series of books that have become a very good TV-miniseries or movie series? available on DVD?
