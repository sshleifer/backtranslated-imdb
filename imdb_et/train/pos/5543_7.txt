A very well done and spooky horror film from the poverty line of a film company in the PRC, who usually put out really cheesy movies like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. The German foreign director, Wisbar, works wonders with a small budget and a set of favorites in his studio. Gaunt and ghoulish Charles Middleton is effective as a Strangler.
