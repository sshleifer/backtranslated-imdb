Customizing the book Finding Fish. This story speaks of a troubled young sailor, Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), who talks about the painful story of his past to Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Derek Luke's brilliant debut and Denzel Washington's always great results. <br /> <br /> This movie was so unbelievable on so many levels and I was disappointed that it didn't win the Oscar, I think it was bad, so it was overlooked. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone, his story touches, and it makes the audience empathetic to the young man who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like inspiring real stories, look at Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
