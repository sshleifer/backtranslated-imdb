I feel very sorry for people who go to the movies with a pen and pencil to write down mistakes and keep notes about how bad the film is. I feel equally disdainful about people who go to the movies and can't stop the reality and / or enjoy themselves for 90 minutes of their boring or busy lives! Get the people of GRIP. ECGTB is a very pleasant film. If you take the movies seriously, it's not for you. If you expect a movie in any way similar to a book, it's not for you. But if you liked the Queen of the Queen of Priscilla or Moulin Rouge in the desert, "what I look at hell". Or "The Sweetest Thing" brand comedy then let yourself escape to Cowgirls. It has some very funny parts. Funny actually. It also has pretty good music, kd.lang. I also mentioned that I have 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ...... I need to say more?
