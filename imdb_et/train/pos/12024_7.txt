The good thing about this movie is that it is alone - you don't have to see the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest drawback. It would have been nice to have some original characters involved in the new story and see how their lives have evolved. Sinclair, like the original, is great and offers the best comics for movies when trying to deal with uncomfortable and embarrassing situations, but supporting casting is not as strong as the original film. Forsyth is to be congratulated on the courageous attempt to move the characters and create the original sequel, but the film is ultimately flawed and there is no heat in the original.
