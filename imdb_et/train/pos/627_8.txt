Except for the uncomfortable scene, this refreshing fairy tale is a fantastic fun and delightful adult cynical spirit that admires its way towards the audience, as well as the sound that moves this fairy epic. Except for one of Robert DeNiro's scenes, which did not get smooth and seems to be out of sync with the rest of the film's tone, it is a gorgeous romantic fairy tale between great storytelling and strong magic and a serious balance between serious adventure scenes and lighter spiritual humor is well done. In the renewed tradition of PRINCESS BRIDE, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is fascinating. Ten stars eight.
