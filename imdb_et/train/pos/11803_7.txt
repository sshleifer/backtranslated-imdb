"Sasquatch Hunters" wasn't really as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling to the Forest, Park Rangers Charles Landon, (Kevin O'Connor) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet (Stacey Branscombe) escorted by Dr. Helen Gilbert (Amy Shelton-White), his boss, Ethan Edwards, (Gary Sturm) and assistant Louise Keaton, (Juliana Dever) to find some known bones in the region . Upon reaching the camp, the team will discover a giant burial site and more strange bones that nest in the area. When members of the group begin to disappear, they will safely migrate through the forests. It has been discovered that Sasquatch is behind the killings and the team band survive. <br /> <br /> Good news: it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Indeed, the film begins around half the place when the creature is attacking. This is a masterful series of scenes because the whole group is subordinate to the attacks of the creature, and the ratio is extremely high throughout the passage. In these parts, forest areas are most appropriately milked, enhancing tension and thinking when one of the people traveling in the woods will get their results. It is also quite freely through the film that the truly unusually usable screen dials and noise are used effectively. They really add a lot to make this part horrible, as well as the second time, when a terrifying fear is heard. It is quite effective and works well. It's pretty nice that the later part of the movie picks up the pace, because it gets pretty well with great momentum. One scene that I especially feel must be a special scene for the first time. As the man runs through the forest of the creature, he puts on an expedition that has been looking for it. He raises his hands toward them to get help, the other who announces his presence, attacked from there and killed him in a hurry. It struck me as a surprise and gave me a little leap during the first viewing. <br /> <br /> Bad news: There were just a few things here, one of which was a complaint and one was a normal complaint. The creature here is mostly done by the terrible CGI, which made him look completely ridiculous and destroys any credibility. Threat air caused by the opening of the film appears almost out of the window when the creature appears on the screen. It's so annoying that it's a shame that a little more work wasn't done. I have complained a lot about it and this is something that should really be taken away because it does not look as realistic or quite fake. Another great thing is the killings here. Very often in a movie, a person is caught up and then left behind and then found a bloody body. It is quite aggravating when it kills the beautiful and juicy after that. Otherwise, I really do not have a big problem with this issue, because everything else that is usually criticized about this has not bothered me, but it is called for others after that. <br /> <br /> Final decision: I liked it, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie. It should not be taken seriously and, if viewed, it is really enjoyable. Fans of these movies should watch it and those who like Sci-Fi Creature can find some nice things here. <br /> <br /> R rated graphical language, violence and some graphic carcasses
