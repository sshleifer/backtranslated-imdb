"Ruby in Paradise" is a beautiful, daily story of a young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, who flees from her strangling roots to get herself. Although the character of the title is skilfully played by proud Ashley Judd - probably her first film role, although it is quite proud - the emphasis is not on "changing someone", the next Madonna (whether Jesus' mother). or a gentle, attentive-hungry singer). <br /> <br /> Instead, the following instincts are emphasized and somewhat introspective of them, to grow up to be an ideal adult. NOTE. This is not an action movie !!! She uses a random voice command when she writes in the magazine (Ms. Judd) and I see that I have just lost her readership to her. But be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that bliss can be discovered - oh, I can't, spend and cut wood. <br /> <br /> Actress / director / writer Todd Field, who played Nicki Nightingale in "Eyes Wide Shut", celebrates Ruby Lee's noble love, helping her heal her idea of ​​young implanted relationships. But even his character is not Ruby Lee's answer: No hero is assigned to him. The final message is that we are responsible for ourselves. Writer / director Victor Nunez, who also wrote / directed "Ulee Gold", did an amazing job of showing a young woman who grew up - facing the old good evil challenges on her journey. > The star and the used music are also supported, especially Chanteuse's Sam Phillips cuts (which I hear is the husband of T. Bone Burnett), right - especially "In an attempt to keep Earth." "Now that I hear the first few chords of this song, tears of my eyes, Pavlovian and forbidden - not sure if it is music, or an indelible link to the silent, charming message of the film." recommended for all young people trying to find their way. For any woman it is a must see it! Negative: it is not on DVD except Spanish. (However, we learned that we have the right to make one VHS version can be easily found on the internet. My beloved husband found someone with a copy of VHS and got me a DVD copy. press the world. So buy yourself a copy. <br /> <br /> This movie should be a big release again and it would be when I was a Hollywood queen. <br /> <br /> Figgy Jones
