"Telefilms" tend to fall into the pitfalls of low budgeting and fast landing plans, so this film always tends to turn. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott perfectly embodies the Ebenezer Scrooge, which fully encompasses all of his cold trends, and continues to be equivalent. The production value of this film was extraordinary, never relying on boffo's special effects or sound track settings, based on the depth and clarity of on-the-spot shooting and strong backgrounds. A movie that's definitely alone.
