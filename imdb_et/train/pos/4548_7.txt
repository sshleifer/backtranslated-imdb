At that time, "My Left Foot" was a small film that could. It was very popular, and everyone praised the fact that such a small, independent film can do it up to Oscar. <br /> <br /> Since then, movies like "My Left Foot" have been a dime, so it can be difficult to retrospectively understand what all the noise was. This is definitely a well-made and competent film, but it is clear that most of this success is based on Daniel Day-Lewis's shoulders, who put themselves in a brain-paralyzed role of human Cristy Brown. Day-Lewis pulls the same bit of stunts winning a year ago with Dustin Hoffman's Oscar to play a man with autism "Rain Man", and the Academy followed it, giving Day-Lewis the same honor. <Br / The only thing that really separates this movie from the big budget for Hollywood production is precisely this - its budget. Any other way, it's just like any standard product. That doesn't mean it's not a good movie, but it's not a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
