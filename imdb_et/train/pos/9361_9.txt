Reign Over Me (title after who sings) is a movie that will definitely bring almost everyone's eye. It was a moving story of a man who lost his family in 9-11 World Trade Center attacks. Years later, he finds himself in an old college roommate (cheadle) that he does not even acknowledge the secondary market stress caused by the disappearance of his family. Two revive their old friendship, and Cheadle's character, Johnson, realizes he needs to get Sandler's character, Fineman, help before it's too late. <br /> <br /> It was the first film that made me cry for a long time. It is completely worth watching and after I see it, it is positive that the viewer appreciates his family much more.
