Fans of the HOH series "Tales From the Crypt" love this MOH episode. Those who are familiar with the main archetypal stories, most of which were based on classic EC comics, recognize it as batil. <br /> <br /> Indie-underscore Martin Donovan (also a great writer - co-author APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HERS scenarios are a guy whose good looks forever can go to both sides. He could play really nice if he misunderstood, or he can play the same role as it is with a horrible undertone of corrosion. In the case of RIGHT DIE, he is the last approach and it will work. <br /> <br /> Donovan is a doctor who has recently had a relationship with his slutty office administrator (Robin Sydney), his dissatisfied, unforgivable husband Abbey (Julia Anderson) madness. If both of them are involved in a terrible car accident when they return to an unsuccessful weekend where he has "formed", and he burned a terrible fire, he doesn't want to pull the plug on his side. without his enthusiastically enthusiastic lawyer and best friend (Corbin Bernsen, who sees these days worse). <br /> <br /> But Abbey has never been without without a struggle, and there comes the EC theme of the episode. Cuckolded spouses - and women - have always been a genre of favorite subject for some spooky (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans, and this incident is definitely no exception. If anything, the resurrected share of gender and gore in your mausoleum must be a butterfly somewhere. <br /> <br /> And that does not mean that John Esposito's original script provides only a slight twist to the adultery angle. You do not understand if you look at only half the story, until the end ... (I guess, MEASE BENEATHI more with guts and gazongs, and you are there.) <br /> <br not the best of the lot. At least, Rob Schmidt shows here and there the flavors, especially in a scene that makes mobile phone picture messages a truly terrifying experience! As with most MOH episodes, this is a common theme of the season and cracking, so it is not very nervous.
