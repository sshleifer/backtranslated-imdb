In this horror movie, the 50-year-old Cold War paranoia, the Reagan era in America and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, a full moon high star behind the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) are traveling to communist Romania, and while he is lost on one of the streets, he is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the state, he cannot control his natural penetration and continue to kill. Disappointed, he escapes from the city. Decades later, immortal Tony returns to town and enrolls in high school again. She still can't control her transformations, and the townspeople and her friends realize she's not a real person. It all culminates during the big football game in schools. <br /> <br /> I was expecting this to be one of those bad films from the early 1980s. But I was surprised that the movie was actually legit. Cast, including Kenneth Mars as pervy coach, Roz Kelly as Tony's passionate former flame, Demond Wilson as bus driver and Alan Arkin as a strange doctor, are going to have fun results. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I was struck by the similarity of writing and humor "Family." "Full Moon High" is the same as everything that goes into attitude and never takes it seriously.
