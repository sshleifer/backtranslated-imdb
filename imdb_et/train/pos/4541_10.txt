I saw this movie cable, it was really funny, from the stereotype of the police chief to the stereotype of big guys, jay leno and mr mayagi from the karate boy star in this good comedy car prototype. I compare this to "RUSH HOUR", where a local policeman has to work with an Asian police officer to deal with the case. Bringing down the downtown Detroit farmers brings back memories. Nice sound, good script, I will give it a 10/10.
