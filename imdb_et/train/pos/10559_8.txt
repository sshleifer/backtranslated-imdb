I haven't written about IMDb for a long time, but I felt compelled to write it! When I was looking for this movie, I found one particular review that called people NOT to see this movie. Don't pay attention to this unknown person! Nothing is a fantastic movie, full of laughter and above all ... imagination! Are you sick and tired of pushing the same old cycle of soil rubbish trash? Sometimes the film comes with NONE and gives you something you have never seen before. I don't even care if you don't want to (even hate) a movie, but no one has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a reputation for reputation and a negative review should not discredit such a movie. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but don't try to tell people they shouldn't look at it. We have our own minds and thank you for your mind. <br /> <br /> If my rating is good, I'd say more people enjoy this movie than those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Keep a little eye candy in your mind! See NOT!
