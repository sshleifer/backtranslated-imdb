Although a little preaching about progress as a grace to save mankind, it is still a stunning film that predicts the special effects blockers of science fiction that would take another 40 years for the silver screen. It predicts the global chaos of World War II, but expands on the assumption that the conflict will last for 30 years, and then the epic story of human struggle under the rubble and the space wild. The action looks woody and strangely sterile, but it is probably due to its contrast with visual images that must be absolutely breathtaking during the release of the film and still impress today. This is a movie that nobody wants to be interested in the SF genre at all.
