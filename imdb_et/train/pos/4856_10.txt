I saw this movie for the first time a year ago and I've been watching this opportunity several times a year. It's in my favorite movie list with some classic. If someone tells you that it is stupid or outdated, ignore them ... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music. Dance is not as important in this film as in other Astaire films, so the comedy and actor shine. Watch this movie as possible, it can be easy, but it is still amusing. So I know that many people hate black and white movies, they think old movies can't be funny, this movie should change their thoughts. Someone I know can't watch this movie, at least lightly amused. The only problem with the movie: Fred Astaire sings without dancing. She can be a great performer and a capable singer, but it's not just exciting and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. Comedy sometimes becomes a little clich√©s, but the performances of G-burns and G Allen's vaudevillesque are perfect for the pieces and can be satisfied by anyone looking for a simple laugh. Give this movie a chance even if you don't like old movies, this movie can turn to a ridiculous side.
