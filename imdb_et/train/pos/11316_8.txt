(Some spoilers) I have not read the James M. Cain novel ("Postman Always Rings Twice") on which this film was based, so I can't compare this movie version to it, but I've seen and loved the 1946 US version Even better is the Italian pearl I read that it was "damaged" in editing because too many blatant references to the fascist regime. Well, any ?? what is left is the cinema, which is probably the forerunner of the neo-realistic movement in making the film. You can see why? Regardless of the harsh editing, there is a sense of social and cultural oppression, as well as personal oppression, hanging on the main characters, who are therefore confronted with many limits of life. <br /> <br /> Think Gino, the youngsters are not well educated, unemployed and exploited by keeping and attracting people to get his one pair of shoes that are so moist that it would be practically useless. <br /> <br /> In Giovanni, he sees a way out, but he should have continued, because Giovanna has been pushed for his unfaithful marriage to a senior man who has money, his job (working in his wife's trattoria, slipping behind the bar and in the kitchen) sex. Previously, he had limited options and still decided to marry a restaurant / gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) knowing he wouldn't make him happy. He tells Gino that he feels sick every time Bregana touches him. <br /> <br /> Considering that Bregana helps to fix her car and visit her for the purchase of the necessary part (which she has actually paid for), Gino wins in favor of Bregana (also allowing water to break the water symbol of life or absence) and remains alone to Giovanna. They start immediately with a heated, passionate but volatile love relationship. <br /> <br /> Gino will soon feel suffocating in his relationship and feel the need to move forward when Giovanna proposes to use his wife. Gino, who doesn't want to get this part, leaves the city on a train ride that he can't afford, kindly pay him another Gypsy man named Spagnolo, a passenger. Gino represents Spagnolo a kind of freedom and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), traveling and looking for a carnival. Finally, Gino works constantly. His fear (not yet over his love for Giovanna) is over a month when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival and Bregana persuades Gino to go back home to live and work with them because he is comfortable too weak to resist stand by knowing that it will reunite it and Giovanna, Gino agrees and goes with the couple. After a while, he gives Gina the demands of getting rid of her husband. When the evil thing is done, Giovanna gets more than ever with cold blood, it seems to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame are eaten by Ginol to hurt a person who did not hurt him. As much as he wants to leave him? he does it in a nutshell, now they are inextricably linked and must face its consequences. <br /> <br /> I liked how Spagnolo's character returns to Gino's life to act as a judge for his misdemeanor? it was very good and interesting, adding a story to another dimension. <br /> <br /> When the '46 US version of Lana Turner and John Garfield loses some of the peripheral signs, especially the police and lawyers, Ossessione, it is trying to focus much more on the psychological effects of crime alone on lovers. It gives even more power to the end result and makes a strong statement that strengthens the marriage that is characteristic of the society in which the characters have to live. <br /> <br /> Little Story: Time (barely) that passes before lovers pronounce love in love, how fast they kill their spouse (there is no first attempt, as in the US version); Gino very fast relationship with dancer / whore? they also know their love quickly and they are willing to risk a lot of what they just met! ? everything is pretty unreal, isn't it? Did I find the problem with this schedule quite troublesome? it made me think I had to miss something from somewhere. Otherwise, the viewer will pay time. Action and direction were equally good. Recommended.
