I just stopped watching this movie and found it very enjoyable. This is a quiet, small movie that doesn't kill you with special effects or "big" performances. It just takes you to the lives of people living in a small village in a small park in North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good result as Raymond Toker, a young lonely man who finds a child abandoned in the woods. Finding Toker's parents leads him to a journey that has a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, who is a naughty motif. And David is playing a bad guy perfectly. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this movie than first eye. The film is placed in North Carolina and the great music of traditional music is worth it.
