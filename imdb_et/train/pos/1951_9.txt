A single mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself working with a number of minimum wage jobs. When he is fired, he finds he can't support his sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the latter having asthma. Then he goes to his friend and starts selling drugs. Soon he will become dependent on the drugs he sells. His life goes together, especially when his children, namely his eldest son, discover the truth and threaten to leave him. Then he struggles to redeem his children, but can he protect his family from drug addicts he worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie has one of the best shows I've ever seen! Diane Keaton crosses a lot, and her character is crazy, but she was very convincing. He fits much more drama than comedy. But the best result of the movie is Michael Seater, who plays his oldest son. She is perfect as a responsible son who is still young but is trying to be an adult in the family. His behavior was particularly great in scenes where he faced his mother's drugs. Colin Roberts, who is playing a younger son, also does a good job. <br /> <br /> A movie worth watching, especially because of Michael Seater's and Diane Keaton's show!
