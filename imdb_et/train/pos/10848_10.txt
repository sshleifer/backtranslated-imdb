... Heads, Hands and Feet - a band from the past, like Strange Fruit. Triple Whammy. Those who have not liked this movie are either heartless or under 40 years old and have no real experience. For them is sad. This is a painlessly well-seen small picture that is a great opportunity for an hour or two, and probably the other show won't go away much. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as a fat drummer (in many cases quite an amazing figure of all) and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - like a neurotic vocal and a front person who all turn super performances and Juliet Aubrey has beautiful eyes to go with some sharp action, like Karen, who is trying to save the band because they look destructive. <br /> <br /> Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson's echoes are white and clear, Mott Hoop Beat up before someone is infused with ridicule, and the script is never more than a minute long. Don't compare it with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - all of them are unfair. The closest comparison is commitment, and it's not bad. And any movie that can let the memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I never see, but the name lives - well, it shows someone in the team knew what they had. <br /> <br /> Little joy and thanks for the memory. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and I have another - Stiff Little Fingers; a-a-and SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... Ten Inch NAILS Anyone? (You must see or have been on the road)
