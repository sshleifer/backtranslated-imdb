Peter Sollett has created a loving portrait of the real people who live in poverty in New York's Lower East, or Loisaida, as the locals know. <br /> <br /> Mr. The heart of Sollett is in the right place when he explores the dysfunctional family that is typical of the country's "cities". Mr. Sollett highlights his story. These are basically good children, the children of their parents who have left them and whose grandmother has taken their wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of losing your characters as losers, Mr Sollett shows the positive side they all have. These children are neither drugs nor steal because they are poor. If this story had been made by Hollywood, we would have seen a parade of stereotypes instead of being struggled by children who struggle but deep inside. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. He's natural. So is Marte of July. His character shows us a nonsense girl who can't deceive or drive to do something he doesn't want to do. Altagracia Guzman, when grandmother is great. He expresses his disappointment that he is unable to direct his grandchildren to things that believe in him and that are so important. All in all, it was a great picture for Peter Sollett.
