It may not be one of the best films ever made, but in general it is a very enjoyable, light-weight foam in which all involved seem to have a good time. This is highly recommended if it is only sensitive. OK, so Frank Sinatra's "act" leaves much to be desired, but his song is a great salvation function and the songs are perfect for the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra made a lot of films where she undoubtedly had the ability to act, but her first attempt at Hollywood, her voice, not her actor, was her main contribution to the film. I looked at it again on television and it still raises my mood as he saw it for the first time many years ago.
