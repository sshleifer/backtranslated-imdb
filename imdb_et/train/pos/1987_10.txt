This movie was fantastic! I can't overcome this song. I think I'm too old for musicals, but this film deserves credit here, boys! My special favorite was Jack Wild. As a lover of a British actor, you cannot keep me from all the beautiful, fresh, young men. I didn't know that when Jack made this movie, he was sixteen! She looks like 11 years old. He's short, it helps. Try to post your answers, colleagues, so I can communicate with your experience. Oh, and Oliver Reed, this man, Bill Sikes, think the drone looks really familiar. Is the idea where he is before the letters? If so, post it up, I really would like to know.
