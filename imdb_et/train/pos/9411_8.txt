Sidney Stratton has difficulty maintaining jobs in various textile industries, mainly due to his experiments in textile laboratories. Stratton is experimenting with a new fabric that would create the ultimate fabric that is never dirty, never wrinkled or wasted. When Stratton finally creates a fabric, he creates enemies and owners in all textile industries (who lose their jobs) (who lose money because one mill has exclusive rights) so that Stratton becomes England's coolest man. The film is perfect and only Ealing would have done it. Guiness's performance (and great supportive casting such as Greenwood, Thesiger, and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film a joy, but the true hero is the story itself, a nice satire for business and industry with drama, complementary elements of romance, and intercourse. Assessment, 8.
