Of course, this is the "Sci-Fi" battle Star Star Gallactica average. It makes me happy. I don't like those cheesy sci-fi that show Battle Star Gallactica in particular and that's why I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the show got a lot of warmth to do it (an unusual sci-tea path) and it was worth it. I read from Wiki that they wanted to turn to everyone, including women, and not just sci-fi notes. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising show ever since Lost. It has, for some time, the most interesting, smart and deepest script that is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I love most about the show is that it plays like a big anime! From young teenagers running with firearms and a very well balanced and sophisticated script, it reminds me of something from Japan, except for a little better (most Anime is too confusing).
