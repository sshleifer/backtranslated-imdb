It is difficult to find a direct, bad historical drama based on the life of any number of British monarchs. Just respect the British or Australian acclaimed actress, make things pretty beautiful and you are guaranteed the Oscar success formula. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria is no exception, just about everything right, the striking beauty of cinematography, soft luminaires and lush colors and fabrics. Being Emily Blunt in the role she can eventually rise, the film begins at Victoria's 18th birthday and moves through intrigues and issues surrounding her potential throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). As Victoria herself complains, she has moved like a chess pawn by different parties because she finds her base and voice as one of Britain's most influential rulers. <br /> <br /> Although this movement on the chessboard is a fairly typical territory, it is the development of Victoria's relationship with Albert, which makes the film a little more interesting. I admit that I have a degree in history in the Victorian era, so I'm a little involved with these numbers. Despite many mistakes, such as rulers, Victoria and Albert were the first leaders to devote their people to improving civilization. They left art, public health and education, and the conservative view of Victoria and the culture of mourning after Albert's death. But these things are only briefly mentioned during the film. <br /> <br /> It is quite certain that Victoria and Albert were not only crazy about love, but also respected each other, which monarchs usually did not see in organized marriage. Even if it happened behind the scenes, they were certainly one of the best known. An empty and friend has just the right type of chemistry to make a famous pair of justice, appropriate restrictions, and despair. This is a different kind of love that is not usually shown on the screen, especially in such a movie. It is encouraging to finally see the relationship between a man and a woman on equal terms. <br /> <br /> But we don't see that love enough. While filmmakers are trying to match things to political trends, it does not create the momentum needed to keep the tension high. Even without knowing a couple of more important public works, things seem a bit uncomfortable, superficial and intimate, and sometimes confusing. This is not such a big problem during the film, but later the effects will be quite fast and you will find yourself trying to remember what you just looked at, despite the perfect performances of the drivers, which is noticeably Blunt, who even hits the famous monarch expressions. <br /> <br /> Victoria succeeds as much as she tries on multiple levels, but she lacks the shine that would make it solid from classic to classic.
