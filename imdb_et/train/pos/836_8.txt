It will probably not vote for the best comedy of the year, a couple of too many coincidences, and plot holes. But we are talking about a movie where a hit man and a white bread salesman become girlfriends, so some strife shouldn't be too surprising. Brosnan is great in this role, from the tree to James Bond (the role he is wasting). If he can maintain such quality, I hope he will continue to comedy. Greg Kinnear is also a brilliant straight man of Brosna. I have hoped here for some negative comments about Hope Davis, but I thought he was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep. There are a lot of good points when Brosnan slips his way and a couple of scenes where I almost smiled. My father (the consultant) lost almost that Julian describes himself as a "helper." Like Grosse Pointe Blank, another hit-comedy, humor can be very dark. When you are ready to enjoy yourself.
