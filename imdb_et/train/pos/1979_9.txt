I and my girlfriend, Annette, looked at it together and we both comment. <br /> <br /> Both of us really enjoyed it, though he took liberty with Dicken's work. Many of Dicken's work is somewhat blind and harsh (including Oliver Twist), but this movie changed everything. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically) and the characters were lighter. were memorable and lively, and choreography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: It's really a lot that comes from Travis. I can't stress enough if the nice numbers were really good. For example, you might say that these guys really worked hard to make routines perfect. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Three participants were really different from IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man that Oliver Reed can really be a good villain. This one scene where you can see your eyes through the post office gave me the chills ... AWESOME. And this guy Jack Wild was the perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when he was killed). He can also sing! Kudos to the electoral department about these choices. I hated Oliver Twist's boyfriend. He was too powerful and funny for my taste. (I wish Bill Sikes shot him down again during the scene.) And they shouldn't have sung him. <br /> <br /> DONATION: Operation was really great. In addition to the three stars mentioned by Travis, I felt that Ron Moody (Fagin) did a tremendous job. He was so funny and at the same time slightly embarrassing. Supporters were also excellent. Harry Secombe performed the role of Mr Bumble very well. And she has a great singing voice. I saw Mr. Secombe present in another movie "Davy" where he played an opera singer with nice results. Talented Harry Secombe should have had many more movies. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, this story isn't quite right for the book, but it was stronger in the IMO. This movie was also not boring because some musicals seem to be. And consistency kept you with the characters right. The tracks did not diminish the plot and let you sleep for too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Every musical film that Travis watches in full must be rare. And it's really rare. It is very easy to see, which will carry the viewer smoothly and enjoyably to the end. On the day when the movies seemed to be affected with beautiful faces, it was a refreshing difference. <br /> <br /> Our total rating was 8.5 out of 10. .). <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I appreciated it for 7 mainly because Oliver Twist boy (Mark L.) irritated me and his songs were torturing my too sensitive ears. Otherwise it was a great movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. Movies don't get much better than that. And you can say that all the people involved in this product really worked hard to make it a ... masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please don't miss it ... even if you don't usually like musicals. It's really rare.
