I watched it in Turner's classic movies Last night I saw it for the first time and I loved it. I like a lot of older movies, especially because there are no dirty languages ​​and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's movies. I also think they were much better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is my special favorite. I just thought this movie was fun to watch and I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you feel the same about older movies, I don't think you can go wrong with it. I believe that "you have received a letter" is a remake of this movie (though a bit different and also a very enjoyable movie). For a relaxing evening of the movie, you don't have to be ashamed if your children or someone walks during your viewing, get it or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.
