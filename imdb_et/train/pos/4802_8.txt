I just saw this episode this evening with a recent presentation by our local independent channel, which presents two episodes for each day of the week. <br /> <br /> Like a gentleman in another, here's a previous comment, I agree that this may not be one of the best programs in the series, but I think it's still interesting. <br /> <br /> My father was a friend of a director (in my home town of Cincinnati) because whose young Rod Serling had been working in the media - and I remember that his father talks about how talented and creative he remembers there. In general, "Twilight Zone" is definitely one of the real classics on television and gives its production during the Cold War period not only in the country of the era, but also (nowadays) on the production of nostalgic images. techniques, creative views and participants of this era several decades ago. <br /> <br /> Minor Spoiler. * <br /> <br /> This particular story, like the other presentations in this series and elsewhere, is a story where the locale is meant to be a "surprise". Sometimes there are characters on earth, elsewhere, while the story at first means that at least one is "landing". They usually contained a message (as here) about a situation where the trigger day buttons are finally suppressed by superpowers during this cold war. <br /> <br /> Today, such stories are nostalgically reviewed 4-5 decades ago in this world perspective and still offer some reflection. - Like this episode. <br /> <br /> Although dialogue may not stretch the drivers' remarkable talents, it is still a simple, important message and worth 20 minutes of entertainment and interest.
