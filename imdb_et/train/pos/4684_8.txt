Petter Matte's "Love at Money" is a visually stunning film for viewing. Mr. Mattei offers a lively portrait of human relationships. It is a film that seems to us, what makes money, power and success for people in different situations. <br /> <br /> This is a change in Arthur Schnitzler's game on the same subject, so the director directs the action to New York, where all these different characters meet and join. Each of them is in one way or another connected to the next person, but no one knows the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are trying to see how these people live and the world they live in. <br /> <br /> The only thing that comes from all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness that everyone lives on. A big city is not exactly the best place for human relationships to find sincere fulfillment, because one understanding is for most people we meet. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is good for Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented singers make these characters alive. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr Matte good luck and eagerly await his next work.
