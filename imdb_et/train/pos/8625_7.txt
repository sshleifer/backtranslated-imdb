Jörg Buttgereit sometimes goes too far with his films and themes, even to my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically made, often with deeper meaning for his themes. This film is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> Labeling this movie is very difficult. This is not really a movie that contains the story, in the sense that it has a beginning, middle and end. It also has no major character but focuses on 7 different suicides and killings on 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All the different stories are spoken with a lot of class, although some of them are of course more interesting and realistic than others. They are not necessarily interconnected, but they still tell the story together. The film doesn't feel at all. All the different stories have a different feeling and Buttgere tells the story without hardly using any word (which is also characteristic of his style), but allows the picture and characters to speak the whole story with obvious emotions. This helps make this movie effective. <br /> <br /> Again, not all output values ​​are too high and this can be something that may scare some people. However, this film will help to determine the right tone and atmosphere for the whole movie and its blind, distracting and frustrating themes. <br /> <br /> The Buttgereit movie I watched. <br /> 7/10
