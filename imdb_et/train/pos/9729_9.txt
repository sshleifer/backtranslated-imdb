Weak start, strong middle, fantastic finish. This is my impression of this movie. I liked Simon Pegg in two movies I've seen him - Hot Fuzz and dead Shaun. His role here, however, was completely different. Shows her choice as an actor, but still did not like the character when she was first depicted. <br /> <br /> There is some kind of humor I call "comedy disappointment". His supposed "jokes" and mind are really nothing but painful and uncomfortable moments. Like Bea's character, Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are also a number of other comedian actors who also show similar signs. I don't want them here bashida, so don't. <br /> <br /> But be warned that if you are like me and you don't like the smell and crazy idiots, Pegg will show you these characteristics for the first third of this movie. This, however, will improve. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that it is based on a real story. Hmmm. Maybe. The story of the film ceased to be annoying, and in the last third it became a "little man" triumph. I don't need all the movies as sugar and light, but randomly, as this movie got better, it started to be an increasingly happy ending. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure to see an old favorite Jeff Bridges play so masterfully. I liked the Iron Man, but saddened the fact that Bridges was a villain. Of course, there is a purely personal taste, because it was great to do it. However, he was a miracle here as a man of greater vision, a publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see her in the role I can really enjoy. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked it! I just wish I was late for 40 minutes and missed the beginning.
