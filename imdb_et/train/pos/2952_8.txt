Judy Davis shows us here why he is one of Australia's most respected and loved actors - his lonely, undefined nomad is first-rate. Teenage Claudia Karvan also gives us a glimpse of what makes her one of the most popular actors in the country in the coming years with future roles in the GREAT SYSTEM, HEIGHT, HEIGHT, RISK and the recognized TV series THE SECRET US LIFE. (By the way, Karvan, as a child, was a young girl whose toy Panda was stolen from a pharmacy store in 1983 in a drama that started with Tracey Mann.) When this movie arrives, make sure you see it !! Rating: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANT POSSESSION, LANTANA.
