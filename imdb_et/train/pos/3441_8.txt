This film is incredibly realistic and I feel that a criminal who many people do not know is a great justice because of lack of experience. Many people who think they can understand what is going through the victim's mind are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in Maya's role. I agree that this is an incredibly brave film. It looks at rape from another, more realistic perspective than any other film I've seen on this subject. The end was a bit long, but I know that many victims represent such justice because the possibility of sending an attacker to prison is about 1%. It is good to see a film that is closer to reality than most of you dare.
