What is very French for this movie is the time it takes to create two leading characters. This may require some patience, especially since neither of them is typical of Hollywood in such a definition. However, when the "ghost" begins, the movie rushes quickly, perhaps at times too quickly. But it's true mountain biking and if you don't look too close, it's all quite plausible. Such a movie you know would have been accepted by Hollywood.
