I had been waiting for this movie a long time ago because I saw the trailer that made it look like a political drama that looked like three of my favorite characters; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And although it was led by Harold Becker, who has done uneven work, he and Pacino combined the love of SEA, one of their best work. But intervention at some level (starters, several scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie) and changing the tone (later trailers look like a thriller) do it while being traceable. which is too bad because i really wanted to like this movie. There was great potential here to be a film about how the government can still benefit from corruption, and make a complicated statement about this corruption, not the usual good guys and bad guys. And here's good action. Pacino and Cusack are both very good and Danny Aiello is one of the best performers in his career. But the Fonda is wasted in its role, which has nothing to do, and while the center line has value, when it comes to thriller, the film loses its path, recovers briefly in the last scene between Cusack and Pacino and then falls to the end. I wish I could get more, but not.
