I saw this for the first time in a movie theater when I was 8 years old and it is still breaking. Muppets are so cool and approaching businesses in a refreshingly naive way. My favorite scene is when the rats start a brilliant campaign in the fancy restaurant on behalf of Kermit. This is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
