Film is fantasy. The story is thin, but it acts as a structure to sing and sing beautiful songs. (I still can't believe such beautiful and attractive people could sing it well.) Some of the dialogue is wonderfully wise. Costumes made me feel like I had been looking at the fashion show of haute couture since 1942. <br /> <br /> Movies are for various purposes. It is for entertainment and certainly. If I had one negative comment, it would be that Nelson Eddy was a bit too old to be a beautiful dashing count. Some close-ups made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing great. But Jeanette MacDonald was as dazzling as ever. She does an outstanding angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is before my time and I'm a new Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy movie and a related conversation. The music in this movie is beautiful. As far as I love classic rock music, which performs the most modern movies, I think there is no doubt that this music is simply and memorable, more pleasant, better built. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see in cinemas today. And Jeanette MacDonald, without Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I'm unclear why so many other posters feel sorry for this movie and more generally for this movie group. They say it's dated and trying to explain why. And those who don't like it say it's not very good, but compared to it? I think this movie is undoubtedly entertaining if so many other films have long been forgotten. In this film, there is too much quality in every sense that it is not remembered or enjoyed. I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and good music.
