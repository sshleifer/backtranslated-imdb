I noticed immediately that this film was not based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a nice idea that Pongo and Perdita's son had their own puppies now. The Dalmatian dogs were, of course, small snowballs that were completely clean until the end of the film. Frankly, I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed quite kind. In fact, I have often thought about being able to become friendly, but now that he has so quickly changed himself and announced that he is once again Cruell, I was almost really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians. In fact, there was a scene where the puppies saw Lady and the tram when Chloe and Kevin dinners were much better than I had expected. I also liked the priest who played the dog and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was pleased that the Dalmatians finally got away again, but I would have liked to know what would happen to Cruella after all the property had disappeared. And what on earth could a dog make at home with so much money? <br /> <br /> Finally, the snowball had spots at the end of the movie.
