I'm a very big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed at my ASS during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like his serious movies, especially the Truman show. It's a cross between her very funny side and her serious side. He is, of course, very funny in this film, but there are parts that are very serious and he pulls it out easily. he is a truly multifunctional actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest, I was pleased with Jennifer Anistan's actor. I think she's more than a couple of nice tits and big ass. The volume of Morgan Freeman makes a very cool God. For Steven Carelli, his limited scenes are very funny, especially at the anchor point. <br /> <br /> In general, I should appreciate it. 9. A good actor, a funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good movie.
