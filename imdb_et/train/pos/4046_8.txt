Rohmer returns to the real story of Grace Elliot, an English speaker at the top of the French Revolution in England, at his historical dramas. It was always suspected that Rohmer was conservative, but who knew he was such a red blood reactive. If you can ignore the unprotected defense of the Rohmer monarchy (and this is not an easy thing, for example, the French subclasses are depicted here as dirty loute), it is actually an elegant, intelligent and polished film. There is a lack of money for Rohmer in the 18th century for France's great cinematographic holiday, but instead the actors play obvious painted cartons. This is obviously an artificial mind, but it somehow works. And the newcomer Lucy Russell manages to make a sympathetic character that shouldn't be.
