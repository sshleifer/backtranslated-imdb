An excellent, free-flowing, often lyrical film that whispers you, never smiling, even though the journey has truly shocking incidents. One strikes how women are treated, and ultimately it seems that they come out very well and are worried that so many potentially catastrophic scenes work so well. This is probably the best result of Depardieu, certainly her most natural. Jeanne Moreau is outstandingly performing what has been a very difficult role and with a couple of men at least half the parents. Miou-Miou is beautiful all the time and plays very difficult scenes again. Initially, it looks down and dirty misogynist rant / romp, but when the story and characters open up, a much more delicate and honest image will emerge. Ultimately, this requires an uncompromising and bold film.
