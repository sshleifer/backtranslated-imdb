Viggo Mortensen celebrates a new haunt of a prisoner, where the ruler (played well by Lane Smith) has a secret secret that may be the reason why various prison guards and prisoners are killed by supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is secret and he's afraid of his life. When I think prison movies, I always think that there are films starring Stallone or Van Damme or high-level dramas like Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. But I didn't expect a ghost story from Exorc III. However, the prison is an effort in the atmosphere and will definitely be the best film for Renny Harlin's career. The film is horrible and has some good examples (at the time) of the unknown. Lane Smith comes out of the best because her caregiver is not the usual personal clich√© of annoyance, but rather nervous and nervous, which adds some credibility to a film that exceeds many expectations. <br /> <br /> *** Four (Good)
