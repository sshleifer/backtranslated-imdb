Let's start with this review of a positive comment - I'm very happy that they didn't decide to shoot with Tony and make a retrospective season, as some people were rumors. In fact, the creator and writer of this episode, David Chase, did the opposite. We don't really know if Tony is living or dying. He is in a coma and his recovery possibilities are very small. This episode seemed to be moving very slowly, and the coma-induced dream Tony was associated with an erroneous identity and the robbed Asian monks who got out of it were absolutely strange. After 45 minutes I got sick of all the sorrows, but this should not be the reason why this episode is slipping. It was a weird and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. Edie Falco gave this episode a spectacular career as a decisive career as the controversial woman had to face the death of her husband. I also found it interesting to drop AJ from school and swear against Junior, which AJ probably won't hit. Silvio is now a boss that opens up several problems for later episodes. There were also many good pictures in this episode, and I think Vito 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore can kill his death if he's greedy SOB <br /> <br /> It wasn't a big episode and disappointed just because Tony kills people, admire him as an audience, and feel that he is the hero of our exhibition. It was an episode for the series, although it was a bit snore, which led to a conclusion. Kudos performed by Edie Falco and David Chase and the writers to create a wrestling of a completely original and unpredictable plot. This is the only season in "Sopranos" where I have no idea of ​​f * cking where it goes. I can't wait for the next week's episode. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The best episode of the episode: (Paulie AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
