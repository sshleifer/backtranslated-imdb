Warning: Includes spoiler. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie and plan to do it, just stop reading here and take my word. You have to see this movie. I've seen it four times and I've still not thought exactly what happened in the movie. That's all I say, because if you haven't seen that movie, stop reading right away. <br /> <br /> If you're still reading, I'll give you some questions and maybe someone else will give you the answers you can email me and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my class 11 English teacher quite well. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me it was wise for her years and she always had the way to teach you things that you might not have been too eager. If we didn't like Shakespeare, he made the story of contemporary romance with modern language so we could understand it. Our classroom was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading the book in our spare time. It was his own indelible way to brand something in our sponge-like mind. <br /> <br /> I'll start with Vanilla Sky's review of this brilliant man's description, as he gave us a turn that is, in my opinion, firmly etched, like a long lost friend's phone number, and it was finally reasonable for me to see the Matrix. Now that I didn't know better, I would have guessed that the Wachowski brothers were really a pseudonym for my teacher, Mr. Krisak. But giving them some doubts, we assume that it wasn't her. But it was the first time that this task was more than just incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> He had asked us to prove to him and to himself what was real. Show me how you can say you're real. It got all the usual ideas out of the class that I am sure you can imagine. Everything from the loss of pain, the feeling of touch and the feeling of hunger brought us to our teacher to prove that we were real. After each of the scenarios we gave him, he came back with one response that would leave us in the word. <br /> <br /> "What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What if you were someone else's dream? What is a confusing question. It was a question / scenario that we had about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid development of computers. How would that be possible? But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself what you were part of someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant yet surreal movie this year is David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, who explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could count. In short, this is one film that literally (if you let it) blow your mind around all the surrounding possibilities. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise is played by David Aames, a young, hot shot, fair, full of his own publisher and multi-magazine owner. He inherited it from his father and, although he has a talent and an entrepreneurial spirit, his Board of Governors, the seven dwarfs, is probably that he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that he has done nothing to deserve the success that each of them has to go to. <br /> <br /> Early in the movie, we meet one of David's proud toys, called Julie Gianni, with the perfection of the harmful but bombarded Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, claiming that they have just used each other and are no less interested in a monogamous, dedicated relationship. It is a relationship that is in line with David's other flexibles that he had in his sexual sex life. And while both are talking about good play, we can say that only one really says. <br /> <br /> Next, we meet Brian Shelby, who played with Kevin Smith's good friend Jason Lee. Brian writes the book David is about to publish, but they are also very good friends. This is something David has very little in his life and you can recognize the movie early on. Brian has one famous line he tells David over and over again. And this is "cute not so sweet without bitter." She tells her that one day she will find the status of true love and not only of the part-time love she seems to have committed to all the nights that live on her bed for the night or two. <br /> <br /> David's great birthday bash (so big that Steven Spielberg's love wants him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, of course Penelope Cruz, with whom the actor has to show this year's best results. . It's just called bash and initially David and Sofia seem intrigued with each other. And in a typical David way, despite his best friend, he starts flirting with Sofia. To make things more complicated, Julie appears without calling and starts to spy on David. Then David spends the night with Sofia, but they talk and draw each other's cartoons. There is no dwarf bank. The next day, when David leaves the Sofia apartment, Julie, who offers him a ride and ............. well, I think we've seen all the ads. <br /> <br /> That's all I really say about the plot, because here the film tends to make us feel real and cloudy. We introduce Kurt Russel and other shady characters that everyone plays in this maze like fog. There is a subtext of death and any miraculous treating all that may or may not be able to create eternal life. This is just one of the interesting opportunities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there. <br /> <br /> As many movies are blossoming nowadays, this film has a secret. The sixth mind could start this madness, but look even further and maybe you can thank Angel Heart for launching madness. Regardless of how it comes from, Vanilla Sky is one of its hidden intestinal busters. And what makes it so fun is that the film gives you a lot of obvious clues along the way, but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the truth and the lie you have just put into revenge. I have seen this movie four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is anything I can understand. It is rare in the film to work in the theater to allow it to open up new opportunities. All ersatz's "Best Images of the Year" have been good, but nothing remarkable. They have no content. The beautiful mind was intriguing, but the flat, Royal Tenenbaums were interesting but uneven. Vanilla sky is rare because it is a film that will leave you much more longing for your satisfaction because the film and the things that care for it. I know this movie has got different comments, but I just think those who don't like it don't really understand it. <br /> <br /> This is what movies should be. The film should do this for you. It should make you feel. Most other movies this year have been just empty spaces. It is not like that. <br /> <br /> 10 of the 10 best films of the year. I would like to see it become the best picture, and I would like to see Cruz as the best actress, the best support for Diaz, the best actor on Cruise, and Jason Mewes should be the best actors. Cameron Crowe should also be there. None of this may happen, and it is a shame. This is one movie that shouldn't be missed. <br /> <br /> And the last note, I'm pretty sure Mr Krisak wants this movie and maybe it's a movie that can answer his question. Can you prove that you are real? Or are we just imagination of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted against someone else's innocence? This is a film that raises more questions than answers. And I'm sure it's very good with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
