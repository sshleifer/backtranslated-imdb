I had no doubts about this movie, I thought it would be a normal ticket --- a movie about Christmas. At the end of June, in the midst of a hot wave, we decided to let it go, maybe we could see snow. <br /> <br /> This movie turned out to laugh after another. Ben Affleck was plausible in his character, but its real star is James Gandofin. He gave his lines to him with a real spirit and made an excellent "father". <br /> <br /> If you want to enjoy some pleasant hours, be sure to check it out.
