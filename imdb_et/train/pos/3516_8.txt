Ella was great, Francho was inevitably universal (but she played similar parts in other movies like "The Eiffel Tower" man) and Alan was almost non-existent, but the movie was definitely "exciting". > <br /> * light spoiler *: I don't know how many times Elisha Cook strangled in her movies, but I think I can recall a number of other examples. I would avoid naming the murderer, but I think it is obvious because the plot has a "thriller". <br /> <br /> A very well done, but dated movie (for example: anyone who smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters. Unlike today's gore festivals, bodies have never been shown.) This is a familiar short-scene table format of the period. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
