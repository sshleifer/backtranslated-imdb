First of all, I would like to say that I am a big Sarah Silverman fan and other people say that then and the pilot is outside of me. Everything in the pilot was on a typical Sarah Silverman form, maybe not quite funny, but the situation and delivery read. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jesus, I don't see how you do it. t like that. It has the same flow and rhythm. True, it's just for real fans, but if you're happy, it's just right for the fans. If you are not accustomed to your style, then you won't get why it's funny. But it is, and I hope you think so.
