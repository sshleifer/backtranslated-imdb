For the actual filmmakers, this film is a must, because it acts as a great little allegorian for the films themselves. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff is related to the capture and projection of the light of cosmic phenomena. This light can damage or be good. On the one hand, he dazzles his mother, on the other hand it is used to treat darkness ("I see!" Shouts a young girl whose eyes are projected by this light). When Rukh / Karloff is poisoned by the unpleasant power of this light, we see that he actually gives a ghostly glow to his hands and the face as badly developed negative, pointing out that we look at the projection, the unit looks at the film (only visible in the cinema when the lights are switched off). <br /> <br /> At first, there is a wonderful mileage, where Karloff / Rukh explains his science that he will be informed that everything that happens will be captured in the light that rolls through the room for millions of years when Andromeda's light separates from the galaxy at a time when the earth was still a molten rock. <br /> <br /> There are sections in the film when this new science is compared to older cultural instruments - in the writer, Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and the religion depicted in the sculptural line of the local cathedral Karloff explodes with its projector / ray weapon. <br /> <br /> Here we have to think about whether this film was supposed to look at what was going on in Germany at that time, and especially about the use of Riefenstall's film a year earlier to promote a regime that would surely continue to do much harm: the triumph of will. <br /> <br /> Finally, the mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first science rule. <br /> <br /> If you want to get up in the theater and call me, "I see!"
