This is undoubtedly one of the fun movies. Amitabh as a state burst, Arjun Singh, is fun. The best thing is that laughter never ends. The plot is the same old story where a child is separated from a mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - a happy reunion at the end. There is a villain (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather who was thrown by a good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember at that time. <br /> <br /> Amitabh arrives in town to make a decent life, and her dialogue and fashionable are fun. Later in the film he becomes an angry young man, he is famous, but humor remains. The memorable parts include his walking, speaking and speaking in English, singing (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. <br /> <br /> All in all, I was laughing at the whole movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at his absolute best - that's it. This gives it a 10/10.
