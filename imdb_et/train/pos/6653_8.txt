Ignoring All Political Views, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's "Gandhi, My Dad" is a good film that wisely explores Mohandan Karamchand Gandhi's confusion and family and his oldest son Harilal Gandhi's struggle with society, his greater than life father and the most important demons of his head. One draws parallels with Gandhi, the father of the people, and the struggle every son can have with his father. <br /> <br /> Operation is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna - strictly in that order - add color and stamens to the heart attack that Harila strikes, and who cries to just hug her once, and also drives her finger with the weakest touch. <br /> <br /> Feroz Kani's direction and production canvas is rich and attractive, but the scenario could have been more stringent. I had seen the game a few years ago on a pirated video DVD (I thought it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi) and it was definitely more engaging. Though the background point of the film and the mom-son and mom-son moments are just excellent treatments. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been great. This is the borderline. It has the potential to be so great that it has been just a story of differences between father and son or just Gandhi or even both. somewhere, the plot is gone and if you are waiting for an absolute extract of emotions, nothing will come to you. <br /> <br /> It compares well with other Gandhi. It is certainly not a movie like Kingsley Gandhi or abstract as Kamal Hassani Hey Ram. The film simply manages to find its foundation; But one is left to think "what if ..." worth a look. 7.5 / 10
