If you are going to play on the prison walls, why not go to actor William Shakespeare? And if you decide to choose many of your criminals casting long penalties for the most terrible crimes, you can be sure that there is enough time for the samples. In the Kentucky Correctional Prison, this daring project was carried out as it was with excellent results. This movie shows how it all happened? Elections? Samples? Set and Costumes? And the final presentation of Shakespeare's "The Tempest". It hadn't happened to me before, but there is an analogy between games and proofreading. In the game, the ship's broken characters are confined to an island that does not come into contact with the outside world. Prison life is also very similar. <br /> <br /> In the simple-colored, back-colored drops of the surrounding sea view, the most enjoyable selection of costume characters may not be drawn out of the line to the approval audience. The purpose of Shakespeare was certainly a good heart and genuine sincerity. <br /> <br /> More interesting than the game itself was the small comer of every man behind his character. One inmate saw gambling as a lesson of forgiveness than the redemption of his sins. It was quite touching to see men celebrate tears when they talked about murder, shooting and strangulation. One had the feeling that they would all like to bring the clock back and review their brutal activities. But (as someone said) the past was a past and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least in the game, temporary relief was provided from the frustrating thoughts of past events. <br /> <br /> Prison officers should be praised for allowing them to play. Such an event puts the Kentucky map and hopefully other prisons can follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone is not just in favor of the Kentucky prison, but the prisoners themselves who have to find new confidence and self-esteem and be ready for the day they leave.
