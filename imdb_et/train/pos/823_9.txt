Until the end of 2005, the Star Wars saga to the sixth and last episode I was in 1983. Versatile scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made it a particularly attractive film. <br /> <br /> No activity focused on one spot for too long. The last half-hour will show you the most, as the scene switches from forest to spacecraft every few minutes to the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Another nice feature of this movie was that the two previous ones were not a fight between the two stars. Gone was a constant beating between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everything was on the same page! It was nice to see. Ultimately, it was just a wonderful adventure story more than anything else.
