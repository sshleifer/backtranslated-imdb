"The World of the Worlds" Timothy Hines is a very fun movie that obviously goes into the classical book of H.G. Wells with great effort and length. Hines Hines manages to do this. I and those who watched my movie with me appreciated the fact that it was not a standard, predictable price for Hollywood that appears every year, eg. Spielberg's version of Tom Cruise, which had the slightest similarity to the book. Obviously everyone in the movie is looking for different things. Those who see themselves as "critics" of the amateur are just looking at criticizing everything they get. Others appreciate the film on more important grounds, such as entertainment, so most people do not agree with "critics". We enjoyed Mr Hines' dedication to H.G. Wells' classic novel and we found it to be a lot of fun. This made it easy to state what "critics" perceive as a drawback.
