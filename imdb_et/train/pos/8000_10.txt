... does not read any plot summary because words can seem trivial, brain-dead and meaningless. The film is great, both Denzel and Dakota (he goes to heaven, trusts me) is just fabulous and the plot is remembered. In fact, a "fabulous" little word for such talented participants. The film is simply based on real facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds to the shock that has arisen during and after the film. If you like both actors and somewhat unsuccessful movies, you still haven't watched your favorite view ... Trust me, finally you have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is fantastic, to see, rent, buy or whatever ... just don't miss it
