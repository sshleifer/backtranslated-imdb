There is one detail that is not very common in Jackie Chan's films, but what is here. It has some very harsh and serious atmospheres, while funny elements exist. Jackie is threatening and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is being attacked and only then fights back (in the usual inverse pattern), but he is the one who can go and start the rebellion. His way of catching this evil boy in glasses is amazing. Every time it goes "crack". I also especially enjoy this scene where Jackie goes to the pub and casts off her villains standing in front of her girlfriend. This is one of the best blitzkriegs placed on the screen. Besides, the whole scene is photographed on the wall with some of the acts (it also looks like a "rabochiy" poster in our Soviet era) and some lines on the left of Russian (I noticed it very accidentally). It seems terrible (and nostalgic for the Russians). I also like windows breaking in the movies. There are many such things here. It is quite amazing looking at the characters falling / jumping / running / driving through all kinds of glasses. <br /> <br /> All three movies are great. I was prepared to see a drop in quality, but I saw the perfect trilogy and sense and incredible tricks (and not just Jackie Chan's character in all three movies - it's great and keeps consistency). <Br>> <br /> I would like to describe every movie with just a few words: No.1 - great (in all respects - this is a thrilling story from start to finish) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - Furious (Jackie is really * beep *) and painful (Jackie tortured); No.3 - incredible (a woman fighting with Jackie is incredible) and bombastic (if I had to mention a lot of weapons and explosions?). <br /> <br /> The rest - many others have mentioned. <br /> <br /> This is a trilogy that can be seen again and again (at least by me). Its place is in the top 10 in the competition / comedy jewel. Finally, it has been released in Russia on DVD (2nd film has the best features - Chinese / Russian audio tracks and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
