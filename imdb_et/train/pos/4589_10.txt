Well, I consider the police story to be one of Jackie Chan's best films. Plot, fighting scenes and stunt works are great. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer, Chan Ka Kui (in some versions, Kevin Chan), who successfully arrested the lord of the crime. After being released due to lack of evidence, the criminal master designed Chani to kill a police officer. Because of this, the police got the will. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), the secretary of the offender, went to the shopping center and began to steal evidence of a criminal offense from her computer and prepared them to hand over to Chan. But the criminal knew that Salina had downloaded her accusations and hired her henchmen to hit her. Later Chan appeared on scenes and began to fight against all the hounds by dropping them one by one. In the last scene, Chan saw a criminal. Finally, it's the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended.
