Mahatma is depicted as a man who forgot his son in this film. Don't do me wrong, I don't tolerate the movie; it is such a wonderful film and walked out of the cinema when my throat is. We need to understand Mahatma's spiritual state, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully lit person could be separated from their loved ones. Such a caliber man leads his family and followers by example. According to the film, he talked to his son and tried to understand where he was coming from, but the poor Harilall so little intelligence did not understand his father. When things went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma could remain calm and testified that his son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If it had been another parent, they would have endangered their values ​​to help the son get to his feet. Mahatma did not do it, he is the real leader who leads the example.
