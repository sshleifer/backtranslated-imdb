Why can't we create horror movies like "The Shining" these days? It's easy to answer: today's leaders aren't Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved this movie that he is indeed one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. <br /> <br /> So the plot is quite simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played great by Jack Nicholson) and his family moved to a large, secluded hotel to watch this season. Kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel murdered his wife and two girls for murder. Next, you can best summarize the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie for a very long time to make me "scary". This is some serious confusion, but good. One thing that adds to the fear factor is amazing music. Music has been a big part of Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Oddysey and Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he certainly won't cheat it. The result determines the tone completely and the film would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary action. Jack is convincingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, he steals only the scenes of this movie. It is a top-notch action that must be seen as a belief. <br /> <br /> Never make such a horror movie. REST IN PEACE. Stanley.
