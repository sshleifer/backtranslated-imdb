There are some things I never understand; why underwear is in thirty packs if it is clearly not a sufficient example. Also, I never understand this movie and it's great. When you approach this film, waiting for the actual movie, you might also want to approach Satan, who is waiting for hugging; though it may be possible if you greet the satanic figures of this movie. Take, for example, Pitch; The most ineffective camp, the devilish imagination of the devil, as Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a ten-footed Satan costume from red body colors and condoms-covered horns. However, it will produce some of the most fun moments of a movie. Seriously, this is not an underestimation. The same can be applied to every other character, the bar a little girl who acts so ill innocent that she is probably over-compensated for some serious crime. When Santa's inter-space reconstruction station is real, there is no way he would have prevented him for so long. Simply put, if you haven't seen this movie, you can't seriously cherish yourself. Achingly's funny character, action, concept and almost radar attack make it visible over any current movie (if you're laughing clean).
