Wow baby, this is indeed a subtle Asian horror / gore and crazy extreme movie. This is a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me of Tetsuo little, except when it comes to all blood and guts, there is a strange love story. It's hard to imagine how they even dreamed of this visually stunning movie with some unique aliens who infect humans as parasites, making them part of a machine, or think cyber. The only thing with these creatures that happened after taking over a person is whether they have to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. This is probably called industrial spraying or something like that with an excellent soundtrack to add to all the fun. The film also borrows a little of Carpenter's "The Thing" in creature design and effects. I would put this gorehound in the black-and-black category because there is a non-stop carnage and some very fine. And for black people, you don't even have to read the headlines, but the visual images are enough for the mind. A little creature living in the human body like a fetus reminded me of some of Frank Henenlotter's films, which is another tribute to some great sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is very fun for gorehounds, there's no doubt and I just loved it.
