I noticed that this movie started to hit before the theater and I didn't have any great hopes. I thought it was another type of "You Served", with some nice dance and scary action. I was in the theater and decided to do it and meet the Spartans and choose it. To my surprise, the operation wasn't bad at all and the film was really pretty good. The fact that it is lower than you have is completely ridiculous. Instead of listening to garbage here, I suggest that you show this movie so that you don't spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how wrong everyone has done. For dance movies, this is definitely one of the best, with much better than many others. Go see the movie and judge yourself. Hopefully, the rating will rise after it has come out on the DVD, and more people will watch the movie instead of evaluating it before commenting on the movie before it is released. <br /> <br /> Editing Movie movement is now closer to the correct rating. Over 1,000 people have rated it 9, which is a bit too high, but at least it helps to compensate 1 ridiculous voice.
