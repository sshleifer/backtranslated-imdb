Poor Ivy: Although it was, he had bad luck to marry a charming waste (Richard Ney). Since the film has been set in the 20s or 30s, when rigid Victorian class ideas began to warp from the edges, this uncertain status moves it too much. Gretorex (so called) doesn't know where their next shilling comes from, but there are sailing parties and fancy dress balls that attract him to tempt. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) introduces a rich older generation (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born in the Middle Ages), he sets one of his extravagant chapeaux. Luckily, he is one of his former string (Patric Knowles), a doctor whose counseling rooms offer a poison that he is good at saying goodbye to his hub. The fact that it affects Knowles does not bring him a little further, even if the lessons begin to run until he comes to death to hang his neck. Turning a plot depends on police officer Sir Cedric Hardwick; Knowles' mother (double deplorable Lucile Watson); and Knowles loyal housekeeper (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds a little bit of fine touch to the average melodrama; Fontaine's light face gives the rest.
