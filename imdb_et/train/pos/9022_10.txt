Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British TV show, performances, staging, casting, intercourse, drama ..... everything is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Although the show fell slightly later in the last season, this thesis was fun and created a great story for fans of the exhibition and the beginners. I can no longer recommend, find and watch this movie. But I suggest you watch the series for the first time because the first two seasons are even better than the fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> Obvious (10/10)
