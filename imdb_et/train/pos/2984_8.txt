David Zucker has been one of the funniest comedies of the year for this funny farce. Yes, it is a matter of acquired taste and it depends on rich sophomorphic gags, but it is consistently funny, unlike recent comic efforts. The film is full of all kinds of jokes, obviously ranging from obvious to subtle types, which you need to pay attention to, or likely to be missing from, everyone. Like his previous efforts involving "The Air!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun," humor flies almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to forget a few. What sets this film apart from the light dazzles of other dark genres is that it has a real story. While others have relied on amusing too many famous scenes in almost casual movies (please take "Mafia!", Please), this movie speaks a new story with pleasant characters. This usually applies to sports movies, as well as to the real sport industry in satirical, not to specific films. Even for people who don't care about South Park, its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading natural chemistry. The movie is also very effective in shooting athletes, sports scientists, and other celebrities, especially the fun picture with Robert Stack "Unsolved Mysteries". By the way, stay with credit with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved the words that may apply to the mixing of the film's sport, the home dunk.
