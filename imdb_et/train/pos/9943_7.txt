The film does not claim that it is something wonderful, like many movies. The movies are predicting fun and fun. And that was it. This is a Korean Korean version. Bring it in. <br /> <br /> With the approach, you can feel the rest of the movie and its end, but pleasure is not surprising, nor is the movie a second copy. Instead, it is a pleasure to see how the other two "scammers" were men in themselves. That's why the movie is fun and fun. <br /> <br /> The camera works, especially the dolly moves were very well done. The script, which was weak, was too enjoyable because the characters were not two-dimensional but were full of life and desire. This movie does not win any blockages of Oscare or DVDs, but a fun and fun experience.
