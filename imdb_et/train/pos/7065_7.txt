Lovely movie about three living sisters from Switzerland (often seen with matching sets) who want to get their parents back together (it looks like the mother is still carrying a torch for her father) - so they drive to New York to get married to their dad by a blonde gold digger he calls worthy of. The father has not seen his daughters for ten years, they (strangely) do not seem to mind and think he is wonderful, and in the meantime it seems that a worthy mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to see her daughter marry a rich with a man. The sisters get the idea of ​​pushing the Precious Hungarian crowd, beating two gold mining women thinking that he is one of the richest men in Europe. But because of the mistaken identity cases, the girls think that the list is a good look for Ray Milland who goes with the scheme because she has a sister Kay split. <br /> <br /> This movie is enjoyable, lightweight. Barbara Read as Kay is so Lovely and Beautiful, Ray Milland looks so young and beautiful here (though unfortunately it's little to do), Alice Brady is pretty good as a blessing mother - but it's Deanna Durbin, a real charming and cute like a button plays the youngest sister Penny, who pretty much steals the show. With an absolutely beautiful vocal, she sings several songs through the film, even though I really wanted them to see it even more in that. The plot of this movie is a bit stupid, but still I found the movie to be fun and fun.
