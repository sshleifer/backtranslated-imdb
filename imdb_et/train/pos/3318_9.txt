Very cute movie with a great background from Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and a light film maker, he hit me homerun. Lots of laughs and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real ball players and real references to previous Bosox bugs. And how enjoyable was it to watch a baseball-themed movie without having to tolerate a jump, a suicidal self, a self-serving Kevin Costner, who tried to bring the believers out of the critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a good job as a young loved couple who suffered from Jimmy Bosox's "jones". It was a bit dirty and left-wing field, but it really is Sox fans who are this fanatic and who live through the luck of their beloved team. The movie was at a fast pace and the end, though predictable, was the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular films without being too terrible. <br /> <br /> It was also enjoyable to return Willie Garson to the screen. I'll forget forever the popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex & the City. She's always funny, even if she does or says very little. So buy yourself two boxes of seats, some popcorn and prepare for a fun time. "Fever Pitch" is the winner.
