I had the privilege of watching last week at the Holly Film Festival in Edinburgh. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl selling prostitution by her family and living in a Cambodian brothel. Patrick (American) comes to Holly's life and decides he wants to help him. When Holly is resold, Patrick desperately looks for him. We are watching that they are in a difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunion. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of children sold and sold every day. The film represents this difficult problem, without going beyond the line. I walked out who wanted to learn more about child trafficking and ask how can I help? This film should be visible to everyone because it is a beautiful story and it creates a problem that we should not ignore any more.
