Brendan Filone is the absolute best character in Sopranos. he died by casting his eye. It was the best and well-organized scene in Sopranos. Brendan Filone is too good. Brendan Filone haunts Uncle Junior in his dreams until Uncle Junior can take it away. Brendan Filone is the best character. Brendan Filone was killed in episode 3, denial, anger, acceptance. But his legacy lives forever. Brendan Filone is the best character of Sopranos! Brendan Filone is the best character ever. I recommend this example to anyone who loves drama and want to see good death scenes and great leadership and production because it doesn't improve this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
