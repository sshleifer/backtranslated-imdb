I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of life in New York. I went to live there for the next 26 years, but never saw anything as gentle and beautiful as this little TV movie. It was part of the PBS series when you remember, and I've never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, just gentle, moving, exceptionally touching moments of excitement and excitement, all in conservative, Boston (I think), World War I, where women played the role of a dedicated woman is looking forward to returning from the war and not looking for a career or financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is a great career photographer and I've spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles without any results. <br /> <br /> Do you need a video for this movie? Of course it should be on a DVD, but definitely at least a video?
