A cultural film about every real Russian intellect. Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it's not praise. The film, like a book, is full of symbols: my favorite is Razrukha's brightest symbol (the spoken word for "ruin", which often means the chaos of lifestyle after 1918 - the Civil War of the 20th century) - wide opening of a dirty door in the snow and behind the doorway in the dark black holes. <br /> <br /> Now the movie comes on a DVD with a fully restored image and 5.1 sound. well-translated subtitles in English, although some of the disjointed words of Sharikov were replaced by lesser versions of the translation. I don't know if this DVD is available abroad, but if you find it right now, it's really worth it. <br /> <br /> And finally, the fact: 50% of Russians today, mostly young people, can be significantly identified as Sharikov. This is a post-Soviet influence: the Soviet people seemed to be completely unprepared for an informative attack on Western civilization, television producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and mass media astonishingly aggressive, breathless, and thoughtless, so reducing the darkest instincts of every Russian language. Even among Internet users, every third of them uses funny language in forums and conversations because it is surprisingly common in spoken language.
