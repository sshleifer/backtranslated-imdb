Just picked it on a DVD and looked at it again. I love bright colors and dark shapes. Not a big Beatty fan, but it's a great popcorn movie. Pacino is surprising, as always and well, this film marked the period when Madonna was her absolute sexiest. I want him to remain "breathless" for a while. Charlie Korsmo's first really big role, except "What's Bob?" The make-up effects were then top-notch and mostly closed. Beautiful scenery and mood will transport you directly to the comic environment. Cars, wardrobe, buildings and even street lights and a big tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although many red scenes can be annoying because it tends to get a little blurred. I just want Beatty to have the opportunity to continue. All in all fun for a few hours.
