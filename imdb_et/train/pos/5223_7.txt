It doesn't seem like this movie succeeded many people. First of all, many did not seem to have seen it first (I just fell into it randomly) and then judging by the reviews and rating that many who did a lot did not really enjoy it. Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere's appearance and charm, and although I didn't consider him a big actor, I know he can do pretty well (I liked his Mr. Jones). But it's all different. She's not pretty pretty here and she's not charming. His character is completely different from what I saw him - old, ugly, broken, set. And Gere, which has been my best results so far for me, pulls it out beautifully. I think this is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you can't imagine someone else doing it - think of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter or Washington as Alonzole Training Day. So good was Gere here. <br /> <br /> The rest was good for me. I guess I wouldn't have given this task, mainly because I think he's too good for that. But he really does a great job of keeping his Gere in top form that isn't small. Strickland can easily provide the best supportive action in a section that requires a significant selection. I think he has the main scene with Gere and the Danes, and that's quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> What about the rest of the movie, except some great actors? The story may not be surprising, with some 8mm dimensions, but the "veteran breaks rookie" scene that does it, and also (like the lambate silence) that helps speed up the girl and Gere's impending retirement. All of this is the backdrop for the development of the two main characters as they help each other to live in their respective new stations. It's a lot to do in 100 minutes, but it's well done and we take care of the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> Direction and photography were enough. I could have done without modern music camcorder movements and cutting, but then I am an old worshiper and it wasn't really that bad, actually I think it helped the film's atmosphere that you might have guessed, generally not happy. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting.
