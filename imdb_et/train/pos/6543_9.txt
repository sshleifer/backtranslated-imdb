I read all of Nancy Drew as predictive and collected books as an adult. I loved the effect used at the end of the movie (and a little at the beginning) where book-style drawings morphized into movie scenes. It was a pure way to draw attention to the situation between film and books. For example, the scenes of the oriental antique seller resemble the many scenarios I remember from books. I thought Ned was completely cast and Emma Roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of Nancy Drew. (Just like the picture of Betty Crocker, she keeps it!)
