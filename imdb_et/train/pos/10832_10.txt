If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy a key role in this great movie, Stephen Rea. The story is from the 70's most famous rock band, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play again. But of course, there are many problems with these concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to look at it.
