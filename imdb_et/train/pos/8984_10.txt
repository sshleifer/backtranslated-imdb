I first saw this movie when I was through my older DirecTV movie channels. It was on the Sundance channel and started. I love music, especially in the late 60s, and it sounds like BJM (Dandys is fine). Everything about Brian Jonestown's massacre attracted me to music, Anton and Joel's personalities, illegal drug use. It was funny because when I looked at the first party scene, when everyone was doing the rows, my parents went and decided to watch (The vision of their face was invaluable). Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite films because it introduced me to Brian Jonestown's massacre, who is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> Just look at it ... seriously
