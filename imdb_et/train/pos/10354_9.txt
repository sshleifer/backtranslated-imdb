CRY IN THE DARK <br /> <br /> BACK EFFICIENCY was a film that I assumed would give Meryl Streep a phenomenal presentation and a solid, if not a noticeable film. This assumption was due to the fact that after the nomination of Streep's best actress, the film received little attention from the big prize groups. <br /> <br /> Little did I expect A CRY IN THE DARK to be such a raging drama, well built on every level. If you ask me, this classic is underestimated. <br /> <br /> The film opens slowly, letting the audience relax on the temple and notice that they are at the heart of an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (director) chooses random moments to capture a family of vacationers who are threatening the tragedy of an intimidating adversary, while showing the attentive bliss that Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain take care of their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "Dingo took my baby!" has become somewhat punchline these days, the movie never even near ridiculous. Azaria's real death is amazingly busy. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience scared and asking questions. <br /> <br /> Most movies take place in courtrooms and focus on Chamberlain's ongoing struggle to prove its innocence to the press and the court that suspects Lindy of murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is clear from the outset that they are innocent makes the tense trials even more exciting. As a member of the audience, I was fully invested in Chamberlain's difficult situation ... and it was really angry and painful and sad when they had been so terribly seen by the media. At the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was in no way sympathetic, but they always had good reasons to keep their opinions. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie is very deep and perfectly captures the central element that makes this movie so different from other court dramas. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, the only ones who really matter in this movie are Streep and Neill ... and they give you all the results. For me, this is one (if not # 1) of Meryl Streep's best performances. Streep never loses the central heart and soul of his symbols with all his different accents (which, of course, are very impressive in themselves). I think this is one of Streep's finer performances, and he will hit it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never been charismatic and impressed with JURASSIC PARK, is the perfect counterweight to Streep's action. What I have seen is undoubtedly Neil's best work so far. It is a shame that the Academy did not recognize it as a lead actor candidate to match Streep ... b / c two of them perfectly play one another. <br /> <br /> More emotionally thrilling than most movies, and also incredibly embarrassing ... CRY IN THE DARK went far beyond my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know the movie as a flick where Meryl screams "The dingo took my baby!" watch the movie and see how much more is in DYY DARK, then one line. <br /> <br /> A ...
