Some movies seem to have been made before we're ready for them. When I watched this movie, made in 1988, I thought I was looking at O.J. Attack of the Simpson (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of individuals in every situation). <br /> <br /> The Australian press, when it is believed, destroyed a potential newborn and the truth. remained for follow-up. It was scary to see invasive, bright media scenes, ridiculous accounts half of the truth and lies, and discussions about the expected values ​​of the case at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> Equally terrible is the portrayal of the media as indifference and misunderstanding of technical information in the case. I would like to see more cases of religious prejudices (seven-day adventists are accused). <br /> <br /> Today, these circuses have become common, but it makes the lesson more important. /> <br /> Streep is great as usual, and that's the best I've ever seen with Sam Neill. Aussie accents sometimes get a little thick but not understandable.
