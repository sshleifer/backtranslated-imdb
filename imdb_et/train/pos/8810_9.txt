I first saw this movie when he called the newly released Trio channel a few years ago, and I recently looked at it - sans commercials - Sundance. I was impressed for the first time and found that it was even more involved in the second viewing. Yes, some segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical comment stands out like a painful thumb - but overall 11 09 01 is a complete success. Best Exhibition: Shohei Imamura's amazing final segment, which today's critics, like Mick LaSalle with a thick spirit, somehow misinterpreted as an attack on "terrorists", but now it turns out to be a masterful anti-war police; Samira Makhmalbafi's opening collection, which succeeds in deep empathy against the victims of September 11, and which is very worrying for Afghan children; and Idrissa Ouedraogo, a crusade for amusing children for Osama Bin Laden - a hunt for almost as serious and successful as REAL Osama. Youssef Chahine's segment is surprising as a failed attempt to at least have the courage to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are essentially American foreign policy and CIA creation, and while Sean Penni's character training seems inappropriate, it is still an effective bittersweet piece of film making. All in all, viewing and seeing are more important than Oliver Stone's Reactive World Trade Center.
