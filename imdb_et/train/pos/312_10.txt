Based on the real story, this series is a pearl of its kind. An Orient who becomes a King who seeks the heart of the most powerful person in the village. <br /> <br /> The Tijuco diamond mine in Brazil has the final authority of the diamond sender appointed by the King of Portugal. When the young and beautiful Xica da Silva has grown up in the relative security of her house, she finds her world threatening to decide to sell the city to a whore, refusing to admit that a black slave girl can be her daughter. Desperately wanted to save herself, Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond artist and plans to escape. The king's army is coming to collect diamonds the next day, and when looting is lost, the diamond sender chains are led, his family is lost and only the clothes on the street are thrown away. Martin, the son of the diamond sender, swears revenge. But Xica and other slaves are being auctioned and Xica comes to Sergeant Major, an old man who bought him just to hit his lust. However, the city of Tijuco comes with a new diamond admirer, elegant and merciless Joao Fernandes. As soon as Xica's beauty hit her, she was manipulated by Sergeant Major to sell her. And so begins a dangerous, intriguing and passionate love story, a deliberate nobleman and a cunning slave between a girl who rises to one day as a queen. <br /> <br /> The series is full of era-rich details of beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. etc. And it really manages to recognize your attention every minute. At times it is funny with sarcastic and dark humor, full of sacred and unexpected turns. "Xica da Silva" is definitely an obligation. I wish I could buy a whole set of DVDs.
