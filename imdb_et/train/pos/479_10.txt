Emily Watsoni Natalia is the most loving and romantic guitar I've ever seen on the screen. She's the queen of this movie. Or does he pass on to the king? The inner knitting of the chess games and the struggle of families for control, power and victory are stunning. Like film chessmakers, the director plays a number of concurrent games at the same time, but they all knit in larger or smaller patterns. The period, the costumes and the shapes of the Italian lake region at the beginning of the 20th century are perfectly caught. No space squares are wasted. <br /> <br /> So many great scenes are rich, I can't read them all. I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, maybe over the weekend, because you can't collect all the poetry of a 64-square but multi-dimensional framework together. <br /> <br /> I didn't read Nabakov's book, but try my own analogy, which I read, reminding me of another romantic winning poetry-game, Barry Levinson's natural. It created the endless end of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book for the benefit of romantic impressionism, which was uniquely American. Well, the director did it better when you seamlessly combined the morals and morals of Russians and Italians into the background of enlightenment. The real story is that the games are zero; there is a winner and loser if both contestants do not win. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, only these limitations and the conventions of life limit us to the extent that we allow others to break our spirit. The pure love that Emily Watson Natalia personalizes can overcome and allow us to strengthen our gifts at the same time. Only the barriers set by our fears can cut us off. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie (10/10).
