This is where the tiny Ruth Gordon plays the author of the Agatha-Christie-type murder mystery, which locks his nephew in a safe way through marriage. Gordon believes he murdered his niece and his young colleagues about suffocation while Gordon travels back and forth to New York. However, he can leave some clues down, scratching a few black safes and improvised and well-hidden notes. Columbo enters the case, suspects him at once, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is at your fingertips as Gordon's secretary and potential runner. I believe Hartley is a big daughter of psychologist B.F. Skinner. I'm not sure his ancestors had anything to do with his attractive stomach button displayed during belly dancing, but I always admire Skinner. <br /> <br /> Murder is well handled. This is a good plot and none of the speakers or the team is talking about anything. But here is the outstanding figure of Ruth Gordon, just over five feet long skosh. He was over 80 and looked at it. It is almost moments when he almost beats, but he constantly expresses charm. His actions are peculiar. You can never be sure if he is serious or if he puts Columbo and the audience. He also has some good features. What humor comes from Gordon. Columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comics. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a nice job for everyone involved.
