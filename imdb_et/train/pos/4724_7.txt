Trapped: The dead buried leads us to a newly opened resort that will soon be closed. <br /> <br /> Let's start with a man trying to blow the cracks to avoid the avalanche. in no way makes sense. anyway, he will hit one extra big when he notices that the resort is open. despite his best efforts, the higher authority tells him that his day is over. <br /> <br /> Soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche will hit. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not discovering anymore I can say that it was a B movie that was intended for a family gala (what I just saw, and that it didn't have ads, proves it is B- movie), it's a pretty decent movie, but it's partly unreal. <br /> <br /> First, when people are buried with ice and snow, they are buried. not just powder. or, how about a screwdriver CD? this is not possible. and finally, what I can't stress enough is that the explosion can't stop the avalanche, it's guaranteed. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is worth renting or watching TV but not having it. 7/10 <br /> <br /> The film is rated PG, but maybe it could have been a bit stronger. the boy almost loses his mouth in the elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, the boy is roasted with electricity and diesel, and people are dying in the weight room. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
