After six feet down completely addictive, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would be almost as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is enchanting! I love this example and can't turn it off. The richness of the characters, the complexity of the plot, the beautiful places are all amazing. I'm completely and completely hooked. I don't know how the creators do it, but every sign touches me very deeply. I feel their joy, pain, everything in my heart! I don't have a cable, so I've rented this series on Netflix. When I put it on, I look at all the episodes at once and feel sad. I can't wait until the next album comes to my home. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen!
