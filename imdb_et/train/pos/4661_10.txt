I can only repeat the praise of other comments here. This is a delightful film that feels a good factor that reaches the limit without exceeding the sentimental sentimentality. Of course, sweet - without sugar. <br /> <br /> One small point: it seems to me that the mild objections to the character of Ustinov's Pendelton, which allow to walk and win the security of the system, ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / bright thing. Yes, the movie was pretty illiterate on the computer, but he showed Pendelton his computer in his apartment, and I believe that meant that his gifts just allowed him to just overnight. <br /> There were a few strange moments when some scenes showed that Gnatpole tried to try Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I'm not sure if we had to believe that Pendelton had failed out of these situations, or if he was quite aware of the tests - it was a bit unclear. <br /> <br /> He must have known enough to set up the manikin's accounts. It is expected that Wallach and Ustinov relied on their rather bleak idea of ​​how computers worked these days, and to understand in detail what they got, it was necessary to know what their concept was. They knew that "procedures" were important; they thought that "smart light" could actually control security rather than just pointing it out; they thought that the functions of the (stupid) user terminal had a strong impact on what could be done on the mainframe itself, even though it was not seen by the graphics function itself. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I think they tried to avoid the real computer business as much as possible and they did it quite well. By allowing them a little artistic license, I don't think their efforts had any flaws worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> The CD
