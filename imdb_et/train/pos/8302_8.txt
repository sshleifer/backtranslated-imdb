Guns blasting, explosive buildings, cars are falling and it's just ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This exciting movie that includes a former CIA mercenary scammer who can't die, no matter how many times he's shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. Harsh and toothy Gary Busey, who is usually thrown in these gloves, is his usual mad charm, but is a bit more modest: after he has been wearing the whole show. What does not mean that there are not many terrible supporting roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala and many other "forgotten" characters. <br /> <br /> There are enough smaller action sequences to keep the whole story up: Busey has to release a group of "abducted" American military elites and return high-tech "supertank" (ordinary container with cheese addition) pasted from above ) back to countries. But is America deserving of this killer machine more than bad guys? This question is, of course, asked as in all films that focus on the CIA ... but without preaching.
