the most amazing combination of two young love and psyche. Presented in the most exquisite way and definitely touching your heart. a rare combination where the sequel goes beyond prequel to storytelling and emotional intensity. and separation pain. the pleasure of seeing your most beloved is unique and something can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have essayes of eternal characters in the simplicity that makes the film just a joy and love to watch. Must see a movie for all people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic (at least one of them) all the time.
