"Scarface" is now a great cult, 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> It has also been widely criticized as very sticky, refined, up and all bloated! These are the people who compare Scarface's godfather movies. It is true that for technical purposes (cinematography, scenario, direction, etc.) there is a Scarface 'godfather'. <br /> <br /> But it is also true that what Scarface and some other gangsters lack in films is the gangster's crude, pure coarse approach. The Latino gangsters of this movie look much more threatening and realistic than any of the gangsters of gangsters in Italy or Ireland, such as The Godfather or Goodfellas. This is one of Scarface's main winners, and I firmly believe that this fact has been "sticky" by most critics! I have seen the original Scarface of 1932 and I have to say that both films are too different and should be viewed as two different films instead of praising the original for a "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been critically criticized for this movie. But how do you think filmmakers did Tony Montana's character! He's the angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws a shot every two minutes. He's not here for Michael Corleone. She is Tony Montana, a very sticky, uneducated person who doesn't think much and gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> This film is definitely 80 years old. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some songs, including 'Gina and Elvira', 'Push it to the limit' and the title track instrumentally. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visiting mother. <br /> <br /> Performances: Al Pacino is great as an angry Cuban refugee. He has allegedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana throughout his career. And it looks like he has enjoyed himself in all his scenes! One wonders what "Scarface" would be like Pacino. I just couldn't imagine someone else depicting Tony Montana and probably the movie wouldn't be as effective without her! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer looks like Tony's friend Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is wonderful when Tony boss Lopez. So is Murray Abraham (like Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then, by Elvira, Michelle Pfeiffer forms some eye candy. She looks beautiful and is enough in her role. <br /> <br /> The director goes a bit overboard during a certain part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would just say that it was the only small part that suffers from mismanagement. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most interesting and one of the best gangster films ever to come out. Enjoy it for what it is: Prudent Drug Lords and their gangland!
