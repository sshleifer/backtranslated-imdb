Being someone who reads the live movie of their five favorite films three times in the night of the living dead, and at the same time loves this parody of student film, I feel I have to protect this movie from previously posted wretched comments. This short but sweet opus has always been a crowd of fear and scientific literary marathons where those who are involved have a love for the genre but do not know they take zombie films too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It is funny and many others I have heard and felt that I agree that it will succeed. Especially for those who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. See that the director came to Jeff Drexel as a news reporter and if you have the chance to catch your alien parody, Loaf.
