It's a little easy. It's about that. <br /> <br /> Graphics are clean and realistic, except that some fences are 2d, but it's forgiving. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. Sounds are great. All talking to SFX is pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> Camera angle is sometimes somewhat frustrating, but it's the same for every platform game like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and Since then, I have received terribly 120 stars over 10 times.
