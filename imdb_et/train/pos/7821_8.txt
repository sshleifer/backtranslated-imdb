Very rarely does Denzil Washington make a bad film and thinks about what is going on for Kevin Kline, and in that case it must be one of their best films. It's more about a movie than a strong friendship can be more than Steve Biko's story, even though we get an idea of ​​what the man was and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to keep the man's name and give the world a knowledge of the corrupt society in South Africa. The direction is remarkable for David Attenborough because it was for Gandhi, although if there is any criticism that should be directed, it may be the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit down on a historical film. What's amazing is how it manages all the extras. Thousands of people in both movies. This movie really opens your eyes to what happened before the break up of Aparthiet, and you can't leave it. 8 out of 10.
