I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! Not only is she an incredible actress, she is also superb with a fantastic body. He did a great job of handing over his lines and making George better than Fraser did. Great play for your first big roll! This movie is full of fun scenes that every child loves. My kids have been watching this movie many times because we bought the day when it came out on the DVD. In addition to the movie, the DVDs have the same fun. Two with that thumb! I recommend it to everyone!
