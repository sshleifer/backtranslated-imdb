I saw it when I was 17 and haven't seen it. CBS's late film showed it at one point on a regular basis. I remember how sad and disturbing it was, it really made me into my stomach. The effects were not what they are today, but he did very well in both parents losing and leaving that Amazon is alone. I remember the most flaws and bugs, so realistic that they eat their meat. This is a dark film that was a controversial subject at that time, although it was likely to be heavily altered on television. I want to remember more details and if I can see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for it for years. I believe this is shown in CBS under another heading. I have no idea if it has ever been published on video.
