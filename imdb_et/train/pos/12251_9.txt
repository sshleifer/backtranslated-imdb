I've been left for a while to see this version, because unfortunately I don't seem to be able to rent it in a video store, but a second version, but I fell in love with it. I was always with other Emma borders. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, because they are not British, must, of course, emphasize and it doesn't seem natural to me. It looks like it's on. I'm sorry, but I don't think Toni and Gwenneth did a great job there. I could not warm up any symbol, but this version is more of a warm-hearted and more type of person I imagined Emma. This is definitely the version I will be returning to. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley didn't see a better picture, but he's convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed her up in a film version, but it is better illustrated in this version. Come to think about it (apart from Mr Knightley) all the characters are better played and much less up. Unfortunately, both came out at the same time and the Paltrow version got more advertising. Sorry ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! So, if you're a Jane Austen fan, don't forget to watch it.
