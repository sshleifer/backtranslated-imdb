Question: How do you steal the scene from expert expert scenes expert Walther Mathau in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? Answer: Quietly, dead and with perfect timing, as George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I don't know anything about Vaudeville, but it remains a favorite movie, both drivers are fun, the script is funny, the script is funny, direction and funny very good. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a straight man - trying to hit Burns through the window and so on. Even small parts are big. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny scenes, Mathau's commercial use, Burns repeats like senile ... <br /> <br /> Pleasure. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
