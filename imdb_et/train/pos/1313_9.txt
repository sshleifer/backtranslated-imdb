More TV movies should be done as such. I saw it back in '93 when it was first on television. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrible, giving very sharp and realistic performances. Weber was particularly good at delivering extraordinarily horrible and underestimated performance as a child molester / killer. This film really brought respect to Hunt as an actor. The director also led the "Hoosiers", which was somehow both formal and exciting. But in both works, the direction is the same, simple and realistic, which is so appealing. If you like TV movies that are not predictable and full, watch it when you can. The side story about Wolf and Fahey is also tempting, without affecting the main story.
