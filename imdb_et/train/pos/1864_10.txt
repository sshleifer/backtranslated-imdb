I watched Antwone Fisher from BRAVO. With awesome movie and incredible young man. This film must be visible to anyone who is abusing childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult. Denzel Washington delivers excellent performance and a young man playing Antwone Fisher. Kleenex warning - I feel good and tearful. The most famous moment is when he finally meets his mother with whom he was taken away at the age of 2 months. And one of the bolder was when he stood up against his abusive mother and sister. I saw this movie in Bravo in 2008 and just wish I had known about it for years. Be sure to include your movie in your DVD collection.
