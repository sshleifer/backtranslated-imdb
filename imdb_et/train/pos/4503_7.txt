In 1916, this short and fun short - the time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the great names of comedy - includes a young Oliver Hardy as a ne'er-well-well who quickly holds his rich uncle for his wife and baby on his visit . <br /> <br /> Of course, it won't go smoothly and soon there will be more women and children than it can cope with; plus obligatory traces and misunderstandings that mark the early film. <br /> <br /> Well restored, it can be seen as part of "Oliver Hardy's early films" and is now available on DVD, a fine addition to the available large-screen favorite communal duo.
