"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit and longing comedy that has a laugh and "ah?" But I suggest giving him a chance. I think it has been very much reviewed. Not too many people give this film a chance. It works. Just think of it as a "perfume" parody. Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does it well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. She's just working for a big boss for a beautiful woman. And, of course, like many mobi movies, nobody wants him dead. 90% of the jokes are laughing. As I said, I give him a chance. Just take your favorite gangster movies and mix in comedy. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
