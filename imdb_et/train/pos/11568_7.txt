One of the many Merrie Melody cartoons that attracted America's world music during World War II, Bob Clampetti's "An Itch in Time" hobby flea that lives with Elmer Fudd's dog. A little boy turns into a real sadist by wearing a dog home, but Elmer warns the dog: "Another scwatch and I'll give you a bath!" In the meantime, a flea dog is a dynamite! * And that's not the end! I noticed that in one scene Elmer reads a comic book with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Of course, Elmer and Bugs are often marked with an asterisk, but Elmer never played with Porky (if you don't read very short "bonds today"). But for me, the idea that Elmer read these other famous symbols of his own genre, the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew his existence in his universe, though they did not appear in this figure. > <br /> Of course I go too far in my analysis. I'm sure the comic was meant for pure entertainment and it definitely attracts. As for the line "I can like that", it seems that this would be something the censors would not have promised, but somehow missed; I don't really know what it should be. Was it something sexual? Finally, when I thought I was all, I would have been tempted to look more, not to do what the cat did (although it was a pure trick). <br /> <br /> * The men behind these cartoons definitely had something for TNT, didn't they?
