This movie is not for everyone. You are bright enough to get "it" or you are not. This movie can be enjoyed by fans of sci-fi movies who do not take themselves too seriously. I recommend this movie to those who appreciate spoofs and parodies. Everyone I have recommended this movie has enjoyed it. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you probably enjoy it. Voice words are linguistic and monolayers fly fast and furious.
