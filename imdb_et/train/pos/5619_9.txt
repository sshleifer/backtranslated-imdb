I once lived with a roommate who tried to commit suicide, and our apartment was in a building where, after midnight bed, you got a fifty-dollar noise from the night - so to speak, I can easily get involved with Polanski's "Tenant". <br /> <br /> But I also enjoy the movie for other reasons. I'm not sure that it works as a whole - Polanski's character's falling into paranoia and madness, which takes the last half hour or so, seems to be quite striking and odd. Ebert, on the one hand, was absolutely convincing, and he hit the film with a witch with one star. But I think the individual scenes and moments work beautifully, so even though I don't understand the whole movie - what is Egypt related to, for example? - I still have a general positive impression of it. <br /> <br /> I love a nervous friend like Bernard Fresson. God, how many times have I been to foolish friends, not friends at all! I love the movie theater scene - a more fun "timing" moment in movie history, I would say. And boy, do I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so clever in this movie, it's almost incredible. And it delivers excellent performance as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I disagree with the occasional unpleasant comments made about his activities here. His character should be low-key and thoughtful, so his low-performance force is suitable. On the one hand, I found him completely sympathetic - although he lost me a little when he started to tow, without any obvious reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is hidden. And slow. But it strikes the alienating qualities of living an apartment - what I've done too much - so I dig it. It's funny how everything you need is a common reference point, and suddenly this strange movie becomes very important! Be sure to replace your pocket on a DVD.
