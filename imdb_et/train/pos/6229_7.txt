One of several musicians involved with seafarers on holiday is a regular sailor who meets a girl, complications, happily sorted out. It runs quite smoothly, but it also moves in places. Dialogue is not as funny as "Top Hat" and Randolph Scott seems inappropriate. <br /> <br /> There are benefits. It has some of Irving's most famous songs in Berlin, including "Let Yourself Go", "I'll put all my eggs in one basket" and "Let's Face the Music and Dance". It is Fred and Ginger who, dancing, take the movie to heavenly height and they don't disappoint here. On the same movie they have a great dance-dance, comic dance-dance and rotating graceful dance! Great versatility and artistry. <br /> <br /> He also has Harriet Hilliard, who is pretty good in his role. He had a diverse career, becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here he touches without sentiment. His two songs have been delivered easily and effectively. She has a good contrast to Ginger, but you can believe they are sisters in the movie. More tightening has made the film even better. Pretty good though.
