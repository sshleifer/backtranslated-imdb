52-Pick Up never got the respect he should have. It works on multiple levels and has a complex but subsequent plot. Participants will give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly cast and offer deep symbols. Also noteworthy is Vanity, who should have shown it as a serious actor, given her unexpected ability, and Kelly Preston, who characterizes you for a few days to haunt. Anyone who likes the act and the sharp complicated story enjoys it.
