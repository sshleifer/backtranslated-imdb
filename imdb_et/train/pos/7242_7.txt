1933 seemed like a great year for satires (for example, "Duck Soup") and it fits well even when it comes to the obsession of a contractual bridge. The tone is like a New Yorker's humorous piece, as the film begins on the "City Chats" page of this magazine. The only thing is strange. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. But after 1934, you would not have had adultery in such a complex way, young and beautiful Loretta Young in some displacement and sliding tools, or a group of prostitutes who listened to the radio signage. Even if you don't know anything about the bridge, you may want to look at the rare example of a Hollywood satire.
