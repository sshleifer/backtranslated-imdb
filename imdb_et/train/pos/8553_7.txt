I just watched a movie I was afraid it would disappoint me. however, I was quite surprised. The American pie franchise is still my favorite film. Yes, it's not true when I say I enjoyed it as I enjoyed the original. Beta House, along with the previous two pies, certainly lost something that the first two do not get. but what the hell is - it's still a lot of funny moments and i think it should be the first movie you want to entertain and relax after a hard day at work or school. beta house deserves 6/10 but I gave it 7/10 just because I was another PIE slice.
