Freddy's dead final nightmare is just as terrible and disturbing as every other nightmare on Elm Street, yes he has this comedy in essence, so there are all the other movies, but how can one say that you don't find Freddy Krueger scary if you would have come across this man's dreams, he wouldn't find him more comical in nature because his comedy shows he doesn't care at all that you are being killed, he finds it very funny, and Freddy also plays comic games with them what in its own way is very disturbing, using its comic ways, which thinks that horror movies on the Nightmare walking street they are today, Writers are extremely smart, making Krueger a comic and frightening as opposed to Jason Vorhees, who says nothing and has not got his really scare the victims. This movie is as good as Freddy's wisdom and I would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and so "Don't forget!".
