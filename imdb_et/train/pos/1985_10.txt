I'm not usually a music lover, but if I have to choose what my favorite would be, Oliver would definitely be. This movie is so well done, the characters are well illustrated, the costumes are good on the spot and the songs are great, my favorite being "Review of Ron Moody's situation, giving a great picture of Fagin. I wasn't old enough to see Oliver at the end of the 60s when my sisters were, so for weeks on end I had to sing bloody songs with them, usually â€œWho buys my wonderful roses, I already knew all the songs before I saw the film. This is a timeless musician that you certainly couldn't do it is not an accurate book and I don't think it would have worked as well as it would have been. I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed when he wrote to Oliver to portray poverty in London, orphanages, workhouses, and what the poor had to survive, and the film represents is very good. Type English Bullterrier, you will notice his long thin legs, it was bred out of breed many years ago, they must be hunting high and low to find the specimen as it is exactly as if English Bullterrier watched in Victorian times. Note that he has scars on his face (which is probably a makeup), Bill Sykes had apparently used him to fight dogs or in a hole in the rats. Victorian Bull Terrier had a record number of rats in the mine. It's a beautiful dog, but noticed that he didn't hold Bill Sykes after Nancy's killing, he's obviously his standards, he's not a thick head Bill Sykes thought he was. great musical to see if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals, try it in some way, something in this movie.
