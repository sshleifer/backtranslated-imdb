Every time this movie is on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times tells us how it is satirical against post-war normalization and the welfare state. I don't think it's a movie at all. The film parodies the spies (the small criminals who ran the black market) and the housewives who fought against government restrictions, but were really Tory's organization. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, the film sends a political / social situation, but ultimately, people realize that they need all the controls to ensure a just society, they want to be British and confused, not abroad. <br /> <br /> But I don't think they're going back as they were before.
