I look at this page and it seems to me inappropriate to listen to someone's ramble and real classics. Of course, I agree to give everyone their opinion, but here is my: <br /> <br /> This movie should not be circumvented by any observer of classical horror, and should be seen in many random viewers around the world. Of course, this has lost some of its elegance and size with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's not the reason why you would like it. <br /> <br /> You should like it because it is actually a scary movie, even for today's standards. This is a general ickyness that throws you out as much as the original audiences, so don't let the classic if you haven't given it a chance. Look at it, but not with a critical attitude. See if it's fun, how it was originally designed.
