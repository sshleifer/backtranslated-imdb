The French novelist, who has been frightened by friends of his female society, is relieving North Africa. There he meets a lively and talented bedouin girl who lives in poverty. Despite her husband, who is romanticizing Maharajah, she decides to train and educate the girl and introduce her to the Paris society as PRINCESSE TAM TAM ... <br /> <br /> The wonderful Josephine Baker is perfectly cast in the title of this very pleasant French movie. With her enormous eyes and infectious smile, she instantly contacts the heart of the viewer. His overwhelming personality and obvious representation with joy look at him. Baker takes care of what happens to the poor Alwin during the transformation and demonstration of Europe. <br /> <br /> Albert Pr√©jean makes Pygmalion very well with Baker Galatea; Georges Peclet as a semi-boxer and Jean Galland as a mysterious Maharajah are also effective. <br /> <br /> The film is very beautiful and well done, with little attention to Busby Berkeley's films produced at the same time in America - unlike American films of this time, PRINCESSE TAM TAM is not racism. It should be noted that there were no Hays offices or production codes in France. Some of the dialogue and action are quite provocative, but it has to be admitted that Baker's singing and dancing under "Under The Sky Sky", as well as his culmination in the Paris nightclub, are two of the most memorable moments. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in 1907 in St. Louise is a very poor family. But his ambitions for talent and driving soon brought him to Eastern Europe, and he was a member of Ziegfeld Follies for a short time. Realizing that in the mid-1920s, America was gifted with great constraints for a black woman, she succeeded in Paris, where she eventually joined Foil-Berger & Le Negre Revu. The French adored her and became a great celebrity. A short return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things hadn't changed for African Americans. He returned to France, became a French citizen and worked in the early years of the war. Baker moved to Morocco for a time and amused the allied forces there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker's treasure began to slip and he faced many financial and personal difficulties. For some time he was forbidden to return to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted Princess Grace's offer from Monaco to live in the Principality. Josephine Baker was back in 1975, at the age of 68, a dead stroke. <br /> <br /> Having appeared on only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger. But he deserves his place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich and Robeson, as truly legendary performers of his generation.
