French production, which invited 11 leading film directors to create 11-minute short films reflecting their thoughts on the events of September 11th. <br /> <br /> The movie segments are very different in content and quality. Two claim US involvement in terrorist acts (Chile against Allende, who died on September 11, 1973, featured in the British director Ken Loach; Palestinian US-sponsored Israelis, shown in the segment of Egyptian director Youssef Chahine). Two more are reminiscent of other destructive acts (Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, Israeli director Amos Gitan; Japanese "holy war" west of World War II, Shohei Imamura). <br /> <br /> Ironies is rich in many stories. The darkening shadows of an apartment in New York collapsed from an old man suddenly disappearing as a telescope of the towers of world trade on Sean Penn, bringing joy for a moment. But in this light he can finally see that his wife has really gone. Mira Nair's film, based on a real incident, assumes that a lost young man, including New York, the son of a Pakistani family, is expected to first be a fugitive terrorist, but later he proves to the hero who sacrificed himself to save others in towers. <br /> <br /> There are dots everywhere. Loach has an exiled Chilean man who quotes St. Augustine so that hope is built for anger and courage: anger in things, courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with very young Afghan schoolchildren who are in exile in Iran, trying to tell them about the recent events in New York. But they have been more impressed with their refugee camp, where two men have fallen into a deep recess, one has died, the other is a broken leg. This is an understandable tragedy for 6-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Ouedraogo, from Burkina Faso, creates a drama where the son of a sick woman in Osama bin Laden is in her village and gathers her friends to help escape the terrorist to get $ 25. million US Fees. He tells his friends that they won't let any adults know their plans because older people would waste money on cars and cigarettes, while he is going to help his mother and others who are sick and poor. /> Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ("Amores Perros" maker), who offers the most powerful and cool segment that usually only shows a dark screen with audio cassette songs and voice. from time to time. The short visual flashes allow us to see the fall of the higher floors of the towers, and it tends to make us these are the bodies that hit the ground. The sequence ends with the music of an elegant orchestra and another picture with the first phrase first shown in Arabic, followed by a translation: "Does God's Light guide us or blind us?"
