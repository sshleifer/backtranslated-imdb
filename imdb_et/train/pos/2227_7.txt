It gives reviews over the entire map because it does not fit comfortably into any form. It's horror, but not splatterfest. It's an equal part of both tense and horror - but without the usual Hollywood screams and jerky camera. <br /> <br /> The film's feeling is free and lean with special effects, because I think you should listen and watch the characters. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan has finished Buffy universe. It's red herring. He works here. "Camp" is the wrong interpretation of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau gives a solid result - so she has to believe that the script has something to say. We all apologize for the excuses where the actors obviously don't care anymore and just wait for the director to click "Cut" and get their wages. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Give the fact that your bodies start to fall almost mondo-funny. I don't think the will was humorous - but to keep you balanced. Think of it as a less fearful of "movie" and more of fear of "Play" on the stage - the one that destroys the white house. Then you can see that it is actually paranoia, fear and spiral madness, placed in an isolated, USA. <br /> <br /> And it's complicated. Time, Mind Control, Secret Tests and Nazis, NOT Dead. . I say renting it and try if you're in the mood for something a little brain. That would be a good choice for a Saturday midnight.
