Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest films, one of the films I think you value more parents. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I find that the film has been the greatest at the time of publishing his films. The characters became larger with the size of the earlier films, creating more symbols to appreciate these symbols more. Cinderella itself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest signs Disney ever created. With her kindness and dry humor she is extremely pleasant; it is the inspiration she offers that makes her memorable. Like many people, he is an endless dreamer and he keeps his dreams, never giving up. Even in the most unfavorable situations, his dreams are tolerated and he does not allow anyone to take it away from him. His inspiration should be inspiration for everyone and encouragement to never dream.
