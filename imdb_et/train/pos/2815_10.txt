I can't believe in my eyes when I read a lot of other comments and comments. As if it were a central film about some mill dudes. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful, funny, crazy, exuberant, violent, but minimally gore and energetic core of all the way. Loved every bit of it. I don't remember anything like a mad smile and martial arts that have been seen. And now the most important thing (at least for me) is that it's a computer effect for free. When I look at some of the Hollywood actors who do it in a modern high definition and fucking high-budget "fuflo" (Russian word meaning "bull * beep *"), I realize that every * beep * child can do it - get wires in the body Adjust, add some cute PC effects and add it to the movie. Here it is different. I don't think there are even dozens of physically advanced stars in the world who can repeat the strokes at the end of the movie or in the "Chinese Football" game. And it's just a little Hong Kong cinema to make fun, not pretending to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> DVDs with an English soundtrack are not a problem with this movie. It doesn't break the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> You can't help mentioning a very nice theater game. Some of you, suppose, don't like it. As for me - it's amazing. Watch a dragon friend who speaks boldly with criminals and suddenly gets a fist on the left side of the head. The expression of his face becomes vivid and he comes up with the hope of expressing the baby. And look at the magnificent size of your mouth - it's almost one ear to another when it grimaces. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a higher rating and thousands of reviews from people all over the world. Very grateful to our Russian industry for publishing classic Jackie Chan films. His contemporaries are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much leap. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 - legendary movie in your genre. Thank you for your attention.
