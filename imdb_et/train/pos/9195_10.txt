I don't give a movie or an exhibition ten very often, but this exhibition touched the nerve in a way that it didn't show. I found the whole series mysoju.com and thought that the premise seemed interesting that I saw. I was not disappointed with what I saw; I was moved. This story stays on the supply side as the main characters move through the scenes. Sumy Iwaya, which Koyuki plays thoughtfully, shows us the human nature if she wants to keep problems. No one wants to put their soul in front of a prospective companion. Instead, he replaces the pet, played by the divine Matsumoto Jun. Such an animal is like any other creature we would consider as a pet. Difference; he can receive it the same way after Momo is a man, not a dog. Because she is treated as a pet, she reacts to situations in which the dog can react. He spends time with a new boy, Momo gets jealous. This is when he realizes that his pet is not just a pet, that the sexual tension between the two will become thicker - Momo is a dance shop. His thinking changes slowly when we look at our thoughts. Matsumoto leads us to seeing a character who is very one-dimensional at first, two-dimensional, when we see that he is a dancer, three-dimensional in nature, when we see that he starts to fall from his husband as a man, not a dog. I think it's worth looking at this story to see this character. Plus Matsumoto plays Momo's kindness that you almost want you to have. Don't want to think about the future and how their relationship changes, but like Momo (the name he gives him would call his new puppy)? we both knew it couldn't survive. Look at this example with an open mind, it's worth it.
