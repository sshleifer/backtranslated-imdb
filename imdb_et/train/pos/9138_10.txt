I am the owner of this film and has been viewed several times over the years after its release. The prince does not stunn us with his phenomenal style of action or anything, he is a musician and I feel that it is what he showed here, he is just the best person to influence the story. Most of this movie is simple and teenage, but it is the fault of the directors / writers, but it's a great movie with even better music. Purple Rain's principles and moral beliefs are quite strong, and if more films are based on the basics, then we are better taught to young children because art reflects life reflecting art.
