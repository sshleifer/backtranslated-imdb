This is a good film, although Modesty Blaise's comic books and books find that it's a bit slow and incomplete. For the Modesty fan, the movie is very enjoyable, especially because it is a very faithful presentation of Modesty Blaise's "history". Peter O'Donnell is on the list of "Creative Consultant" and the filmmakers have to pay attention to it, because the plot follows the details of the comic books over the years [although the events have been updated today]. The only thing a real fan can disappoint is that Willie Garvin has no story. This lack of Willie is simply faithful to the chronology of Modesty Blaise, as the film takes place in the early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden makes a very incredible young Modesty, who actually looks like modesty. A welcome change from Monica Vitti's idea of ​​Modesty.
