In the evening of his bachelor evening, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) will meet at the bar of the proud dancer Becky (Julia Stiles), drink a lot and next morning he wakes up in bed. Her future mother calls her and announces that her groom Karen (Selma Blair) will arrive at her apartment and desperately ask Becky to leave her hurry. Earlier he finds that he has crabs, and later, in the preparation of a wedding dinner, he understands that Becky is Karen's cousin. This is a very funny beginning of comedy with fun situations. The first attraction of this film is definitely the central trio of actors and actresses. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are great actors and very proud, and Jason Lee, who is amazingly funny, is in good shows. I laughed a lot, but there are some scenes that are really fun. For example, if Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds his colors; his imagination in many situations; in a pharmacy trying to buy and get an explanation of crab medicine; most of his neighbor, minister scenes; when Karen calls the department store; or if the police find that Paul is in doubt. I could calculate many other scenes, but with the reader it is better to buy or buy a movie and I have a lot of fun. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
