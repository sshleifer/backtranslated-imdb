To some extent, I liked this film better than the original VAMPIRES. I found this film to be rather nonsense. Woman and spooky fan, I'm used to the fact that women in danger are the main genre. But they just shove Sheryl Lee too much. In this film Natasha Wagner is more realized and the main bad guy is gal! Arly Jover (who played the sidekick vamp in BLADE) is very controversial and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... okay, yes, no big actor, but he's doing OK. At least he won't sing. Check this cable if you can. This is Encore Action this month.
