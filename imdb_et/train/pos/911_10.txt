VIVAH is, in my opinion, the best film of 2006 coming from a director who has been successful throughout his career. I am not too enthusiastic about these romantic films these days because I see them in the "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. But I've been watching this movie three times ... and believe me this is a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH goes back to the traditional route, showing simple symbols for engaging in a reasonable and realistic theme and marriage. For the entertainment of the film are all the ways that can be reflected in the marriage we do (or do). In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya has done his homework well and depicted a very realistic story of a well-made, very fun movie. <br /> <br /> Several sequences of this movie are trying to get your interest right away: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - how is she trying to look at her without making it too obvious to her family in front of you. The song "Do Anjaane Ajnabi" goes well with this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when she comes to see her - the shy Shah, who doesn't know exactly what to say about getting a good conversation. Also na√Øve nature of Amrita, limited eye contact, shameful qualities and Shahid questions. <br /> <br /> The emotional breakdown of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) as she feeds her in the form of a Shahid party, instead of her second daughter-in-law, her uncle's beloved niece. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the film belongs to Amrita Rao. The actor depicts the role of Poonam in the belief that no one can replace him. She looks beautiful throughout the film and depicts a completely innocent and shy traditional girl. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor is also great. He gives a promising result and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to Sooraj R. Barjatya's film. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a lovely screen pair without a doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Great), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very Good). <br /> <br /> In general, VIVAH gives a well-made and realistic story of two families, what he promised. The film has top-quality performances suitable for the film, a great story and great music, as well as the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. It must be seen!
