Alice Walker's highly emotional and influential version of the 1983 novel (written largely for the central character of Celie's letters to God) was a huge success for the Oscar and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Celie was abused and woke up, and Whoopi Goldberg gave his screen the best result by miles. Not far from him was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, a fate-fought fiery woman. The other cast persons specified what Walker was so clearly on this page - Danny Glover Albertina, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, the force of change good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as a corruption preacher woman; and much left of Carl Anderson (otherwise best known as Judas in the 1973 Jesus Christ Superstar film) as preacher Samuel. <br /> <br /> Beautifully paced and sensationally written "Colored Purple" justifies opening this source to include viewers in feature films.
