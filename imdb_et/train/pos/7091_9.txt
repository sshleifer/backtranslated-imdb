The big problem is where to get started, because this film needs your attention for the next two hours, and you won't have to miss the coke for a few minutes because there's a risk you can't follow. But the pause button is also good. Bruce Willis has to go to the magazine to find out what the virus was in the world in 1996. Due to some mistakes, he reaches for the first time in 1990, then in World War I, and how it all looks confused, Terry Gilliam comes out, which must be one of the most intelligent scripts. This former Monty Phyton man knows exactly how the genius is spoken of SF stories and his choice could not be better, there is crazy Brad Pitt (his presence in the shelter is memorable) and brilliant Bruce Willis who proves he is more than any Schwarzenegger. This is a movie that can be viewed over and over, because the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view will give you other surprises. One of my biggest favorites.
