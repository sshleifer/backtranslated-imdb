My son saw this movie 7 years old, now on a Russian fishing boat, and said that the film he was most influenced by and that is in his mind for all these 39 years is The Legend of the Movie. Boy and eagles. He has asked me if it is possible for him. I'm sure many things will go through his head because he only has 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and has three months before the contract expires. Because we have Indian blood, it combines this movie. On January 27, he will be 47 and I would like to receive this movie. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the last 17 years and, as we all know, it is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
