Larry Burrows has a special feeling that he has lost something. Since he missed out on a major baseball, he is convinced that his life would have been better if he had let it go. Then one night his car breaks again. Going to the nearest bar to wait for a tow truck, Larry happens to be a barman Mike, who, to Larry's knowledge, is not going to change his life forever ....... to a great life and not showing any signs of a recent Sandler vehicle that was in Click. This is a genre that has produced very different results. In 1990, this production by James Belush, which was rarely mentioned when the subject was mentioned, seems to have been largely forgotten. What is ashamed because it attracts charm and is not a short humor. We know that we are directed to its ultimate goal, but it is a fun and enjoyable way. The film also signals what was good comedy actor James Belushi. I mean, if his style is smart, isn't your thing? then you are likely to avoid this movie anyway. But for those interested in Red Heat, K-9 and taking care of business, Mr Destiny is just on your street. While driving, Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. <br /> <br /> Mr. Fate, pure escapist fun with the kicker of your heart. 7/10
