I watched this flick yesterday and I have to say it's the most amazing horror movie I've ever made for $ 36,000 (Sorry Steckler) The movie is definitely worth it if you're a zombie. This film lives from the soul and the atmosphere. Some of the zombie shots are best for the film. VERY spooky looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble their screaming victims. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot sexy accents Canadian women keep you busy before HORROR grows into the corpse's head. This movie fun from start to finish. I couldn't ask for more. My only complaint is that it was too short.
