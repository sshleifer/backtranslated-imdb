Really cool flick. Need for any music snobile. You don't need to know the frequency bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie I only heard two songs from Dandy Warhool. The only thing you need is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The movie centers are located around Brian Jonestown's massacre. Dandy Warholid has a "rival" role in the film, but they are BJM's second violin. Dandy Warhools do not play such a big role in the film as I originally thought, but then again they did not have the excitement and unpredictability of BJM. and his very charismatic man, Anton Newcombe. It is a self-evident film and learning of the music industry. Just watch this movie and have fun.
