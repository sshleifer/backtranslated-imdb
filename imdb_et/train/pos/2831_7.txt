I put it on the film when I was on eBay's Caesars Palace because I am in love with my rich history of Vega, the latter being an original luxury resort that is still in good condition (if you don't read Bally, the original MGM Grand). In this regard, this film gives full force. You will be given a great excursion to the Caesaris property, which, despite all the renovation and upgrades they have done for 40 years, is alarmingly similar. In general, according to the film, the graph is somewhat difficult to follow, largely due to terrible editing. And when I say terribly, I don't use that word lightly. There's a lot of spliced-in, another long fragment of Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where Robert Driva's character talks to his father about how much he has grown up, and without explanation, he (Drivas) goes (in these infamous extracts) ) that she is herself, a child, a little boy and then back and forth with her father. (This does not give away any plot details; if anything is possible, it can be prepared and maybe they are not as flabbered as I am editing.) The film is outdated and has a good message about the distinctive differences between father and son. most men can be associated in some way or another.
