POSSIBLE SPOILER - in some way "how to transfer friends ..." is "loser learns to adapt, becomes successful and discovers that something else is more important" story that is in fame. - THE END OF THE SPOILER <br /> <br /> I don't know the original book, but this comedy offers many good moments. Although I think the end is wrong. It seemed too fast and too steep as if something was missing. In addition, I would say that the film is not able to maintain high standards. In addition, you will find a sweet selection of actors and actors who sometimes have conflicting qualities. So far, I've never seen Pegg. However, it is a very unique type, although on the screen it may sometimes seem a bit annoying as needed. Fox proved that he could play a hot star in the clouds with his head. Don't know if it was hard to do, but his performance was hot and so much better than "Transformers" (okay ... probably not a tough game). Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may like it (like me) or it is annoying. On the other hand, you can see Anderson, who proved his acting skills and Jeff Bridges (who is good but maybe he could have been a bit more powerful). They all fit well enough in their character. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a nice celeb comedy, with some more and some less funny sections, sweet cast, but too steep.
