Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, who just lives) strikes her father (.. and speaker offer) who die in an explosion, life, sliding her way through the banks of business branches in the big city of Gotham. If the overwhelming lover murdered, who was supposed to be his next father (and Lily's new lover), the sky's boundary to Lily, as he wrote his different relationships in the diary and the nuances, makes it known that the papers will get if a certain fee does not reach him. Recently, the Bank's president, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of grabbing a lot of dough, but soon finds herself in incredible love after she is in the city of love. This makes Lily's mouth water now when she has succeeded in attracting wealth and prestige to men who bring wealth to their path. However, there are circumstances that lead him to a decision that threatens his successful way of achieving these riches. Trenholm, now his wife, is accused of being imprisoned and lost in the prison. He needs money that Lily now owns or has absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the whole movie, despite the fact that the usual Warner Brothers polishes. Being pre-coded gives the filmmakers the opportunity to develop taboo themes, such as a woman with sexual intercourse, to succeed and how it can lead to tragedy. The good direction of Alfred E Green shows that the seductive result of Stanwyck gives a good idea in different ways and speeches about how to steer something without expressing an act. Of course, the movie shows that money is not all and all that jazz is love in the heart of Lily's dead heart. What ended up with Lily achieves a wonderful metamorphosis as a lovable person, not giving me the truth. He has spent all this time getting to this platform just to fall on a man who was not essentially different from the others he had previously used.
