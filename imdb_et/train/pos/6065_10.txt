This movie is terrible - so bad it is a good way. <br /> <br /> There are so many other movies I don't even describe. This is a sword / sorcery picture, he has a child who hopes to understand how important he is in this world, a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil helper / witch, a princess, a hairy creature .... you get a point. br /> <br /> For the first time this movie I was catching a very tough winter. I don't know why I decided to continue to do it five minutes before turning the channel, but when I caught the Gulfax site, I decided to stay on it and look up to the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white, hairy creature similar to Chewbacca, but not nearly as useful or interesting to look at. He looks for someone to glue a white shag with a carpet and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes where the actor seems to be unable to move, or that he is almost crashing. Although he's not so much in the movie, some scenes are worth it! See how he tries to talk to Bo Svenson, making Solo-Chewbacca's comparison even higher! <br /> <br /> I just bought this movie because of this character and it's still somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may seem like a sh! t, but he did this movie !!! The only reason I have never seen or even sought this sequel was because of his absence! Perhaps the final film that has completed the trilogy should be completed, Gulfax is making a very welcome return!
