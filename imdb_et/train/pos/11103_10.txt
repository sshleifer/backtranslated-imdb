"The Godfather" on television, but aside from this praise and mobster characters, the two are nothing like that. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a panic attack. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually a part of two families - in one family he is a loving father, but not a perfect husband, and in another family he is a merciless spirit. After the analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems are actually caused by his mother Livia, who suspects he has a personality disorder. Gandolfin is rightly recognized as the main character; more Bracco and Marchand are not nearly as well recognized for their equal and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are recognized for their excellent supporting roles. Van Zandt (E-Street Bandist) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend and is quite convincing and locking. Chianese, the only recurring actor who has actually appeared in the godfather's movie, plays Tony's uncle and on-off-nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lipi, Sciorra and Buscem. Tony's children are "okay" but not remarkable (except for the Iler stunning result in the third to last episode "Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are not convincing and general, but the exhibition is too strong to hold them back. Even if the exhibition lasts over six seasons, it is no longer a dull or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (Four)
