This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this, dead (the so-called zombies) have died to live. However, the company has developed a collar that puts zombies around the neck to be obedient and perfect servants. Robinson's mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire a zombie because everyone in their block already has one. Tim calls Zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control over Fido and things go wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see, many other things include the Lassie series start-up film, where Fido is for Lassie. Timmy was named the reason! Each single of the famous Lassie episodes is transplanted. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido out to get help before zombies eat him! This is also the satire of Sirki films in Doirlas of the 1950s, where everything is bright and colorful - but the dark secrets tear people apart. The characters wear very bright clothes from the 1950s (Moss is always in clothing) - especially the furnishings, settings and cars are all in the 1950s in bright colors. Even if the script becomes repetitive, there is always something to look at. The script is good - but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can do. Melodramatic is kind of stupid, but cast it off. Everything here is great and right. Even Connolly as an emotional zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - playing every row for all your values ​​--- but never overboard. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone (of course). Satire can disappear for most people and gore is pretty annoying. Gore is done so randomly and it is hard to take it seriously when playing happy music. So for some people, it really works. I'll give her 8.
