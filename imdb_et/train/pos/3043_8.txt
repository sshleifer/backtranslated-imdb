This movie tells you why Amitabh Bacchan is one man. This film also explains why Indian filmmakers are smart buyers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the top of Bollywood's domination when her one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to reuse her image. Prakash has the habit of choosing topics and narratives from it, adding to it the liberal doses of Bollywood's sensitivity and clich√©s. Zanzeer saw the preparation of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about a bastard and Namak Halal was a master-servant of loyalty. <br /> <br /> Then the theme was limited to moving the script, three hours of singing, dancing and drama. The film includes a career in Haryanavi, who goes to Mumbai and becomes a hero of regulation. Amitabh's vocal skills and words saw this movie for his great bucks thanks to his flawless Haryanvi accent. For me, this is the biggest drawing of the film alone. The rest are all typical Bollywood screen writing. <br /> <br /> Amitabh now had some typical comedy scenes in his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This film had a good dose of them. Party shoe captain, monologue by Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare, under the leadership of the Mosquito Challenge and the usual drunken event that has now become the usual Amitabh price. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the film with his moody, subtle character (remember he asked Ranjeet's "Shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned cakes "), which was an important role for the captain, while Amitabh was his loyal servant, but Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind ... and so Shashi had to wear his movie with the rest of the movie, it was one sign that could have been a more serious movie, but it's a caper, remember? Amitabhit with a new hat and going home happy, the end is always predictable, and the good guys can get up and the bad go up, the subject of obsolete loyalty is once again stressed and all is well to end well. <br /> <br /> So w The hat is what makes this movie classic? Amitabh Bacchan as Haryanvi Prakash Mehra created another icon for the story, Chuck's story, characters and plot My characters are for Amitabh only.
