This indie film looks at a group of people who take adult swimming in Connecticut. The plot is quite thin. The film's leading characters, who are excellently played by mostly unknown actors. Predictions are Brewster as a high school teacher who has marriage problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who is cubic. Two actors give a natural performance and work together. This is an impressive film debut for the writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the narrative fast. The movie's title and poster show something awful, but it's a wonderful little comedy drama.
