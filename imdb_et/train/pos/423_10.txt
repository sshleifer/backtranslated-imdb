I just read the plot summary and that's the worst I've ever read. It doesn't make this incredible movie right. For an example of a good summary, read the "Turner Classic Movies" list. Anyway, it was one of my favorite films as a little child. My sister and I couldn't wait until April when we saw it in T.V. This is one of the best horse films of that time. This is one of the great classics the whole family can see. Romance is pure and loving. The story is interesting and the songs are great. They don't make such films anymore. Good functioning and not upper. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are the best with many other great actors.
