An excellent film that shows the pathetic life of the two walnut old lady. They couldn't live together or split. Constantly, sometimes at the same time, they beat the past and repetition; and what could be. I found that I was laughing at times, but most of the time I took those two women so sad and abandoned. Look at it.
