This movie was amazing. It was an original concept (vampire film corresponds to the Yakuza mobile). It is a humorous and yet very dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and commenting on society subtelly. Gackt Camui excelled in the role of Sho and HYDE was his first film as a tortured but humorous vampire, Kei, for a surprisingly good. I laughed and cried Toshi, a happy character who grew up in Shoga. I loved this movie every second, especially moments like a funny cigarette scene, fighting scenes, and above all the audible end.
