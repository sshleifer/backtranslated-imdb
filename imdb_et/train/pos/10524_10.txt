Jane Austen will surely approve it! Gwyneth Paltrow does a fantastic job that prevents Emma's attitude. She's funny without being too silly but elegant. He puts a very convincing British accent (not a Briton himself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but he deceives me ... he was also a great "slider" ... Sometimes I forget he's American ~!). <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson's and Phyllida's Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) are also excellent as Bates women. They almost steal the show ... and the law of madam doesn't even have any lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
