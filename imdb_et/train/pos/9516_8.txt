Tom Hanks as you haven't seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death". He is a senior Irish mob boss with his replacement John Rooney (Paul Newman). The young son of Sullivan (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses what his father is living, and both will soon be on the road for seven weeks, robbing the banks to apologize for the murder of Sullivan's wife and another son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer who wants to kill Sullivan himself for the opportunity to add his dead mobster photos. Filmed 30's life dramatically. Sometimes the bog is attacking, but then there is a story about the destruction of graphic violence. Director Sam Mendes directs it on a strong association between drama loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and secret husband and his young son. Other notable cast members are: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks again turns out to be a very memorable film. Make room for some Oscar!
