"What would you do?" is a question that will remain in your mind a week after the emotional Brokedown Palace. The question remains whether Alice (the Danes) spoke the truth or not - an issue that remains unresolved and right. This is a very well done and beautifully captured film. Although it is slow from time to time, it is a reflection of the pace - but many movies are on the edge of your seat; who want to know what happens next. Finally, I'll leave you with the characters in the shots of the frames that are played perfectly by Kate Beckins and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also commendable.
