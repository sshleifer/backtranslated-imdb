When "Girlfight" came out, the comments praised it, but I couldn't see it. Finally, I saw it when this video was released, and I understand the glowing overview. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a high school in the middle of the getto. We will soon introduce the student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). He has expressed a bad ass on his face and every idea of ​​Diana we can get from this expression is confirmed when he fights. When Diana struggles against it, we meet our father with an aggressive type; obviously we cannot blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But then the movie really comes up when a new idea in Diana's mind thinks: Boxing as a way to get into this gloomy existence. His older brother is already in the box but his father probably disagrees. Only Diana can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Just the first few minutes alone, I found myself in a very sharp, non-Hollywood movie, but John Sayles's brief appearance in a supporting role confirmed it. Even before they reach boxing games, you will feel like you see the life of Diana's life as a ugly life. And when they finally get to the movie, there is no return. <br /> <br /> All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I admit that the use of boxing as a tool to show someone who is trying to do something themselves has been a kind of cliché ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby") for years, but I still think they did a great job here. In fact, it may have brought the top of the genre. Very good. It is too bad that Michelle Rodriguez was hurt in Hollywood films after that.
