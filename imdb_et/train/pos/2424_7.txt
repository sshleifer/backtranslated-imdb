Three generations of their only deserts will be wasted after their lives in greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; this style of film always makes me wonder where the reality leaves and the imagination takes over. Even if these people were on the ground, I still found myself sad. They couldn't really do a great deal of opportunity.
