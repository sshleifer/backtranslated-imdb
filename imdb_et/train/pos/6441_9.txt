As the sky is {SPOILER WARNING), it was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable that changes the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a highly talented musician who has been physically and mentally exhausted due to his career and must give it up. When he joins the church chorus as his pulpit, he brings along the life of the crust as Jesus did in the first century with Palestinian society. They laugh, start talking to each other openly and honestly, their shortcomings come together, accept each other, come to love each other, become a vital community. and they are gradually rejected by the decorators. When Stig Daniel fires, rebellion and Stig are broken. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of the day of Jesus, whose demand for the observance of the Jewish laws gave rise to a stark contradiction to the new life through the "golden rule" that Jesus brought. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone says, "The Church invented sin." Throughout the film, there is a contradiction between moral and vital life (being). <br /> <br /> The story of Christ proves that Conny kills Daniel when he defeats him, leaving him in the river. Next scene, we can't believe it when Daniel (resurrected!) Body pulled into his room (tomb) printed on a white fable (shade!) For the Three Wives (three women kept watchful at the Crusade) in the Gospel). Daniel is brought closely to Lena, a warm, beautiful young woman who has been loved by a man who has now been loved and who is now promising (Jesus developed a close relationship with Mary Magdalene) Lena - who was probably a high-level Courtesan / prostitute. Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something she has longed for, and now she finds perfection. <br /> <br /> Gabriella's sung solo, written by Daniel, is everything that lives full of life, unlike moral correctness that causes concern for sin and what is right and wrong. The final scene shows the choir that he sings / moves in harmony, like a mantra, drawing a large audience, illustrating harmony and interconnection, which is our true human destiny.
