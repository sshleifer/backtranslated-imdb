After all, you won't go to the Orson Welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and cheerful star grinding ?? <br /> <br /> Are you going to see theatrically elevated characters in contradiction to colorful and unusual settings, illuminated and painted imagination, captured bravely, and all things erected with unexpected surprise details to prevent the wiser and the duller from thinking or thinking first? <br /> <br /> As usual, Welles wrote the script and also played the hero? a young Irish sailor who knocked the world and saw his evil, but still kept his trust with the good of others? Unfortunately, he gave him confidence in Rita Hayworth, whose cool good looks hid the gloomy of the past and the murderous future? He was married, without love, to an impotent, poor lawyer, a brilliant lizard of Everett Sloane? <br /> <br /> It is the all-inclusive romance that underlies it, and this quality came from "The Lady from Shanghai". Before the inevitable happened, Welles fled? the last triangular showdown in the Mirror Hall, which has become a classic scene in the postwar cinema? <br /> <br /> Welles didn't lose the chance to contrast words and activities with visual detail that enriched the texture and lifted the atmosphere throughout the film. His camera seemed to shine on Rita Hayworth because the sun was playing with her hair and long limbs as she played the young sailor playfully on her web?
