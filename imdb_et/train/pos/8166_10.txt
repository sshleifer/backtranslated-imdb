This movie is very big! Action is good, Corbin Bernsen's excellent casting into a perfectionist dentist who tortures and tortures his patients. At first he sees his wife with the pool and then goes crazy. He also punishes his wife and the pool he is tormenting. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some of them are indeed counterfeit (like drilled tongues that have fallen in the night and are still red in the morning). But the scenes of torture are quite well done. Although this film has a weakness, it is very slow; sometimes heavy parts are sometimes just extremely boring parts. But the real horror / thriller fan is this must-watch!
