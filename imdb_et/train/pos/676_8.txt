The "last wave" is much more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a disaster movie, it's just a study of Australian Aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than just a court drama. Writer / Director Peter Weir succeeds in bringing these elements to the next level to create a truly effective and thought-provoking film that has the same nervous atmosphere he gave to Picnic At Hanging Rock two years earlier that you remember years later <br /> <br /> When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpili) over an aboriginal death for which he may or may not be directly responsible, he finds he is not just in trouble to get the truth from Lee but in the sense he hears when it comes. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the time of everyday life and dreams, the truth exists on two completely different levels, the consequences being more catastrophic than Burton could ever have imagined. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt why it is better to remember that "cliffs hanging on a picnic" are a permanent mystery. We are led to the same track but forced to find answers. In The Last Wave, we can all put together at the end of the movie. But even with all the information we need to choose how much we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the limits of our normal reality. <br /> <br /> On the production side, Weir will use its budget to leverage, gradually building a comprehensive cognition, from soft lighting to heavy rain, to sound use. Random music is unobtrusive, never trying to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain manages to pass on the inconvenience that the audience would undoubtedly feel when trying to unravel the secret. David Gulpilil is an excellent man between two worlds who wants to do the right thing, but he's afraid he already knows the end. <br /> <br /> Put all these things together and you have a great example of why David Weir is a familiar name in the cinema thirty years later. Recommended.
