It's a hard-boiled Warner Brothers movie starring very young Barbara Stanwyck. The perfect captain, who is a Machiavellian cool, is the technique he refined after eleven years in Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, the owner of the violent speaker of a violent grain city. She has become cynical and numb for years when she was offered sexual benefit to her father's clients. When his father dies in an explosion at a distillery, he puts a freight train in New York and literally carries the bank's corporate ladders. <br /> <br /> It would be superfluous if Stanwycki relaxing work here. With his dead-eyed enthusiasm and immoral seduction techniques, it is easy to understand why men depend on his aggressive carnival. One of the young men he attracts is the fresh face of John Wayne, all things, accountant Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama is hard-hit against the last third of the movie by a murder suicide that is a hush-hush job in Paris to keep Lily's quiet and new bank president, so lily so dependent on her, that she is forced to keep her money in luxury. Finally, it is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanwyck displays the screen. The film has curious features like Lily's friendly relationship with African-American Chico and a German immigrant who teaches Lily to Nietzsche about the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
