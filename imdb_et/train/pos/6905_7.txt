I thought Mr Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr Julia, played his role as equally perfect. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss replaced the dictator against his will. But he became more confident and satisfied over time. Because everything happens for life's reasons, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he had to stay there for a year he did. I think he stayed because he had to see how well his life was compared to the poverty he showed in Parador. I think he took it for granted during his lifetime and had to get serious control of reality while staying in that country for as long as he did. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. anyway ............ that's why I gave this movie out of 10 out of 10.
