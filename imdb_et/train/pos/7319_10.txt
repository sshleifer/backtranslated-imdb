Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. She takes her problems to her older sister, whom she murders at the beginning of the movie. It's just the beginning of things coming from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays with a doctor who has been learning Myers for years. He knows he has something else that is mysterious evil. This evil is not kept and cannot be stopped. <br /> <br /> After the institution escapes, Myers pursues his younger sister. When he kills him, the misconceptions of this misunderstood boy can be over. But he seems to be having trouble refining his sister when other people get on the road. He manages to take them out while looking for the girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There have been a lot of horror films with a masked or terrible killer. But it all started, sort of. If you think that, most of these fear films we all remember are those with Freddy Kruger or Jason behind about half naked girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, these characters wouldn't be haunted by our dreams when we were kids. <br /> <br /> Halloween director John Carpenter got a lot out of the 50's fears. and combined everything he knew for a movie that scared many people back in the late 1970s. These films strengthened her as a director to watch and jump, and Jamie Lee's Curtis career began, playing a girl kidnapped by a masked killer. it wasn't much there. It's copied and ripped, but Halloween is always the most important teen horror movie. It still gives you the chills that listen to Carpenter's exciting music, while we see that the other victim is sacrificed by this shady Michael Myers.
