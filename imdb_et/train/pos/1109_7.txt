Having only seen two of my pictures before, I've reached Altman. Before that, I always marked my movie style "boring." You just have to be right to understand your crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is quite undervalued and highly questionable. In fact, I don't think it's ever issued to VHS. Why so? If all these dirty movies get DVDs every day, will it be lost without reason? Honestly, I had no real problems with this movie. It was mostly consistently amusing and funny. Almost all scenes for some reason are mysteriously interesting, whether it be a great dialogue or a subtle presentation. Here is the real skill. <br /> <br /> The mid-bottom pool by Paul Dooley is delightful. <br /> <br /> If you can, try finding a forgotten little copy. pearl. It is not perfect, but it is much better than most of the sediment that DVDs there. Hell, I would be happy with this nice copy of VHS. <br /> <br /> It's often in Fox Movie Channel, so look at it.
