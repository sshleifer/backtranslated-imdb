This movie was terrible about me when I was just a kid. It's not "Citizen Kane", but it has moments. Hanging a hand is good. The plot is good even if there are no characters - there can be something to do with it. Put some top names on people in roles and see what you get. It was one of those shooting, editing (little was) and spreading a few months of movies. This is a classic low-budget sci-fi and deserves this very reason. I appreciated it from nine other films of this genre and age.
