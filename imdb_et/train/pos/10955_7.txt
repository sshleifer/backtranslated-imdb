Originally I got a nice fat 8 for Sarah's show, but I am a little bothered with late humor and the thin 7 is what is placed. I explain. <br /> <br /> You either like Sarah's humor or you don't. If you don't, I doubt someone could convince you. You know who you are, and that's perfectly good, but you know it too. Moving forward, the first season gave us fantastic bits of Sarah, her friends and family and her lifestyle. In a memorable episode, official Jay, whom he meets for the first time, "pulled". - "Do you know why I stand here?" he asks. "Because you have everything in high school C?" he quizzically responds. It seemed like a real question. - It's a funny thing in my book. Sarah can come to you from strange corners. In the second episode, his attitude to God was particularly funny. God is mighty and jealous of fun. It's wise, it's a twisted view, but he showed us the truth in humor and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. Although we are not yet new and inventive comedy, we seem to have slipped into somewhat banal pain and joking. I want to laugh here and there, but a lot seems to be stuffing when he and the writers struggle to find some original material. Sophomoric and tiring is the feeling I have for episodes lately, but I've been giving it to the gems I find (turtle) and I look forward to turning it around. I was a fan of his "Jesus Magic" routine and I would like to think that I understand what he can do. Back to it.
