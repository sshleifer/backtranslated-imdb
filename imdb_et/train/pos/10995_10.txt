I've seen it in a movie theater when it came out for the first time a few years ago and really enjoyed it. But I wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to the movies that are coming out now, and I'm saying it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!!!! !!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie unless you fully follow the action you lose and you don't understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so good that it can't be expected. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on the manufacturer!
