This movie is so wonderful that it is hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can't decide what was better, a book or a film. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic and Oprah Winfrey, as a good actor, he can be funny, happy and unhappy at the same time. The movie was all staged by Steven Speilberg and should not be passed on. 9/10
