A superbly original film that has enough twists for the nail bag. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she looks like. The story is very linguistic and the dialogue is skilfully underestimated. Humor and a hint that neither can characterize Posey pulls out so well. Supporting casts are stars. The downside? This film needs your full attention, almost until you stop the movie and make notes. Posey has more eyes when he raises eyebrows than most actors in the body. He deserves your time, even if you don't understand what you don't want.
