This is one of the films that explore the cultural clash of eastern people cultivated in Western countries. <br /> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> </p> <p> <p> </p> p> </p> <p> </p> Ken, a rock n'roll fanatic, will marry a Japanese girl in Kyoto so she can stay in the United States when she has finished her visa. The marriage is expected to be only temporary, ie until Kyoto reaches its legal status. But Ken, who seems to have disappeared in every relationship, knows Kyoto and tries to do things very well. This is despite the wish of his friend that Kyoto dumping and the release of all obligations towards girls is bad for roller coils, except to inspire a song that speaks of broken hearts and everything. <br /> <br /> However, Kyoto comes from a rigorous traditional Japanese upbringing and does not expect to be married to Ken. Not only is he home and wants to return to Japan. It's sad that it is finally someone who thinks he can love and be together and everything except once he thinks he found someone to feel that way. It's not that he doesn't like Ken, but he's used to a healthy lifestyle. He says, "I can't tell him how I know English, and Ken can't tell me how he feels in Japanese." This is a rather sad love story with the killer's 80's techno-nintendo soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I hurried to love Tokyo because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80's movies, Tokyo Pop. And for those who enjoyed Loving in Tokyo Time, check out Tokyo Pop (New York singer goes to Japan and joins Japan's American cover group), except for the one who has a happy ending. <br /> <br />
