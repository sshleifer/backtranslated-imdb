I found this film to be an exciting study of the crisis. When Leo, the eldest, reports that he has HIV + family members' reactions alone and with each other, they touched and were still strange. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a family that would have been as physical as it was; or anyone who is likely to scream each other. I did not understand why the family thought the younger people could not solve the news, but once this difficult time passed, I found it as a thoroughly moving film. <br /> <br />
