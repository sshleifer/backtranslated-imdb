Under no circumstances is my favorite Austen novel and Paltrow anyway my favorite actor, but I found the film almost completely fascinating. Paltrow does a good job and Cummings, Stevenson, and who plays "Miss Bates" are absolutely terrible. The details of the period are not alienating; the movie's feeling is actually right. But the actual "finding" is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. The IMO couldn't have been more perfect casting. I hated Mr K in the novel, but I found him wonderfully humane and humane in the film. The good looks and smiling eyes of Northam do not prevent pleasure! Highly recommended. AnaR
