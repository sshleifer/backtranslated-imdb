This movie is one of the most provocative films of Jesus I've ever seen. It does not try to speak the whole story, but to portray the interpretative expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is darkly witty, playful and seriously faithful to elements of Jewish tradition and contemporary scriptural interpretation. Judas is much more common than other images, not darkness and evil, which we sometimes imagine, but a very erroneous man who is terribly mistaken. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and dedicated - very human, but also divine. The final dialogue is thoughtful and works like two little talks that two powerful men can do when they have just been scared. I watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
