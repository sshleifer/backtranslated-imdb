Most of the 70's (and 80's) Kong Kong martial arts films barely function as films; usually there are some well-planned sequences of fighting, but the plots are scraped quite thin to fill the gaps between these nodes - like porn movies, really. <br /> <br /> But it does a lot of things well. The most open-minded is the direction and choreography that limits each fighter's "style" - it is really based on the acrobatics and comic strip of the Chinese circus, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is a camera language that uses some impressive methods (even today's action), changing the projection speeds from real-time slow motion and unfiltered views into filtered views to represent the direction of the past or the future. <br /> <br /> The least public, but the most powerful and unexpected is construction. The winner of this competition will determine who will "hit" the story. The captain (writer) creates a game where the wizard does not know who he is looking for, which is the same as the viewers find themselves. One by one he thinks who is at the same speed we find who is who. All of this follows the tragedy / arcade. The end tends to irony, la "The Sting." A lot of smarter things than what we usually get out of this genre. <br /> <br /> The five-poison idea is the size of Tarantino's "killer viper assassin" model "Kill Bill".
