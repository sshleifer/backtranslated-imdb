In Mexico, the former CIA assassin and now the alcoholic decadent man, John Creasy (Denzel Washington), has been hired by an industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), who is the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken). her young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and her husband Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of Cold Creasy, making her lively and smiling again and feeling very fond of her. When a girl is kidnapped and Creasy is told that the criminals were murdered, she swears that she will kill all those responsible for the robbery. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece and will definitely become a classic in the future. The story is great, never shining, and although it takes 146 minutes, the viewer does not know the passage of time. Great actors and actors are cast, their performances are outstanding, featuring Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Cinematic art has wonderful moments and the scenario has stunning lines. I personally loved the character of Christopher Walken explaining to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death and prepares for his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best films of this genre, if not the best film of the year. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Revenge")
