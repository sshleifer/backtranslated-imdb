This movie is still a favorite. Only pretentious, humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful movie. This film looks like a slice of hot apple pie with added vanilla ice cream in France! I think this is Cher's best work ever and his most credible result. Cher is always blessed with charisma, good looks and enviablely slim shape. Do you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely celebrated the entertainment industry and is remembered for a long time when others have come and gone. He is one of the most unique artists. It's funny because who would have thought Cher was such a naturally talented actor? He is present in today's "movie stars". Cher is a true actor at the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and some others, because she never seems to be "acting", she really becomes convincing. He has more than a tribute to his peers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstrucki is wonderful - characters, landscape, dialogue, food. I never fell into watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch a scene where they all sit around the dining table in Rose's house, I stop the remote control to see exactly what the delicious food Rose is serving. I saw spaghetti, mushroom (I think), but I can't find out if they eat ravioli, ziti? What is this main dish? Looks great and drives me! <br /> <br /> Everyone in this family was a hardworking man and they respected and cared for each other. The grandfather was not pushed aside or tolerated, he was an important part of the family and was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be a pretty healthy, independent old encoder. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother was not "just a housewife," she was an adhesive that kept the family together and set an example that a woman's mother and housewife should try. He was proud of his chosen lifestyle, but he didn't let him determine who he was. High-power businessmen are not as comfortable in their skin as Rose Caster. Note that he said "I had no children before I was 37. This is not over". You feel like she was a young woman who did exactly the way she was happy and got her way without the other person realizing what was happening. He was charming and fast. What a great mother! <br /> <br /> I didn't like Loretta right now, because she seemed a little familiar - all who were not really as adventurous and as if she was in control when she wanted others to think. He could tell others about himself and where they went wrong, but he didn't use common sense for his life. She married a medieval mother just because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose for her life. He was more common than his mother. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron in a detention house and seemed humorous and boring, but below she felt that she was vulnerable and lonely and had much love to give the right man. He would probably end up with an awesome mother. <br /> <br /> In the future, I saw a house full of Loretta and Ronnie loud, shouting happy children and Rose and Cosmo who enjoy it every minute.
