I watched this film so many times through my child's cover that even today I can see the whole dialogue a lot again. And when I look at it, it just makes me happy and surprising. I think it is amazing how they managed to train animals, especially cats, to the extent that they can play the main role of the feature film. But now, unfortunately, I look at it as not a masterpiece that I ever thought. But I prefer to remember how I felt when I was younger, watching it in VHS on my fist television, which was yellow in the cloud. And bearing in mind that this is a children's film, I would definitely give it a 10/10.
