William H. Macy is here the most sympathetic and persuasive than the dead man and the loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angry with his glorious parents. There is a lot of territory in the midst of a crisis living on the track, as the "Sopranos" of the TV (here he is shrinking), but it is still worth looking at some of Brommel's tense direction (looking forward to what this guy directs to the next), a great script and all the big shows. Macy is great as always. This is probably his best role since Fargo. Donald Sutherland is his horrible at best, the dominant father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly ripping dramatic move like Macy's husband. Young David Dorfman is great because Macy is a bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (whom I usually find awful) is convincing as an anxious young woman who hits Macy's eye. All this is moved by a touching score and a sharp pace that leads to a predictable but still strong peak and meaningful aftermath. This film made a much wider release because I suspect it would have been related to the audience.
