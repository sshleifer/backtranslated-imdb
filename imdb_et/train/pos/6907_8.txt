This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you get out of it. Think "Dave" has gone to South America because Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor between jobs chosen by the parade secret police leader to replace the dictator, Alfonse Simms, drunken sot after he has been a heart attack and died . Noah worships, the role of the former dictator mistress, as they try to prevent Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also appears as a cordial American migrant who turns out to be a CIA. ALSO starring Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are some absurd moments, such as freezing the old dictator's body during the year and the last scene where Sonia Braga, who has a bee who occupies Dreyfuse's bloody, bullet body. to see moments later all the pristine whites, nary blunt her. All in all, this is a big romp.
