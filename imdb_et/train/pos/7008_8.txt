WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a fan of modern Italian directors at all. Usually I don't like dramas. I'm not a Will Smith super fan, even if I think he's a very good actor ...... but this movie! This is such a great movie that has such an original script and so good direction and so well working ... wow ... it's stunning. This film struck my attention in a minute's minute and I didn't even like "The pursuit of happiness" (maybe because I didn't like Will's son's acting as a very bad actor, while the kids usually seem to be all naturally born actors, I saw he also last night "On the day the earth was standing" and confirmed that I feel that Jaden cannot act, I do not want to write a spoiler and so do not tell the story, but I can say that this movie is about love, death and other feelings that I don't like to watch in a movie. This movie is such a great movie. If you have a minimal heart, you won't regret watching it
