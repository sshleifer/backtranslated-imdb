The last hard men find James Coburn's law, which makes a long sentence that breaks the chain gang. Will he and his friends go to the Mexican border for prison and security. No, they are not, because Coburn has a revenge mission. The killing of a peacekeeper who took him in and in the process killed his wife. <br /> <br /> This peace officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired and knows what Coburn is for. When he explains this to his daughter Barbara Hershey, Coburn was put on the boat and took part in a similar position to Waco. His Indian wife was killed on the ball. He's not something he's proud of, he was a man in a security accident. <br /> <br /> That we would not be sorry for Coburn that he knows well what he really is. Heston is his usual hero hero, but the actors of the last heavy men respect James Coburn. He blows all the others on the screen when he is. <br /> <br /> Coburn has a vivid idea that Heston will follow him, robbing Hershey and bringing him to an Indian reservation where the white authorities cannot touch him. He knows that Heston must make it personal. Heston has Chris Mitchum, his son. <br /> <br /> The last tough men are one nasty and brutal west. Andrew McLaglen led it and I think it may be a project for Sam Peckinpaugh. This strongly demonstrates that its influence is slow in stressing violence, using liberal use. There's a lot of it. For The Little Peckinpaugh Lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
