Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are an inappropriate couple who get into the car and go to work for one or the other. Morgan Freeman is a great person who is related to one and all of them, while Paz Vega is a straightforward cashier behind "10 items or less" who threatens customers and misses their minds. Together they explore, discover and learn from each other. To do this, of course, they must be vulnerable, interested in change and have the sense of humor they all have. I want this film to be realistic, I want this type of story to happen more often, I wish we didn't have to go to the movies to understand that we can really communicate with each other even when we come from a very different background. The film's message is based on an open heart and makes us think about the possibility of another world where we meet there - a world where peace could be an opportunity.
