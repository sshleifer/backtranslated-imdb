Although I'm not the best Anime I've ever seen, but I enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I've never read a comic and just saw it in a video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> Animation was OK, I got the 80s anime feeling that's turned off for me. Why all others hate what is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The character development was good. I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death. for you who did not like it, you had no obvious attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens, and she used her words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a pleasant mentor / soldier. his dark bruising styles were perfect for such a film. <br /> <br /> I think everybody here who has done it has to look at it and think about it. Everything that people have subdued can be said about every favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
