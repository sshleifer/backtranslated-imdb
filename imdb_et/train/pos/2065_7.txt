Terrible symmetry is a pleasant episode with some bugs. The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near the Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwestern Idaho. The 'Deep Throat' season takes place near Ellens Air Base, in the southwest of Idaho. I mean, the bases of the air force are the same, but they decided to use a real name in a terrible symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, a zoo keeper, reminds me of old school teachers. They had to like the kids at the same time, you just can't imagine how. Just as he had to take care of the animals at one point. I liked the concept of episode, but I felt that it had some contradictions. If foreigners are so adept at robbing people and returning them safely, why can't they put the animal back in the right place? And are foreigners facing problems in returning animals now? I don't buy Mulder's theory of space-time continuum problems. As if he were an expert on it. I also thought that Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done. In addition to these nitpicks, I still enjoyed this episode thanks to the intriguing notion that foreigners collect both animal DNA and human DNA.
