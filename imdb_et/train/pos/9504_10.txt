As many people know, the Mexican cinema was very bad at the end of the 90s and at the beginning of the 21st century, after the Mexican cinema, with great films such as La Ley de Herod, Bajo California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá Tambi and of course El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba appeared. El Coronel ... is a great film that talks about Gabriel García Márquez's classical story, removing elements of magical realism and replacing them with the raw reality that lived in Mexico, not just the colonel waiting for their pensions, but more than half of the Mexican population living in full poverty. The characters in the film represent satirical signs in the Mexican society, such as a nationalist colonel, a cold and even an ambitious priest, a hypocrite, but at the same time a loyal compadre, a tolerant and patient woman, a hidden homosexual, and so on. the movie is a must-have if you want to learn more about Mexican society, and especially if you want to look at Mexico's best directors.
