The emotional forces and characters of Dominick and Eugene are things Hollywood no longer does. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and heart-felt movies I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce, and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, bring Oscar victory caliber performances! There are not enough words to express how big this film is. Of course, people who are not in sentimental movies may not care as much about the rest of us as Dominick and Eugene, but the rest of us are going to the heart and compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, EVER! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS DOWN ***** <br /> <br /> A simple but eloquent story is masterfully said. Eugene is a med-school intern who faces long hours and a demanding workload in the hospital. His fraternal twin brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a bit slow and uncomfortable because their father has abused the victim. (A heartbreaking moment when it is known from a movie that leaves you tear!) Eugene (a.k.a. "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He has to decide whether to finish a medical school, which would mean accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominick (called Nicky) behind or losing the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay for his brother's med-school study material by working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Ethics, morality, and responsibility issues are blending in this landmark movie. Just when Gino thinks Nicky can move on to independence, Dominick reverses and does things to help the drug dealer out or link to exploit the flaw he finds in the electrical equipment landfill. <br /> <Larry, is the partner of The Character and Nicky on his garbage route, which fills the gullible Dominick with almost all stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, who he guides in clinical pharmacology) goes to the Atlantic city and plays all his money. But deep, you see that Larry cares for him. Nicky also has a little boy with our friends in the round, whom we also know about his father. The end result is also tragic and the pain you see in Nicky, when it happens, talks about the volume. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the two brothers share to each other cannot be overestimated. All Nicky wants to be loved and look for acceptance in any case. (ie he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nick more than anything in the world. But can his brother be independent enough to allow Geno to continue his dream of becoming a doctor? An excellent film that should have received more recognition than it deserved, but unfortunately it came out at the same time as Rain Man, who dealt with a similar issue. But I like better Dominick and Eugene because he has a much stronger emotional component. Be careful that this movie is directed directly to the tiny channels so you have Kleenex comfortable! What movie !!!!
