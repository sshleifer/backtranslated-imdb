Photography is interesting in this, artistic, with lots of sunshine, gauzy light and shading through windows and rooms, watching crowd-moving handheld cameras, fast editing, and extreme close-ups. making a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie begins with a bit of coffee on the competition. The film begins on a warm Sunday at the local pool where we meet lovely Lucienne or Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a little eye-catching for the men living by the pool, she will soon decide to enter France for Miss Europe beauty contest, a lot of her very jealous, nut-noise fianc√© (pretty a tedious companion) for a true glory. Trimming on the track has ten contestants who show themselves in a swimsuit, while the winner is selected as the competitor who gets the longest applause (I wonder if the girls couldn't walk slower to extend their time and therefore applause) on the cat line?!). Lulu will soon be driven by Prince and Maharaja, but his hot-headed beau will not like him for the attention paid by other men or his adorable public (I think he just wants him in his house, cooking) his meal, and stay in sight, eh?!) . <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps to improve this film, but it's really the way it was captured, the most interested. A bit confused is the odd dubbed sound that is a bit off. Printing this version seemed very clear and full of nice contrast. Looking at it, I just tried to forget the sound problems and look at the film visually, and found that the movie is great, worth a look.
