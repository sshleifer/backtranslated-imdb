When I first read this plot of drama, I assumed it was like Sex and City, but this drama is nothing like that. The stories that characters seem to be more real and you feel more situations. The concept of drama is similar, with four 30s leading us into friendships and relationships with problems and conflicts. Katie GP is a dark and terrifying figure who is also hard to associate with the best friends of the Trudi widow. The character of Trud is warming up from the heart, because you may be concerned with the difficulties he has with the fact that he is the only mother of four. Jessica is a party girl who is very united and knows what she wants and how to get it. She has a pleasant character and is the closest to Siobhan, who is just married, who at the same time, loving her husband, cannot help her colleague in her eyes. All the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continues to produce the series, it can work well. Unlike other female cast dramas like Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives. If this is right, it may be the next cold leg. Plus man cast is not bad eyes too.
