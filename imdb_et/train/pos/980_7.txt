The summary line above that James Cloud (Robert Preston) told his brother Tom (Robert Sterling) almost all say. Jim, AKA Kid Wichita, is the way things happen, just in trouble, he usually leaves the corpses where he's been. Not a mentor, Tom, who foresees a younger brother Jeff who likes what he sees in Jim, especially when he protects his pasture against local Texas Cattlemen. <br /> <br /> Open credit shows John Barrymore Jr. The younger brother - in the first look of the screen. It seemed quite strange to me, especially since he was almost immediately treated with the story of Jeff. Approximately eighteen years of this film, he is similar to Sean Penn. There was no stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career, as well as alienation from his family, I wondered if his daughter Drew Barrymore could ever see this picture. I tend not to think. <br /> <br /> On the similarity issue, I was also struck by the idea that young Robert Sterling saw a little at the start of Roy Rogers' career. I thought Sterling used to be only the role of George Kerby in the "Topper" television series of the early 1950s. His character is encouraged by his brother's ingenuity in distressing and giving some of this non-typical story. Small squares are abundant, including the career quarry John Gall (John Litel) is with his son Sheriff (who kills Kid Wichita) and Kathleen Boyce (Cathy Downs) and his wife Earl (who Kid Wichita kills). Chill Wills rounds the main cast of one of Tom Cloud's hired hands and figures in a somewhat predictable final. <br /> <br /> What's not quite predictable is how things end up and for that reason the West is earning points for less traveled, so not quite as formal a lot as many brothers / poor brothers in the West. Together with the eclectic pain of the principals, I recommend it even if you have to endure some jumps and sloppy edits that I experienced with my copy.
