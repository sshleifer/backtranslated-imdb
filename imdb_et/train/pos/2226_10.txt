I'm surprised at the low rating of IMDb's movie. With all due respect, its low rating is represented by the level of IQ who was so poorly rated. They would rather see the movie with cheap excitement, more budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> The first human misconception is that it is a horror film. It is not, nor does the film mislead you to believe that this is one. This is a psychological thriller. It is intended for people who actually want intellectual experience when watching a movie. The Reel.com review is a great example of how I feel about this movie. All other negative evaluations do not make sense. It's almost the same as trying to make the original change for the movie - on very rare days - is something bad and not worth it. there's no point. Martha was brainwashed and herself was trying to be a caring mother; The evidence is all in pudding and the fact that, when we first watch it, we know this cold-blooded monster during the film's duration, which shows that the film is direction and writing. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this movie should be rated at least sixth in a unique way. I recommend this film to people who are the intelligent people of the IQ scale, which is obviously occupied by those who would rather look at Scream or Freddy Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Kudos also works. With such a low budget movie, you are surprised that this movie did not hit your local cinema with great direction, writing and showing. Please do not be fooled by IMDb rating. This movie is worth it. I really recommend buying a movie because the first look at the rent does not do that justice.
