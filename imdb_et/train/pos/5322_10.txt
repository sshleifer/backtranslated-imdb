A true dark noir film and a very graphic film that is a nice story of a man who continues to redeem, which may be too late. Visually, there are very nice scenes that are artistically amazing that can be done with minimal budget. Complete signs for Gareth Maxwell Roberts and the team, looking forward to the new project with new ideas, although hopefully big British players are great. Lisa Ray seemed cute that she hadn't seen her before and hoped to see her again. All interesting sex, drugs and violence. Go ahead. I would definitely say that you rent it and see if you are in a mood of a half-mood.
