It may have been the ultimate movie ever, Columbia Studios did not cut as much Orson Welles original. What we have left is a mistake, but a brilliant film that shows Welles, as an actor / director, and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent. <br /> <br /> "The Lady From Shanghai" is a movie noir, it is the most brilliant and crazy. With an uneven accent in Welles, Michael O'Hara, an Irishman who, after the depicting, dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in the GREAT performance), is hunted by his and his exhausted husband (Everett Sloane) to accept the work of a virtually forced crew member. Elsa or "Rosalie", as Michael likes to call him, plays the innocent, helpless doll very well, forcing O'Hara on his web. As lovers behave at sea in a non-secret matter, Arthur Bannister's partner law firm George Grisby (Glenn Anders) comes. He's a weird, insecure figure that offers Michael a unique proposal: he'll get $ 5,000 to help Grisby die in Grisby's death, so he looks like a murder. The plan is for Michael to leave the technical side and descend into the sun with Elsa. But things are not going as planned. <br /> <br /> Hayworth gives us one of the best femme fatales in a very vague image. Sometimes it seems that he is really vulnerable and similar to a child, in another case brutal, tired and hard with the world. She is always brilliantly beautiful whether she insists she should be dripped into a wet or black swimsuit by wearing a gun. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here and is far from the famous Gilda role. His wife, Orson Welles, cut off his auburn locks for a dyed blonde culture (Angering Columbia boss Harry Cohn). It was a terrible marketing project and he changed his attitude very well. He is not a sympathetic femme fatale that "Gilda" is here, but he is a predatory, black-hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful choice. <br /> <br /> Welles and Hayworth's pairing came at a time when the couple were in extreme hardship. They would separate after the movie, so it is also curious to give some insights into complicated relationships. They are hated in this respect, not romantic, so it's hard to judge whether they had real chemistry on the screen. Certainly, every meeting is robust and full of raw sexuality, Welles as a "fallen boy" (he even admits it in the movie!) And Rita's double-breasted babe. <br /> <br /> Welles' character is a typical noir stripe that doesn't make much sense. As Welles speaker points out, O'Hara does not really use his brain but thinks he thinks of him (Elsa). Welles usually played smart, charismatic companions, so his move here as the Twilight Michael is unusual and very interesting. Indeed, Welles was a fine talent actor and he pulls it out well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane is appropriately slippery as Hayworth's exhausted husband. One wonders why he hires Michael. Is it obvious that his wife is romantic about her, so why does she "threaten" her on board? One interpretation may be that Michael offers a "service" to his spouse, which Bannister does not get in his bad state. There is certainly something to this theory that has many consequences for Elsa's behavior before she met her husband (was she a prostitute?) And Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate secrets referred to several scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a confusing, complex film whose plot is definitely faulty. We are more interested in the Triangle of Love than in the plot of murder, like most of the dogs. Welles offers us many of our usual excellent cinematographic touches, including the reasonably famous peak of mirrors. It is a terrible scene, one end that can destroy and exaggerate the mistakes that have already occurred in the movie. This fun house design is a visually stunning, Dali-like feeling on painted kits (probably Orson painted them himself). The fine visual imagery used in Welles's entire film improves the plot and makes it a thought-provoking experience. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is a scorching, confusing, low-pitched voice and helpless, extremely amazing little girl. Hayworth proves his ability to act in this field and proves that SHE is the "noir" final femme fatale. It was a pity (only small, like Rita was a great dancer) that she made so many joyful but frothy and often forgotten music in Colombia in the '40s instead of a noir with dark themes. He was a great actor when he was given the opportunity to show his talents. <br /> <br /> 9/10
