First of all, I would like to say how big it is. It is amazing and sometimes shocking. At least I am 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely be a boring movie, but it's nothing but boring. It's like a journey through humanity. Its immense realism shows this monumental masterpiece. It is a heartbreaking story of two down and forth (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who create mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) is naive Texan plaques in New York to make it rich for entertaining women. Soon he will meet Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), a poor person hardly able to pay the rent. Race becomes Joe's leader, but soon both men will not find Joe's job, which will result in stealing food. When they try and survive on the streets of New York, we understand how difficult it is. They won't get Joe as a girl until they meet at one party. Joe makes money and soon Joe Ratso, who is on the Ratso dream site, Florida. The last five minutes are heartbeats, but moments near the film. From the high altitude we send tough and sometimes distracting city views to life.
