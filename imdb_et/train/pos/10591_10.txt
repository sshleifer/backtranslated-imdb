There is no denial that Ealing's comedies are good, but for me this film is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The main premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered in a part of Burgundy, not in the UK. We then watch the lives of their inhabitants in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explosion, and exclude black market traders who soon realize that there is no UK law release. When they get imprisoned on their streets because the government has decided to close the border, we see that they are fighting against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to eat with water and food in their condition. In fact, it becomes worse than before everything started, when morality comes. This is when they lose all the food they think they beat and require delivery, just to make the whole of London meet its weight in sending food, its a lot. This allows them to continue their fight. <br /> <br /> This movie hits the right note, the actor is great, Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It is just right, not too sentimental, and the story of morality doesn't force you into the throat. Worth a look
