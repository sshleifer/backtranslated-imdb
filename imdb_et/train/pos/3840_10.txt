Jerome Crabbel has a leading role in this film. I saw this movie 6 times and I'm still not tired. This film is in some ways similar to Flesh + Blood. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all Paul Verhoeven Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I've seen all his films except Showgirls. My mother doesn't like her so much, but I disagree. I think all of his movies are on the fly to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instincti. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his films, including Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch movies are different, but still enjoyable.
