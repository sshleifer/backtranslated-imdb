I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it very much. it gives an insight into making a indie movie and how much work is really involved if you have a low budget, but you need an actor / actor to get people, all the people who see it, and give a movie. Bobby Myeres, played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder, make an excellent combination to find exclusive Miachel Bates, "NAME" actress, played by Alan Bates. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan, who was played by an excellent and undervalued Debra Kara Unger in her special film movie. If you enjoy thinking while watching comedy, that's for you. The low budget matches the low budget with a high value for money.
