After watching Walt Disney south on MySpace, I decided to watch Ralph Bakshi's answer to this movie - Coonskin-on is a Afro Video link from Google Video. During this lifetime, Preacherman (Charles Gordone) takes his friend Sampson (Barry White) with him Pappy (Scatman Crothers) and Randy (Philip Thomas for years before he added Michael for his middle name professionally). ) when the last two flee from prison. During the experiment, Pappy Randy tells the story of his brother Rabbit (Thomas voice), his brother Bear (white) and the preacher Fox (Gordone) and their adventures in Harlem. As many of these Bakshi efforts expect, there is an animation and a live action that offers a unique point of view from a writer / director who will certainly offend people. Another exciting animated character is Miss America, who is magnificent as gigantic in every sense, a white blonde woman dressed in dense red, white and blue stars and stripes with a little black man and one of her most sexually violent ways were shockingly funny to me! There are many scenes on the whole picture, one of which gave me a big laugh about Brother Bear's front anatomy. There is also a woman who tells her child a "cockroach", she was with friends who left her, touching the part that seems to be a tribute to the comic artist George Herriman. I also had a fascinated hearing of Grover Washington Jr's Ain Ain No Sunshine, which was part of the score. The most compelling part of the picture was to see Scatman depicting his head on the silhouette of the opening credit at the time of singing and devastating the songs he uses the N-word in a satirical manner. When I saw the VHS cover a year ago, he had portrayed his brother Rabbit in a mysterious mode before what seemed like Warner's circles with the slogan "This film offends ALL". This is a great warning to anyone who thinks that all cartoons are for kids. That means I definitely recommend Coonskin to Bakshi fans and any kind of animation.
