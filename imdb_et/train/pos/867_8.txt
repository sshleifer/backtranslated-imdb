As in Amelie, recent French films appear to be a stereotypical male-female relationship, focusing on finding a woman for her true love. In this case, despair brings the convicted person leading to his development as a prototype mob. A clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the woman is supporting the woman. <br /> <br /> For those who don't speak French, the subtitles are a bit quick but not unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Music, as it seems more and more in European films, is a great and perfect sync with movie variations. Nothing seems to be forced. Visually, it reminds me of a variety of horror films. There is Wes Craven in Chicago.
