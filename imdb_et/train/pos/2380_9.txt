I didn't know walking. Then people walked really walking. This lent the pieces of this period to the air of authenticity and some perspective on the technology of the Marques. I was also disappointed with the consequences, especially the Thunderchild scene, which I find one of the most exciting books. But I can't boast this movie enough for Wells's story! It's time. The actors are nice and the performances are charming. This film is also very worthy of hearing about Jamie Hall's real excellent musical score. It was interesting to see that the same actor plays both the writer and his brother in London.
