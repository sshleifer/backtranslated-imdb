As knowledgeable fans, I recommend reading this movie for facts and acting well. As an 11-year-old living in Istanbul, I heard friends talking about a new musical mood that made girls shout. I thought if the girls liked them, they must be crap. So far my only records were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after I was on vacation with a family at a military café in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned to “Love Me”) and floored the difference and what I ever heard. When I heard the album of my older brother, Meet The Beatles, I was committed to life. After reading the final book of his beginning (Davis), I was surprised that this film was very good at facts, except for most of the sex and some of the use of drugs (this was about the use of methadrin / dexadrin)). >
