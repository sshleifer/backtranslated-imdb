Let's face it; Nancy Drew was never a great literature. It's in the same category as the Babysitter Club, the Magical Tree House, Goosebumps, the ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original stories of formulas. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "nice", never internal conflict! and never changes. Ned is pretty much the same. The film was in this style and I have to say I liked it. It is never an excellent movie, but it was the same nostalgic taste that books kept. It was just the right amount for my children (8 and 10). I liked catching a more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Corky was a bit annoyed. He was a little away from high school campus. I've never really received the reason why he was there.
