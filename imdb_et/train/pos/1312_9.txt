Criticize it in the winning column, it was a great movie. The performances were great and the script was equally large. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was great as Riverside police officer Gina Pulasky. Gina was complicated. He was a young man with the Riverside Police Department. He ended up communicating with a co-worker he knew he had a wife and children, all the time, when he took a dangerous task to go covertly to the serial number. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (Ray Liotta looks the same) was dealing with a confused, often exhausting police officer who was linked to Gina. He was a stoic officer but he was quite the opposite when he came to touch his feelings and his marriage. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, especially the sitcom "Wings", did a nice job, like a quiet, bright, underfilling sociopath. On the surface he was an innocent loser, but under the surface, a killer with a cold heart lied. Weber really took a young adult suitable for the child, who was an insatiable thirst for young boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was remarkable. For each scene, each verbal exchange gives us more signs of characters. The production team made phenomenal work, condensing days, non-weekly events with a 90-minute film. This movie was a good example of how much you did a little.
