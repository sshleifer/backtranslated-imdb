Just as the new BSG was not what the original series fans expected, Caprica may not provide new BSG fans (mostly). It is very interesting, if not a somewhat independent exhibition, or at least a pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for (new) BSG's great CGI excitement, you are very disappointed. If you liked drama, you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with. <br /> <br /> The story describes how Cylons were developed, why they hate them and the origin of the monotheistic society. Writers can also cope with people who play God and create or create a human life. It is interesting to see how it plays. <br /> <br /> I found it in some parts and in others too preaching, but it was all promising. A small part of me wants (or hopes) that there may be some BSG inclingas (in addition to the aforementioned attack), but it probably would be too much. Like BSG, I have to wait and see if Caprica is growing on me, but it's too early to say. <br /> <br /> It would be a really easy mistake to compare it to the previous series, but I'm ready to give it a chance. In general, I thought it was interesting enough to see how the real series was before "wiping out".
