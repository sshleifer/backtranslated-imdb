At a time when Hollywood is making money, showing its weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs and war, this film comes to us, which reminds us of the concept of the "Unbeatable Spirit". When you feel beaten, this film releases your mind and makes you rise. We all know how difficult life can be, sometimes we have to remind you that perseverance and courage get through. That's what this movie did for me and I hope it's for you.
