This is a rare occasion when I want to see the movie again. "Amateur Girls" is such a movie. In old times I would have been more cinemas for exhibitions. Was this story autobiographical of the writer / director? It has an aura of reality. <br /> <br /> All the stars present their character in a credible and tender way. Who doesn't want Mercedes Ruehl to be an older sister? I've loved her work from "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> For most movies, belief is stopped because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. to stop this belief in "Amati Girls". One knows this part of the family! How I wanted to protect Dolores when his family stifled his emotional life. And he wanted Lee Grant to rejoice when he criticized Cloris Leachman's hair color. Humor is not a stomach to laugh with humor, but has a good quality that satisfies much more than training and doing. The love depicted in this cinema family must be emulated and pampered. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that the surname, Amati, translated from Italian, means "close".
