PAMAA CAMERA IS A MAN is a deceptive cute movie. In fact, this is a complicated look at children's psychology and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and artists. On the surface, it is a nostalgic group of some high-end kids made in the 80s with some home videos. One of the film's leaders, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over the artistic leader of all the films. Of course, these are just some cute kids having fun. But it is much more. It is a study of some times when children are confronted with many confusing issues we all face in life - fear, sexual awakening, uneven love, loneliness, and just trying to understand an adult world that seems to explode around us. As we grow older, we forget about how life's realities were very small. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie even more important is to see how young Darren Stein becomes a small general manager of the filmmaker. It is clear that Darren is running this example, and these small films are his vision, but all his friends know their problems, the dynamics of interpersonal relationships, and the general confusion about the horror of adult life. Many children make movies at home, but I have never heard or seen that children create the Holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to fit and meet friends. These children are facing and dealing with difficult things! <br /> <br /> The power of this movie is the way Stein and Shell draw different scenes so tightly with their children --- all adults and all friends. This adds a new angle to the film. How many of us have contacted our childhood friends? These men have. Many of the issues they were dealing with would go two decades later. Among the conflicts - the acknowledgment of the destruction shows that the heart is still broken, the very usual sexual experience of childhood is still a "sticky" topic between two men, some constant annoyance over dynamics and the member of this team is still very active and central! What is the perfect idea when one sees their home video progress in a few years. Darren Stein is Director. No doubt. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell occasionally talk to each other while talking to each other and can't help but imagine the inconvenience that allows us to peek into the younger lives of these people. This is especially true for Stein, a film producer, writer and director, who has been a great producer in the entertainment industry. From the first moment PAM THE CAMERA is ME, we see a gay little boy who tries to figure it all out. We also see the aspects of artistic mind and personality that are not always "nice" or "caring" - and it is a bolder step for every artist to share with the audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and challenging moments are the movie where we see the Jewish concentration camp victim of Nazi torture and killing. Through interviews and narration, we discover that a Jewish child is playing a Nazi child, and that the pagan child plays a part of the victim. This is a painfully distracting moment that looks at the darker side of fear and how children work with the horrors of an adult world that is far less than children than understanding an adult. <br /> <br /> It's much more than some home videos. This documentary takes into account the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growth. Powerful stuff --- and it's worth seeing! <br /> <br />:
