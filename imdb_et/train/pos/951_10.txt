I know many people are familiar with the Dickens story of Alistair Simi, but for me it is the 1984 version. My wife and I have a copy of this movie about VHS and let's see it every Christmas Eve together. I often notice that we can also watch it for Halloween because it is a very horrible story. Scott - Scrooge's message - is disgraceful and disgusting, making your transformation even more wonderful and moving. I think it's there with his performance in Patton. Spirits are all effective, each of them is the last. Watching the dark, floating and skeletal form of the Christmas spirit, Come sends my shelter every year. And what supporting cast! Above all, David Warner is in the form of Bob Cratchit, as is his wife Susannah York. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this version remains closer to the original story than most others - but I may be mistaken because it has been several years after reading it. Regardless, this is a great Christmas glamor.
