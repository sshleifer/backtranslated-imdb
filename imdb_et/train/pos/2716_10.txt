Everything I remember about it was great ... with a great shot by Sam Waterston and George Innes (before he became more familiar with the US audience) .... great scripts because only English can be done - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion type mysteries, but Jules Verne's twist. Like MacGyver, it would have been in England 80 years earlier ... at the beginning of the 20th century scientific / technological revolution. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered if MacGyver saw these shows. MacGyver introduced for the first time about 3 years later. <br /> <br /> I still have one episode on a much deteriorated tape.
