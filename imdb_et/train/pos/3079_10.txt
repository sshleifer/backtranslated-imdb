While listening to the audiobook, Cambpell Scott is a reader. I was so excited when I heard her voice and it brought back her disappointment that "six degrees" was canceled. They never seem to have the air showing the air long enough to capture the audience who can show the story. What shame and shame on this network, if not, will show the full season. It was a great show with great pain. The network gave the Men a Poodle a second chance, which is also a great show, but they took out the "Invasion" and it was also a totally different look, not the same old old themes. Why can't networks get it right?
