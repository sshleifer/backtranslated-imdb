We took a few episodes to "get into" Dark Angel as a story and a series because we were in a transition from Soprano, a very different framework of mentality. But when we got a series of content, we were very quick hooks. The shame is that the series ended when he started to go into the good category of the past: Dark Angel was much more than your average TV series. It captures the ass and the stones as it goes, but the interaction between characters and social reactions to "mutants" reminds us of the constant prejudice we face (and do) every day. Because the story is set in the future, the mood keeps it surreal and prevents us from rubbing the anti-discrimination message on our face (hence the "fun" is not destroyed by those who do not like the lecture for entertainment), but every communication and communication between man / society is important today. We all make decisions, we face our prejudices, but finally the question is who you are: are you sitting back and closing your mind, or are you getting up and doing something? For those who have no choice but to fight, survive or justice, this series gives them. For those who have never had to face this issue, "this series" links this message to the shadow of pure action entertainment. It's much better done and well written than most TV series; I'm very disappointed, it ended before it really took a big turn.
