I was speechless and destroyed after it was first viewed - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal - a non-documentary film that gives Fellin or David Lynch money for their money at the weirdsville competitions. I continued to focus on how those women (who are clinically distant eccentric) reveal their humanity in the most surprising ways, and I do not know whether their withdrawal from the world led to something that is unrealistic in the universe of unreal blue blood, maybe some abuse, or may -Only reluctance and rebellion that pulled out of control and took his life. It may be one of the biggest movies ever to be dangerously exploited, without moving over the edge - as Edies did, I noticed things like empty gin bottles in a rubble bedroom, cats urinating in bed, climbing holes in the walls, and the last scene incredibly sad - as the child's birthday is seriously mistaken. Definitely worth seeing and searching - you will never forget it, but very disturbing.
