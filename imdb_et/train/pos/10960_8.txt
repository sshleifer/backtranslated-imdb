I really don't remember who suggested it, but they said it was one of their favorite films. Surely it is strange - like a rubber bump in a road accident. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the truth is unfamiliar, and the truth is something to see. I really do not understand how the fiction of this documentary will be published this year. How can you fix it? Jackie Kennedy's aunt and cousin leave the New York Society and hide at Hampton. In the process they get themselves and best described as "mad cat ladies". They would have been hidden when the city did not move to condemn the fear of property and later rescue by Jackie. This movie was made after this salvation. All the time, you couldn't help but guess "how bad was it before?" It is a look at the darker side of society and it is quite exciting.
