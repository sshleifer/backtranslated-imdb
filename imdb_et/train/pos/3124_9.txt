Jason Bourne is sitting in the dusty room with blood, trying to understand what he just did. In the meantime, the CIA leader in NYC describes the agency's response to what happened on the screen. The American flag is proudly at the center of the picture in the center of its picture, but when it speaks, it slips out of its focus when its plan moves morally into a suspicious territory, as if it would not be involved in the course. The government man decides it is necessary for national security. <br /> <br /> This is the movie's mood. In addition, Bourne's ambition to learn how he got Jason Bourne is also ultimatum to explore people's costs for stability and security measures that protect us. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best movie you will see in the cinema this year. <br /> <br /> It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine): "This is not a story of a newspaper, it's real," and you almost believe it in the audience. The camera shakes, but remains stable enough for you to see everything and feel like Bourne when trying to get out of your catchers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem to be the ones they're depicting instead of just being well-written roles. Active scenes are so brutally fast and choreographic that they seem instinctive, not planned to move from minute to minute; Stunt work is nothing amazing. <br /> <br /> Acceleration is just incredible. This keeps you on your conclusion, but not so quickly that it leaves you with a tangle; the script transmits the necessary information as quickly and clearly as possible before setting up the next tense activity. Although they are often simple (the Waterloo order is simply a man whom a man watches over the phone), they are accused of such a dramatic intensity that you cannot take your eyes off. The film is so focused on bringing it forward that you can't get involved with it. <br /> <br /> On the basis of their intense activities, brilliant pace and intelligent decisions, the name of national security, the Bourne series is what exactly describes the uncertainty of our age. The ultimate is its peak.
