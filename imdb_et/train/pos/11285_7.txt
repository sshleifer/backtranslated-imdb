Like Tarzan Ape Man (1932), only more. There's more, more animals, more diverse African tribes and scenes where the idea should be, if it were good against three or four lions, would be forty better. Tarzani wrestles with crocodiles, the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling surface, around and around, slipping jaws. Tarzan can kill it with its ubiquitous knife when the blast is stuck. Tarzan kills lions and nose and constantly grows a number of animals. His friends are real chimps, people wearing larger monkey costumes, and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephants much more friendly and trainable than African ones? The Human Story: The second white person, worse than the rest, seems to have joined the ivory of the Holt with an elephant tomb. Tarzan doesn't show them the way, so a bad boy shoots an elephant so that they can follow it on the grave. Tarzan intervenes and a bad boy puts him down, but of course he survives and returns to rescue Jane. All others die, Holt and the bad guy and each of them "boys". People are spending, especially Africans, and there does not seem to be much difference between black companions who die because they work with white men crossing taboo countries and those who kill them. It must be the last Tarzan movie before Hays Kood made more clothes for Jane. There are several underwater scenes where Jane swims naked and although the light flashes in motion and glances are very tempting. Probably one of the friends of the Weismuller Olympics was naked scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. He moves through a film that carries the same waistband Weismuller (plus bikini), showing a glimpse of the thigh and hip. They don't have much to say yet. They sleep together and enjoy cool animals and away from towns. No wonder they are happy.
