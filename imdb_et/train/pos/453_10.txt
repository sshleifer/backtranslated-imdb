I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult film that has no interference, no sex, no violence. One might think that this is the "ultimate chick flick," but I bet you have one or two enlightened men who love it. Do not invite children, however. This movie is very low. <br /> <br /> Seeing Enchanted April is a very healing experience. The soundtrack and the gorgeous landscape with the gentle ways of women remind us of the peace and beauty of the pre-Raphael painting. <br /> <br /> No one thinks you are really just watching one movie, I paraphrase what I heard on "Saturday Night Live" and said that my two favorite films are "The Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April ".
