I watched this movie when I was almost a kid, and of course it moved the fox family story. The fantastic landscape of Hokkaido, excellent storytelling and the last, but also the wonderful soundtrack, are close to rare friends. I'm still looking for a wonderful soundtrack. It may be useful for German viewers to know that DEFA duplication is the only thing worth listening to. I recorded both (DEFA and BR) but I only look at the first one.
