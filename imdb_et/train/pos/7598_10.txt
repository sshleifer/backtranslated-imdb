"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These and many other high-quality exhibitions prove that we are in the midst of a golden age in television history. "Missing" is a pure genius. Unbelievable layered personal and psychologically viable stories highlighted by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word in describing a TV show), killer score, great performances and editing. Anyone who does not have it is one of the most important creative expressions on television. This can be a problem if you only look at one episode a week, but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to see it. I hope they will keep it (as I am sure they will do).
