Fascist chief Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who is western expert Dean Cundy, as if she was ten feet long) is planning to turn her high square around. There are complications that challenge this goal in the delightful R''Rock Randell (PJ Soles who lights up on the screen - he also has a hot bod) who is the obsessive fan of punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose great rimmed and nerdy role cannot hide his stunning beauty) connects with Riff with the forces to end the supposed crisis to kill rock'n'roll, the Togar's mission. /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a fun role, like Tom Roberts, with success in everything but put down. Kate is crazy about Tom..if, because only he can pull his head out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard steals the movie almost (honestly, who can steal this movie from Sole?) When Eaglebauer, "the supplier", gets everything almost everyone. His office is in the boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also fun as a music teacher who will become Riff's ally when he has a RAMONES concert. <br /> <br /> A dirty high school romp that breaks all normal rules ... and I loved it. It's like someone just says, "Let's do life for 1.5 hours." The film is indeed anarchy ... a plot-less chaos that loves RAMON with all the heart (even if they are terrible actors, they have the opportunity to get new audiences with this film). <br /> <br /> Quite a lot of summaries of the movie as a whole. The reef and his classmates take high school and start a massive party. Frankly, I didn't want the party to end! In no way normal, this movie loses crazy. With a movie that includes some of the best songs of THE RAMONES, this movie will allow viewers to take time in life if wars did not dominate the headlines, and people just had a good time. Those, I think, were the days.
