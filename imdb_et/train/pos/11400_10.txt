I felt it was necessary to reply to the comments posted on the front page of this movie page, because some of them were a little false information. <br /> <br /> Originally, I posted quotes on the original poster, but I wasn't sure if it was correct given that it is a "comment" index and not a bulletin board (although we used this way back before IMDb movie message boards added) so I edit it to make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Well, first you may not be aware of it, but Gene Kelly first became famous for playing "Pal Joey" in Broadway's original production When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a "panorama" of Gershwin, he wanted Kelly's character to be more complicated than the role of "good two shoes" he had played in most of his films (except for "My and my gal"). to build a new story in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey." This gave Kelly the chance to play her famous role on Broadway, although Warners was entitled to cross Pal Joey for the rights of MGM. although Sinatra fit s but the other problems sink into the movie (script changes and bad direction. ============== ========================================= = <br /> <br /> You complain that Kelly's pictures are not well done, even quoting your art education to prove this point, but you forget that Kelly's bad art was clearly bad and it is necessary in terms of story / character . that Kelly is not ready for the show, even if she knows it, even though Milo has kissed her until she almost believes in her, but it is important that the audience does not sit there saying "but she is a great artist if she had only a chance!" You want the audience to be fully aware of their shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that it sabotages your interest in the show, again you don't understand the structure He refuses because he doesn't want to feel gigolo, and because he He knows he's not ready for the show. His enthusiasm for the show is definitely not as big as "Joey's enthusiasm for" starting a nightclub. "But it serves the same function on the plot. Remember that" Pal Joey "is important that Joey will give up his nightclub after he realizes he does not deserve it, as well as the art exhibition. If Kelly's paintings were really good, it would damage this whole point. ============== ======================================== Then you complain that Caron and Kelly are not " chemistry ". I think e It is in the eyes of the viewer, I agree that their chemistry is not as strong as it should be, but it was good for me. Compare it with even worse "forced" romances, such as Cary Grant and Sophia Loren, "pride and passion". ====================================================== ==== == <br /> <br /> When you say that the big dance finals have nothing else in this movie, it just shows that you have not dug the surface of the movie into your symbol. Many elements of the dance series are related to the story and characters, and through the dance, the plot is solved through pictures and symbolism. It is about finding love, enjoying love, losing love (he looks around and his love is lost). The symphony movements are constructed so that part of each dance image reflects a separate stage of Paris art and a separate stage of their relationship. If you don't see it, it's not the fault of the movie. This is certainly not a "crap load". ====================================================== ====
