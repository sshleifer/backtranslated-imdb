After seeing this intense martial arts film for the first time in nearly 18 years, I have to say that it did not lose any mystery or any of its outstanding martial arts activities, as I remembered from my youth. A story of a dying martial arts instructor who sent his "unfinished" student to find his five poison class members, so they're not looking for the luck the captain's friend is holding. Fearing that his last pupil did not have enough training, he is tasked with communicating with one of the five "poisons" to win the other four. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough about choreography or camera work. Exquisite film on its own and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies. CLASSIC !!
