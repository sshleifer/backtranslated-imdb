The only reason I got over this movie was that it is LITTLE MISS MARKER on DVD and I recommend watching it, though it doesn't like it, as well as a better-known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a man and his companion. The film begins quite lightly, but becomes more dramatic than Coop's first plan to use her daughter to extort a large amount of cash from her brother, but when she meets her girlfriend and disciples her brother - the law selects her. But he has difficulty on a straight and narrow road so drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley still steals scenes. There's little music and Shirley's just one song. But it's fun and worth a look with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
