At first I thought Ring would be a more common film than a regular plot. When I was surprised! Of course, the plot is simple - one girl in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us in a silver plate, laughter and fear, compassion and anguish. The way he depicts the crowd of people, the strength of the girls' attractiveness for both men, the tragic elements that come up with techniques that open the minds of most of his greatest films (North by the fetus, rope, etc.).). The Master did it before the thirtieth!
