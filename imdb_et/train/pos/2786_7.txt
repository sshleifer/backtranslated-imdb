What surprised me most about this film was what it attracted. Similar movies, such as Anita and Me, have never produced as much hype as this movie, although I think it is probably due to the mention of the title Beckham more than anything else. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that shines a brilliant message - you can do something if you are confident and remember it, which is such a positive message to anyone watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's one of Keira Knightley's best films, and I think she's a great actor and was great for this role. Parminder Nagra was also great. Unfortunately, I can't say that to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers because I don't think he was such a good actor and, frankly, his eyes were a little scary. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a brilliant movie and a brilliant story
