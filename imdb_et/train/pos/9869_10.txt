I have to say that this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. I liked it for the first time, but I really appreciated it for the second time, just a few weeks ago. I understand why the sequel continues in such a large business office. Apparently, this movie liked many people. <br /> <br /> A great color palette (man, good looking) and lots of good adult (but pure) humor make it a great winner. The 3 to 4-minute scene with "Scat" is great, as do the breaks that follow. In the film, however, the main humor is "Sid", a wave expressed by John Leguizano. During the whole movie he usually has something funny. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is a mammoth voice, a great character of a movie, literally, while Denis Leary is a wild bad man-turned-good sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> It's not just humor and beautiful colors, just a nice, sentimental story about how a little baby softens a few harsh characters. It is not interrupted by many songs: one is only short and there is nothing offensive, language use. <br /> <br /> If it were a good animation film, I'd have more.
