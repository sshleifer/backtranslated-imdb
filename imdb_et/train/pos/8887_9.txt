As I saw the movie, I was really shocked to see what was in the 60s. I know I can speak wrong with some things, but it seemed that the 60s really had an impact on people. Some people said they wanted to go back to the 60s. Of what I saw, I would say no to the excitement and the outcome of the hunt. But this is my opinion.
