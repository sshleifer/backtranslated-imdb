Most of the New Orleans films or those are ridiculously bad and ridiculously inaccurate (remember: "The Savage Bees"? But I make an exception for "Tightrope" that almost got it right). <br /> <br /> Here's one that doesn't fix it inevitably. The accents are not too bad (yes, the "yat" accent here is more of a Brooklyn than the South), the city of 1950 shows how it was / was without the mandatory "tourist" frames, and they understand good drama without trying to make everyone "peculiar" for lunch. <br /> <br /> One of the few movies that make this city right and a good movie to be launched.
