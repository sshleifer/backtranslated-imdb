Great pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients to keep its attention - the absorbing story of the intrigue, the fiery lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), who is interested in the irresistible Mr. Hawk (Errol Flynn), who has a secret mission. Anthony Quinn is an average, bad pirate who weaves his merciful salmon and conquest. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick, who played a supporting role as Mrs MacGregor, the protector of the young princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There are beautiful filmed landscapes on the coastline, ships and bay. Too many clashes with sword fighting, battles, bouncing jumps from Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard!). I heard from the burning redhead in Maureen O'Hara's interview that she was struck by bullfighting and could also fight with Flynn in a sword fight these days, but there is no need to test it. Very enjoyable movie.
