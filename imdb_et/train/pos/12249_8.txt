Like Jane, it seems very popular today. I've lost the number of rollovers. Probably the reason is that his "ruts" are our "ruts" even on that late date. This TV mini-series gives him the respect of a novel. Stylish, opinionful Emma is a pretty "modern" girl when you think about it, even though Jane Austen's world atmosphere may seem artificial to us today. If you haven't known EMMA, I'll just say that self-sufficient Emma is getting its income. It is worth checking out how to find out. Here, the respects go to women: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They would have had almost a psychic relationship with old Jane!
