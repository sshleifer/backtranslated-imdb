Young girl living as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A cheap hustler who wants to get a big score. <br /> <br /> They meet each other in Thailand. Opening titles may suggest that this is a violent film, but it is also a story of love with two people in their struggle to get money for a better lifestyle. Sometimes this film seems to be refreshing because of the changes in the essay. This story is also Eros and Thanatos. "This is not the original joke, but it is well said," says the sign, and that is also true. We've seen the story, but we see it. Thailand appears in hot tones, the photo is painted in color. And it captures the cage of this imperfect person in the city. There's also good use of music to do things.
