As my family's story goes, my dad Milton Raskin played Dorsey's piano. After joining the Sinatra band, my father practiced with him. Then my father said to the sergeant that he was actually good at associating with such a small group (the band) and that he should go for himself. By that time, Sinatra had enough credit under its belt to do it! Dorsey never gave his father forgiveness and the rest, as they say, is history. > I've seen almost every Sinatra movie more than I want to say and her movies never get old. . . Thank you, Frank
