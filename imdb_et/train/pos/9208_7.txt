"Shooter" was a different film for Michael Dudikoff. Although this film is usually associated with martial arts, this film, as it was western, has allowed it to show that it is a much more capable actor than the story of certain formulas. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, of course, is that the film does not allow a certain kind of development. The upgrade is indeed left to the viewer.
