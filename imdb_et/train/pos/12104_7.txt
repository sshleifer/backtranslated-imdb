Well filled old and very dark house horror. A good structure that includes the nature of the store itself, referring to the story of the London pub. Although there is a lot of one here who has dared to visit the houses at a certain night, running from room to room, searching or avoiding people, it is still the most enjoyable. In addition, we have a pleasant and puzzling Barbara Steele. There is a wooden dialogue and some inexplicable bits and bobs, but it is an extremely creepy atmosphere that is kept throughout, this and the super music score that keeps it well. The DVD comes from the US and has some extras
