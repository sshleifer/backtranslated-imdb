It is so gratifying to see one great piece of art that is transformed into another without distortion or competition. I had no idea how such extraordinary literature could be seen as a movie worth seeing. If you love Bulgakov's book, you would probably be afraid to see some misconceptions that have been made more in the art project than the story's deeper meaning on the screen. There are a few examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As the story is complicated and far removed, the film leaves nothing out. Just as the filmmaker read Bulgakov's work in the same way as the conductor of the orchestra reads the score - not answering the note. Why can't we find such talent in the US? Now, my favorite book and movie have the same title.
