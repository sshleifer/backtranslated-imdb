Shamefully, before I saw this movie, I was unknown to Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research to make sure he didn't really suffer like his character. well?) what he is bothering about. I was in the absolute awe of this beautiful woman. He pulled it out flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Who should have thought that sexual circumstances involving the unique desires and needs of a unique young lady can be interpreted as delicate and romantic? Well, they may be, if the right performers present them correctly, as they did with this wonderful film. I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter was watching this movie. I have often said that he was the most beautiful creature ever to fall in love with the face of our country, but he seemed to have done it himself. <br /> <br /> I hope someone who looks at this movie will enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for giving me your opinion.
