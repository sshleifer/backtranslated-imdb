Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is an enemy (she speaks Russian), I'll give up right away. In his short skirt, high-quality boots and pronounced busts, he is a real babe, even if his zombie-like eye shadow is such and goes. This 30 minutes is undoubtedly the sexiest of the series. Note the realistic and revealing wrestling game with Bronson as long as he displaces him to the jaw, destroying everything fun. Okay, I should probably leave my hormonal response down. <br /> <br /> This is a very well-produced half-hour since this undervalued force is the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Of course, manufacturers want to control the third season with a higher than average entry. This is after the nuclear-holocaust America (we know it is part of an intruder) and only the American Bronson and the Soviet Montgomery are together about 20 tons of realistic wreck. They alternate between the destruction of alternating moods, but we do not know how long biology needs to become a policy that naturally ends (happy Bronson). And that's it. There is no real talk except what Bronson has to say, which is over-inflated. Nonetheless, the scenario is still entertaining and fairly courageous for this time, even suggesting that not all Russian women looked like a truck driver (a popular cold war time stereotype). <br /> <br /> It is quite curious that Bronson (Buchinsky), a very Slavic person, would be a Slavic American and glossy Montgomery. In appearance, it should be the opposite. I think the producers didn't want the American to be a physically weaker woman, regardless of their appearance. But it may happen that there is little of the usual TZ fear or atmosphere, but the episode remains very, very traceable for 30 minutes.
