Wow. I loved the whole series and I was shocked by the comments of people who thought it ended badly. Perhaps he looked a bit loose during the 4th and 5th seasons, while being better on television than anything else. But 6, and especially 6b, were beautiful permutations on issues that developed in the more muscular three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B started with such a nervous mood, and Janice has always been keen on the family hate - a doom-filled line that knows Tony's desire to sit and star. Anyone who didn't survive the consequences of this series doesn't know Tony. Melf's discomfort with psychiatric research and its references to the expressive sentimental sentimentality of sociopathic pets and animals extend to the first episodes of the series, such as Tony panic attacks over ducks that left their pool and resonates with Phil's wave. before childhood before the final episode of coup (not Chase dark humor). <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I just add that I thought the final show - starting with the strains of Vanilla Fudge to offer an ironic shelter ("You Keep Me Hangin" On) the terminal moments where Tony disappears peacefully with his family, for example, AJ's SUV or Phili's head were completely perfect. The best TV ever. <br /> <br /> Pretty good in a deadly environment that supplies pathologically "jack-off fantasies" to AJ derides (and then to where he immediately leaves). Mr Chase has a pork pie.
