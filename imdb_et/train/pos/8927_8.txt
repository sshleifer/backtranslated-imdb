Clair Denis once again looks at his foreign fathers, men who keep their bliss firmly, despite their family's emotions, but Nénette and Boni from Marseille's narrow world, exploring Louis Trebor In The Intruder takes us far from the frontier between France and Switzerland, half way around the world, Korea and Tahiti. Again, the film begins in the midst of a stream, Louis, in its sixties, to cope with heavy hearts while trying to maintain a high level. We learn that Louis is not a stranger to violence because his salon is a place where smuggling and armed forces regularly occur. Louis is sleeping with a large knife under his pillow near rifles. Denis is not in a hurry to move forward, and we have to patiently build our understanding of Louis in our daily activities and the few people with whom he is working at the border, including son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost coarse-haired mustache) who pushes him as " lunatic ": which is shown as a devoted father. There are many short scenes that, although apparently unrelated, create an impression of Louis and his milieu. The work of Mr Godard's camera is inspiring here. The controlling metaphor is the transplant of the heart of Louis, to which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to look for another son that was not found and where Louis's new heart pushes him back, as Sidney rejected the old one. We are used to short scenes in Denis's film, which is inexplicable: Nénette astride Boni eats with a spoon; drive with Boni's father and then Boni's shortest images with head-to-head injuries; In the Louis scene, a body with a habitat with a transplant scar, but a Sidney body. The idea of ​​the two latter is to reject the father, real or imagine, killing something unspecified in the son.
