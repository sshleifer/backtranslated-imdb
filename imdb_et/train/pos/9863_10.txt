I thought the ice age was a great movie! As a 30-year-old woman with no children, I still enjoy these humorous, animated animated films. Sid is the best character I've seen for some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (though he was really humorous and I didn't think his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I've seen the movie at least 15 times (I obviously do it myself) and I quote the movie at work (several times ... yes, still). My favorite scene is where Sid says, "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to think what the squirrel is trying to tell them about "tigers". "" Wolves packaging, bear package, flea pack, towel pack, nose pack, pack leather? "lies, a package of worries, a pack of wall, a pack of birds, a pack of flying fish ..." or that part goes! This is a more fun part of the whole movie, although I really enjoyed humor behind "sliding map mapping" and many other parts. The only animated movie that can compare to the ice age is "Brother Bear".
