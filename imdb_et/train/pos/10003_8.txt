This is not a typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less of a hit than most of his films and he actually had the next plot. Leslie Ann Warren made the film, she is such a fantastic, undervalued actor. There were a few moments that could have been a bit more complementary, and some scenes that would probably have been cut to make room for this, but all together, it is worth renting and watching. The action was good in general, Brooks himself did a good job without telling him directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" played their parts well.
