I'm very sensitive to the movies I see. I heard Moon Child completely random. I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time now and Gackti and Mizer fan only recently. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found that the film was released again and chose it without a second thought. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as movies, I admit that scenes can sometimes be somewhat threatening ... but they're also meant to be, as the other user suggested. Typical peace before the storm, citing Leon Gary Oldman ... without getting into spoilers, the movie hit very hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are unlimited and, as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and a similar marriage, it's up to death you participate. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give performances that show why they can make such lyrics their lyrics, their passion for music on the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary movie that reaches its soul and creates an emotional response. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the movie, I realized it would probably be a big rotation until my collection goes. I want to encourage everyone who reads this post to revive the film if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend ... it takes a whole new direction using the classic Yakuza movie elements and how you can go wrong with Ryo Ishibashi Takashi Miike's "Audition" and "Suicide Club" ? <br /> <br /> Man ... I can't say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
