I finally sat down and saw this movie all the way and I have to say I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actors - it's not just that she can * act, but she chooses the roles best suited to her, which are more meaningful and important than what first seems. I have read some comments that express their relief that it was not a terrible feminist thing, as they previously thought, but I certainly disagree. Diana is a feminist. He watches his dreams and believes himself in the opposite of what practically everyone thinks about him (except his caring brother Tiny and his coach and manager, Hector, who turns out to be his father's parent), which is the word "feminism" is all about . It's good to see movies like the real side of feminism - they're not a bunch of losers - but they have dreams and they can do something. Diana is loving for herself, but she and Adrian have more realistic, sophisticated relationships than just something magically working. Girlfight is a taste of reality and it brings faith back to the understanding of its people. Thanks to Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important movie that's not just for young women, but for everyone who wants to go a long way in their lives.
