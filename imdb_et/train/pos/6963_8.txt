Great surprise, probably because I was expecting it. The reviews were rather modest about this, although everyone seemed to agree that the concept was golden: the man discovers his new hero's super hero and finds if he wants to break with him that he is such a psycho. I expected it to break down, but it never really happened. Of course, it does not make as much of its fantastic assumption as it could, and decides to be short if it could have expanded the universe of the film. But I can't blame it for that. Uma Thurman is great as a bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And I've discovered that many years later, he didn't like Luke Wilson being absolutely perfect as Schlub. He has given two of the best comics in 2006 (the second quite unpublished in the Yiddish). I broke my face when he and Thurman first had sex. This is one of the funniest sex scenes. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a little too much psycho, just as incredibly incredible. Maybe I would have received it with some backgrounds. However, I can forgive my mistakes because I had a good time to look. Definitely underestimated.
