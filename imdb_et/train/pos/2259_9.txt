I bought it cheaper than renting our local store. It was almost in a coin state and I wouldn't have heard of it before. Obviously no one else was. <br /> <br /> I can't believe my happiness. You are going through the whole field of emotions and you will undoubtedly try to overcome the complex message - the Mandela party's very moral and non-triumphalistic attitude. Despite its huge length (I had to look at it in two sessions) - it was like a book that couldn't be put down. Maybe the songs are not all memorable, but the spirit of the thing will light up forever. I do not understand the comments that music (which is clearly intended for the stage) is not realistic! I have seen the "South Pacific" and have read the book and can make sure that the musical is not realistic compared to the book. I'm going to find it a little while it takes. One day they will do it with a better budget. <br /> <br />
