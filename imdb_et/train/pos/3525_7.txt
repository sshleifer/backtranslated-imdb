Man, it's a hard DVD that comes. I found it only in the 2nd region, Spanish imports, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Well. Not so much that it is a masterpiece of making a movie, although it is run by Curt Siodmak (IMDb.com credit reads "Robert", but Curt's credit list is Curt), or because he has a few familiar numbers from other murder concepts - Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but since my ten-year curiosity about film has finally been met. <br /> <br /> In essence, Alan Curtis, an independent engineer, has been detained by his alienated wife and finds himself in a New York Bar with two pocket tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is beside her in a stool and she politely calls her in a musical review. He accepts a bit gloomy. The Mopey barman gives them both eyes when they leave. <br /> <br /> At the show, a passionate star will notice that this public girl is wearing the same hat and breaking anger with anger. The band's drummer Cook, a letter to a silent lady, but doesn't get the answer. Curtis takes her wife's home and asks her name, but she doesn't give it and she doesn't want to know her. Had he been a Longfellow devotee, he would have said something about passing ships at night. <br /> <br /> Okay, Curtis is going home to find his wife's murder in his absence. Police officer Gomez turns him to DA. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom nobody else can remember - not a bartender, not a Latin star, not a cab driver ("Al Alp"), not a drummer - and since a woman is lost, it is impossible to sue. <br /> <br /> Curtis has been convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez thought things over and decided he was probably innocent, because someone with a brain wouldn't be so stupid. He joins Curtis's loving secretary, Ella Raines, in an informal investigation of the case. <br /> <br /> They will visit the alleged witnesses again. An ominous bartender travels by car, maybe accidentally, so he's out of the picture. Hot-tempered Latina has left because the show is closed and she has still refused to cooperate and is unknown to the source of the hat. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by a real murderer, but not before she is featured in a scene where her drummer puts together in an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face requires an expression that does not mean intense focus, but rather a monster, an orgasmic madness. Her eyebrows roll to the ceiling, her mouth slips, her hammering becomes crazy. I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Nobody is otherwise unfulfilled, but everyone is professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. The best performance is probably by Franchot Tone. He's a real murderer and he's fooling his alibi. He is reserved and artistic. Even when he despises, he is decorative. I don't know how to put it exactly, but Tone seems to be both thinking and just part of it. Alan Curtis as an innocent engineer on the Kelvin scale is close to zero and belongs to B-picture. <br /> <br /> I don't know why it's considered classic. It's really your main murder mystery from Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But the direction of Siodmak is sensitive. The man goes over and his hat runs in the gutter where the water flows. The use of his shadows is quietly effective. <br /> <br /> Glad when I got it.
