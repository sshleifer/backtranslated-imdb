My kids had to stop this second night of the movie and when things started playing, it drew my interest. I had to go to the bowling league so I would have saved them for me on a DVD so I could review later. Well I just looked at it and the front of my shirt should be soaked after the spiders. It was a great movie, although I could almost feel these girls were experienced. And, in millions of years, I would never have guessed why Alissia went from this beautiful girl to an anti-social gothic. It was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I experienced the same pain that Alissia felt. I wouldn't have been looking for this movie either, but I'm sure I saw it. Very touching, very touching. Good for those who love good drama or tears.
