It's one of the first independent movies I've ever seen. For such a very small budget it did well; I, as myself, feel the main character, although my sleeping problems have never been so intense and disturbing. Well-managed, well-functioning, a lot of things I haven't seen in theaters, lighting, and so on to set up a movie. There are few noticeable horses, but they can be designed; you see after watching the movie. The film is very personal and worth watching twice. No movie is flawless, but the Hollywood version couldn't do it better. a total of 8/10.
