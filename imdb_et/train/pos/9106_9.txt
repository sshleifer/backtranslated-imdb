Since I looked at it for the first time, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures I've ever seen. The great scenario represents the life of women (all of them are somehow related) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar achieved a convincing film of his director's debut and proves himself to be the leader of effective actors. But not that all the performances are great. Of all the leading women, they reach the middle (Najwa Nimri) very well (Vicky Peña), but the standing assignment should be directed to the newcomer Mónica Cervera, who convincingly plays Antonia San Juan's slowed daughter. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as her male sister and Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and director Ramón Salazar have a nice little turn. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" is beautifully written and filmed when I looked at it so moved that I couldn't think of that day. I highly recommend it.
