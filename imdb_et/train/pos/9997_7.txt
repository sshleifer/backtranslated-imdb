Life Stinks (1991) was a step forward for Mel Brooks' other productions. He marks a rich man who pays his friends a mad contribution. Brooks argues that he gets a life like a homeless man for a month. His shocked and amused friends accept this unusual contribution. During his stay at Bowery, he meets a number of strange homeless people, one of whom catches his fiction (Lesley-Ann Warren). They attack friendship when he teaches him a lot of tricks he learned while living on the street. Can Mr Brooks be able to survive independently without being a dirty rich? Will he win this unusual bet? Who are his real friends? Find out when you look at LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This movie is unfairly broken. Of course, this is not classic like his previous films, but it's still enjoyable. I liked how Mel Brooks honors Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you've watched Chaplin's previous silent movies, you'll also have humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
