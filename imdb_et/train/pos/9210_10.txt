I feel this is one of the best films I've seen, I'm an older man and I love the western. I love movies that are partly based on facts, if I'm not mistaken, it's such a movie. I also like revenge-type movies, it also qualifies in my opinion. Some parts of my favorite film were opening scene with whipping and board picture. I felt that the regular beating scene was a bit of a surplus, but didn't affect how I felt about the whole movie. I saw what I think this film continues in the episode of smoke smoke. I also enjoyed it. I recommend watching the movie for a while, look at it again. I also felt that the romantic parts of this movie were well played. I thought Randy Travis was so characteristic that he was playing a villain type, but I've always enjoyed doing it.
