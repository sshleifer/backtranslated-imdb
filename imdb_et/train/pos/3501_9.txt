One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! There is a universally impressive story of young love and bravery in the Lower East Side of New York City, both of which are superstars. Funny, adorable, sad and inspirational, it is completely refreshing for the young people in the urban environment, who often makes Larry Clark a miserable mess into the gutter where it belongs ... although I have to admit that Bully was at his usual ticket. Victor Vargas Raising is one movie you are missing ... you do, so don't miss it!
