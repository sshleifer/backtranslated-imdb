The shortest way to describe Ride With The Devil is just one word: authenticity. I do not repeat what has been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much historical research and careful attention to the details that the team undoubtedly went through was appreciated by the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> As a student who has studied history and the setting of this film, I have to say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films about bleeding in Kansas. Yes, there were freedoms about actual events, because all fiction is able to do. But the overall feeling of the movie is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (there are no PCs here): even the actors see authentic.Even Jewel Kilcher (who is a small part of the film) seemed to have stepped into a photograph of the mid-19th century. <br /> <br /> A few viewers with whom I spoke have expressed their disbelief in a stylized dialogue. They cannot believe that farmers of the 19th century would speak like poets. <br /> <br /> What they do not understand is that in this era of verbality, the American public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and beautiful bunch. These people were raised in Shakespeare and King James Bible. Scenarists reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, deciding on the basis of time documentation. The stylized dialogue only adds a magical atmosphere to the film. <br /> <br /> But in addition to the historical document, this film also works on a visceral level. Beautifully photographed and executed, it reflects back on the days of great Western ethics. The attack on Lawrence, Kansas so many times in so many other lesser films is a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the middle of action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This movie has everything that can be attentive to the motion. In a year when overpriced rubbish, like American beauty, dominated, this magnificent work of art was buried by an indifferent studio system. But I am sure that it will be delivered with the Rattan Devil in the coming years. Please rent this movie. You don't have to be disappointed.
