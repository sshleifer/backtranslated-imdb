That same year, it was a happy coincidence that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made Alfred Hitchcock's haunted masterpiece "Vertigo". Maybe the two participants had to do it after the hardness of the Hitchcock movie. In any case, it is a great companion to "Vertigo", because it again explores a very unlikely but powerful romance. In fact, the film can be seen as "Vertigo" fixed to its happy end. Again, Novak's transformation goes through, in Vertigo he essentially plays two women, and here "turns" from witch to mortal. Stewart is again witched and for some time his love is torturing him. Unlike Vertigo, two come together with the Bell Book and Candle, an ideal antidote to Hitcock's film. Again, the dynamics of love and attractiveness are studied, but in a completely different vein. The cast is terrible. Lemmon cheerful as Novak's warlord and Elsa Lancaster, who gave a classical performance as an aunt. Ernie Kovacs is a player of the alcoholic cult writer and, of course, Hermoine Gingold, who is playing Novak. Drinking Stewart drinking is the best comedy. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if you shouldn't see this memorable light comedy.
