After looking at "Merisiga", we mean two questions (besides "Do I really see a psychopath?"): "Is that snuff?" The answer is no; although this is the closest thing I've seen to the snuff. And then, "Where the hell did they find this girl?" Because he is tortured within 45 minutes without any justification (in fact there is nothing else in this movie!): Nails, torn hands, feet, tools that are infected with breeds, and much more until the last scene (I'm still not sure how they did it). Because it belongs to the "japonese land scene", it is obvious that he didn't get much money. So what were his / her motivations? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but this is not a problem (there are no real dialogues, boys are offensive with just a few scenes). I haven't seen all the serial numbers yet, but the first "guinea pig" is not the best known. I'm still rated 8 because if the goal was to believe people in snuff, the problem is pretty good (ask actress Charlie Sheen). But I think they could have gone beyond what they did in the following. <br /> <br /> Another movie that I hide from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
