I was so surprised when I saw this movie so much underestimated ... I understand why some of you don't like this movie. Its pace is slow, characteristic of Japanese films. However, if you are absorbed into me like me, it won't find it at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's the best comedy I've ever seen. "Should we Dansu?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is different from Hollywood, eg. Austin Powers or Scary Movies where the gag is guaranteed every few minutes. Rather, it is a light film that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it makes me "real". The plot is simple but pleasant. I was so glad Sugiyama (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing. Before I watched the movie, I had a little depression because of a hard school job. I felt lost. But this film made me think of the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same Sugiyama boat; if he could find his hobby, why didn't I? It reminded me of "exploring my future" and discovering happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that actors are not professional dancers. While some of you find that dance scenes are not as perfect as you expect, I like it because it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", learning to dance when the film continues. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is encouraging and warming up from the heart. Like comedy, he does his job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And Aoki is funny :-D
