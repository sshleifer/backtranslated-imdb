An odd and interesting French novel cynical and honestly adjusting the depressive middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying largely on the first person's story, but nevertheless. The best way to describe both the film and the novel is to be a philosophical and black humorist (petit-bourgeois sort) that it is more of an intellectual Charles Bukowski (not disrespectful of CB). A somewhat funny but also social and sexual relationship analysis, the big achievement of the film is that it reflects the real life in such a recognizable way that you ask: why aren't such other movies? One of the rare examples of a good book that makes an equally good movie.
