David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes are playing a young couple of journalists who want to go to California but can't really afford it, so they "share" with other young couples (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save costs. to stop at various murder sites, sites where serialists did their thing because Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they do not know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are a serum killer and girlfriend who just goes with everything HE says: I don't care about Pitt as a rule, but he does it for psychological roles. It is frightening that he does them so well; as he did before, no, not killers, but pretty much the same way of thinking, but as the journey goes by, Carrie thinks others are in money, but Earley always looks like money. ..when you remember that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it One thing he stands out is not too bright, having a good heart but not realizing that he doesn't have to cope when Earley beats he doesn't like anything. As things begin to become unacceptable, Carrie demands that the second pair be put into a petrol station and unfortunately it is at the moment it is inside, that it sees a newsletter that tells him exactly who they are going to, after which things are going to catch them fast. It's not the biggest flick in the world, but it's not bad ... I was looking at what the "unrated" version was supposed to be, but I don't know how much was cut out of the version because it seemed to me quite annoying really ... not so that it changes family holidays or something, if it is not the Manson family. 7 out of 10
