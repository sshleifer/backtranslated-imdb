Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspiring movie. At the end, when the crowd of the stadium rises and people raise their hands, I'll give me the cold when I see it. It's just great. Joseph is great as a lonely and sad boy who has been disappointed so far and something in his life. How he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to believe in magic and angels is funny and exhilarating. A very nice family movie - I admit - - is rather a horny happy ending. But hey, this is not really important, the film maintains its basic quality by good deeds and inspiring themes.
