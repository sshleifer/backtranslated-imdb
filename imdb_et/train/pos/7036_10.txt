I have to be one of the best political satires I've seen so far with excellent performance for Cusak, Tom and all the supporters. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot, very well placed and very good unexpected turn at the end. Action scenes were well filmed and choreographic. Very funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie big thumbs. It is extremely critical of US military intervention in the Middle East, and as such, it can get bad comments from people who do not share the same political view, or those who are simply too politically unaware to assess the dark and drk humor. Indeed, in places, comedy was so close to the truth that it was a funny and tragic border.
