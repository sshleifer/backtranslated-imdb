It's a well-made documentary about Indy Car's racing world. Photography is simply outstanding. The scene was Mario Andretti, who rides on an old racetrack to New England Street, lined with ancient maple leaves, blown to the speed of cars on the side, is incredible. The film loses its beauty on a small screen, but if you like to watch the cars on their border, you should see the movie.
