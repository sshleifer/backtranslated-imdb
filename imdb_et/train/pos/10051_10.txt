Family problems are in real life, and that's the movie. Love can keep members together through tests and trials, and that's what this movie is about. One man, Daddy, is mature and confident to keep the family in front of the casualties. Children grow up, everything is a hard way to realize that no matter how old they are, the parent still loves their children and is ready to offer them a pillow while falling. All the actors who portrayed their characters made great performances. Yes, I threw a tear down the road, knowing that I had a similar experience as a young and later as a parent. This is true for a life that every young adult and parent would look good, although some do not know it before they are older. Must see for those who care about their families.
