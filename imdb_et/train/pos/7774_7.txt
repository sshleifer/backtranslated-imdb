"Written Wind" was a tremendously successful universal image. This can only be done by Douglas Sirk, the man who saw opportunities in the material given to him. On the basis of Robert Wilder's popular novel and George Zuckerman's adaptation, it had all the elements that change the great melodrama: nymphomania, great oil of happiness, alcoholism, incest and touch of light homosexuality. Mr. Sirk made the way to follow later in the genre of soap operas, mainly "Dallas" and "Dynasty", just mentioning two. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie is a fully inserted studio. Most of the designs are fake. Like many of these pictures from the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was shot in the studio completely. Just look at scenes that should take place in Manhattan or Miami, or even a lake to see how the landscape is painted in the background. Mr. Sirk didn't care less about reality than he could talk about his story. <br /> <br /> Recently, a tryout screening, part of the revival of Mr. Sirk's work, where people laughed at the most dramatic moments, especially during scenes where a good Mitch Wayne Rock Hudson appears. There is also a graphical way that both Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later his daughter, the evil Marylee, caresses a bracelet that adorns an older man's table, a sort of phallic object d'art. > <br /> Douglas Sirk apparently wanted his casting to be the highest performance that makes Dorothy Malone a nymphomaniac Marylee, and to some extent Robert Stack, like Kyle, a tortured story heir. This would probably be a simple explanation of what's on the screen. The only thing that seems to be normal is Lauren Bacall, who was not asked to defeat Lucy Moore's character, which seems to be something other than a grounded man who tried to hang with the wrong crowd. <br /> <br /> With your second Hollywood films, "Written Wind" shows the genes of talented directors who gave the public just what they wanted to see: stories larger than life that can only be seen on the big screen
