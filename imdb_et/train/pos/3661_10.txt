Snobs and pseudo experts find it far from De Sica's best. Those who suffer from a lack of serious innocence find the problem with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very directly. His Italian language is not about contemporary Italian filmmakers or Pietro Germi's bitter self-parody, Mario Monicell's sharp generation, Visconti's solemnity, or Antonion's cold observation. De Sica told us like a father sitting on a baby bed before going to bed. There is no attempt to make intellectual. Miracolo A in Milan and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales or what we call magic realism today. The movie is a pearl from beginning to end, and Toto is the kind that you accept with an open heart, but it naturally requires a heart. Cinema is the purest. Great.
