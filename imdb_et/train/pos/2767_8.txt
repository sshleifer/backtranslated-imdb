Gregory Peck gives an excellent result in this film. The last 15 minutes (or nearby) are great and Peck is an absolute pleasure to watch. The same cannot be said for the rest of the movie. It's not terrible and I'm sure it's done with good intentions, but the only real reason (when I was honest) would be Peck. For the rest, you will only read the Old Testament.
