Rich, alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with Secretary Lauren Bacall. She's getting married and so happy she's gonna stop drinking. Bacall is also mysteriously loved by Stack's best friend Rock Hudson. And the Stack Nymphomaniac sister, Dorothy Malone, lust after Rock. Throw in some complications and the movie goes out of control (good opportunity). <br /> <br /> Very shiny film in beautiful Technicolor with jawbone cutting and decoration (see Bacall hotel room at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, shaping clothes. It is basically a soap opera with class A production values. The story itself is a lot of fun, and some of the dialogues from the start are fun. The behavior of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not so good, but seeing these young and glamorous people is great ... especially the Stack ... when he smiled on his knees! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she deserves the best support for her role. He's sexy, violent, cruel and sympathetic ... all convincing. <br /> <br /> A fun, shiny trash can. Don't miss it!
