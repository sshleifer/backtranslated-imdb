I'm not sure this comment contains the actual spoiler, but I play it safely, so don't read it unless you've seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and so everyone I work with - and that's the thing. I spent a lot of my life in the cinema without acting. Such people are the heroes of this film: cries, pullers, air travelers, lighters and writers, costumes, etc., and the whole thing is said from their perspective, at least to a large extent. Most of the participants are nuts and are absorbed by the absurd point that this film enriches so well, but you have to work with the actors to make this movie a real drama! Possible spoiler warning: In one great scene, both participants are both participants _discussing how _discuss_ something personal, something completely "script", along with other actors, and they start to make lines, practice and criticize them. 91, it's become fashionable to do it, especially on television. But hardly anyone has done so well.
