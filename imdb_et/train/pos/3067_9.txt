What a surprising treatment has come across on the television late. If I read a short plot in the TV list before seeing the film, I would have passed. The idea of ​​a movie that talks about amazing-seeing - the need for shrinkage to leave-business-and-love-in-love .... sounds like a trite. But the movie works. It is clear from the beginning of the film that the man carries his weight on his shoulders before he even says the word. The look and feel of the film is perfect. in the dark, but not disgracefully so. <br /> <br /> After an amazing family aspect that touches surrealism, Macy grabs her marriage and her father's control. Macy shows repressed sadness and her sleeping talks with her son are amazing. The young boy shows his acting skills longer than his years, and communication between father and son is so natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films I've seen for a while and I can't believe I received it at night in television at random.
