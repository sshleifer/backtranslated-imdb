I saw it for the first time as a child living in London. Hitler's Luftwaffe scars were too obvious and the film's landscape resembled our street. I remember having a nightmare after that. The odd thing is that it is not really a cinema when looking at cinema as a piece of social history. <br /> <br /> After a world-wide destructive war, the range of machines was badly scared, more nano-technology, but generally it was a great and well-designed job. It was interesting to see how space was perceived. I think the shooting of a spacecraft with a giant weapon would almost certainly be the killing of astronauts. But much was right. Mans desire war, man man. War instruments as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
