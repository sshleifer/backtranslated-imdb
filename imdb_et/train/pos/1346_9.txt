The British Film Institute worked with Martin Scorsese, a documentary film by AFI's 100 best films "rebuttle". <br /> <br /> Now. I'm a big movie fan and I'm proud of seeing many many movies. But I'm comparing with my idol. In this fantastic (though long) documentary film, Scorsese spectator walks through the history of American history at several stages. It is divided into several parts, including the West, Gangster, and Noir. Martin Scorsese is a great excursion and a fantastic professor.
