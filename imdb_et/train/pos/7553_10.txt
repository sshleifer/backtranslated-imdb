When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely attached to the screen. His greatness kept my attention to such an extent that all my attention was focused on its duration. I would recommend seeing it not only for anime fans, but for everyone who loves a very good movie period (or who really likes strange stuff). The art style is beautiful, the sound is perfect and the insignia inside is breathtaking. I've heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text into a movie, but I think the way it is done complements the strange style of the movie. The description given to "Hello Kitty acid" does not justify this absolutely epic proportion. I would like to find more of the works that I did and see them.
