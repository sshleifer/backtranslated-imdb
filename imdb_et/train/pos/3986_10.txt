I am a college student studying at levels and needing help and comments from anyone with any views on the subject of the mother's film. Whether you've gone through something like this, or just want to comment and help me explore more about this movie, every comment would be very welcome. The comments are only used for the exam and are included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, then I'm sure I can use them and you could help me A! I also learn about "About a Boy" and "Tadpole" so if you have seen these movies, I'd be grateful if you could leave comments on this page. Thank you.
