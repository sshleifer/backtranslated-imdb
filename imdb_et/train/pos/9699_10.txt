Something about "Paulie" touched my heart because some movies do. It's a funny, funny, but emotional movie. I'm late for this movie fan. I didn't see "Paulie" until May 2004 and have since subscribed to a widescreen DVD from eBay. <br /> <br /> Paulie's special effects are great. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases. Probably my favorite part is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy), followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) is a good person with a good heart. You're driving her through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> You can't rent or buy this movie wrong !!
