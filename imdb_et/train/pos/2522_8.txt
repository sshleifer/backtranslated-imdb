I have to admit that at first I didn't expect anything good at all. I was expecting only a chewing film promoting Gackt and Hyde, but I am happy to say that it offers a lot more. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is not so great, but it doesn't wonder if all the cast is well-disciplined and bring enough strength to your characters. Effects lack consistency, but the action scenes are satisfactorily satisfactory. <br /> <br /> What really struck me was the nature of the story, although it combines fantastic elements, it also shows reality. Developing the characters, their doubts and feelings really do with me and I think this is the key to this movie. It makes you think and it conveys all the hate well. <br /> <br /> It meets all the hopes of a good drama. I definitely recommend it to everyone.
