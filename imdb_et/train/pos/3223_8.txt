Basically, it is a sci-fi movie for popcorn, but it is obvious from the beginning that it is aimed at a large number of intelligence. You can count on about 10 clich√©s that the movie builds, but it only gives about three of them, and some of them have a twist for them that will let you know once again that the director hasn't assumed you were an idiot. Kurt Russell's behavior is truly superb and gives depth to the surprising and rewarding character. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to build your faith!
