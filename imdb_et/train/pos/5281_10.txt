it is not "Bonnie and Clyde" or "Thelma and Louise", but it is a good road movie. it creates two main characters gently and easily. viewers learn the main tensions quickly, which is a tribute to the director. there is a young French (and English)-speaking son who wants to work well in France, has a French girlfriend and drinks alcohol, parties like young men. And there is his Moroccan Arabic (and French) spoken father who follows his Muslim faith, generosity, and wisdom of his parents, and who rejects his new culture (like mobile phones). The film could explore a very powerful policy - a strange couple travels through Turkey through the former Yugoslavia and then through Mecca in the Middle East. these are areas where the Muslim population has been involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have held power in torture and condemnation and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle. but the film moves through these places and opportunities only to clues to such agendas. The relationship between the two films is key to this film and faith, politics is the background. It seems to say that we are all human and we need to understand and care for each other to cope well in this world. it is certainly not natural born and the better.
