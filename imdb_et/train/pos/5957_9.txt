The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I am not a film critic or like the rest of the snobbish people who comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie probably doesn't have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, exemplary was fantastic and cinema was great! It seemed like you all had this movie a lot of fun! I voted from 10 out of 10 because the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but I think it could have been a mistake when recording a DVD. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check out other films produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, Cast and Team, Thank you!
