My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 years old (I have always loved the movies) and even then I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the story is original and fun. I especially love scenes where RV is under attack in the desert. The stones are really convincing for such a low budget flick. Such films are above average and music is terrible. This is definitely a uder-prized pearl. I recommend it to anyone who loves these strange films in the late 1970s, early eighties, such as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre" and "Return of Aliens, Deadly Spawn". Definitely classic !!
