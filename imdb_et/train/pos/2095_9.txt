We will eliminate all discussions about the role of Asia in the players who play the roles of Asia. The film is 67 years old. In 1937, the studio masters believed that every participant could play a role. Participants were contracted and did not always have the choice of what role they played. End of story. <br /> <br /> This is a really great epic story about love, individual rights, classrooms and men / women. The centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer intending to take on a wife (Rainer). From the beginning, he treats him with respect at a time when women were looked upon as much as hired help. Without giving too much to the film, they go through high and low levels of all relationships, and while the story may be in the late 19th and early 20th century, the story and their feelings seem credible. In addition to the film being about 5-10 minutes longer than necessary, and Charley Grapewin's and Walter Connolly's performances are typical cartoons from the 1930s, this is a really wonderful film that has unfortunately become a victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 out of ten
