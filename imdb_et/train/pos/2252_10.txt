Henry Hathaway was both brave and enthusiastic about his love for the first days of US history. However, criticizing the historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and Mormon people is not necessary or helpful in commenting on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway did an excellent direction to convey what the people of Mormon were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the time when the martyrdom of Joseph Smith began until the release of the film. Often he reflected the philosophies and teachings of Mormon in many segments and scenes in fine filming and dialogue. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings in the early 1950s. It was just over ten years after the release of the films and before the completion of the Los Angeles Temple, which I looked at to build and attract more curious people who were Mormons. I recently bought this movie and enjoyed the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in her movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal convictions, 2. Charity for those who need it, or not, 3. The family is very important, 4. Listen with respect and care, because even the opposing messages have important points that need to be considered and adopted, 5. Work hard, individually and in the community, 6. Prepare and retain the days you need, 7. Hope is a binding link to the higher being and our daily lives. 8. And that everyone has a unique quality group and appreciate those that are useful.
