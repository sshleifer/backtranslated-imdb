When I heard "Hammerhead" appear on the DVD and finally found it in my local DVD store, I thought "well, just one cheap monster movie from Nu Image". These boys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produce cheap but very fun B pictures in recent months, but also very disappointing movies. So I didn't expect much, especially after looking at the rather disappointing "Shark Zone" a few days earlier. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be a great revival in the 1950s monster films. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and girls in trouble, people eating plants, and of course we have a creature, a huge mixture of mutants between man and hammerhead. All you need for an entertaining monster movie. The only thing missing is the graphical sexual scenes and the nudity you expect in these types of movies, but since the film is made on the TV, it is understandable why these scenes are missing. And it doesn't matter anyway, because "Hammerhead" is an action and horror entertainment. There are two reasons I gave it to seven out of ten points: First, the monster is not very often seen, and the fact that the creature is destroyed is too fast and badly done, and secondly, William Forsythe just isn't the right guy for the "hero" and proud of love With Hunter Tylo. In addition, I can highly recommend this movie to any monster movie fan. Grab yourself for a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
