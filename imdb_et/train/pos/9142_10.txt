Purple Rain ... what else to say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well chosen. The movie had a great story. I love it! I've been watching this movie since I was in the eighties and I'm only 13 years old! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he took all his musical compositions and Apollonia sat in the staircase with his ear. Critics say its drama, but I think it's more romance. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, he actually acted like himself. I'm so glad I've seen this movie. Singing Rain in the song was so cordial. I cried more than once.
