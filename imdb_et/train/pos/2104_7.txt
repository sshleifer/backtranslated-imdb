Who does not know Largo's winch in the France-Belgium-Luxembourg trio (the three countries where the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are massively published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which itself is an adaptation of novels, it was on HAD custom screens. After the first and failed TV show, the real thing begins. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, most fans didn't get it, the purpose of this movie is not to strictly adjust the comic book. There are some important parts, characters, and activities in the original. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a first-class fan of the comic book, I have to admit that I was nicely surprised. Participants are good, so is the scenario, though it may seem too fast. That's why I recommend this film to anyone interested in financial / political thrillers, but this is probably not an alternative to James Bond or Jason Bourne, as I read through the Internet.
