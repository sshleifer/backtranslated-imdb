I personally liked this movie and I'm worried that some people have given it a rating. This is a movie based on a comic book and animated, now that you don't like comics or animation, of course, this movie doesn't like why you watched and watched to judge whether it's outside of me. Though, if you are interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexy) women who hit the butt and save the world (hell) love this movie. I thought this story really drew me and it was a very cool movie. A pretty adult animation after a new trend is pretty anime-esque or more like some American movies. Like Titan A.E., meet the Punisher live version. Finally, I recommend this movie to a fan of comics and super heroes or someone with a movie that is open-minded enough.
