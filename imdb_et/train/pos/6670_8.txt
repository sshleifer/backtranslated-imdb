There are many problems with Mystery Men. First, there are too many different signs for them to get complicated or even interesting personalities. The special effects will tell the story and not really that special. Paul Reubens has disappeared in a miserable, juvenile role that simply farts and talks to an irresistible accent. <br /> <br /> Now for the right parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance, like a shovel, is the perfect pitch. Sphynx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and sprays traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller is also very amusing, showing a weak character that tries to make it a great leap for superheroes. All the characters do and this is an area that I found particularly ironically. This is because all actors are actors in the Indie movie who are trying to do it in the big leagues of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the reason I thought this post office failed was that America does not. Don't get irony. <br /> <br /> All in all, I loved the movie, but I feel that it would have worked better if more effort was made to tweak the script than to make the CGI landscapes and effects unnecessary.
