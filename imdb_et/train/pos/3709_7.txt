The adaptation of any screen from John Grisham's story deserves the mainstream Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman talks about the last director I would take with the mainstream. But this sundried pot pot is pretty good. Although it is not the best of Altman, it is definitely not one of the films he has made to leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking. <br /> <br /> Altman was wearing a hat with a mysterious thriller with noises before his 1973 film "The Long Goodbye". "Gingerbread Man" is not as good as this movie, but it is pretty good. Kenneth Branagh is a devilish lawyer who finds himself in murder when he is involved with a client (Embeth Davidtz) who has assisted him in defending him from his father (Robert Duvall). The film is placed in Savanna, Georgia, during a tropical storm approach, which gives the film an oppressive atmosphere that I really liked. The turn of the movie turns into a clunkier and clunkier, and Altman proves to be not all who are capable of shooting shootouts, but generally the film is not a bad addition to the Altman canon. <br /> <br /> Also starring Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Rating: B
