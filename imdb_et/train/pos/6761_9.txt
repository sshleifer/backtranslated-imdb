Otto Preminger's Dana Andrews Film Cycle Noirs is one of the (largely) failed jewels of the genre. Because they lack paranoia, misogyia, or hysteria, they may have been inappropriate at this time, but clear eyes, identity, masculinity and representation, subjugation of traditional psychological beliefs, tough, geometric style seem amazingly modern and very similar to Melville. The bright iron of this film is so loaded, cruel and ironic that the "happy" end is one of the most cruel of Hollywood history. Stylish, thriller, tight and packed with two-blade dialogues.
