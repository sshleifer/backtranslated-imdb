BEFORE KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE, it is recommended that DEAD starts promising, creating a simple hermit that is terrible, from different perspectives (RASHOMON style). The hour around the mark makes Sidney Lumet a film that is as much as the sum of its parts; Finally, it breaks the drama of a diverse family, exploring the full area of ​​human emotions / relationships, as the story reaches its cooling. <br /> <br /> As with Lumet, he has outstanding performances with his star studs, without any sense of excess or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character and often a dwarf Ethan Hawke who plays his brother Hank. This does not mean that Hawke is not bad; In fact, he is quite adequate, in a style appropriate to his style. Marisa Tomei is great for her relatively short look (the fact that she repels her meat). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's father) is the most intriguing, and I think he earned a little more with the screen. Amy Ryan also fulfills his job to a sufficient degree. <br /> <br /> BEFORE KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE, LADE is not an extraordinary film, but it proves that Lumet is still at its top (seemingly) in the dark. outstanding career. Here are many of its features and brands, at least of which its use is linked. Infuse a murder script (not intended), intelligent dialogue and pace, and decent scores. A truly undervalued pearl. 8/10 3 stars (out of 4). I should enter my Top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
