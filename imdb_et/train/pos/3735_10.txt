A true story about the recruitment camp in America, where young men are ready for the Vietnam War. Humanity always turned to me when it comes to war films, because it translates military personal, subjective opinions, contradicts the films of war, where actions and technical data are analyzed to the detriment of the human factor. In the film, a new spin can already be placed on an old subject and managed to be distanced from conventional war films, especially focusing on the heroes in the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozzi, who fiercely avoids sucking the dehumanizing war machine and refuses to give up his fate and fight for what he does not believe, spending his energy looking for ways to avoid being sent abroad, both his own and his comrades, and ironically finding his own The very reason why the war finally ends. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> Action is truly extraordinary, and documentary filming will make you a movie takeover. The film also offers ways of thinking for those who are accustomed to traditional warfare films or enthusiasts of war games, hopefully awakening some of the generational thoughts that luckily escaped with this terror.
