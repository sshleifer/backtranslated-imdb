Wang Bianlian is an old street artist known as the "King of Masks" who is the art of changing Sichuan art. Liang is a famous opera singer from Sichuan, honoring Wang as an artist and person. Liang is concerned that Wang should not dear precious art, so he sows the heir of Wang's legacy. The film deals with prejudices, male domination, artistic status, values, and most importantly, heat. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in the loop. Everything is important. It's a long story that has been so well modified that the movie is just 91 minutes long. Full satisfaction. Within five minutes, this is an artistic film; in the next five minutes it will be a sad film; in the next five minutes it will be a thriller. It just changes your mood as its main character changes his face. The last rope scene is phenomenal. The story and script are flawless. The actors are great. Both the main characters are the artists that you can tell how they have done. Very impressive. It wasn't even an Oscar candidate. This year the "English patient" got the best film Oscar and the foreign language film "Kolya". "Kolya" was just OK and "English patient", the smaller the better. See this 9/10.
