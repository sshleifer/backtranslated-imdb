The only reason I have 8/10 of this movie, and not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) Kelly's character's love interest leaves much to be desired (IMHO). Is the love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is a little boy. Jerry Mouse's dance series is one of the most fun and amazing dance series I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my personal favorite for me and my daughter. I am 28 years old and is 4 years old, so if the character is less iconic than Mickey, she is a favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is always exciting, eyes are fun and exciting. In every movie I've ever seen, he always steals an exhibition. One of the best 20th century dancers. No wonder Paula Abdul "chose" Kelly's move. Gene Kelly is also one of the most beautiful people in the 20th century. If you only look at one part, don't miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You don't have to be disappointed.
