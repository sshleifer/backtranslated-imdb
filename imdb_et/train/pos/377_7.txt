Ghent, the softly spoken drama by Steven Spielberg, was his first real deal in this genre. Leaving his usual adventure / fantasy price paved the way for his 1993 success, "Schindler's List". <br /> <br /> Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel tells the story of a young girl's marriage. Difficult brutal, angry farmer and his painful isolation from his beloved younger sister Nettie. Although the plot - compassion, abuse, and the ability to cure all wounds - is often powerful and mobile, it loses its way through continuity and Menno Meyjes's scrambling scenario. "Color purple" is sometimes difficult to follow and one or more times tends to be somewhat uncertain about the schedule. This expiration of scripting has cost the viewer the obvious depth and detail of Miss Walker's novel. The real shame that Maestro Spielberg was unable to pick and fix these problems, as most of the exhibitions are a great example of his leadership. <br /> <br /> Performances are strong all over the world, where Whoopi Goldberg makes his debut - which he has never done, because it is an accomplishment - like the heart cut off by Celie who just wants to be loved. Danny Glover lends strong support, even though his "Moses" were in front of him in the "Heart". A separate exhibition comes from the unconscious Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, a unanimous, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronizing, upper-class white woman. Good support also for Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) has given a beautifully melodic score and also given original blues. Editing by Michael Kahn is a sound as always, while the photographer's director, Allen Daviau, shows the perfect skill to capture some of the famous southern landscapes. <br /> <br /> This real heartbeat definitely brings a tear to the eye, it's just regrettable that we have so many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
