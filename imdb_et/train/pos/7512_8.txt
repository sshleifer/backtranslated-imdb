First of all, I've heard some great things about this movie, especially the retro / vintage scene and stocking lovers who absolutely love the Bettie page and are not disappointed. In a very pure black and white color that is added to key scenes, the film provides a documentary film about the early life and career of the Bettie page. <br /> <br /> There are many things I didn't know. First, there was a gang rape, later his early attempt to develop actor career and then glamor images, first with a camera club with people who don't get him enough and later Klaws, Paula and Irving, who, despite slavery and fetish photos, have met very pleasing and friendly people. If only such modern pornographic producers were such, maybe for better porn, be a consequence! For the most part, the film is not a philosophy of evil against pornography, but an attempt to show the environment in the 1950s for people who produce fetish and nude images. This environment was extremely repressive, perhaps a good way, because it meant that there was no effect of 'saturation' on pornography today. It also seemed much less harsh. The page appears as someone who enjoys their work and does not seem to have deteriorated. In many of his photos, he has been hidden and gagged (and trying to talk), whipping him with flourishes, so he is thrilled by photographers who photograph and see "initiation style" girli-serf films, which look like a real man. when he was in his thirties for "Jesus Christ". His faith in God and Jesus never disappears, even when he is bound and gagged, he still requires that he be given a "gift" to do "this thing." Looking at this movie, I am more familiar with the page and fear of my modesty, beliefs and behavior. He is unique in comparison to the ident-kit clone of the blondes we have today and someone who can actually say "It's life after porn".
