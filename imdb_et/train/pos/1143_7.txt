I don't look at the soaps. My grandmother still looks at it with glass. I made them fun for a tenth (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this movie takes a parody and reveals it in a new way. I found the story pretty funny. The 80's fashion - shoulder straps, sequins and polyester - are just that. Large hair, high heels and histrionics - what they combine. <br /> <br /> And all the actors just go to town, chew their parts and spit out a great, well-written pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such a potential before tabloids. And Garry: Why did we have to wait so long to see her on the film? Leesa Gibbons - she wasn't lost, but it's nice to include her as a real entertainment reporter (and where do you still ask for this job?). <br /> <br /> Of course I could have without Sally climbing the drainage pipe. Lucy Ricardo did this many times? Obviously this is what you do when you're in a funny building in New York. I'm just grateful that they won't pull the flagpole a bit. <br /> <br /> But it was cute, it was funny, it had a tease, it was after the credit that ended before it was normal, it was worthy of the second look, it was big cast and it got my personal memories. Really what else do you need?
