Suddenly, Eastwood's artistic failure at the moment of his career as a good leader is seen as a sudden impact. The reason is not actually the film itself, but the attitude it holds towards the vigilantism that it seems to support. In some places, it owes Death Wish more than the original Dirty Harry movie. It can be argued that this is the case - at the end of the day, this is a film about guilt, justice and punishment. At the end of the day for me, empathy is compassion. However, with all these arguments in mind, it's easy to forget that the unexpected effect is a terribly well-made film. Forget "Go on punk, do my day picture", it's iconic, but not original. But take a look at the pictures taken from San Francisco by increasing the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite remarkable. Or look at a great scene where Sondra Locke's character visits the hospital with a nurse with mental illness. Eastwood uses the face very well. All in all, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how Eastwood is a maturity leader. And when I remember correctly, it was Eastwood's first time on the screen, even though it was a feature film of controversial ideology. I also think this is the first well-developed film from Eastwood. Although Eastwood has a huge talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak spot (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.). The narrative space leads to the integration of the visual elements into the film and not the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.
