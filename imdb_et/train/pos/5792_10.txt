This movie is the only movie with a scene where Michael Jackson uses Tommy Gun. Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> This movie tends to be funny! It may be horrible to watch Jacko w / kids, but this movie also has stars .................................. ........ wait for it, ..................... <br /> <br /> JOE PESCI !!!!!! Think about it, Joe Pesci and Jacko with Tommy's weapons, throwing coins into mummies from 20 meters away? What not to like? As stated above, this movie is ROOK !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! ! !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
