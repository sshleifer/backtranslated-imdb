My mother and I were on our way to the Northeast (mainly in Massachusetts) when we decided to take a small detour to the Boston Film Festival. Now I don't know much about the movie, so I thought it might be a little educational. The first movie we saw was ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I don't know about you, but I thought it was great! I'm from Texas and where I come, we don't see too many moving movies, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted it was too violent, but said I didn't know much about what she said, but it was a great picture. I was shocked by the sequences that were great. I'm also a big fan of how good guys win, so I was glad when the ladies of Romeo killed all the bad guys. It was a real shine. I'm not sure if this video will be released, but if you get the chance, you should check it out. I think you are pleasantly surprised. But the word is reasonable, it is quite violent and there are many words so you don't want to look at your children. This is more for adults.
