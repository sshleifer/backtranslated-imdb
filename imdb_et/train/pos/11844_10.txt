I started riding horses very recently, and as anyone who ever drives, I should know that I loved horses and their world. I rented the Spirit out of the whim, just trying to get so much horse-related stuff full of my life as I can, and I was surprised at the results. <br /> <br /> What I was expecting was a Disneyesque film about animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I got was an amazing movie full of beautiful landscapes and animations and an amazing story that has great potential for warming up the heart. <br /> The Spirit is a wild blackhead in the Old West, whose whole world is shattering around him when he discovers that people are taking over their homeland slowly. The story comes with many different characters, some people, some animals, everything is well written and most of them are nice to look at. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story. and who is happy with history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but what I think is important is that the animals in this movie are not talking. It was a really pleasant holiday for Lady And The Tramp's animated movies, all of which are used to today.
