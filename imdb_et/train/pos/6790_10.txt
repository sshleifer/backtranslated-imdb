This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist, this is actually more fun than any other because of the battle system (you damage the enemy, depending on how you try to attack, you can transform into a dragoon, a special attack, a magic ...). The script is very good. The characters are all beautiful and you don't have long dialogues to support, as happened with many Final Fintasy series games. I missed the dialogues about the past if you just wanted to continue the story of the game. Ambientation is a jewel of this game, combining medieval fantasy and futuristic science fiction. It is noteworthy that animation effects are simply incredible, I like them more than other modern games (we don't remember Dragon's legend for 8 years). Then the map is big, there are all kinds of enemies. Finally, music is not the best music I have heard, but it is just for this kind of game.
