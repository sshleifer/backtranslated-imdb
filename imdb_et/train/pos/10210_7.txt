It's not a big movie, but I admire writers and filmmakers to try something a little different. The main theme of the film is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can change the future significantly. In some ways, it reminds me of SLIDING DOORS, although instead of focusing on one random event, seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and everyone helps to build a cute conclusion. In addition, the strange bald guy seems to understand this and he talks about it in one short scene - as he is some kind of almighty creature, but he has no explanation (like two men fighting with each other in the HUDSUCKER PROXY bell tower). <br /> <br /> The DVD jacket only shows Audrey Tautou. This is his success at AMELIE, although he is only one of many film actors and no one is starring. The pace is brisk, the acting fine and the conclusion are not at all bad. The only reason I didn't get it was that some characters were a little uninteresting, and I think the film could have been tightened somewhat less with sub-blocks.
