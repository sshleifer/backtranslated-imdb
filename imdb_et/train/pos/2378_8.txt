This movie is much better than the asylums version mainly for its war in the world. The tripods look pretty cool, but their walking and death could have been better. Action scenes were really cool. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking! oh my god stopped please or i will kill myself. The thunderstorm scene was my favorite queue mainly because the ship was hanging on a tripod. Good movie I recommend it to people who have read the book. The music is fantastic and the directors are cutting down pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Pros. Good soundtrack 99% of the book "Violent Violence" Stands and handling machines are cool to watch <br /> <br />. some bad actor looking for london
