Unlike other comments, I found this movie exciting, even with all my mistakes and some actors' zombies. <br /> <br /> As a technologist, I found that experiments were interesting and the hardware was realistic. While reading people's thoughts through a computer sounds fantastic, they are now being experimented. I note that these experiments are at a very early stage, but the results are not yet favorable. <br /> <br /> Movie characters are well cast. The girl, though overstretched, sees a fool. A truck driver is a ring of true truck drivers. First, the minister questions (the chief investigator tells the minister that he (minister) is not sure if he believes God created a human being or that a man created God. Only a doctoral degree plays a zombie. The secrets they have in the port are suitable for their character but the face of death is reacting as real people. <br /> <br /> Film is a warning about the dangers of unrestricted surveillance from the government, the film is not exciting enough because it is exciting as a scientific exercise with philosophical foundations.
