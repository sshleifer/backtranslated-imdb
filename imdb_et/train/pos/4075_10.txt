Shovel: The castle sky is a bomb. The message is as strong as its newer work and cleaner, fantastic and flying pirates, how it would be better! The art is absolutely amazing and the soundtrack that is repeatedly used (im not sure if it was the first time I heard it) and I get the most emotional sentimental response to any soundtrack in the film. Sheeta, the woman's leader in this movie is absolutely fantastic and boy, Pazu is also a great role model - she lives by herself! The plot is a classic Miyazaki. I'm not giving it away, but the end is really great. I consider this one of Miyazaki's three best Nausica and clergy strangers. You can also check out Howl's moving castle when it comes out (sometime next year I hope) If you like Miyazaki, check it out for any US available. Enjoy, Piper A
