First of all, I would somehow remember this movie in my early childhood, I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I like this concept. If you can't stop at least part of your adult skepticism and have your inner seven, you might want to avoid an old movie. That is, having just seen a restored 137-minute DVD, I have to say that I enjoyed it, though not as much as I was seven (I remember the end). <br /> <br /> There are movie values ​​that deserve criticism, both having the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes of both really comical moments, my favorite is the contrast between the scenes that worked within the last 10 minutes, and the curious choice to support music ( listening to songs). <br /> <br /> The action film focuses heavily on the personal stories of certain soldiers and on the social dynamics of the crew, as the strain of these journeys takes their toll. At the end of the movie, I had decided that it was a good thing when seven, though “relationship”, was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> There are also many gratifying horrors for the action film. , especially a couple of epic battles between the Shogun soldiers and the Order. The filmmakers have ensured that as many deaths as possible would be bloody and let go of the face, humorous. I thought it was a great view of the movie when I was a kid, and I'm not ashamed to say I'm still doing. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that today's soldiers generally don't spend the movie with the egg shell, trying to avoid changing the time concentration of space, having heavy caliber machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, tank and helicopter, and they are hell to change feudal japan own. What I would like to think is that all powerful IMDb users would do their boots. <br /> <br /> In short watching movies, the viewer regrets that movies with similar assumptions are no longer and at the same time offer some clues as to why GI has such a film Samurai is so unique.
