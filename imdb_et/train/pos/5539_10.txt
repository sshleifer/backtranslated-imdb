When I first watched this movie, it was a recorded copy and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still have a tape, and I testify that I watched it more than once from start to finish! Film is a very low budget and dialogue is often inadvertently amusing! I've got some of my friends to watch it, and we have terribly big laughs. The film is about a couple, (I remember that it's like the beginning of the 70s, so they're too clean a man!) Who will go on a camping trip over the weekend that I believe was supposed to be NY. They have a great fun after catching and eating fish, and the girl dies and eats the fish! The boy goes back with something funny about how they ate the fish, and now it was part of them and he goes; "And that's a beautiful man!" Hard man, really hard! LOL! Anyway, come a few Vietnamese veterinarians, one of whom plays the flute, I believe. (In any case, they are musical companions!) Girls are clearly attracted, and when the couple turns out to be more unfriendly, they terrorize them at night. The boy gets into the chicken cream and has to look at how the two girls are exhausting their girls. In fact, it seems at night that she is pretty beautiful, and when the morning arrives, the boys and the girl and the man leave. The boy is said to have learned how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a damn good smile! It won't make me entertain anyway! If I could find and replace my old tape copy on this DVD, I'd buy it again, it's a classic camp! You have to love this stuff!
