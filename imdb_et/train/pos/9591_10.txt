Great document. I personally remember this growth in NYC in the early 1980s. This movie is for anyone who wasn't there during this time. This shows that the African American Gay Underclass felt that it was only theirs and that the love and camadrie you see are real. People are real and, unfortunately, there are few of them at the time of writing. The balls are still in place, but not as far as they were in the nineteenth. This time has forever disappeared. This is a good "gay thug" movie. When Queens was really proud they were extroverted. Farewell to Storyville, this is another era, but he documented all the hail films!
