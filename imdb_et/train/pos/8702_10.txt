She was a boy in the world and was alone. They were both alone, because the boy was a gift and a curse in one package - he was able to take the sword out of his hand. This "gift" was always caused by a wound in his wound - a deadly wound in his body. First of all, he constantly kills a drunken father who hurts his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his true father. Just as easy as all the time for a superhero - he comes to justice .... but society decides that justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is really right, because Hollywood movies don't like the character not trying to kill anyone - Sasha (he is The main hero, acting Artem Tkachenko) kills, as a person who, in his opinion, deserves to die, but receives accusations from the authorities and runs. In such a blow to the authorities and the mafia, he meets a girl (Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else needs to be looked at ... not to say. Note that this movie is more about feelings and emotions than about action. This film is full of the main character and his vision of life.
