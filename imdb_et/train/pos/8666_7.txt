Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-profile mobster who turns to the police or illegal gambling (for reasons that are unclear to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thug who visits the pool pool and spends his free time on jealousy to Frankie. Being in the right place at the right time, Tony Frankie is arrested and sent to jail ... where they make a bond that may not be friendship, but is doing it now. <br /> <br /> This movie was called "Frank and Tony", which is a disappointment because I see an alternative name "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony" that would have helped to sell the film more effectively. I assume it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry," but what do I know? I looked at it just after the second Italian criminal "Violent Professionals" and I have to say that these two are very complementary. a real shame on this movie. It's considered a "grinding house" movie that unfairly puts it on b-film (or worse). A cleaner sound and picture could have been a Hollywood hit, I suspect. I found this story very interesting, characters (and actors) better than average, and unlike "violent professionals", the plot is pretty clear - not too many secondary signs. <br /> <br /> Movies you should try. A movie about violence from Italy (how much do you want?) There is as much as you can ask. Of course, this is not "Godfather", but it shouldn't be. It's not drama, it's a light comedy, a serious friend movie ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from a bad boy's perspective. Well, okay, not really. <br /> <br /> If this is nothing else, this movie made me look for other director's films and principles. Films other than "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and regular cult movies. What's more fun than discovering a lost classic?
