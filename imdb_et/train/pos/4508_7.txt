I was impressed by the beautiful photography of this film that was shot in the Alaska area. Although we see technically melodrama, we see many activities related to Eskimo, such as hunting, dancing, igloos, etc. And their practices, such as visiting a woman's visitor, are routinely a story. Hunting was sometimes equipped with film material because animal back projects were easy to detect, but even they were exciting. Hunting for salmon, seaweed, caribou, and even hockey and whales sometimes seemed like a documentary. There was no cast list that strengthened the documentary taste. The filmmakers tried to feel it very authentic, with the native speakers speaking only in the Eskimo language, which someone translated to the screen or title. In the introduction it was said that unless the white traders and the King's Canadian police were not participants in the film, it was not strictly true. Two of the leading characters played by Mala and Lotus Long were the Eskimo birthdays, but there were professional actors who had credits for earlier films, and you sometimes saw that they had makeup. But they were great in their roles and had a Hollywood career. All in all, the movie is definitely worth a look.
