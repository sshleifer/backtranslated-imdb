I must say that this film has given me a double personality. I have said again and again that SHUT UP and I will talk like a normal person. But it is very difficult ... not wang. Did you find this nasty and disrespectful? Well, get a lot more mood. This movie is just messy! This is not a movie to show to your grandparents, but you should show it to a teenager or an immature man in his workplace. Anyway, back to voice commands. Fortunately, there are some Ladies Man on this site (did anyone in the studio notice that there should be an apostrophe (?) Between e and s), so you always have little to say to your boss or police. I have a wallet page.
