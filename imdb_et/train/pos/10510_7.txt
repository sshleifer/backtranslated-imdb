This is OK customization but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally fine, but I found Jeremy Northam wet rather than Knightley, especially when compared to Mark Strong in the television version. Gwyneth Paltrow is OK and his English accent is pretty good, but again I preferred Kate Beckinsale's Emma. Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson have excellent support. <br /> <br /> The script is often laughed too much, the book is comedy, but there are too many pins here, and Frank Churchill's subfield is almost completely missing. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is landscape. It's too lush. England has never been so. It looks like it's a chocolate box. Only Americans would do that. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, I enjoyed this movie, but I would recommend more TV adjustments.
