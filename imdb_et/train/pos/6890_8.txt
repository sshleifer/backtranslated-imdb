It was one of the half-forgotten seasons of ST: TNG before they "grew" or grew for the third season and beyond. It was not only an exhibition for pilots like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but also searching for data for his "humanity", this time through comedy. Still one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> In the side note, I am still disappointed that the actress whose Okona character was ready (after the character of Teri Hatcher) has no credit until Worf routinely interrupted her. I remember seeing this episode "for the first time" back from my comic book store and we all thought he would have been the perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beautiful lady really is ...
