I really don't know what people are against, but it's definitely one of my favorites. It's not preaching, it's not endorsed by morality, it shouldn't be controversial. It's just God. Every possible God, regardless of religion. And it's really funny. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays the television reporter Bruce Nolan, who is usually on the light side of the news to desperately prove himself (more or less) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job of anchoring. This ride has slowly driven off his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the last shoulders are over, he can't laugh quickly but screams before God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce will make his life better for himself until he is guilty of helping others, where he then misses his point of authority. Meanwhile, her constant excitement for her life makes her selfish, leaving her relationship on a dangerous surface. <br /> <br /> OK, it was a bit long. But as a plot, it works well. Step by step, as we meet God's challenges, is much better than concentrating its problems and being able to hide quite well. <br /> <br /> As you probably know about this movie first, Carrey's pitch-perfect still works (which is luckily for him) and controls and gives the scene a scene in the scene. Whether they admit it or not, it was written or written for Carrey only. Without him, humor would become flat because humor is half filling. And humor is very good first. But without Carrey it seems like it's a wonderful life. Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some say, she is not the only one for the third act. At least, you don't think when you see him. She gives a heartfelt report and forgets that you are watching a movie, she and Carrey are really a couple. <br /> <br /> In the film, it seems that the ggoooood (see the movie) is a very nice feeling, deals with an idea that is better than expected and better than ever, and should never be called to save Carrey's career (which wasn't everywhere) .).
