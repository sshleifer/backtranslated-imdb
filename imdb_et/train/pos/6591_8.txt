An invisible man is an exhibition that everyone must love! It reminds me of the special effects of the old school 80 series (a-team, airwolf, knightrider) are small but very effective! but the most important thing is the fun they shot in this series. It really shows! The whole cast is perfect for roles there and it seems they can do what they want! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca looks like this! for me it is incredible that an actor with so much sarcasm is his style of action. Don't get a big movie (Mr. Tarantino, this was an example that should have been directed! Instead of this great eternal serious threat) Get this show if you can. well worth it!
