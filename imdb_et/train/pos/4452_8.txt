Don't let naysayer get this. This is a wonderfully horrible movie. It was a thesis project by a writer / director JT Petty. He did an excellent job of having my seat on the edge. I never knew what to expect, and for the outrageous horror movie mover it's Nirvana! The film concerns an elderly man living in a log house isolated in a forest. One day, does he feel his cat in the forest looking for a child murder or doing it? He agonizes the rest of the film. For this movie, it is most unusual that there is no dialogue with the latest scenes. I found it interesting. The writer can get her senses and give them a relentless tug. Let this movie go, you won't be disappointed.
