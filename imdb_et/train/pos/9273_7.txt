In Iran, the Islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people continue to live their lives, usually just what you expect, such as football matches, to compete with a national team because it is rolling to become a world championship. Except women, you must not play at the football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> A funny little movie often follows a small group of women caught in a football stadium and a small eternal group. soldiers assigned to guard them inside the pencil just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to rejoice in the team (there is nothing subversive), and the little human touch on the lives of everyone, adds a rather subtle comment to humanity and ideology. br /> Amateur acts, good script and dialogue, really enjoyable movie. Knit it like Beckham, sort of - warm heart and joy in people's daily interests and pleasures.
