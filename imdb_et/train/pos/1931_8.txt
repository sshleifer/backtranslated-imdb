The Connecticut community pool is under the "radar" that is charming, funny, fun and attractive. Although it won the awards for major film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not released for the US theaters of theaters, but was distributed in DVD format and was selectively shown in theaters. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that "Big Bad Swim" was never a leap of Hollywood release marketing, given how much Hollywood released this year, such as "I know who killed me." "The Big Bad Swim", a really good independent film, had to swim upstream. <br /> <br /> However, in The Big Bad Swim, actress Paget Brewster is a loving and believable Amy, a wired point math teacher who not only spends her husband but also loses her job, and ends up playing a new life . TV Soap Actor Jeff Branson - who is HOT - plays Noah, a serious, vulnerable swimming instructor who goes to the length of the pool to help his students overcome their fears and discover that he can learn from his students. Pretty, sexy Jess Weixler (did I see her in the bank for commercial use?) Play Jordan, who is swimming, working in two jobs, one is not a dancer, the other is a blackjack mediator. His character is a catalyst for changing the ensemble, but it is the least understandable of the characters because there is no "feedback" or motivation why he does what he does. Jordan is young enough to still live at home with a widespread, video camera-accurate younger brother who laughs at him. However, it is not shown that his parents are in some way connected with their lives, which seems strange. There is no drunken mother or abusive father here to explain why an ordinary, attractive girl from the suburb of Connecticut would decide to be self-regulating, not a dancer who is debating himself to a lousy bachelor. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that "Big Bad Swim" succeeds, largely because it is a happy, good movie. <br /> <br /> As one might expect, swimming learning is a metaphor of life. Ultimately, it is better to jump with both feet and go swimming rather than sit on the deck because life will happen to you anyway. <br /> <br /> Big Bad Swim is a great date, a great dormitory, a great "what I haven't seen" movie, and men like women.
