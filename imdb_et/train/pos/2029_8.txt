As a horse lover, this movie can only be judged. There are a few movies that show the horse as it is. I would like to know if Brian is driving himself in the movie. I would also like to know if he has horses. Brian has been in many films where he has been driving. Where did he learn to ride? The only part I find difficult to do is that the riding places are always sloping, as the horse gets full of steam forever. Camera-work is first-rate and captures horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on the horse. It would be very interesting to know how they took this movie to find all the great riders.
