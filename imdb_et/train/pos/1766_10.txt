I got a free passport to preview this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. The premise seemed stupid and I assumed it was a lot of fun and fun humor. What a big surprise. I laughed so hard that I called some jokes. This film must be visible to anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK ..... this is not a movie that goes to your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or small children. The language is dirty, jokes are (very) coarse, and the sex call is about as graphic as anywhere. What's amazing is that the movie is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved it. Steve Carell is terrible, but (like the agency) the movie is actually a movie. All the characters have their drawbacks, but they also have depth and attractiveness. Everyone pulls their weight and chemistry is perfect. I can't wait to get a DVD. I am sure it is there for repetitions of Office space and for quoted lines.
