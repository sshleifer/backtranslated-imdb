Having just "welcomed home" my 23 yr old daughter from year in iraq, Camp Anaconda medical aid unit, I felt compelled to have this DVD. I wanted to hear other returning vet feelings to try to better understand his mentality on arrival and didn't wait until something bad happened. Regardless of your war and peace, this film is the beginning of all Americans to begin to improve the emotional emptiness of our returning veterinarians. The primary statement of the entire movie is the "Do Action" issue. Incredibly emotional film. I would recommend this movie to veterinarians for the whole mature family and would like them to follow the plan to listen to comfort to help return to the Persian Gulf Permanent Freedom Veterinarians. <br /> <br /> Fast forward about a year later and My daughter has seen this DVD. He took into account his emotions and has undertaken to restore it for another 6 years. The time spent in his sand is that he did good. Local Baladian children received first-class medical care for a variety of common medical conditions that were usually not available free of charge with the sender and the translator. His vision of his shoulder on his Iraq tour was. "We've changed a few hearts and minds there" Excellent DVD that you need to open and see all sides
