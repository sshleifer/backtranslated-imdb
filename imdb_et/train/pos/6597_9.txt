We always watch American films with their special emphasis on each region (South, West, etc.). Here we have the same. All foreigners have to watch this film and have to accept an open culture, and it is almost dominant in the American and European cinematographic industry. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about a parallel world that's not for those living in a big city like São Paulo. All participants are improvising and they are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their confused world, the loneliness of every character and invites us to share our world. <br /> <br /> It's a really great movie and even the worst rent at home.
