They are a true and lasting friendship with each other and everyone would be willing to sacrifice their life for another. Gunga Din also wants to be a soldier, especially the Bugler, but he can never achieve that rank because of his subordinate social status. But the heroes are not made according to their social powers, they are made to sacrifice for the greater welfare of others. Gunga Din tries to prove her strength at every step, but does she ever get the rank she is so passionate about? .... "You're a better man than me, Gunga Din!"
