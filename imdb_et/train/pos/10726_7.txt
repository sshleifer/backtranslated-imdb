To my surprise, I enjoyed Spacecamp, I remember it about 13 years ago and recently hired it again. I was quite impressed. Obviously, in today's space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, special effects are much better than SpaceCampis. However, this film had a story - a very stereotypical story of the eighties, where you could almost hear the next dialogue. But that's what I liked it - they don't make such movies anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson early, Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw added the substance to a light and fluffy plot. Definitely a robot called Jinx, it was very cute, but unfortunately he had more emotions than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed in NASA's space camp in Alabama.
