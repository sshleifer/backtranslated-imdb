Sex Bender in Limerick: <br /> <br /> Man or Woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out that "it" is both. <br /> <br /> Sleeping while sleeping <br /> <br /> Then they went all out in one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great Season 1 episode. I enjoy it because the story is one where you are never sure what will happen next. This is completely original. Teaser is very fun for eye closure and reflection of disco lighting. I really need to learn that the thumb trick that a sex family does. I really like the atmosphere of Kindred's small village and Mulder and Scully in the middle of the night. Its very exciting. This is one of my favorite Season 1 episodes. I think the thing I like so much is how they turn out to aliens and left to the crop circles. Many people see it as an alien episode of mythology, such as "Unnatural" or "Space", but I think it can be easily seen as mythology. Maybe there was a family like an alien bounty hunter and it may seem like someone else. Ah? Anyway, I'll give an episode of 10 out of 10.
