Of course, it was funny and pointless and sometimes dirty, but at least filmmakers didn't try. While most TV movies are bordered by the mediocre, this film actually has some redemption features. For cinematography, cinematography was pretty good, and Viggo Mortensen shows Aragon colors in a film about a man playing his rules. Most rebounds were sort of cheesy, but the mountain lion was a scene. I was annoying about Jason Priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock attack, but then again it's TV MOVIE! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was terrible. However, it was nice to see that Tucson, Arizona, is prominently featured in the film.
