Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that everyone can feel compassion for. Although their house was dirty, it is somewhat understandable given their mental illness. On a bulletin board, the poster said "Little Edie has eight years of coping skills." It reminded me of the dramatic 2009 version of Big Edie telling Little Edie: "If you're stuck, it's just for yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, a firm belief in their opinions and actions. Maybe if Little Edie himself wasn't that hard, for the first time things didn't work, he lost his hair, work and love for his life, he would have done it. It is somehow related to what I believe is his mental disorder: his inability to raise himself when the times are tough and to see good times ahead. The world never knows what happened when he didn't listen to his mother's claim, "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> But these understandably insecure women can somehow be brilliant, heartbreaking and lovable, even in their very dirty home. These women were extraordinary, and communicating with each other brings humor and sadness. When Edie had one of his emotional malfunctions, living on what might have been or how he wanted to get out of his home because he feels like a little girl, he gets an intense desire to hug him and tell him "everything is going to watch out okay! "<br /> <br /> Great Documentary !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
