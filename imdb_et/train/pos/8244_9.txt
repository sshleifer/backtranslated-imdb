I loved it! What do you dislike? You have your suburbs, you have zombies, you have your own family issues, you have your own social dilemmas, you got one fine in the Retro-1950s-style meat-eating class kept by the bay. Information on whether they are the following. You couldn't ask more. <br /> <br /> Cast is great. Carrie Ann Moss is an absolute perfection as a debut of the housewife of social climbing. He is both deliberate and criminal. Every man's dream. It's really great if the son just tries to be as normal as this nightmare exists and somehow succeeds. He's a real screen presence. Very photogenic and natural. Without mentioning all of them, the rest is great. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious police with gigantic instincts and might as his daily person. Billy Connolly is happy as Fido. Exquisite actor: I wish he played the title role in "Braveheart" with Gibson. My idea is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the actual reality. His Fido is there, but available. Nice touch. In short, a great and wonderful satirical poison for morality, values, social erection, feeling, growth, coping with precarious times, and compensating for impossible conditions. Real reality.
