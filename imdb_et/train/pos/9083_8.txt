I liked this movie and I had a very low expectation because I read the negative comments before. I went because I was curious about what all this noise was like, because some posts were so angry with this movie and Korean. Oh, and this is Korea, who has put some of my favorite movies. I liked the host but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi / fantasy movies, so you have a sense of taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil Series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> It wasn't confusing as everyone said and the monsters seemed good and the battles were great. The story contains some holes, but it's not really important. I remember such things and stopped asking why long ago when I see summer blockers. The Korean legend was interesting, things of reincarnation were different, and I thought the main characters suspiciously dressed as actors for Korean actors. Ethan's (Behr) hair saw Asasiana. <br /> <br /> Yes, it may be better and I hope that in the future, Korea, with its extraordinary sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
