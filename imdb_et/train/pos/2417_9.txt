"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen. Of course, this is a small budget, but it is a non-stop comedic tour de force. There are many memorable quotes. For example, if her upcoming father asks her how much she earns, Candy says, "Oh, I'm pulling under thirty ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh, of course, it's a candy delivery that sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy is also a fun filmmaker. The clip from his horrible low-budget movie "Kung Fu U" is on your run. <br /> <br /> So if you are a candy fan and want to forget about a forgotten pearl, I can't recommend this movie enough.
