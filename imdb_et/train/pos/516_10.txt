One of the few best movies of all time. The change of black and white to the colors of heaven and earth was the director's excellence. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely clever, the complete film leaves you puzzled by all human hours and does not discriminate against the war movie. I had to see this movie more than any other, and I never tire of it. This is a film that makes you question about your mortality and beliefs that happen after our death.
