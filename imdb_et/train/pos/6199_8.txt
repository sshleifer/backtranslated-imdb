Like a person who has seen and followed Hartley's public work for many years, I think that much of what has been said through true stories has risen to hidden philosophical mind games. <br /> <br /> Although fun, Fay Grim is the second to enter Henry Fool's mindset, where the film reflects the quality of the object inside the film. Henry Fool's object is memories ... Fay Grimis is an object of encrypted memories - which is stolen, falsified and mutated into something so hidden that it doesn't really make any sense - that is, writing and filming the script process in today's era - where most drag and drop movies are a bit more than the past. It's a philosophical sense of Fay Grim's question. Perhaps it is a tragedy that the shock is now a clich√© and boring (as the scenes in the publishing office suggest). <br /> <br /> Considering that many do not understand the importance of Henry's character and the memories he is looking for. Henry is a thin, veiled devil who for the first time visits Simon as today's Faust, and so on. Without realizing how tragic Henry's character is, Fay Grim has lost the plot and the quality of the story. <br /> <br /> Enough "details" expressed as verbal feedback - Knowing the Henry Fool plot can't compare the quality of "feel" characters, as did Henry Fool, and so I think someone who walks into this movie is about 10 minutes "so what" answers to the highly constructed dialogue and then that's it. <br /> <br /> But Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley movie until I realized that it was bad - frustrated and infected - precisely because Henry Fool's confessions were bad ... not only dirty and not dirty, but inevitably broken. Henry can't even be the right frog - and maybe it's a tragic mistake that makes him the most pleasing ... as in Gollum Tolkien's work, Henry is merciful. <br /> <br /> It doesn't come together with Fay's Grim, though Henry's dialogue is great. What has come across is that the whole movie is built into encryption - shaping some other plot around it that comes to another bad story that adds henry confessions. This is an interesting twist, but what can't really be cut first without the first movie. Perhaps Henry would have shown more earlier than the publisher would have described the main story of the first film - although this plot is not really what the first film was - unless perhaps there is one random observer. <br /> <br /> Part of encryption? It's hard to say ... a little disappointed about sex games. Cheesy.
