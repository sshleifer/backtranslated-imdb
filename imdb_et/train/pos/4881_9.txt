"Kaabee" depicts a woman's difficulties during the Second and Second World Wars, raising her children alone after her husband was imprisoned for "thought crime." This film was directed by Yamada Youji, and as it was hoped, the atmosphere of this film is really wonderful. Although the historical correctness of a scene, especially the beach scene, is suspect. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is absolutely incredible. I am amazed at how they managed to collect the stars for the 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, Japan's most beautiful yet active actor, undoubtedly fights more individual prizes for her results in this film. Shoufukuei Tsurube also supported her role very well. But it was Asano Tadanobu, who gave the most impressive result, perfectly depicting his character and difficult situation. <br /> <br /> Movies with a pre-war movie aren't my thing, but thanks to wonderful leadership and action, the story was completely absorbed. Nor was it a long-awaited mess, like "Yuunagi no Mach, Sakura no To", and explores the controversial and sensitive issue that occurred during this period of oppression and brainwash in Japan. Excellent movie, recommended for all viewers.
