Imagine that I missed this big cultural event last night on Swedish television, and only because my girlfriend called for the TV to turn on (to make it easier to fall asleep!) That I got there (yes I had seen an advertisement for it before, but of course forgotten about it and waiting for "early evening" ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway - this must definitely be a rather unusual idea - creating a movie about a documentary interview that has been done over 30 years ago with sound. But with an animated film and other documentary film, this really adds a good and understandable portrait of one of the most respected literary artists of the 20th century - Georges Remy or Hergé. <br /> <br /> I will definitely read my Tintin albums with different eyes after seeing the movie that makes it easy to combine style variations and combine different times of content in Hergé's life (and I can tell you that I'm getting a little that I'm not doing ). Of course, my understanding of albums has changed for more than 25 years, which I've already read, and my opinion of which albums are my favorites, but it adds (at least) another dimension to them.
