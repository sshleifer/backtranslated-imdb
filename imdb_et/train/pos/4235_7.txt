.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappears from me !!!! What happened to the old Burton who read Frank Miller's "Dark Knight Returns" as a study to prepare him for Batman's leadership in 1988-89? From this perspective, Burton did not investigate the book or the film that caused everything WRONG! This movie sucks! It is not as good as the original and it does not deal with the same topic as the original. If you want the monkey to be good, check out the original. <br /> <br /> ** ****
