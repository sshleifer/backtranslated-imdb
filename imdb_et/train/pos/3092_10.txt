You probably already know it, but you can watch 5 more episodes on ABC.com that you never have. I've been watching a lot of television over the years and it's probably my favorite show. It is a crime that this beautifully written and acted exhibition was canceled. Actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlosit, Mae, Damian, Mom and Omg, Steven Caseman - all these roles are incredible and so natural. Even the kids are big. Wonderful show. So sad that it's gone. Of course, I mean the reasons for canceling it. I won't let myself believe that Mrs Moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it. That was the perfect time for this market. I've been watching all episodes again on ABC.com - I hope they all come out of the DVD one day. Thank you for reading.
