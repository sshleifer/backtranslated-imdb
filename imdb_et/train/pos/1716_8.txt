Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and welcomes him "Hello Sister" !!!. This sets Shivam Nair's remarkable debut film tone. Never, a middle-aged girl has run away from her home in Nainital and has come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan does not leave Soh, alone and alone in a bad world. . Abhay, the lower class side of the world, turns to the Protective Soha and helps her get a job and shelter in a retirement home. Slowly the romantic is booming and never agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan enters Soha's life. This well-designed film has moments that will remain in memory forever? uncomfortable first kiss and abhay's quick excuse; Abhay describes Never as a "class wali lady" and hurriedly "that he does not love him"; her gift to Churidar Soh and asks her for a date. <br /> <br /> The music is great and the background music is great. The soundtrack disappears in the soho where Soha radiates and covers Abhay. Quietness creates both discomfort and affection. Must see that I appreciate it 8.5 / 10
