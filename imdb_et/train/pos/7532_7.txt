New Batman adventures (also called Gotham Knights) take place 5 years after Batman's last episode: Animated Series (B: TAS) and only 24 episodes. It's not a terrible show, but it's not as good as the original Batman animated series. I'll start with all the things I didn't find very good. <br /> <br /> The first thing, the animation itself: tall and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always bright red and orange, B: TAS did it too, but it was pulled over the dark palate whether the color of the sky was worse In this show, the color of the sky is too bright. It all looks like all other kids show and doesn't seem to be as unique as Batman: TAS did it in the dark and cool art style of Gotham. The art style is OK, but I don't remember Batman anymore. Each character consists of a straight line, a square and a triangle that makes the characters less human. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters look like drawn versions of real people. Animation can be more consistent here than B: TAS, but it is definitely not so good. Next: Some episodes seem too outraged and childish, but some are even stronger than B: TAS (two-face trying to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2 and some villains get pretty tough treatment). This leads me to the next point. <br /> <br /> Since this should happen in the future as well as in the final episodes of Batman's animated universe, many villains will meet their deaths or remain forever. Poison Ivy will probably sink into a cruise ship explosion; Two-Face kills almost Penguin, Killer Croc and himself so he has moved to Arkham forever; Joker gets into the industrial plant's exhaust pipe (although he will return to the animated series of the fair league later); Catwoman moves to France after leaving Batman etc. Just because the series ends, it doesn't mean they have to get rid of some big characters! The motifs of roses are also pretty bad. Missing! B: In TAS, we find out that these villains are tortured and their lives are destroyed, so they act as they do, in this show, the criminals are just a crime to go on with the story. It's like Batman just doesn't care about saving what peace of mind is in the people he's fighting, he just wins them useless. This Batman is a colder and more meaningful version of character, but since he has been doing this work for years, I see why he is so harsh. <br /> <br /> Next, character patterns have been redesigned: they are terrible. Gordon cut about 100 pounds ... is he sick? Many villains see STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc). Although I think some characters look better (Bane, scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is about the same and Ivy (who is even hotter) has light green skin. <br /> <br /> The series, which has many bugs, has some episodes big - over the edge, mad love, don't keep the hump Girls night, old wounds, legends of the knights of darkness, and never fear is my favorite in my opinion. All cross-linking marked with the Superman animated series, Batman, were great. <br /> <br /> The absolute part of this show is how the creators say they love this series's animation more than the original. In the original Batman animated series of DVD features, they talk about how proud they are of artistic style and how complicated some of the characters were, but they managed to succeed (for example, the complicated animation needed to animate Clayface). According to the new Batman Adventures DVD features, the creators basically say, "Hell with B: TAS, this is a fresh, new vamp, it looks better and we love how we BORN!" (Okay, that's an exaggeration). When the creators surprise you with the amazing art style of B: TAS, which is very irritating to me! <br /> <br /> This is not a bad show, but I still don't like the original animated series. At least this exhibition doesn't speak to its audience, so I thank it. Although some episodes of this new series are fantastic and look. <br /> <br /> Superman: Animated Series and Justice League: Animated Series is a great follow-up for Batman: the animated series and The New Batman Adventures, so give them time.
