If I didn't know it better, it would seem almost staged, but it wasn't. It was created perfectly and how they all got this material amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are well documented in this documentary and classic film. Only in the history of film material should it be POSSIBLE to see an American or a person dealing with the tragedy of September 11th.
