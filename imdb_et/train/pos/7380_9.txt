The three main characters are very well illustrated, especially the rock musician Anisio became the first actor of Paul Miklos. He is extremely convincing as a lower class attacker / intruder. The film shows the snowball effect very well, with increasingly shady business, contrast and similarities between lower and higher classes. How all the greed and ambition get away. 9-9.5 out of ten.
