My friends and I just discussed how disappointed we are with movies and especially romantic comedy. We feel insulted that Hollywood serves these days because they act like everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Well everyone is not well ... except for some bright spots like this movie. It has no big name links, no big budget, I don't think it would have a big edition (I rented a Hollywood video), it really didn't have what most of the big budget romantic comedy has. <br /> But it lacked most of them. It was a great chemistry between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story was not so much for us. The director took some time to get to know each other. Their story reminded me of some of my favorites, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> The supportive majority did not only include really funny comics, but also the depth of the story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely invaluable. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his associates at the Psychic Hotline was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed, shouted, I remembered how big it was to fall in love.
