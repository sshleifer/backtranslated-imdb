This movie is wonderful. It has always been always. I really mean what a better house maid is in love with. Walt really did it himself here. And music! A dream is a desire for your heart to be beautiful! What else can you say amazingly? I can't wait until the special edition comes out, it's so fantastic! I can't wait to hear all deleted songs! This movie is so beautiful and smart! It's cute. But cute mice too! I know I say the same things over and over again, but hey, this is a great movie! Woods was terrible in this beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie
