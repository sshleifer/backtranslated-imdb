Hey guys, <br /> <br /> I've been looking for all these movies and I can't find them anywhere in my local area. (I'm from Australia). Can you help me and tell me where I can buy it. At home, Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best films I've seen and are suitable for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie, which I was 5 and it's still when I'm a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie except my younger sister because I've been watching her get sick. I love this movie and I can't wait until I can buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
