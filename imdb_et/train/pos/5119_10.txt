I just have to say it's one of my favorite films. I can't even read how many times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolt, but the first time the camera put his body up after he was all shaved, looking for his first trip to Gilley, I was awe. As always, Debra Winger gives a perfect result to Budi's young, naive woman, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you are not a country music person I was not, this is one soundtrack that will sing to you with every word. If you get the chance, check out this movie - it doesn't disappoint.
