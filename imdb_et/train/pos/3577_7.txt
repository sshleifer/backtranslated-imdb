This film has probably never hit the radar screen, but it is quite good. It's pretty lifelike, but you think it's just a movie. Duvall and Close represent ordinary people, and you don't even realize that they are now big-name participants. It seems that this jerk jerk is too old for Eugene's girlfriend, but I think it's possible. It seems unlikely that the child will travel from Montana to Nevada himself, but I think that is possible. It may be thought that the family problems of this film will never happen in your family, but I think that is possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something you think your job is the hardest part of your life, but that's not.
