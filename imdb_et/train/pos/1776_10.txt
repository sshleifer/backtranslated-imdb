I hated the first episode of this exhibition ('Protesting Hippies') so much in 1999 that I was the other couple. But when it came to the Paramount Comedy Channel, I looked at it completely and, to my surprise, it was a lot of fun (motto: never rate a comedy series in the first week)! <br /> <br /> In 1969, Simon Pegg, "Ray Purbbs", editor of "Hippies", was edited by "Ray Purbbs", "Oz" underground magazine "Mouth". At the end of the 1960s, the youth felt unbelievable optimism that they could change the world through magazine printing, something nobody read. Instead of hippie naivety, Hippies is fond of it. era icons - "Hair", "Woodstock", "Graduate", even the infamous "Oz" of the early 1970s. Great performance; Julian Rhind-Tutt 'Alex' remembered Richard O'Sullivan's character "Man About The House. It's a disgrace that there were never other series, probably because of people like me. If you missed the Hippies, try it.
