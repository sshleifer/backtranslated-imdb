I'm fascinated (yellow) and I'm very frightened by companionship. I read numerous reports of its widely spoken contradictions and explicit sex. What I got was not that, but thoroughly thought provocative and inclusive film experience unlike others. I sincerely believe that most commentators who felt the film was "flat" or "boring" turned to the film as if it were pornography. Perhaps it is pornography, assuming that pornography is something that is meant for the uplifting of the senses, but it is intentionally erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws her all into her performance, giving her a realistic and humanity that is just convincing and enduring. Her breasts can be dirty, her nipples unusually large, her thighs fats and her face, chubby. But at the end of the film, the audience must agree with him and accept his mistakes as a human being. This touch gives him even greater credibility. If the director were a Briget Bardot bomb, this effect would be canceled. I can't recommend this piece of thought. Be prepared to think a lot about this deliberate film. Patient and effortless viewer is rewarded thoroughly in the way most other movies dream.
