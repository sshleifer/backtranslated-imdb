I love bad movies. Not only are they often as fun as "really good" movies (such as Pirates of the Caribbean and other Hollywood sins), but they are often much better than these movies. And that's why I love Italian robbery in the 1970s and 1980s. And that's why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians & Company. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato has made some very good films, such as the house on the edge of the park, and also his Atlantis Interceptors. and live like a cop, die like a man is enjoyable movies. But it's really bad. Barbarians are such an idiotic film. Peter and David Paul as the barbarian brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny because they have no charisma and no skill. But if they can't act, they scream and shout every time they do something important. From one scene, people try to hang the barbarian brothers and they flee very extraordinarily. <br /> <br /> Poor performance, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, in fact everything in this movie is bad. I can't describe how much I smiled when I first looked at it. Barbarians and companies are classic in the camp, everyone should see. If you thought the 9th Space Plan was a fun camp, it's a real killer.
