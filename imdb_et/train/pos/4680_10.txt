A small slow-motion terrain movie - gives him the opportunity to cook. The story is based on interest and complexity. The characters and storyline undermine the expectations and clich√© at the right moments. The great New York place - sharp, real - is a fantastic antidote to "Sex in the City" commercial demands - in fact, the whole movie is the HBO / Hollywood concept in New York, sex and relationships. It's a rare film that treats your characters so honestly and compassionately. LOVE YOU! Great cast of Steve Buscem, Rosario Dawson and his love interests (forgot your name!).
