Personally, this film falls on my top four. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself to be a master-storyteller again and again. Through such films as foreigners, abyss and both terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and trusted leader in both activities and science fiction. He sees the story and adds strange quality to the film. But the Titanic is so much different than its other shine shocks. The film is exceptionally touching and allows room for surprises, plot development and an interesting trait that everyone knows. The story of the famous voyager that is sinking on his daughter's trip is a legend, so Cameron was challenged to make a real, interesting and fun movie. The action is wonderful because Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, got it overnight with the release of the film, and in most movies I am annoyed if there are not many supporting symbols, but in this movie, this movie is more useful because As the Rose of the Elderly (Gloria Stuart) tells her story quickly that it is the story of Rose and Jack alone, no one else. Emotionally, it is completely satisfactory and does not leave a dry eye in the theater or at home. Music has become iconic and legendary. It is the best soundtrack of composer James Horner, which produces so many films and audiences. The song after such a long time has become annoying, but I still appreciate it for this phenomenon and it is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is a dialogue that is memorable, but badly, like how the cheese is in the dots, but everything is aside. James Cameron has given a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you off a lifetime journey. My heart does not go about it.
