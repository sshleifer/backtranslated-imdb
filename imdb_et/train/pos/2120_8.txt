James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play collaborators at a gift shop in Budapest who doesn't like each other without knowing they're really sweet to meet. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy that has been played by two pleasant stars and very enthusiastically supported by cast. The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (not quite sure how to explain it) that there are no movies today. This can obviously be compared to a recent recipient, and the original wins in every way. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see for every Christmas, I don't think the way to jump into the right Christmas is to feel like this little pearl.
