Maybe one of the few Canadians who didn't read the book in high school, I thought I'd add my comments. Not seeing the movie without knowing the movie. The characters have so much complexity that everyone can communicate with them in their own way. The shine of adaptation is that everyone is allowed to influence their own perceptions of the lives of the characters rather than to give them a spoon. You can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. The great performances of Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring characters. I highly recommend it.
