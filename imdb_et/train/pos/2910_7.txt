This is a great movie for fans of McCartney and Beatles! Everyone has a great time. Audiences (some celebrities such as Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) are as always, quite amazing: from small children to old fighters in the sixties. They know the words of all the songs from the heart, and some of them cry when Paul breaks "black city" "yesterday" "all my loving "and all his treasures in his catalog (who, apart from John Lennon and Dylan, can apply for such a repertoire?) There are two particularly moving moments: <br /> <br /> - Double respect for Lennon and Harrison, the first" here today " made a solo (the title was "war tow") in 1982 and was the best way to do that, then "something" when Paul uses the ukulele. <br /> <br /> The "Long and Breaking Road" handover, which is the main moment when Paul's voice breaks when he moves tears in the hearts along the travel team members hold the stage ahead. <br /> <br /> I remember in the early 1970s when people despised Paul because he was not involved in politics because his former partner was. They had to think of Paul because he is a dedicated artist: "Celebrity is a great cause for charity." The film shows different aspects of Paul's work, the artist who is something other than selfish.
