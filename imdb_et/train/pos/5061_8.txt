it is worth looking at, especially honestly with the nice twists of the journalist, you are expecting a great downturn, as Gray Owl is a scam, but it must not and generally adds an optimistic and uplifting theme and drama story and film. <br /> <br /> This must be Brosnan's best result to date, he convincingly impresses like an English boy playing Indians. A separate scene is a return? where Brosnan and two older female actors perform a wonderful scene full of nostalgia and a life that has disappeared with so little dialogue, expressions and good direction. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known, and the message is so universal, and all that is important is the real regret that this movie didn't get better recognition, maybe it could become a bit classic and sleeping over time. I hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
