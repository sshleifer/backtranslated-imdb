I see this movie at Birmingham South College in 1975 when it was shown with a red balloon. Both films are similar in their dream quality. Most of the movie means happily swimming in your bowl when your new owner, the little boy, is out of school. The cat enters the room where the fish and her bowl are, and she will suddenly linger on her "prey". The boy starts to go home from school and the viewer asks if he will arrive on time to save his friend. Fish shakes in the fish presence and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat runs fast to the fish, gently chooses with his paws and returns it to his bowl. The boy happily returns to his fish, no wiser. <br /> <br /> The end is amazing both in irony and in its technical complexity. It is hard to imagine how the director would have gained technical power in 1959 - this seems to be a trick in 2003. <br /> <br /> If you find it, look at it - you can't be disappointed! And if you find it, let me know that I will also get a copy!
