I just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45-minute ROLL. <br /> <br /> Roller is about boy, Mat (Toby Malone), who has dreams of becoming a Sport Star. The Mat travels to the city and he gets his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is tied to a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and supplies him. Needless to say, Mat pulls into the world of George. I thought it was great how Mat teaches George morals and respect, while George teaches Mati how to relax and enjoy life. Toby and Damien were well assembled and done a great job. <br /> <br /> Every movie character praised each other very well, two police were excellent. David Ngoombujarra brought a great comic to the film. Tiny played a pleasant gangster that reminded me of one of my favorite characters "Pando" in two hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things that Roll liked was that he introduced cities where I grew and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see the sights and attractions I grew up with, especially the old wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
