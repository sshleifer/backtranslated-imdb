I was ready for a market-based speech soap opera cum travel package, but I was delighted to have found a fast paced script, which is the basis for all the actors, especially Peter Finch, for amazing special effects, skipping and beautiful cinematography - there is even a Taliban recently destroyed majestic stone burst. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor's most famous and sympathetic before she gave her later hysterics that was her later work. All supporting players round it out and I don't know who taught all these elephants. <br /> <br /> Speaking of a stone-Buddha sequence, you can really see that it is Vivien Leigh's long frames. His shape and the way he moves is different from Taylor's. The only thing that has to do with this sequence is the poorly made processes where the background moves too quickly on the horses. <br /> <br /> If you want a sense of provocative movie that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with the Elephant Walk.
