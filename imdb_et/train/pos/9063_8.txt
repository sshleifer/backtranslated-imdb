It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rolling children. I felt that I should have become a NAMBLA member instead of a movie ticket. <br /> <br /> According to Thomas Rockwell's book, fried worms start to eat like every child's story: moving to a new city. The new boy, the fifth grader Billy Forrester was once popular but must start again. Making friends is never easy, especially when the only prospect is Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, who is 4 1/2 feet, is gigantic. <br /> <br /> The more complicated is Joe's bully. Her freckled face and sleeveless shirts are frustrating. He antagonizes children with the Death Ring: Crackerjack's ring, which is declared to kill you when you are beaten. But not immediately. No, the death ring releases a poison that kills you in eight classes. <br /> <br /> Joe and his evil ax greet Billy as he smuggles a handful of sneaky worms into his thermos. When Billy has discovered, he plays it cool, so he eats worms all the time. Then he throws them on Joe's face. Ewww! To win them, Billy reluctantly contributes that he can eat 10 faiths. Fried, boiled, pickled hot sauce, crushed and widespread peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is called an exotic name like "Radioactive Slime Delight", where the kids finally live in a living microwave oven. <br /> <br /> If you've ever met me, you know I have an uncontrollably cheerful laugh. I felt like a toddler hit a drunk that his "dirty dick" hurts. But fried worms are wonderfully disgusting. Like the G-rated Farrelly brothers, it is both vomiting and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Bob Dolman, writer / director, is also a meaningful storyteller. To raise wagers, worms must be consumed at 19:00. In addition, Billy has a dark secret: he has a hypersensitive stomach. Dolman also has a sharp perspective. With this precision, he relies on the uncertainty and tendency of children to exaggerate secular dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you hyperbolize this film, how your kids are doing their disappointments, you see that it's essentially a war. In the case of pre-war wars using the freedom fighter and the fighter, the boys pubertyed to learn a valuable lesson. International leaders can learn something or two about peace-building in the world from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was comforting when the two chaperonizing mothers behind me looked at each other and agreed, "That was a great movie." Great, now I don't have to legally register myself in the database.
