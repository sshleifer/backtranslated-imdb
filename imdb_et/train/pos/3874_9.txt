And I absolutely adore Isabelle Blais !!! She was so cute and very different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal", where she was rather a man-eater. I think he should have called Jutra. Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was much better, IMO. For the first time, Pelletier has done a good job and noticed that he paired his friends with Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharm. It was fun to see them in it, I didn't know they would appear. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've seen Quebec's romantic comedy that I didn't like, and it's as good as I had the pleasure of seeing. And if you're in the states and don't know how to get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca gave it to me in less than a week.
