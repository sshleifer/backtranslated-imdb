I rented a zero day from a local video store last week. I've never heard of a movie and I had doubts about it. Just looking at the box, I knew the film was an Indie movie and therefore the quality was smaller than the mainstream film. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day I started right away from the start. The film clearly followed the main lines of events at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how the two leading parties believed. For the first time I was watching this movie, I wasn't quite sure if what I was watching was the actual tapes behind the Columbine shooter. I thought I knew what I was looking at could not be real, but at the same time the actor was so convincing that she had to shake her head. <br /> <br /> Is the movie annoying? Absolutely! Do you see things that make you question the value of a movie? Probably. I think what most people are bothering about is that they actually have two main characters - Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is it problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre in their high school. I know for myself, I felt great sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy with them because their lives were so terrible. They had fallen so deeply through the cracks that they had begun a journey that could have stopped if only the people around them had realized their difficulties. Zero day is a phenomenal film. It gives you a close and personal look at the events that most of us see only in news. It leaves you thinking about the lives involved. And it leaves you puzzled by how people reach it. After a week of seeing this movie, I still mean it. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't seen a zero day, keep in mind: The movie is independent and low in budget, and the movie is made with video cameras. The film material is disturbing. It is not the mainstream of Hollywood and is not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can leave it all alone, Zero Day is a movie that will stick with you and just maybe help you open some eyes.
