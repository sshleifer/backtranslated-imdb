One of my best films, perhaps because I was in a punk scene at the end of the 70s and went to many hazel concerts, but the movie was a good story and a very good nut and up and coming Phil Daniels. definitely in your latest project Eastenders !! great results for many unknown participants who peel their eyes, see them in many UK soaps today exp: Carver out Bill, the more I look at them on the spot, well, if you haven't seen it at night with the video, don't forget to complain your nose and a hard-wearing black eye guard and shave your head in a Mochanian style .... Enjoy
