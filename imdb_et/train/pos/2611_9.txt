It has been widely watched in Australia as one of the best police dramas ever produced here ... and for my money everywhere. It's raw, sharp, the characters are real, the situations are plausible, and they don't abandon the darker life that police and criminals, victims, lawyers, and other people are exposed to in their various orbits every day. > <br /> This show lasted for 2 seasons and ended because the show didn't sell well abroad. We are sorry for this loss: however, like Fawlty Towers, we also get it as a limited-length series of consistently high quality.
