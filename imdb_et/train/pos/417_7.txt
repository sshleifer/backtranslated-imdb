This movie is Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays a bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you hardly recognize him. It was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together, and the next film that was made was basically the same, but at a different time. This film begins with the murder of Lincoln and also deals with the Indian War. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill is married and now wants to stay home. This film also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and I usually don't like Jean Arthur, but I liked it here.
