Can I be so simple and primitive in my evaluations that I just say, "I liked it"? It's reasonably funny, it got great stars and it's proud to look. The songs (there are about two, which are then repeated) are forgotten, but they are getting ironic treatment (like the terribly nice Mr. Fairbanks, which explodes the newly missed Wagner version, which has just been made by the supply ballad Miss Grable); Surrounded by 1861 crinoline surrounded by Miss Graber, there is not much dancing, and comedy can be a bit of a heavy hand, but the result is still uplifting. Photography (including real outdoor conditions that are thrilling) is amazing when playing with various lush gold tones. Miss Grable is a bit behind her main and plump side, but in this continental "old world" comedy it is still fresh and comfortable. It's pretty much down to Rita Hayworth's "Down from the Ground" and many tend to like it. So I think several people would think "this lady in ermine" is outdated and closed. But this is a fairy tale and in any case they tend to move a certain paste. My suggestion is - just enjoy the art, costumes, spiritual script, and everything else that this movie offers, and stop the complaint. The film has appeared on DVD in Germany with both German and English soundtracks.
