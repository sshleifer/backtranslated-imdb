People are too heavy on film. Sometimes we should just sit and enjoy the story without trying to review it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his target remains below. Then the fun begins when all of him "goes down". what this film requires. <br /> <br /> I think this is a great interpretation of what can happen. Although the story of EXACT for me has not been followed (here is Jim Maars' Crossfire reading in retrospect), but that's what's interesting. <br /> <br /> I would like to get this copy again. Today, Domino is right on the principle.
