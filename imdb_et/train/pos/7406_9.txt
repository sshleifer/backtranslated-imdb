This film deals with a very different topic. A simple and simple description of local Chinese practices, looking at the everyday public bath run by the old owner and his slow son when the older son returns home, mistakenly believing his father is dead. In addition to every conventional spa-like treatment, how each man in the city does their daily conversation, playing games, discussing personal things and getting honest advice. When an old man dies, strong and loyal family ties are responsible for older sons, so public bathing doesn't interfere. And finally, the arrival of modernization to end this way of relaxed hours and renting. The public bath must be demolished to build a commercial complex.
