For the first three seasons, Sabrina had a gem hidden to TGIF (and later at the beginning of the school day). Every episode had a maniac, a lively energy, and a quick fire that won a random uncomfortable joke. Melissa Joan Hart released an exceptional talent for physical comedy, especially in her facial expressions. His two aunts who played "straight men" or like two witches can be big comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a talking cat, could freely have some mad scheme he was interested in, and one might laugh and take it all because he was a talking cat. Sabrina's friends graduated from a social school with a typical "bad cheerleader" and "totalitarian principal." Probably the most interesting and unique aspect of the exhibition was the ability to incorporate pop culture (eg, age bands, Jerry Springer), people's archetypal status / morals (eg friendship, Christmas spirit) and literal representation of similar metaphors in magical areas. Unfortunately, like many other shows on TV shows, this exhibition has reached its peak in the first three years, coinciding with Sabrina's high school attendance. In the fourth season, the College started to move significantly with the overall quality of the show, especially when writers decided to introduce Josh as a Harvey rival and blame the sheer excuses for Aunts Hilda and Zelda to remain on the screen as key players. The last season when Sabrina was working in a pop culture magazine was unequivocally disappointing. Ultimately, Sabrina (especially college years) remains a unique entry with hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that raise the annoying ticket price produced in this genre every year.
