The perfect space for a fantasy movie. a group of children going in space randomly and must go back, but whether they do it for sure. It wouldn't be a family movie if they all die. Then it's all sad. You don't want Kate Capsaw, the leading lady to give the Golden Globe, but unfortunately she didn't get Lea Thompson. It sucks so bad. I can't say that enough, this movie is so big, Lea Thompson-lord, the perfect girl for this movie. This movie is definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is both overpriced and the space camp was so little appreciated. It should have been the other way around <br /> <br /> excellent 10/10-10r or 11/10. Iam is not good in math
