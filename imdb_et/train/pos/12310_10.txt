Just read the original story that Pu has written in the 18th century. Pleasantly, the film despises the original spirit very well, although the plot was changed enormously. Film language, rhythm, special effect are all from Hollywood, but still the heart of China. It's amazing how Hark Tsui was able to combine them. The result is pure beauty.
