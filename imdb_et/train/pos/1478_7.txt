I liked this movie, though halfway through, I can tell who was the secret admirer. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if it was based on a real story because he was talking about "real" people. at the end of the movie. I think I have to look into it and let it know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember what happened? I believe they moved to North Carolina if I wasn't wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, countries would have changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> You think this man could have thought of it as easily as I did. Was he stupid or what?
