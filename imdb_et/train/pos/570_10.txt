Embarrassed, I watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It's a story that every father or brother can be related ... one brother is a bit wild, the other brother is a typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a little older brother, but Pitt is amazing and Skerritt is a father. The fishing scenes shot at Montana are absolutely breathtaking ... I had no idea that the catch could be so attractive. The film closely follows the book, making only a few changes to make it more suitable for the film format. Unlike most movie story books, this is one. This is the perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet, night-time and somewhat emotional movie.
