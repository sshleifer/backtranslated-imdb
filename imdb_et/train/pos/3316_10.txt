Bette Midler is inexplicable in this concert. She gives her everything when she's on stage. Whether we're laughing at his jokes and worshiping or throwing our eyes on one of his huge ballads, Bette Midler moves his audience. If you don't see it alive (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. It is interesting to see how incredible his voice has changed and matured over the years, but never lost his power. His more "vocally correct" version of "Stay with Me" never disappears in the spirit of GREEN or DIVINE MADNESS, here it is simply cleaner and always cordial. I will respect this concert for a very long time.
