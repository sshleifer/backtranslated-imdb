I love this movie so seriously that I never see it. The only line I really can't get is when Riff calls himself a teenage lobotome, but nothing else, everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and it didn't help to hear that he didn't even know who Ramones was before he was in the movie, but I can't ignore him for the most part. Most people who watch it over and over are Ramones fans and really ... this is the only reason I love it very much. I'm never tired of seeing DeeDee interfering with her Pizza lines or Joey's confused teacher name over and over, haha. One of the best parts of the film is singing what you want to dance under the high school hall. I love it. A special edition on DVD is a good retrospective, surprisingly not on PJ Soles. Maybe he was working on another project * laughing * Anyway, great movie, even better than being a Ramones fan.
