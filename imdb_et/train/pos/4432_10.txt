I am pleased to note that I am a beautiful film mammal, and that the inventive movements and corners of the camera can be enough to keep my interest in a pretty long movie. Not one of Gojo's lengths, though he had some of the most remarkable cinematography I've seen since the Korean era MUSA. But Gojoe offers much more than just beautiful pictures (like MUSA ... does not mean contrast) - this is the second greatest strength that is great and an exciting story with some dark philosophy. I have to admit that I am pretty sure what the idea was to do, but that will definitely give some thought. Vague, but definitely thoughts: p <br /> <br /> One department where the film might have been better is action. There is a huge amount of bleeding in the film, but this action is filmed with hyperkenetic close-ups and objects in the foreground are often hidden. It creates some very intense and impressive visual images, but it would have been nice to see some real moves that would make it more credible that the crooks could just behave through the entire army that sheds waste on everyone. <br /> <br /> Film is definitely one of the most interesting and beautiful films I've ever seen. Recommended!
