The Zombie Chronicle is not something to talk about, it's not an obviously award-winning film, but it's a fun B-film directed by Brad Sykes, who led Camp Blood, another fun and low-budget flick. Action is bad as the cheapest films made, but it makes it more fun, zombie-make-up is cool and effective, especially for the budget, it's big and tough, the movie is kind of like a zombie version of Tales from Crypt because we get two stories that talk about zombie encounters in the woods are fun and leave you at first glance. Zombie Chronicles are much better than some low-budget zombie movies out there, if you love low-budget B-movies or cheap-made zombie cinemas, then check out the Zombie Chronicle.
