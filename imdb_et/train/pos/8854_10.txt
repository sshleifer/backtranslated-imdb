The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. The love of money leads to greed, which can lead to pride and ultimately destruction. Two brothers, Andy and Hank, discover how far they get paid and the ones they love the most. <br /> <br /> Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) were no different. Andy has apparently enjoyed the success of working in the New York real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife, Gina (Marisa Tomei), who is the idea of ​​a trophy wife when she ever existed. Hank, however, is the one who finds himself in favor of the ex-husband's grace, his daughter's expensive school bills, and the endless amount of child support. A man who means well and who has good intentions, however, cannot escape from the water he slowly lifted up over his head, no matter how hard he swims to stay over it. <br /> <br /> Andy, however, has his problems with his only difference between him and his brother, that he hides them better. He is disappointed with his company and is strongly involved in drug use to escape his fears. The pressure of his life and the lies he needs to keep his appearance have now led him to think of his escape to Gina to start again. Of course, he, like Hank, needs money for this and believes he knows how to get it. How? Robbing your parents' jewelery stores. This betrayal is where Hanson's brothers, their families and many other lives are destroyed by greed, pride and fear. <br /> <br /> Before the devil knows you are dead, this is the way the story is spoken. After the kidnapping and Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris), who is Andy's and Hank's mother, they are killed, the story is told from different perspectives from different days before and after the robbery attempt. We learn more about not only the motivation of Andy and Hank, but also the reaction of his father Charles (Albert Finney) to the death of his wife. The relationship between Charles and his two sons, especially Andy, is also being investigated, and after it is found that there is little love between the two men, another possible motivation is discovered. Nanette may be very loved by her sons, but their father has a different story. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once again why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood, depicting Andy not only as a greedy criminal who has no morals, but also in a controversial way with whom we get compassion. Ethan Hawke also brings Hank's life not only as a loser, but as a man just desperate to hang what he has left. Andy and Hank thus bring life in such a realistic way that they are easy to think of not only as characters, but also as very realistic images of lost and confused men who are now confronted with the consequences of their actions. <br /> Before the devil knows you are dead, there is a moral story of how our actions lead to consequences that we wouldn't otherwise expect. What's more, our choices can also affect people around us in ways we never expected. What should be the best picture of the year, we will see how life is easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate endeavor to alleviate our troubled life. In other words, there are no easy solutions or answers to our problems and finding them can make things worse. <br /> <br /> 10/10
