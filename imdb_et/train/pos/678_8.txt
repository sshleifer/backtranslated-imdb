Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE, is mainly an efficient cooler with an exciting story based on the aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain provides a good defense as a defender whose life is getting rid of reality, as he deepens the murder case of aboriginal tribal rivals. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects who does his best to guide Chamberlin through Dreamtime, an alternative reality / timeline that is central to local Australian history and tribal tradition. The difficult atmosphere, which is deliberately ambiguous in drawing, is based on the film's inconvenient finale, which is somewhat reduced by the bad effects likely to be caused by budget constraints. Nonetheless, an intriguing film remains, with the overall impression of the mystery and fear that lies in what we perceive as "reality", with you.
