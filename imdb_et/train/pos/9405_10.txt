Although Hollywood got stagnation a few years after World War II, England was a very productive film industry. The "white costume man" creates a suit for the inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) that never dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other businesses are probably out of business now! How can Sidney deal with it and maintain its dignity? This is an example of one great movie that Alec Guinness celebrated before Obi Wan Kenobi was born. This is a good look at the general absurdity of the business world. If you are planning to start any business, you might want to consider watching this movie.
