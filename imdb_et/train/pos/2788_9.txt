It's so-called feel-good movies, but it made me sad. Why? Because I had a talent, but my parents didn't allow me to study at the sports academy, as well as the fact that at the age of 12, I decided to finish the football. <br /> <br /> Football is a red line in this movie. Together with the struggle, young people have their parents' expectations. An English-Indian girl and her parents with her traditions and strong family ties, on the one hand, and an English daughter with her daughter on the other, dressed like a boy, and playing football ... a combination that worries her mother! This film also refers to the lives of ordinary people as well as to the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living one's life (where we heard it before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (Beautiful Women!) Play Yasminda, a girl who doesn't care about boys, new clothes, makeup and a typical 17-year-old girl. In contrast to her sister Pinky, fill Yasminda's opposite. <br /> <br /> A real need to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with her older traditions and finally finds happiness. With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as songs from India. <br /> <br /> Pleasant to watch, but if you, like me, ever played football and never did it, this movie will make you melancholic.
