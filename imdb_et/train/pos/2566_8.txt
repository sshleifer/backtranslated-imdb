All films that deal with positive bigotr, a movie that the current audiences should still see, because the story and morals of the story are always relevant as long as we have a world full of hope. <br /> <br Beyond this, the movie is really an old-fashioned love story .. The boy answers the girl .. The boys lose the girl ... The boy gets the girl back ... <br /> <br /> The weakest role comes late Kent Smith Lieutenant Lieutenant Webster (Riccardo Montalban is a close second) ... my question would be how he once became a 3-star general ... character with such a spirit in his presence as a husband and army, it's a miracle that they show him no respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a bit overestimated and some scenes have some holes, but generally I enjoy the movie every time I see it big. The red buttons are big ... I always love comedies in dramatic roles ... like in Button, a comedian can often portray a human tragedy as a more traditional d rabbit actor.
