This is a great, fast-paced thriller from Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street) who, in 85 minutes, sets aside a supernatural and gives us something more frightening - a human being. We are more likely to meet Jackson Rippner's benevolent evil as Freddy Kruger and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) do a great job of introducing a friendly, friendly and even charismatic killer. The performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, The Wedding Crashers) are excellent. Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is a small-scale activity, not a wide sweep of canvas, and it is less effective for these restrictions. Cinematic art is nothing special, although of course only so much can be done with the camera in passenger transport, but the dialogue is great, the story is tight. There are no distracting factors, no sub-block will help to confuse the issue of the battle between the main characters in his heart. Keeping your focus and avoiding confusion, Wes Craven is capable of taking what is very minimal and making it an exciting, fast-acting thriller.
