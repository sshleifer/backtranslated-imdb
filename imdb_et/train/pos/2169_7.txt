First, ignore the last person. They admit to falling asleep, so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was going on !!! Thriller / horrors go, this movie is not too bad, it is definitely very observable. From scenes that open directly, you get a general idea of ​​exactly what will be the cause of all the subsequent madness, and finally, that you are right when everything is clear. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, from time to time it was pretty creepy and it was satisfactory for old movies. Good look late night! I'll give her a bigger 7 out of 10.
