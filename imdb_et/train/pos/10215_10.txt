Most of the people who follow Audrey Tautou's films do not seem to be Amelie's character - this is not actually the real life of Audrey Tautou, so every movie she participates is not Amelie's Part 2, Part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said, I just received this movie because Audrey was in it. Yes, it is true, after the first scene there is a big gap where it is not for 45 minutes at all, but I couldn't even touch him because I had so much fun with other characters. A man who is lying about everything is too funny, a guy who justifies people who run out of his coffee shop and exposes a bill by looking for coupons and those that offset the damage, actually ... getting into all the characters here take quite some time, but that's one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The character of Audrey Tautou Irene is not a superfluous sweet girl whom Amelie was. In fact, like Irene, her insecurity about the bomb, who asked for change, was first a guard. In this film Irene is a good-looking girl, but during the (very dreadful) day her disposition becomes more sour and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie very big is all these really interesting stories and ... plots to watch, great landscapes and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all the characters can actually act. The best part of the movie is about 20 minutes away .... that is when all the plots begin to seduce and the ride really goes up and everything binds together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect flourishes. I swear, this was the best 20 minute movie I've seen for some time now, and the end. It made me think that "I was really successful in finding this movie". The end of this movie is the upper limit. Who has written this script is brilliant, because not only all of these other subplots are going, but somehow they all do (and in a reasonable way that is here), but also the knowledge of every character in man and in life, not just some people who are used crowded to build this whole butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie because it is a great movie to watch any time, any mood, any business or alone.
