This movie is real and casual. Nowadays it is very difficult to find such films in the clusters of Hollywood films. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought this DVD on Tuesday this week and I watched it 4 times. I love the accent of Pazi Spanglish, it's just very cute when she is. And his actor and Morgan are both funny and natural. <br /> <br /> The taste of my movie may be very different from others, but I have to say that I really love this movie, it's easy! <br /> <br /> I've learned more from this life (well, or at least from US life) ... life is really casual ... Sometimes you meet someone, they pass your life and watch your friends randomly, and u don't spend so much time with them, maybe for a while, but u enjoy it '' '' with them, and then u and they never judge each other again, but time u is unforgettable. Just keep those moments in mind as grateful and nice memories ... <br /> <br /> This movie can be a cheap price, but its meanings are not cheap. I rarely can learn anything from movies, but this is an exception.
