I liked Antz but loved "A Bug's Life". Money was put out for this animation. I'll definitely do it on DVD. By the way, Disney should record the widescreen version of this movie. (I heard talking about all the characters in a standard video file screen). Most must agree that the credits at the end were more fun! I only saw one of the two sets, but I can't see you!
