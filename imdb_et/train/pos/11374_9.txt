There are some excellent comments and comments on this movie. I was pleased to note the comparisons of Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the 50's abortion that is easy with David Wayne). The actual offender is not a tortured murderer (an exceptionally good Jeffery DeMunn performance) who takes his sexually frustrated hatred to his victims - mostly children. He's a goal. True villain is a bureaucratic bureaucratic system that drowns in its corrupt incompetence. Fear of a persistently devoted man (A series of his best roles in "The Crying Game"), easily pragmatic, ready to use the system (Sutherland always successful in such a role), hesitant, scared but confident psychiatrist (incomparable Max Sydow), prosecutor bumbous, boopous bureaucrat (brilliant Brit actor John Wood) and quietly supported researcher spouse (delightful supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one damn good movie. Its darkness and darkness is supported by a corrupt and incompetent system that works successfully. No need to dore the nerve sensation of gore-laden slices, which has characterized so many new films. Gore is here - it's a strange story - but it adds a depiction of a pathologically twisted person. The story was successful: it was the acts committed by a person like you or me. If you and I decide to let your frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo took your anger from our most innocent and vulnerable place, our children. The great prerequisite for this story is the excellent actor's excellent actors. - Yeah, I notice that our Australian friend didn't like the speech and would definitely have preferred to hear them in Aussie. Too bad. This exquisite film worked for me and everyone else I did.
