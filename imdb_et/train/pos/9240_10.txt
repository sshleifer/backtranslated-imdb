Found in this flip video store, it costs 2 dollars. The whole movie smells really bad! The so-called colonel who hero here, if the cover could have been trusted, must be in his eighties and hardly able to walk. However, he manages to shoot some of the world's most foolish noses. Then the story goes out of the colonial, which makes sense if the old man's inability to mention something, now there are two fearsome eighties men who have had some sort of story. I lost a hundred times, but don't mind because the movie is so bad that it's nice to watch. Zero Budget Trash, where participants have not deserved this name. Get it out!
