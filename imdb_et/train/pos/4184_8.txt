Some war films will succeed if others do not, and can be judged from different angles. A humanistic angle where you can feel the raw emotions (fear of attack, adultery of soldiers, difficult trials that people are fighting with them, etc.) are always movies that I find convincing. Movies such as Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies you feel with movie characters. <br /> <br /> This movie also succeeds at this level. It speaks of "Supreme Honor", and this honor does. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had the honor and it was recognized in a way that was totally incompatible with the western thought, but it is a true story to the end. Unforgettable movie. Based on the actual story.
