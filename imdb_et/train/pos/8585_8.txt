Involved, riveting story caught in the US Army turncoat who must prove his innocence to avoid hangman. Paul Ryker dismisses a friendly fire in a seemingly destructive attempt to convince the military court that he is actually a US spy on a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the classic courtroom dramas, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well-designed mystery led by a constantly prominent cast, director Kulik's constant momentum and effective plot twists. <br /> <br /> This film was originally made as a television film in 1964 and was then inspired by the presence of many "name" parties and sequences of action. Dillman, who reiterates his role, is a terrible, suspicious defense attorney, whose attentions sometimes err on a Ryker-supporting but somewhat farther wife, played by Vera Miles with aplomb. Rounding up the apron is a key supporting role for Peter Graves Prosecutor's Office and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Marvin Paul Ryker's character is a simple but committed person whose usual modest behavior is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he is placed. Marvin switches perfectly to the indifference, passionate decision-making, giving a convincing, often intense result, which is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama. This is the performance that should bring the film to the platform where it is located in the best courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that "Sergeant Ryker" is clearly hidden, it is still a weighty exam like a book that you just can't put down. Highly recommended.
