In 1976, I had just moved from us to ceylon. I was 23 years old and I was married for just over three years and started out as a lesbian. I saw this movie on the old black and white TV, in a terrible reception alone and uninterruptedly, waking up, which seemed like a story of echo. I lived in small houses in Tucson, Arizona, and it was summer ... like everyone else here, I never forgot the feelings that the images of this story called, and its residues that are weak with magic, and I've appreciated the hope of seeing it yet one day. I keep checking it. I also want someone to make a film of Shirley's blood on the other side of Venus. it also has one and the same delicacy and persistent poignancy ...
