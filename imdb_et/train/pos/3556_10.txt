It's so glorious music. There's a bit of confusion - Frank Sinatra is very insecure than the Jewish Nathan Detroit, although it only appears in "Sue Me", which is clearly a Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs: "Marriage Man Today" and replaced it with a worse Sinatra exhibition. In view of these two drawbacks, the film is otherwise excellent. Jean Simmons looks like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando doesn't know the worth of beans, but he still pulls it out. Stubby Kaye perfectly repeats his Broadway role (written for him). Damon Runyan's tongue and pace, and humor, come through quite well. This is my look-it-every-chance-I-get list.
