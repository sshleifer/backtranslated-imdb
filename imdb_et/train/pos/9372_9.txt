Red Rock West is one of those rare films that keeps you from taking what happens next. Nicolas Cage is wrong with a contract killer when he enters a small town trying to find a job. Dennis Hopper is a bad guy and no one plays them better. Look for a short look at the state song star Dwight Yoakam. This is a serious drama for most of the time, but for some lighter moments. What's important is that you enjoy this small budget, but quality efforts!
