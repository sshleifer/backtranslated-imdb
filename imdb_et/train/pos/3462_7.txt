It was the first episode of the TV series broadcasted by Columbo (although it was filmed after "Death Lends a Hand") and it was one of the most successful TV series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who played three in a series of murderers. He attracts here with equality, arrogance and self-confidence, like Ken Franklin, half of the mystery writing team that carries a complex plot to kill his partner, Jim Ferris ( Martin Milner) who decides to end his professional relationship, leaving Franklin to expose a good publicist rather than a prolific writer. <br /> <br /> The initial setup of the murder is fantastic and Cassidy's performance contributes to the controversial testimony that he was the best in Columbo's murderer series. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is greatly undervalued in his role as Columbo and character traits and marvels, which are accentuated by seeming slowness and lack, especially in Cassidy's extreme inconvenience: one of their early scenes where Ken Franklin prepares to kill through Jim Ferris a non-existent exhibit to identify the crash words in the underworld is very good. Jr. Columbo says that this potential motive and Columbo (deliberately or unknowingly) will not stop, forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a significantly patronizing manner and to compare him unfavorably with a book detective, Mrs. Melville. <br /> <br /> It is also a remarkable 24-year early deposit by Steven Spielberg. Nonetheless, he adds some basic additions to the actors' and cameramen's shady cameras, adding some stylish and complex touches to support the overall professionalism of the episode. One particularly harsh image is Jim Feriss's dead body, located in the foreground, almost in the foreground in the dark, as Ken Franklin lifts the glass in his background after he finishes answering a phone call to Ferris's disappointed woman. I have no doubts that Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated when working with a restrictive timetable of 10 to 14 days. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, another murder case caused by an extortion plan drawn by a female Franklin friend (and what Columbo called "sloppy" in her climate calculation) takes steam away from the whole thing. Cropping a plot is in danger and the screen time between Falki and Cassidy may at that time reduce the script writer (Stephen Bocho) from a narrow corner, because he can't develop the story separately without murdering another. <br /> <br /> The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. Between Falki and Cassidy, the original deception and exchange of words are strong and effective, but it simply advertises the fact that it should have happened more in an episode. The main aggravation lies in the sealing layer (if it can be called a hint): The mystery and arrogance of the Cassidy character so far is astonishingly out of the clue that really does not claim his guilt; and when it is mentioned, he capitulates a rather extraordinary and characteristic fashion. <br /> <br /> In summary, the bold opening of the series, which inevitably promotes and predicts everything that is good about Columbo, and vice versa, - the problems of such inventiveness, ie maintaining high standards and, above all, creating a credible and reasonably intelligent ending.
