Microphones are classic Stooge short. Boys are unsuccessful repairers working in a radio station, and some broadcasts, when Curly is the perfect impression of "Spring Votes" recording, are the wrong thing that brings about a radio contract and a music party. The look of the Lucia de L'Amamore Quintet Trio is especially fun. There is no doubt that this is an important viewing experience for Stooge fans. <br /> <br /> Although evidence of Curly's failed health is visible on her face and voice, her performance is amazing and is probably the last glimpse of the old Curly. Some fans think that "Lind in hand" is the last big curly short, but its coarse voice and slow movement is just too difficult to look at.
