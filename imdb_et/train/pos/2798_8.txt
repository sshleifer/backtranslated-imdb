Jess is 18 years old, very smart and doesn't want to play anything other than playing football when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents over and over again because they disagree with her, they want her to be a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook. <br /> <br /> Tell it like Beckham is a very funny feeling for a good movie that doesn't have to be deep and complicated, it's just so good. Everything is fine and they play very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works great and the script is very realistic and very funny. <br /> <br /> Great Family Film 8/10
