Cable film channels have debris that I hit with this gem. From the beginning to the end it was captured and worthy of the top. <br /> <br /> The father of two sons hears "from God" to kill the people he has said are "demons". <br /> <br /> When opening credits showed the director one of the pains that can often be a bad movie warning; the opposite is extraordinary, because drama is non-stop from start to finish. <br /> <br /> There is no moment in the movie if no one is completely astonished because there are no unnecessary or unnecessary sub-plots and the script is first-rate. <br /> <br /> All actors give absolutely convincing performances, especially to the leading child artist who is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as "Silence of Lambs".
