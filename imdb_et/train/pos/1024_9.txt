I have not always been a fan, but the exhibition grew to me. It was only after the 5th season that I began to see the wealth of the exhibition. Eventually, they brought Daniel Jackson to the end of his wife, and finally, most of Go, Ould System Lords won rival Lords, SG-1 or others. <br /> <br /> The 5th Season, Stargate SG-1, began to collapse. Due to the attentiveness of the new writers and Produer Peter Deleuise, this exhibition became increasingly strong. <br /> <br /> The characters were also outdated. Colonel Jack O'Neill was a stereotypical hero with emotional luggage. When his son Charlie was killed with an O'Neill gun in a fire attack, he decided to end his life, go to Abydos to come down to Go'ould RA. The person offers little growth to any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson decided to play him, raising emotional barriers to his defense. only allowing close friends. <br /> <br /> Amanda Tapping joined Captain Samantha Carter. He was a feminist who was ready to fight with anyone who doubted his ability to do his job. Although this character was little to grow, Tapping has done a great job focusing on Carter's strengths. He has taken the time to get some basic knowledge about some of the things Carter is saying so he can intelligently present this character. <br /> <br /> Christopher Judge joined Teal'c, a cast alien. Teal'c was an alien called Jaffa. Infant Go'ould (a snake like creatures) put himself in Jaffa until they had grown up to enter another life form. Jaffa die. Teal'c was the first prime minister of the Apophis army. Knowing that Apophis was not like Go as a god, he would have thought of the genocide that their armies had captured in the galaxy. Finally, he and Jack O'Neill freed his team with quite a few innocent people. After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, to help him fight Go'ould. Christopher Judge has done a bit of a limited character. Teal'c is a wise warrior, much of whom he learned from his Master Master Bra'tac. The show would not be complete without Tony Amandola's playful master Bra'tacita. He's also a stone. Eventually, he got most SG-1 advisors, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Davis was playing Major General George Hammand from the start. Davis has done an amazing job with Hammond, giving him sympathetic and normal. She does her job, she has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. You can really say that he is the anchor of the base. Just, I'd die for that man. If his bosses do not allow it, he will give troops out of the world to support the troops. She goes herself. He won't leave anyone behind. <br /> <br /> I saved dr. Daniel Jackson, because I think that this character has grown over ten or eleven years. When choosing Shanks, I don't think the manufacturer realized how strong Shanks would be and now that people are talking about Jackson, they're not talking about Spader, they're talking about Shanks. In the first years of the year, Jackson went off as a whore. That's why I probably wasn't a fan. When the seasons were stuck, the sign became stronger. It gave him confidence. Finally, from the 10th season, Jackson's character has matured to become a self-sacrificing hero. He is still following the ethics of the groups. He still manages information that allows any mission to move forward. Acheaology, history, culture and exploration are part of his nature. He's appointed. Although a man of peace, he has matured so that the use of his weapons can be the only way to resolve disagreements. <br /> <br /> Other characters last include Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder), new SG-1 leader. Both participants come from a series called Farscape and why they're put together. I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton (character of Farscape). Black's character is just on the wall. Certainly his soldier is like a character Arin Soon.
