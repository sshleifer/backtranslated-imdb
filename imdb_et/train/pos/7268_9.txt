In all times of the world, we need to escape. Curly Sue is just that. Not a complicated plot or deep meaning; however, it is not in substance. There's more than furious action or heart pounding drama. There are charming small exhibitions that you can watch with your children and have enough time to enjoy your date. Try what you like when you think. A little girl is really smart and cute. "Dad" and the girl go through some dirty routines. When the jealous boy enters, the trouble of baking and the known shadows of life can be torn. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play a good role as the top bark and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable, such as the duo, which depicts today's homeless drifters. Their worlds collide and comedy occurs.
