Enjoy viewing this movie from TCM and watching a very young William Powell (Philo Vance) who played the detective as he did with Myrna Loy in "Thin Man Series". In the 1930s, William Powell played in the Philo Vance series and in this picture, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor (Lake Hilda) is one of the suspects of a murder / suicide case where a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot) has been found dead and Archer was in a room was internally burnt. Ralph Morgan (Secretary of Raymond Wrede / Archer) gave a great support and was Frank Morgan's brother, who appeared in 1939 on "Oz's Wizard". Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in some of these Vance films and also produced an excellent result with "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember that the least likely actor may be a killer. Enjoy the great classics of the past.
