It's not always easy to explain what a movie is, but this time I think I've found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small criminals who rated some drugs and doing some dumb things in Schotland) and Blair's witchcraft (because of the filming style). <br /> <br /> This is two friends between loyalty, one of them is out of prison, the other is not yet caught. Through a stolen vehicle, they travel through the Scottish countryside, but not petrol. When they try to find fuel, they find it in the middle. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and put him in one gun. If it all goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. Next, the person is hunting through the fields and forests of Schotland. Two friends must literally drive their lives. <br /> <br /> This movie has probably been made in just 12 days. Okay, it's not quite unbelievable because most of it is always in the same place: Scottish land, but I find it amazing. Especially because it's not really a bad movie. It may never be the biggest movie, but they may be proud of what they achieved. I had a nice time to watch it and generally enjoyed this movie. I'll give him 7/10.
