This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. This leads me to emotional skateboarders. I laugh and cry and I'm disgusting and happy and in love! All this in just over two hours! <br /> <br /> Participants are all great! I must of course mention the leading actor Michael Nyquist. He does a remarkable job! I admire the actor who plays Tore, who plays this spiritually challenging young man so convincingly! He reminded me of the Leonardo di Capri Rolling Gilbert grape! And then the world's most beautiful song: Gabriella s√•ng. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone to see and enjoy!
