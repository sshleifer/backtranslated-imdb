THE OUTPUT OF THE CLOCK may be the finest film I've seen since BELLEVILLE TRIPLETS. Although very different in style, KELLS TRIPLETS and KUNG FU PANDA share the 2D sequence of the inclined opening of the jaw, an incredible artistic direction, a production design, a background / layout, and a rich wealth of color that is your senses party. KELLS is so proud - almost Gothic with its layout (somewhat reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in general terms, decorated with its Celtic and illuminated design, but the characters are so simple and attractive - AND it all works fine. You love those characters that are the moment you meet them. You're a story for every detail and pencil and brush. With Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone in the Cartoon Salon (& their expanded teams) has achieved this small budget / very small team movie, it's absolutely amazing. Our animation community support is phenomenal. This film is breathtaking, and the buzz spreading through the film's recommendation among colleagues is spreading like a fire. Congratulations to KELLS for its many awards, the Annie nomination and its current Oscar Qualification Progress. They are all very well earned, indeed ...
