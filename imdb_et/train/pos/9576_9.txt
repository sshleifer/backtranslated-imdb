One of the nicest and most brutal films I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and mobile. It's an action melodrama, as the world has never seen before. Sometimes the plot got close to my tears, while the next moment the shocking rashes were like a cracking bone. Edison Chen's presentation. The story of HK-Cop and the Cambodian killer, who are hunting each other, is strong while losing their humanity. "Dog Biting Dog" is pure HK-Bloodshed without heroism, which has very little dialogue for haunting images and sharp camera work.
