The soldier is not a great movie, and everyone who hated it has many good reasons. But I liked the soldier a lot, partly because my expectations were so low that I was surprised. <br /> <br /> First, the direction of art is dense and well executed. As far as science fiction is concerned, the soldier dealt with things more than 90% of the genre. Sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competent; I didn't love my entire future military style, but I was fascinated by it. For me, it took time to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I grew up watching this man in the most memorable films of his youth ... Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films. Soldier is essentially a feature film and Sergeant Todd's role is an important act of hero. This is not an award-winning role, but Kurt accumulates very little dialogue with convincing emotion. <br /> <br /> Third, fighting scenes and battles are well-choreographed. It is not a iron monkey or even a matrix, but again it exceeds the average quality level of the genre. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it and you like sci-fi action movies, pick it up when you go to your rental office. Just don't expect the next Bladerunner.
