I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy" who thought it would be another overpriced movie of the 60s / 70s. Some of my favorite movies come from the 70s, like "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park", etc.), but there are many, much overpriced. well, they have gained a strong reputation among critics because they are groundbreaking - unfortunately, most of them are not well off today. I know this way about "Easy Rider". (Even though this is one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> So I didn't expect much of Midnight Cowboy, but I got back a lot. It is a touching story, well done and well talked about with the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, like Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, is doing his best - it is a bit funny from time to time (he sounds like a comic book when he talks - maybe because of the Lenny / "Simpson" connection), but Hoffman is absolutely convincing. Half of the film's budgets went to pay their wages because it was just Hollywood's big star. Against him, another billed Jon Voight, like Joe Buck, is a "cowboy" who travels to North Big Apple to become a male prostitute. Soon his na√Øve ways land him in trouble and couples robbed of a scam "Rsoo", who offers Joe a leader in a certain percentage of profits. <br /> <br /> The movie's length is quite two hours, but never seems very long. Some films may be inclined, especially in the 1970s, because (as stated in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls") in the 1970s, directors were film stars and sometimes they got a bit too fond of their material, which is going on too long characters / scenes / etc. which is not important. Almost the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was a drug party - it makes the movie extremely obsolete (similar to the "Easy Rider") and really hurts its flow because it's not needed. /> <br /> In addition, "Midnight Cowboy" is an almost flawless movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its drawbacks (the setbacks are a bit sticky and never used as they would have been) and some scenes are a bit peaceful (like gay cinema), but if you can handle the content of "Midnight Cowboy" is a really big movie, uncompromising exploring the streets in the late 60s / early 70s. This is a frustrating film, yes, and today's standards may seem a bit outdated and a difficult liberal perspective on "life is terrible, etc." ... but I still love it and especially the extremely touching end ends with me for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70s. (It was technically released at the end of 1969, but I categorized it as a film of the 1970s. He also won the best picture of the Oscar, being the first and only - X-rated film that did it. R on appeal.) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
