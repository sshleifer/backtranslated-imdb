The great Caruso shows Mario Lanza's unique talents. She shows excellent performance and is in the form of a lyrical singer connected to the Metropolitan Opera soprano Dorothy Kirsten. Indeed, I dare say that he performs some songs better than Caruso (see A'Vuchella Tosti and La Danza Rossin). The MGM's art and music departments also did a good job. This film can be perfect if not Bannth's uncomfortable presence; we see that he is trying his best, dressed in fifty styles just before the events of 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserves a better lead woman and Blyth should stay with less demanding products. Also note that Mrs Kirsten sings most of the opera's opera duets with Lanza, giving the wrong idea that Carusol was a kind of permanent leading soprano.
