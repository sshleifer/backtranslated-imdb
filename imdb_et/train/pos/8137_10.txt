If you like CB4, you have no idea what you are not even seeing. This movie is crazy fun and contains a lot more hip-hop industry than any other parody movie ... It's unfortunate that this movie hasn't been released on DVD because it's one movie I've ever watched with has loved and wanted a copy. If you really want to laugh and you like hip hop and are somewhat familiar with some old school artist, rent this movie. There are no video fields where there are copies of it, but if you happen to be in contact, you won't be disappointed.
