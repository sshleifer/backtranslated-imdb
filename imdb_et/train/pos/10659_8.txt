"I like cheap perfume, it doesn't last for so long ..." - Ralph Meeker's convicted character (Lawson) tells Barbara Stanwycki Helen about receiving her perfume that she picked out from her husband. Tijuana ...! This line broke me and seemed like a metaphor for this movie - that cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap perfume-loving man with 2 x 4 is a better man with a long ring! I agree with some of the other comments about Helen's attraction to Lawson. Even if his narrative says he wants Lawson to be put off, he seemed to be happy with his fiery nature and the passion he confused with him was unlikely to swell!
