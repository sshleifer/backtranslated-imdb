Well, what I can say is that this movie really came to me, it's not as bad as many say I really loved it, although the idea seems so simple and quite boring. First I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really comes with the film. Another is a simple story and the Spirit of the Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like the most is that they didn't give the slave a human voice to communicate with other horses, making the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now, but ... I don't do that? you know, talking about animals is just so ... flat. <br /> <br /> One of my most beautiful animations in 2002, I recommend it to everyone, not just to children :) because it is very relaxing.
