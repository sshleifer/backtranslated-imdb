David and Bathsheba are stories of the Hollywood Bible, produced by Darryl F. Zanuck's Fox 20th Century, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck {King David}, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on the second book of the Old Testament Samuel of the Holy Bible. It is from this that King David, who had killed Giant Goliath as a child, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of Israel. Heavy and sure king, David has things in the heart that cause great trouble. Once he laughs at Bathsheba in the shower, this is the beginning of a journey involving adultery and betrayal; a journey that ends with God's judgment called. <br /> <br /> Typically, the genre has a great, grandiose production by David & Bathsheba. With its superb design, up to this positive pride, Technicolor Photography {Leon Shamroy} has enough quality to guarantee next to the best in the session what the genre has to offer in terms of product values. Typically, this film is sedimented and is based on 99% of its value, which is controlled only through dialogue. It is not for action fans or someone who needs to go for a strap. This is a very humanistic image, which does not really let the burning of the shrub here, it is the story of biblical love that has sinned with the heart. But it is not at all bad, because we find that breaking it works very well (Peck has a stoic but vulnerable thing that is doing really well, and Hayward pushes it to the maximum) and this is a good story that is directed towards knowing Henry King's often forgotten skills. And while some dialogue really reflects disgrace, the character's flow never stops when the Phillip Dunne's (The Ghost and Mr. Muir) Oscar's scenario keeps its attention all the time. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the forgotten picture is in the sense of the genres of Bible / swords and sandals (most likely because it is the main point of sale that is close to the heart), but it really is worth everybody interested in the genre. richer. 7/10
