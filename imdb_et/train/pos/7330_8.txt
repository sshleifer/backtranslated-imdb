This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. Some characters are directly from their paintings (the best example is Death Dealer). Surprisingly, animation manages to maintain the feeling of original art. Bakshi is known for using his great rotoscope (technique for tracking live actions) and this film is no exception. Since the theme of the movie is quite realistic (all characters are people), it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is a plot: if we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences, really a evil villain and a gorgeous babe. The feeling of this film is the best Conan comic, not surprising, because Roy Thomas is our favorite Cimmerian Marvel series writer. It's far from Crappy's lively Conan action, not to talk about the whole genre B movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
