I saw this movie back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and 14 of the movies I saw there would be # 4. Theater 900+ was full and finally got stalled. It was a classic Peter Falk if you were a fan of Falki and you saw many chemistry between Peter Falck and Paul Reiser characters. The movie's title seemed to me long and too strange. I'm surprised that it didn't make it a general release. It was much better than the bulk of the junk that the big studios threw at you. Maybe too adult that it was aimed at the audience of the baby boom and the parents. Many people might be involved in the situations of this movie. It probably enjoys years of revival when people look back at the film and consider it a pearl. I would appreciate it from 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and I would definitely recommend it.
