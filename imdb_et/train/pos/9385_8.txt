Red Rock West is a perfect example of how a good movie can be practically without budget. All we need is a smart script, good actors and atmospheric loads. RRW offers all these and more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays in the Lebanon, a former seafarer injured, who has been refused his oil for the last 5 dollars after his poor knee. He plays the role of Red Rock and is wrong with a man who was hit by a barman Wayne (JT Walsh, not quite as threatening but still evil). <br /> <br /> He will pay him to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary. Only when he gets there just look at him. He offers him twice to kill Wayne. The drill simply wants to get the money out of hell and leave the sparring lovers. But several failures and setbacks bring him in and out of Red Rock, back and forth. Ultimately, this leads to Dallas Lyle (an exciting and somewhat sympathetic Dennis Hopper), a TIRA REAL hit-man who offers help without knowing that he makes the plot more complicated. <br /> <br /> RRW never had a big excerpt, so most of its audience discovered this video or cable television show. Looking at it, it may seem like a television element, but it's bigger. Slick, the slow-timed direction, the desperate score and the scorching wind would all have made the movie a great movie in the theaters, but the best you can do these days is to watch a DVD on a big HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only weak spot in the movie I think is Lara Flynn's Boyle's dull femme fatale with an unpleasant ditch. He would definitely not be against him, but if you think that Nic Cage's character is military for lesbians, then you agree.
