I think the team behind this movie did a great job with these restrictions. only 300,000 and 7 weeks for writing, filming and editing the whole thing, which I think is an accomplishment in itself. Although this film is not for the masses (when a young innocent teenager is killed and the story is related to homo-eroticism), I think this film is a tragedy close to the heart and the deeper the story we get, the more sad you feel. the more Heaton's love for what he knows, but it is not returned. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British movies that I enjoyed and watch again. I think it's a shame that the film hasn't heard very well at all.
