Thinking about this movie, I can think of two more to help see it. One of the most unforgettable, but the same geography, is Coup de Torchon, others thousands of miles away, and much more extensive is an unforgettable indochine. Claire Denis has created a film that has some of the great foundations of Indochine, the complex and unspeakable relationships between France and its colonial objects. <br /> <br /> I had the dignity of Potee trying to preserve her dignity among her peers and her white bosses. I also had a relationship between love and hatred between him and Aimee. The latter gives the film its driving force, the latter that binds the film to indokine. <br /> <br /> No one is sure what motivates everyone, although some characters are needed to commemorate. colonialism. This is the cynical aspect of this story that links it to Coup de Torcho. These are more of a scandalous story that may be even more interesting in descending fashion, but Denis gives us a memory of how it was with all tensions and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American Black, who has grown up in France, is still at the beginning and end of the movie another interesting aspect of the confusion we look to Africa in the West. He says that when he came, he wanted to invite all the brothers. He came home, but they just thought he was small. France, a character and a girl grew up in Cameroon, but they don't understand what it is, even though they remember how it was. <br /> <br />
