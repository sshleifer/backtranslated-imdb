when I read another comment, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First of all, highlight Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; Good enough ... <br /> <br /> Film, very intelligent and interesting, because there are a lot of international special European actors and actors like Turkey and Russians ... <br /> <br /> Second, Story is basic and you may think, but if you are interested in the activity you like, what I like ... <br /> <br /> Third, the final chapter is neither special nor interesting, it's normal, like other movies. Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... And I hope you love to enjoy it: D
