Allen and Julie move into the cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered overnight. No one knows who killed the little girl, but why they moved to the mountains. So the couple are moving into this salon and worshiping people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby city wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very tough on it and has many parts that jumped on me. Some parts are predictable, but sometimes there is a part that I didn't expect. It was a pretty good movie that wasn't the world's most frightening film, but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good. <br /> <br /> I liked this end too, because it left the viewer to decide how to end. It is also a sad film, but also a well-made horror film.
