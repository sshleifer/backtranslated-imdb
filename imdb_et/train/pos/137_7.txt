After some of the negative comments I heard about this movie, I had a suspicion that it would go, but I had a â‚¬ 3.99 in my wallet and mindset when I was playing a budget like a movie and saw it and gave it back and gave it back. glad I enjoyed it. Director: The star of films such as Chain Reaction, Ring, Bourne Identity (Brian Cox) I had to play it even when it was garbage but was not at all, I found some humor quite funny, especially Alfred Molina star Spider-man 2 Character Doc Ock . He was the most enjoyable part of the movie. Of course, like many other people who bought this movie, I saw Matthewi's name and it put me in it! and its part is not at all great, at the end of the film it is very short, it is not a big part of what makes me believe why people hate the movie. I suggest you go. Some parts are bad, which needed polishing, functioning and a little more action. But it's traceable.
