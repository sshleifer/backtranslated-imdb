I know I know it was a good ending, but it was really fantastic. I love the movie ending in a terrible dark nature, but this time I was impressed that Darth Vader turned to the emperor, I was really surprised. The thrilling sequence of this movie was when Emperor / Darth Sidious tormented and defeated Luke. He will be destroyed as soon as Dith Vader, Sith's dark master, removes his dark man. Nice victim. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised at all of Rebel's battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers ships. I loved a new race, they brought Mon Calomari, ewoks, sulleste (Lando co-pilot) and much more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in this movie: 1-When Vader destroys the emperor and is deadly wounded. 2 - When Luke sees the Obi-Wan and Yoda spirits and then shows Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (Star Wars biggest scene). 3 - When LEIA strikes Jabba to strangle the lord of Hutt crimes. <br /> <br /> I personally like the script and the Battle of Endor, which is a land and space struggle, as well as the best duel of the Star Star War of Dead Vader Vs Luke Skywalker. Post-script: Scenes with Find in slavery are memorable. 9/10
