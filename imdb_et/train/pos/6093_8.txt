I saw this movie in a preview of the mouse and all I can say is ... "What did I just look at ????" And I mean it's good and bad. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. Stiller and Black are playing friends / neighbors. Stiller is a focused, hardworker, while Black is a dreamer. Black tries to create this idea from the spray, which deletes the poo. The idea becomes very popular and Black becomes very rich. The black profitable lifestyle and the fact that he is still trying to get Stiller's best friends causes Stiller's envy crazy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is odd. The direction is strange, weird with a rotating opening at the scene where there are no sequences. Dialogue and actor are very strange; in a strange way. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the movie - a strange "Envy" song that continues to play on a scene where you think you hear a classic 80's song, but maybe it's in Japanese. So, the real question is ... is it weird funny? It depends only on the person. I broke the film in disrepute. After screening, I heard people call it awful and uncomfortable that it was free. Strangely, I realized their point. There are no jokes, so if you are not hooked on this uniqueness, you hate this movie. Absolutely hate it. <br /> <br /> This movie is designed to lose a lot of money at the cashier and become a DVD cult class. If you can laugh with a movie that doesn't have real jokes like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, I suggest you see it. If you don't, escape from this movie. It only makes you crazy.
