If you like animal movies, please film this. My wife likes animals and animal films, especially the parrot in the movie. It's aimed at kids, but I laughed the most with humor. The French fashion badge made me laugh and adds the balance of the script. This is a Disney movie with a gentle, happy family apeal, but I like to leave the theater with positive fealing.
