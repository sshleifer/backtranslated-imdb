This police procedure is no worse than many others of this era and better than some. Obviously, it follows the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City" but appears as a pleasant programmer. The best thing is that the appearance is the world that has long since disappeared ... the lower class New York in the late 40s and early 50s. Here it is all over its glorious time, from old school tattoos to cheap hotels to greasy spoons. These old police films are like the travels of the past era and very harsh to anyone who does not like the modern sanitary, soulless city. <br /> <br /> It is also intriguing to emphasize the scientific aspect of nuts and bolts. crime ... in this case, the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes, the Detective Tobin and the Corrigan, are walking, but without the tedious and laborious efforts of the laboratory boys, they can't get anywhere. Although technology is not in the same league, police officers use C.S.I. the researcher is watching his man. <br /> <br /> How some reviewers have written about this movie, you think it was led by Ed Wood and his films made extras. What a bosh! I liked John Miles because gangly ex-Marine turned to policeman Tobin ... he had a happy, easy approach to a role that was a welcome change from the usual histrionics of most filmmakers. Patricia Barry is a lovely and charming girlfriend who helps to solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is tiring and elder detective Corrigan. I rather liked these two chemistry and it did something a little bit different than the robotic "Dragnet" approach. <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not too deep, and the ultimate chase and shooting definitely does not pass into the classics of crime cinema, but during this short working time, "The Tattooed Stranger" is more than my interest.
