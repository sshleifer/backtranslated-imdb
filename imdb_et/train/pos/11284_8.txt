When I was a child, it was Lex Barker's time in Tarzan. I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller was "Tarzan," and I don't understand why I saw a couple of Weismuller's latest movie characters and I thought he was a kind of figure. After many years, I found "Tarzan and his companion" and then I understood. Weismuller is in this image and has a presence and a harsh look at the character requirements that other Tarzans like Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert do not answer. <br /> <br This film also surprised me with the sensual presence of Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, self-evident, active and "non-inhibiting" woman in front of Jane before the film was made (Tarzan rejects it) is entertained, he has a pond naked, one of the investigators can surprise him and even though he would not be able to hit him, he will let him do a bit and do not make a big out of it; Brown, Virginia Huston, or Dorothy Hart, all playing over-perfect sweet vulnerable women that make it hard to believe they can survive in a hostile place like the African jungle <br /> <br /> The glowing personality of O'Sullivan's character steals the display himself from Tarzan, except, of course, when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily, the combination is perfect, another highlight of the film is Cheeta's secondary role, not the main lead like later in Tarzan's pictures, where he often saves the day. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his mate are a good product in their genre. Tarzan Films) and maybe the best, although I have to admit that I also enjoyed the "Tarzan's greatest adventure" (1959), which was made with a higher budget and strong support (and despite exactly the Gordon Scott's leading role) "The physical appearance of a gymnasium that does not fit with a rustic monkey). <br /> <br /> Good Jane and her companion!
