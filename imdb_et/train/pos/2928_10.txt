EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is just a more fun stand-up concert film I've ever seen. Most stand-up operations at some point have rolls, but none. Within 90 minutes, there is no moment that is not funny laterally. From the moment Eddie makes an astonishingly dead impression of Mr.T, laughing is endless. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was done in 1983 and Eddie didn't do anything so funny. it is incredible that this phenomenally brilliant show was written by HARLEM NIGHTS, which was not very funny at all. in the DELIRIOUS vein. Believe me, your fans will love you for that. And I think you know that.
