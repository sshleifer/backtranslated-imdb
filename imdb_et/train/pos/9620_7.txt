There are now so many "Hollywood" movies that are not just torture, but in no way to anyone. Movies don't always have to have a deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still filmmakers who care about talking about "human" stories. I'm not giving this brilliant movie a prerequisite, but the scenario is definitely one of the most challenging and memorable I've ever seen in my life, and I'm a 32-year-old movie guy! There is a mistake in my favorite list of the top ten, which includes only a few names on Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus. This "moving" movie should become one of your favorites - that means you have a heart!
