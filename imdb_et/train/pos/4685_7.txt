Lizzie Borden's "Love Crimes" (1992) is played by Sean Young's fear of D.A. Atlanta. He's a lonely guy who gets too deeply involved with a man (Patrick Bergin) who is a famous photographer and seduces women, and takes them, then leaves. <br /> <br /> Of course, this harsh loner decides to get into a fake locker, putting him in his prey, intending to bring him to justice. They meet, love, the next thing he knows is in his lap, getting into each other. (Note: A quick scene is only in the "unrated" version of this movie. The R-rated version leaves it out and several other scenes that make the plot clearer.) around the room, riding with a riding culture. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, "Love Crimes" is best when Sean Young plays his cat and mouse game with Bergin, trying to get him to blame. It is unfortunate that the movie does not end, it just stops. It is true. It is possible that Director Lizzie Borden just tells the story, but after 92 minutes the credit went down and we have left a puzzling "what just happened?". Confusion. <br /> <br /> Developing a youth plan plays an interesting style, but the lack of a single end is off for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
