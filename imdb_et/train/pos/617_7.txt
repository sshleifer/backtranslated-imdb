Reiterates the darkness. It is compared to "Princess Bride" and although it does not mean this classics, it is very fun and well done in itself. The story is a bit strange and the whole wall thing has never really been explained, but filling is good, even building a strong intermediate layer. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls against the wrong girl (Sienna). Miller), and agrees to bring him a fallen star ... who happens when he is played by a stunning Claire Danes. Not much tension about what happens to these two, but the stopping part comes from the sons of the prince of Michelle Pfeiffer and King Peter O'Toole, who want to get our "star" back on the ruby ​​necklace. A lot of bad behind persecutes good. <br /> <br /> Along the road where you can see the stranger you see (including the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - The harsh is inside and we say his feminine side. The second meeting is a great Ricky Gervais as a fast-paced trader and is good for a couple of laughs. <br /> <br /> Not your typical chase, age or fantasy movie, but the effort of director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer Cake") deserves the audience. Unfortunately, a bad marketing campaign is likely to prevent you from making that money. I think it's a great success for the video.
