I look back at the series as soon as possible. I try to look at all the things in Star Trek. It's 3rd month, and I'm now TNG for the 3rd season and I've gone through DS9. Star Trek is the biggest television phenomenon ever achieved. <br /> <br /> Gray Tones is the first rejection episode in the TNG series. Having just seen that these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how a few of them were shot again because the film looked better. The first season always seemed dark to me and ugly - and the actors saw it foolishly as they didn't fit in their skins. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is essentially the result of the happiest hits. and the worst moments in Riker's life in business until then. The data and Riker scene on the Holo deck is a classic moment of new friendship. My second favorite is when the second officer of the Klingon ship challenges Riker's power as the first officer and Riker won the living CRAP out of this Klingon. Then Admiral hits his $ but good. This whole episode is a surprise reminder that a lot of good, good things have happened in just 2 seasons, 5 more go and a handful of movies! In this series, they really started to develop emotions that bind Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Until that moment they have mentioned it, but they haven't used it yet. Let the record show that the ST Wiki memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and denotes that he has been close to Riker and also emotionally close. This episode also shows that for a long time there is a tense romantic interest in each other. <br /> <br /> Here's an article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By this series in the series, the value of production is up to speed and Star Trek TNG took up the sci-fi behavior that was supposed to be . Looking at it again as an adult, I now see what the great makers of the Star Trek Universe offer. They really have to make a new ST show after all the current exhibitions. The DS9 movie would have been nice.
