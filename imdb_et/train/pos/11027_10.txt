Since I first saw it in the theater, it is my favorite. Since then I've seen it countless times and I've never been tired of it. The device has a lot to do with it (Colorado, I know it would be jealous), but the story is original and I liked how he used the small town as a mountain hero. This movie cannot be compared. John Lithgow plays a smart criminal, but I love how he has completely excluded his element - he has to follow Tucker and keeps it interesting. This is BEST's action film. I don't think I can see you that is so fun. <br /> <br /> You don't need 50,000 circles fired to qualify as an action movie. You just have to grab you, not shocked.
