I just came back from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and saw the ZU legend. I thought it was a * s! It was so creative and unique. This is a scattering tiger hidden dragon with much less drama. Even if some thought that there was too much FX (yes)! Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so good !!! Legend ZU ..... starts with * s !!!!!!!!
