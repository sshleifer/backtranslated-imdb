Answer: Despite the fact that this film is written and staged by a woman, your former sliding, nastier, and irrationality is more than any zombie ever on earth. <br /> <br /> Making this independent movie is really good, even though the script is less than wonderful. Overwritten, realizing the clich√©s is a pretty good actor and it's incredible. Young Anthony de Marco, like Jake, gives a particularly good result. <br /> <br /> Luckily, this movie plot is much better than dialogue. Try it, especially if you're not a monster fan. It's not a horror tape. While all adult women are real monsters, and while all adult men behave like some earlier zombie fodder feed, "Jake's Cabinet" is suitable for adults. <br /> <br /> This time it's much better than the sum of its parts.
