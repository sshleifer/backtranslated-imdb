It was a pleasure for me to watch for the first time the film "The Cure" by Ryan Jafri. What I am really impressive is the camera's work and music. <br /> <br /> I think many young filmmakers (like myself) are experiencing a hard time with cinematography, just starting to make indie. We see that the output is not what we imagined or under our ambitions. But this film, the debut of the director of the young director, worked very well on the screen. Camera movement, color, lighting, composition all contribute to movie story and emotion. <br /> <br /> And music, which is a key element of the film language, also helps a lot. It is hard to imagine a woman's heart, her desire, fear, especially in a short time. But still I have to admit that I'm not a v / o (narration) fan, especially when the movie is narrated instead of progressive frames and cuts. My personal feeling for some narrative part is, I think the narrator was a little too heavy. So the energy pulls the audience back from the film's emotions. <br /> <br /> In general, this short film, well done, saw the director's contribution. How to go, Ryan! Welcome to China, waiting for you next. <br /> <br /> tim
