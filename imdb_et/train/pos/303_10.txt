Since I saw this movie in 1981, it has been one of my 3 best favorites. The blurb written for Amazon is below, and I'm just glad it finally arrives on the DVD on the 10th - 17th June 2006 - the 25th anniversary of the movie. <br /> <br /> The last credit in this film explains this appeal - "Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island it was filmed." A charming and witty romantic comedy is a love story written for New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is the mother tongue) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, Ansonia, old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits and the West Club). This gives the impression that the whole ensemble also chose the screen as they do it, and that intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, cried, it was better than CATS. Not only the ode to Dorothy Stratten, but also the last feature of Audrey Hepburn (she was after the movie) and her inner beauty is flowing from the screen. Buy it, make a big bubble of popcorn and break with the one you love.
