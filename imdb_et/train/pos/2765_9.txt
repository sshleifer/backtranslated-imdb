It is French and Belgian who do the best. It is a peculiar, visually inventive, exhilarating and emotionally complicated storytelling. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us to Georges, Down's Syndrome sufferer and his quest for meaningful relationships with someone, but with everyone. This is not done in a patronizing manner, but very fun and honest. The interaction of Georges with the guru of corporate governance, Harry is dazzlingly handled - the transition from comedy to tragedy to comedy again with a soul-breath. <br /> <br /> On the eighth day, a similar Hollywood price, like Barry Levinson's Oscar winning rain drum, or Robert Zemeckis Forrest Gump, is in the shade. Sometimes it makes Milos Forman one of the humor who flew over the cuckoo's nest and the Dennis Potter tones were good. <br /> <br /> As an emotionally blinded and desperately lonely yuppie, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns on another superb result. But it fits with excellent Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It is a film with evenly strong films and so many, memorable parts - a shoe store scene, a car showroom scene, George's dance at Genesis 'Jesus He knows me', a conference scene, fireworks. If you haven't seen it, there is only one thing. Simply rent it or visit a retro cinema near you to see what you are missing. Better yet, buy this movie. Sheer genius .....
