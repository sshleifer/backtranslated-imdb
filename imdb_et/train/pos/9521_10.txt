I think this movie is brilliant. There are many reasons why they are, but these are some of them 1) Tom and Tyler good actor 2) Brilliant machine gun scene that was brilliance 3) I thought the ending was a good twist because I've never expected the end of all credits to Sam Mendes, as well as those 3 points, to be a good film form. I'm a college movie student and we learned this movie in great detail and it was one of the best films I've seen for years. I would like to thank all the people involved in making this film. Finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the movie is the scene of a machine gun, where John Rooney can kill, it's just a pure shine when shooting the scene quietly, until John Rooney says, "I'm glad it is," it's much better I think that's why that the viewer creates his own sound there and that for each viewer the sound is completely different - great. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this commentary written by Ross Kirk, 16 years old
