I loved this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I watched it. It wasn't strange to me. I fully identified them. I would like to see it again (and I hope I won't be disappointed!). Pufnstuf stones !!!! I was really a fantasy world. And that movie was looong for me. I don't know if I saw this series and I'm confused about them? The good thing I thought was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. He was so dreaming of a decade (when I first saw the movie, not in 1970. I can still remember the characters. Flute was completely plausible and I still can "feel" the evil forest. I wouldn't want to cross my way.
