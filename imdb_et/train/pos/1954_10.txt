I thought this movie was doing the right job. It wasn't as creative or original as the first, but who waited for it. It was fun. The more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it comes out of the DVD, I pay for it very proudly, every last cent. Sharon Stone is great, she is always, even if her film is terrible (Catwoman), but this film is not, it is one of those films that are underestimated during her lifetime, and is likely to become a classic in 20's. Don't wait until it's classic, look at it now and enjoy it. Don't wait for a masterpiece or something that grabs and breathes, just let yourself get out of your life and deal with yourself. <br /> <br /> All this movie is fun and I recommend people who haven't seen it to see it because what the critics and the office say is not always, look at it, you never know, you can just enjoy that. I see this movie on this movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
