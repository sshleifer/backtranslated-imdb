This is a striking (4 hours) transformation of the story of Rider Haggard with a normal female woman and a sub-subheading where Russian soldiers are looking for a "power stone" buried in the treasure of King Solomon. It has shot very well, giving a bright feeling to Africa's vast open spaces and working very well. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland who hires Quatermain to save her father. It is also memorable for Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and Russian soldier leader (not on the IMDb list). Hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adjust it, it's well-said, and except that it's too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.
