Nice and intelligent, two young girls play: Mischa Barton Frankie and Ingrid Uribe like hazel, although the plot is more of an imagination. Young Hazel, working for the mayor, seems inappropriate to be honest. <br /> <br /> Although all the players do it well, the film tends to lack a true drama atmosphere. Maybe we've been expecting a sharp reality in the movies, rather than comparing Pollyanna and how Green was in my valley! Do not forget that each of them is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright, even if his role here is somewhat modest. In the middle of entertainment, well suited for younger viewers, and sometimes with beautiful classical music exposure, which is almost rare! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a welcome change because it reflects the quieter, thoughtful values ​​of the growing years and does not help violence. A warm family movie to enjoy.
