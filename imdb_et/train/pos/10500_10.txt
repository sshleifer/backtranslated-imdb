Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the games in the series, it is still classic and as good as the old games. Such many repetitive games are little and far away. Plus, this game is so many different. There are 15 levels with several different tasks you can do, and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very complicated, but its absence does not take the game at all. If you beat it, you want to delete and start your game again. And it's the same fun a second or third time or two hundred times. Must own any Nintendo 64 owner and is in itself the cause of the Nintendo 64 owner.
