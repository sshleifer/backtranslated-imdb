* some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find that harsh criticism (acting, date dialogue, unclear story) is unfounded. Belafonte is great as Brandoesque, an intimidating, intimidating spirit who must serve his wings, but is actually poorly equipped with his previous life. He learns too late when his empty materialistic life was without love. Likewise, Mostel is a big, deadly man with his dying wife Fanny. Despite his miracles, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing in) one. The two social worlds represented by the characters collide alternately and complement each other, resulting in fun and touching sadness. <br /> <br /> The amazing ending is actually quite in line with the rest of the movie. After searching for Belafonte everywhere, Mostel sees that he sees a falling feathers and feels as if he is finally ready to believe in angels and wonders. But Belafonte was not allowed to stop his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith) so that he did not get his wings. Close floating out of Mostel's grip, a metaphor in both men's lives: it's too late and you won't get another chance. Like "It's a wonderful life," this movie is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.
