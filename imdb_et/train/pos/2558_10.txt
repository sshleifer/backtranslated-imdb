I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We're still together. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, it would never have been so easy. at this point. Mined to death. Mixed connections gave him a new foundation. It's an old hat today, but then ...? Marrying with Asia meant that you owe someone, or you were a freak. This concerned both options with a third option. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his usual good job. Garner did a better job than usual. He's good, but it showed how good he is. Umecki-chan had a delightful debut here, and even though I think she was making her shape, she didn't really stretch. It was a role that someone who hadn't been abroad would have recognized and the novice would be a cleaner. <br /> <br /> The real scene was red buttons. Red was the best in this movie. Bank on it. And the Japanese way of life was also shown in admirable light. <br /> <br /> Classic.
