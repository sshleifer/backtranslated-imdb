What can I say about a story like this? This magical story, following my early childhood, has watched warm memories from my heart. Characters lead you to so many strange places that you want more scenes. For example, there were so many different spices on the market. I loved exotic dancers who were involved in steel pipes. <br /> <br /> The story was great. I wanted so badly that Landsbury decided to keep premature babies and that he stay with Mr.Brown and find the other half of the spelling so men could win the war. <br /> <br /> I'm still a kid, and this movie calls my inner baby like no other. This movie is my definite favorite of all time. I hope all children can watch and wipe this classics and transport them to another time.
