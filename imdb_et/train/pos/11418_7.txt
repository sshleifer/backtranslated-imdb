I saw this movie for the first time and during an international film study course. I am a "non-traditional" student and, perhaps for years, or for reasons of wisdom, I appreciated the slow, reflective pace of the film's narrative. Of course, due to the heat and dust of the dry climate, this story is deeply psychological, full of multilayered symbolism and a verbal reversal of the theme of "other" land that one does not understand. the notion of not coming is full of unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Almost 20 years ago, it is also a forerunner of many other international film genres who are studying colonies in colonized spaces that help the nuances of the cultures they have entered. The much richer filmed --- and heavily funded --- the works that have been done reflect the same topics: indochin, somewhere in Africa there are no two, which maybe, compared to Chocolat, pale and boring. It has no adrenaline pumping action or extreme violence. The struggles are spiritual, emotional and subtle. But saying this is a good movie that is worth watching.
