I feel a little defensive about this movie because it was my introduction to the US.E. The year was 1972 and I.T.V. ran all eight functions in one bumper (followed by "Persuaders" Tony Curtis and Roger Moore main courses) on Saturday night. "Karate Killers" was chosen to open the season. It started with a cool sequel, as the Solo and Kuryak sports car attacked the THRUSH minicopter squadron. I was a fan of life ever since. <br /> <br /> After the main credit (seeing a special title sequence instead of slowing down your normal business), let's dr. .Simon True (Jim Boles), inventor of a new formula for separating seawater gold. True wife Amanda (Joan Crawford) has been dealing with THRUSH agent Randolph (Herbert Lom). Indeed, the merciless companion kills both the doctor and his wife before the formula for hunting. It is true that the event is ready - he has shared this reference into a segment, each of which is written on his own photo and sent to his five daughters, all of whom are scattered around the world. <br /> <br /> Solo and Kuryakin started the formula first by placing a series of episodes in different places and similar to Teles Savala (a close fisted Italian Count), Terry-Thomas and Curt Jurgen. One of dr.True's daughters - Sandy (Kim Darby) - is accompanied by U.N.C.L.E. boys in their global endeavor. <br /> <br /> After formulating the formula, THRUSH will appear and retrieve it before they threw their secret base on the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> All of UNCLE's feature films, that's what should be made specifically for cinema. This is a painful television product, although even slightly more expensive than usual. The location was not filmed and the different segments are repetitive, usually culminating in U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH. Of the singers, Joan Crawford is memorable in his small role and Curt Jurgens is a bad father to sugar. As London's Bobby, Terry-Thomas is as pleasurable as ever, and Herbert Lom is the main villain. Kim Darby grabs like Sandy. He should have said to stay at home. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that it manages to be more fun and fun than many of the official cinema releases from time to time, including In Like Flint, Casino Royale, and The Ambushers. I would like to know how Solo and THRUSH from H.Q escaped. after Randolph's death.
