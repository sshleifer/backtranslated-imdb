ROLL is a great little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old child (very well-off) who is football. Malone's cousin takes a night before her big game in an adventure with a lot of twists and turns, including two gym bags, a drug sender, some heavy cyclists, some police officers and some prostitutes ... and the film keeps us out of what kind of characters there are laws What is the content of a sports bag and even what gender is the main biker. Part of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK and two smokestacks. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL strengthened three opinions that I already had before seeing ROLL. These opinions are as follows: 1. I want to visit Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and look like a cool resting place. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers are Australians. Particularly impressive was ROLL's cinematic art. I loved stylized colors and lighting in many scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian Women Are HOT!
