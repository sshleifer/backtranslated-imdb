Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy, where the three main characters literally travel through almost the whole movie, for each other for one another, due to strange circumstances and comic coincidence. When they run, we see what is happening in their minds and how they are where they are now. Current activity is a metaphor for the lives of those happy people. In some way, what they really are behind is not what they originally did, but the meaning in their lives and escape their personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes them all truly alive. A big life-changing race ends when they accidentally get into something big, violent and so absurd that it's funny and wise. One of my favorite films is the brilliant director Sabu.
