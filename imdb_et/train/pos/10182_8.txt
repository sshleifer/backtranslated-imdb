good movie, good music, good background and acceptable plot. but the main point when his films tend to be is man idia is the best actor and can turn the dust into gold. nana patekar. it may be his second best result after a para (others may disagree). although the other films are not far away. one man who will never deceive you. <br /> <br /> A good movie, though I think Shahrukh was the luxury that this movie would have done without it. You see in your movies, others try to reach their heights and step out of your skin. but this person really is something lively. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool, music and direction are a bit thin, but screen display and dialogue are very good. must monitor.
