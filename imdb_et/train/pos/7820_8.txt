"A true story of friendship that shook South Africa and awakened the world." <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough, who led "Bridge Too Far" and "Gandhi", wanted to bring Steve Biko's story to life and journalist Donald Woods's passage and struggle to get his story spoken. The films use Wood's two books for this information and base - "Biko" and "Ask Trouble". <br /> <br /> The film takes place in South Africa in the late 1970s. South Africa is in the hands of a terrible apartheid, which keeps the black in white and classifies the whites as a top competition. The black people are forced to live on the towns by the cities, and they are often harassed by the police and the army. We have been shown a mound attack, where bulldozers and armed police get through beating the camp and even killing the inhabitants. Then Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is a popular newspaper editor, will be introduced. After a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods will meet him. These two are cautious about each other, but soon they will become good friends and Biko will show the horrors of the apartheid system from the black person to Woods. It encourages Woods to talk about an event around him and desperately puts him on the story of Steve Biko's white man's South African and world clutches. Soon, Steve Biko will be arrested and jailed. Now, Woods and his family have the courage to escape from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish his book on Steve Biko and apartheid. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about Cry Freedom, I had the impression that it was a movie that was entirely dedicated to Steve Biko's life. I had never heard of Steve Biko before this movie, because the events of this movie were really before my time. But this is more about Donald Woods and his trip across the border to Lesotho when he tried to displace South African officials. After Steve Biko was killed, Woods was taken to a five-year household. So in order to publish his manuscript to Steve Biko he had to flee. Because the manuscript is considered to be a betrayal in South Africa and it could have led Woods to a meeting that is similar to Biko's. Actual Donald Woods and his wife acted as consultants to this film. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is just the first hour of the movie and I was disappointed about it because I was waiting for her to see it all Movie. But he was amazing, like Steve Biko, and hit his personality on what I read very well and his accent sounded perfect. His performance gave him an Oscar nomination for the best supporting actor. Kevin Kline offers great and thoughtful results, such as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is a wonderful wife of Wendy. <br /> <br /> Filming took place in Zimbabwe, as it has to be said that there were problems when they tried to film it in South Africa. In South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film team everywhere, so they got bad vibes and they pulled out and went to the neighboring Zimbabwe. Despite everything, and the fact that apartheid did not end seven years later, "Cry Freedom" was not banned in South Africa. But the cinemas showing the film were bombarded. <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough brings the horrors of apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination. He doesn't stop at the end of the movie, when he shows what the students thought of as a peaceful protest, to become a massacre when the police open fire to them. The film ends with the names of all apartheid movements dead in prison and explanations of their death. Many had "no explanation". Quite a few were "epilepsy", which is hard to believe, and many others fell from the top of the stairs or were "suicide from hanging". Nobody ever knows what actually happened to them, but I think it's fair to say that none of these men died in their hands but in the hands of others; or more precisely, in the police. <br /> <br /> "Cry Freedom" is a must-see movie about its portrayal and Steve Biko's story. It also represents a beautiful and devastating image of beautiful land and the hellish raids of racial segregation and violence.
