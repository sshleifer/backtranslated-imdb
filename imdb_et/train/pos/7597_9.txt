Missing is interesting for everyone. There's a lot to say about this series and a lot of talk, so I don't want to rewrite it. Just read those who loved it and know why you want to watch it. The nice thing about this series is that it is brand new. There are not many movies - and even less series based on only temporary themes, but Lost is proud of this topic. It's all inexplicable, and when you combine it with an exotic location, a nice plot with twists, great pain and good format (current and past individual episodes combined), you have a series where every episode is a story about it, but part of a larger word. You want to see all the symbols you want to see, and you want to know where the writers are taking you. As a result, it's a series that won't let you go. According to more skeptical comments, the series went down a bit during 2 seasons, probably due to its success. It is well known that Lost was only written at the beginning of one season and when the great successes followed, the writers were amazed. In my opinion, they made the mistake of adding more secrets and faster in the 2nd season, then solving those (or at least part of) the season's first ones. Secrets, plots, and unexplained phenomena, but the viewer only gets so much. However, the difference between the 2nd and 3rd seasons was great. The 3rd season gave many insights to partially replace them with new issues. And that is how they should write; you want to throw one from the plot, turning to the next, not getting the tsunami secrets that spread all over you and then some choose to explain to the viewers. They got it in the 3rd season and bring us a promising future for the season 4. Good to see that such a different serial form can be so popular.
