This anime is a must-see for Evangelion fans. This is Anno Hideak's earlier work, but his unlimited, dramatic style is completely in place. Also, those who did not like Evangelion may find that this release is a little tasty. Gunbuster is quite unique for sci-fi anime because it is based on true science. In fact, the exhibition has a few little "science studies" that explain the physics behind some of the film's events. One of the biggest dramatic points in the film is the relative speed of the passage of time near the light. The series is doing a great job of dealing with an imaginative traumatic experience of leaving the land on a six-month mission that travels near the speed of light and returns to the land of ten years. The main character remains in the series at the age of 17 or 18, while almost all other characters are getting older. Warn that this show is a heavy juice at times. It also has a couple of the most unmerited breast shots I've ever seen. I found it quite easy to ignore uneven uniforms and boo-hood scenes because the series is otherwise very good, but low-volume viewers could stay away from it. As always, Gainax managed to run out of money on an interesting note. At the same time, they managed to use a black-and-white film, and still had the steps to make a good resolution. The end is a bit stupid, but I felt so good in my gut that I couldn't but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of Anime.
