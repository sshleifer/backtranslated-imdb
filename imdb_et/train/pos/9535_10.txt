The Journey to Transcendence, a film that was ignored this year, Oscars is Sam Mendes' second work (and, in my opinion, his best work), a director who three years ago won the Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American beauty. This is a fantastic movie and at the same time ultimately annoyed and sad. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a relatively prosperous and happy family during an external appearance in difficult times of depression, when Michael Sullivan, the father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I am not his admirer but should say) is by Paul Newman, a man hit by a local mafia commander. His eldest son, thirteen-year-old boy, Michael Sullivan Jr., who played great with Tyler Hoechlin after years of blissful ignorance, explains what his father's work is and what money their family has. His curiosity and effort to find out the truth turns him into an accidental murder committed by his father's superior son, John Rooney. Such a discovery strikes the innocent soul and caused many events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are completely created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless when the story is well written. But the main feature of the film, the most important moments and points of the film, and the key to the success of the film are the difficult father-to-son relationships in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strongly and credibly. Tom Hanks is doing very well and he has one of the best performances of his career in a rather unusual role, and everyone is all over the table is great. Finally, it is worth mentioning the great score of Paul Newman, and as a result we get a great job by all the people involved in making this beautiful (but yet sad) masterpiece. I believe that Road to Perdition is one of the greatest achievements of this decade of filmmaking and certainly the best film of the year. <br /> <br /> My 10th Grade 10
