Undoubtedly the highlight of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In turn, the wild comic and terribly tragic. Does anyone do it better than O'Toole? I do not belive. What a great face for a person! <br /> <br /> The story is strange and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially at the end), but it is also strangely moving and successful on many levels. But I felt that the film basically revolves around the luminous performance of Peter O'Toole and I'm sure I wouldn't even have enjoyed it as much as he would have been.
