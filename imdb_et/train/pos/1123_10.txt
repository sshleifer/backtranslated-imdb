I really enjoyed it, and while the ending ended up being angry, I'll give it another 10. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl, and Cadby) travel to Florida to meet 2 boys (Turner, Davis), they really don't add anything to the plot, but at least somewhat like it. Girls agree to meet in Florida but they have car problems and they never do. One girl decides to go to a nearby gas station, the other three remain in the car. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls will have to use the bathroom, being somewhere in the middle. there is no choice but to go to the bushes. Soon he admits that a man (March) strangles a woman, a terrorist escapes from his area, he doesn't get very far, but manages to get lost. <br /> <br /> His friends go by car to see him go to the woods and get into the same man, one of them looks like a dead woman, the man reacts to putting off the girls, the other girl runs away, he gets back into the car, where he's also killed. <br /> <br /> Finally, the other two girls find each other and, as they enter the gas station, they will be arrested. This is when I started to get mad, these poor girls are afraid of their lives and redhead policemen don't believe them. <br /> <br /> They are being treated badly and one of them is left alone to kill his cell, the rest of the friend can escape, but not without dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This movie is naked, good actors, a shower that imitates Psychot, graphic violence against women and a solid story. Some women are likely to find it offensive and sensitive people don't like the end, but all this is a very small unknown film.
