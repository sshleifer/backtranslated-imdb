I sometimes know it's really funny ... But the actor is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as the button. I love this example a lot and I'm almost embarrassed that the exhibition b / c has a rep. because it's really horny, but it does me well. My only problem is that sometimes it can be quite a low budget - sometimes the actors change and you have to deal with it ... Like Sabrina's dad, there are two different men in the movie ... I mean, could they just say that he was uncle or something? However, I can't love this example. Harvey and Sabrina are making a really cute couple and Salem is absolutely fun. I definitely recommend this if you are looking for some light and funny entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some seventh season ... When you get to college, Morgan joins the group and his dialogue is painful and very bad ... Plus he's ugly, so jokes about how he have only survived their good looks, had disappeared from me ... But I think it was created for the eighth season and I was really sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled!
