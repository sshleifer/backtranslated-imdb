This drama is different from Sex and the City, where women have some drinks and share their sexual encounter. It is much more personal and people can be involved. This is much more interesting and emotional at a new level than other women and their life-centered dramas like "Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle ...." <br /> <br /> Dr. Katie Roden is a secret psychologist in the dark, she feels much depressed and innocent as her 3 other friends. He is dealing with the death of his former lover, his patient, dealing with his son's progress. His blind clothes and the empty and cold house are very good at delivering their inner emotions. <br /> <br /> The widow is Trudi Malloy, who is fighting to leave her dead husband since September 11th. And when a beautiful stranger, Richard, shows him interesting, he is suddenly forced to check his reality with his friends, who say he's going back to business. The ridiculous and embarrassing encounters between Richard and Trudi are absolutely funny! It is interesting to note that Richard asks him when he will get millions of people on board on September 11 for the death of his wife. See what his intentions are. <br /> <br /> Siobhan Dillon, the lawyer is full. his husband's tactics of making love, which only involves "making a baby" (because they have difficulty getting pregnant) and he falls quickly to his colleague who offers his "services" to him too lightly and he does not hesitate for long! it is interesting to see if she continues with her husband or her husband (plays by Raza Jeffrey) Jessica, a real estate agency woman who is single and straight until she organizes a lesbian wedding and interacts with one of them. His character is shown as a brave and provocative woman who is having sex with her husband before a lesbian meeting. Allows you to see where his character is ... .... <br /> <br /> The beauty of this drama is that there are 4 completely different women with different scenarios with ambitions and obstacles. It is also good that drama shows that sometimes friends are "safe" to each other!
