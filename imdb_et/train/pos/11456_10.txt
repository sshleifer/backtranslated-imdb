Andy Goldsworthy is the first-time Taoist Master who expresses his way through his ultimate Ephemeral art. Indeed, time and changes are what his work mainly deals with. I bought my first book several years ago and my family has wondered about it several times. So it was personally, through the film, to become an artist, he was as patient and gentle as you expected, and he has some wonderful things to talk about the natural world, the deepest of which is his inability to say it in words at all. He is like most children who play alone in high field conditions (if they do more), creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they grow out of it. Mr. Goldsworthy was given a gift and mission to expand such a game to create deep visions of nature and open our often tired eyes perfectly in new ways. And always worship with extreme respect, thanks and humor, and admire the monk.
