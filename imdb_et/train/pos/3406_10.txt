In terms of visual beauty, this film is outstanding! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early. Although I didn't like it all, the whole movie is fantastic and I want to be in North Africa. The cast is great and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so attractive and I just loved her on this flick. Basil Rathbone is also ideal in this movie. I couldn't go over the landscape and the set ... The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, it's all there ... Legionaries bring the feeling of "Beau Geste" to the film. They certainly don't make such movies anymore. Don't miss this classic!
