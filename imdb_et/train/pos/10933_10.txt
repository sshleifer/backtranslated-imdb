Be careful with it. If you get your fingers on it, it will change the way you view kung-fu flicks. You now have a plot of every kung-fu movie, you want the depth and development of the characters, you are craving for mystery and unpredictability, you need dynamic camera work and incredible wallpapers. Unfortunately, you won't find all these aspects in any kung-fu movie EXCEPT with five deadly poisons! <br /> <br /> Just the best kung-fu movie ever, Venoms combines a rich plot, full of twisted, colorful (and advanced) characters with some of the best camera work that comes out of the 70s. The success of a movie's pleasant person depends on the ability of the viewer to decipher what the character is and who is specialized in the poison. One is Centipede, two are Snake, three are Scorpion, four are Lizard and five are Rooms. Each character has different characteristics, qualities, strengths and weaknesses. There's a hook, we learn with the pupil's character, explaining who these different men are. We are in his shoes (so to speak), and we have to choose who we trust and who we do not, as he does. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot, the characters, and the camera work great, it's also fun to see what in my book makes it more valuable than just about any other such movies. It is worth quite a few watches for everything that is happening. Venus is a lesson from what kung-fu really can ... just don't expect many other kung-fu movies to live on its lap.
