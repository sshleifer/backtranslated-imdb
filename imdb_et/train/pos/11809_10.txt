Dick Tracy wasn't the best for many comic books because they wanted something like Batman. Dick Tracy plays innocent because it is just a comic book that has feces that have a serious appearance and are fun. Warren Beatty directs and marks the main character who fights crime without the use of superpowers. I liked Dick Tracy because I was a child because the comic atmosphere of the main colors is red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone to watch with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays with Big Boy Caprice. Madonna as a baby, who is the second frog in this movie, doesn't play the same boyfriend she represents. As I said, there is no blood, hidden, sexual enthusiasm, or anything to offend anyone.
