A lot of the problems many people have about this movie is that they think this story should be entertaining (ignoring it in a real story) or against a movie that Che praises (what it really isn't)). This movie is very close to Jon Anderson's final bio-Che and gets this story. Soderburgh is doing an excellent job of setting the mood for the discovery of Che's Bolivia's adventure. You really have the impression that the Bolvian peasant is the whole revolutionary idea or difficulty that his men face in hunger and landscape. Sorry to get the attention of the invited movie fan, but it happened. So don't go to this movie, waiting for Rambo to shoot, its the real story!
