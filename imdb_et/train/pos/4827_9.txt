And that is why historical / biographical films are important to us all, as well as if they are as well done as it is! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "Young Victoria", I knew some things about Queen Victoria, but I finally learned a lot more about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just as big as Victoria (who thinks!) and she will probably be nominated for the Oscar this year. I personally delight him ... <br /> <br /> For technical issues, I am happy to say that this is a very successful production with excellent Art Direction / Set Decoration and, of course, as it was expected to be a terrible periodic costume design! One drawback is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen, but especially about the incredible wife and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
