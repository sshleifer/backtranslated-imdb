As another IMDB reviewer has pointed out, this movie begins a bit slowly, but gets significantly better. Yes, it is released by Roger Corman, and yes, it goes over some of the same thematic areas as much higher budget predecessors like FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON CIS. However, putting a husband's career side by side in an ever-growing blues singer's loneliness and his almost Freud's need to fill an emotional and physical "void" or "hole", while being with minimal effect and smart use of settings, is well done. Using a very small number of locations and characters and using water in almost every scene as both a cleaning and a metaphoric symbol, this film resembles, although obviously suffers from a low budget, in many ways fully realized and newer, namely the French film "SWIMMING POOL" that seems to me at least it was free to borrow some useful ideas from "UP AGAIN AMANDA". With a smaller tool kit, the UP AGAIN AMANDA maintains its temporary, fatalistic view to abandon random harsh temptations, but it is as good or better than other films in this genre. The appeal of past abuse of Amanda in the past (again very Freud) is very interesting and interesting in this genre. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction to Amanda's situation regarding this story. Cast is great, I think. <br /> <br />
