Troubled Men's Magazine Photographer Adrien Wilde (a well-played, remarkable intensity Michael Callan) is a terrible nightmare where she brutally murders her models. When cute ladies become real dead, Adrien worries that she might be a killer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman associates the tempting story at a constant pace, builds a reasonable tension, gives a few gruesomely effective wild momogeological moments of violence (a woman with a rattlesnake above her head, rates that are sure to be highlighted), refreshing the emphasis on nicely drawn and engaging real characters, causes everything from plausible everyday life and stuff things with a delicious tasty woman. Fine pain with great pain will help a lot: Joanna Pettet is a sunny, charming love for mind Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien moco's double amputee brother BJ, Seymour Cassel as Adrien's psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter, Adrien's enemy gay assistant Louis , Pamela Hensley as a Dwarf Detective Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as a Nose Police Chief and Misty Rowe as a Sweet, effervescent Model Bambi. The polished cinematography by R. Michael Stringer makes impressive use of amazing panoramic antennas. Jack Goga's malicious robbery score also makes a trick. The resurgence of fine parts is Robert Tessier, who is a gruff bartender, Sally Kirkland as a puppy whore, Kathy Shower as a tight female wrestler, B.J. grabs the ring and Frances Bay with his old old woman. A strong and enjoyable picture.
