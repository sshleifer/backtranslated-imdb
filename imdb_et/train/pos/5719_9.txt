As I have noticed with many IMDb comments, it seems that some reviewers require that every film they see is reasonably intelligent plots that bind their intelligence there. I'm not one of those people. When I watch an action film, I want to see explosions, fire and heroism. When I look at comedy, I want to have tears in my eyes. You get the idea. That's why I watch a horror movie, I want to be mostly scared. Grudge is a very scary movie, so it's a well-executed "jump" scenes and it's a horrible picture. I've been a fan of horror for years, and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argento, instead of running some of the racing wheels that they cut out these days. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. Way scarier than the original Japanese "Ring" (which I also think is a great movie).
