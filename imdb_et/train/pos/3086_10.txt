Here in Italy (I'm writing about Venice). Why Canceled? ABC should have given him the opportunity to create an audience. Cast (Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) have seen the best of the latter. We need more exhibitions that make viewers feel they are intelligent people who are not frantic drones. I hope ABC will reconsider its decision or the other station will accept it.
