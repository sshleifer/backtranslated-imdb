I have a six month old child at home and from time to time he fights badly. One morning he had a special hard time sleeping when the song of the D. Doodle band was. He stopped crying almost instantly and for the rest of the exhibition it was content. I sat on his delicate seat and watched his feet hit, holding his hands and smiling for the show. Keeps entertainment and joy all the time. I got a video about them, so sometimes, when my little person is glowing, I have something to soothe him. Recently, when he wakes up with colic to keep doodle bops out, it's not his cup of tea, but they're definitely useful when I need time for household work, etc. The biggest surprise about doodle bombs is that my child doesn't even want to see T.V. He would rather be on the floor playing with a toy or with our small toy bottle as we look at T.V. I don't know if it will continue in the future, but now it's added.
