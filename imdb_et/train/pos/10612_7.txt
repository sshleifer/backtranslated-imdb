It's cheesy, it's horrible, it's tough, but it makes it so fun. It's over the most melodic moments that are just ridiculous. This movie is great. Rent it laugh. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on about three female news publishers at a time before the mobile phone. They go to a small town to cover the festival, but they can't stay overnight. And when they meet Ernest Keller. He's a crappy Psycho. And he offers to let them stay at home. But he doesn't tell them the truth about who's living there. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is as amazing as "The Unseen" that he really carries this movie. Most of the film is kind of dull, although it is interesting to find out the truth of the Ernest family. <br /> <br /> Seeing these scenes in these scenes makes it worthwhile. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make a nice eye candy. I think the film is an old pearl that is hard to find and watch.
