I have to say that I wanted to see this movie for a long time and I wasn't disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's action is just fantastic. As part of insomniac, I can relate to how the story develops. I've never experienced anything like this, but some wakefulness overlaps with sleep and it can be scary. It was a great movie, worth every penny. I hope that one day I can work with Tess, it would be an honor and beyond. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe not small children because they can scare. But if you're like an insomniac, you understand the world, the secrets and the fear. You love it. <br /> <br /> F.
