"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of the 80's teenage films by John Hughes. Everything is done in a mysteriously painted world, where everyone is attractive, there are some easy-to-resolve conflicts that occasionally take away from the lucky procedure, and huge amounts of the plot are assembled with assemblies set against colliding pop music. But there's nothing wrong with that. "Bend It Like Beckham" is absolute treatment from start to finish. My wife and I found that cornball cheesiness won us completely, even if we were having fun, and finally, as embarrassing as it must admit, we praised (and we saw it by the way, in our lives) in the room, not in the theater. Watch this movie and have fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
