Since Rita's education, Julie Walters has been one of my examples, and her performance in this woman who helps her loving man to give birth to her feminine side is great. I would never have believed his character in the hands of a smaller actress, but Walters pulls it out with the help of evil and panic. Adrian Pasdar gives his best results to male lead.
