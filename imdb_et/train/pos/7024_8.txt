I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on it, so I thought I'd check it out. I thought it was a really nice movie and can't wait to watch it again. the actors were really good and I loved all the music! there wasn't much in the movie that first seemed a bit strange, but when I got into it, I thought the story and the actor were really emotional and meaningful and thought it left a lot to the imagination. I want to see the movie again because there was so much that I forgot a lot of small things, but I know I left the theater to think about the movie. it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique.
