If you see a pearl of such a movie, you will understand why the 80s were the biggest decade to live through. Rock music prevailed, and so did the movies ... especially the movie films. The filmmakers knew how to attract us, & "Trick or Treat" is obvious. When rocker Sammi Curr, who was probably written after W.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lawless, dies in the hotel fire, her # 1 fan Eddie is disappointed. He's going to get help from friends and local dj Nuke (Gene Simmons). Nuke gives him a copy of the last recording made by Samm; this is the only existing copy. It was given to a radio station where he can play live Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, he somehow returns Samm. He helps the Eddie school bully, but then he gets out of control. This is definitely one big movie. The bad thing is that this movie is not printed. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get out of eBay. You should also ... $$ Well spent!
