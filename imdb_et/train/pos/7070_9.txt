One of the most appealing elements of Gilliam's film is that well-behaved visual images, dissatisfied backgrounds, and willingly disappointed characters indicate creator involvement. Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is a director who receives stars or two), you can experience Terry Gilliam's experience through experience. "12 Monkeys" is proof of Gilliam's own vision and style, not of making unique films. "12 Monkey" is a variation of topics similar to Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / recessive societies, solitude of the protagonist, disillusionment with disbelief, and parallel worlds. In this film, Gilliam does a good job with blurry lines between two areas, using ambiguity to force the audience to believe rather than know. This Gilliam's tendency to miss some gaps leads to criticism of the art house's pretentiousness. The difference between Gilliam and artistic posters is that Gilliam's choice has a clear purpose and all her images have meaning. Two almost identical Cole bathing grounds at the beginning are meant for comparisons that leave the audience alone. His bald head is a sign of future world harmony in the disease state, but makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. The title itself is a sign of Gilliam's creativity, because it requires the majority of the story to be specified in its meaning. All in all, Gilliam needs a commitment to making creative films that are interesting to watch, as well as thinking and interpreting from the audience. The film has a tremendous re-tracking value, as the first time you watch it can have fine details and tips. Definitely one of my favorites.
