In the mid-1970s, the real comedy of a scary situation was a great hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared on earth. I am constantly amazed at some comedy films that have been out for a week and then disappear: HIGH QUESTION, BETTER EFFICIENCY, BLACK SHORT, DO NOT HAVE HOW ......... and have no profile at all. NORMAN was this month's comedy when in 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laugh and never ever mentioned it. Famous for shooting on a videotape and moving to a movie, NORMAN is a historically experimental politically false cabinet that shines the farce that Farrelly Brothers should look at today. If they had done so, there would be no complaints about its content and inclination. It is very funny and YES very rude and funny wrong. Just like it should. In fact, it works better today than in 1976. A movie with all these fear colors and clothes.
