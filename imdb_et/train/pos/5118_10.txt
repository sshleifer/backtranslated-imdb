******** Spoilers - careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and I've been watching it countless times - and I usually look at something new about every view. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I like is that Urban Cowboy is not a wealth of working class people living in LA or New York. Well, that's true except Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Budi, a boy from a small town in Texas, moving to Houston to work on oil fields. And that is when Travolta actually played good dramatic movies like a Saturday night, instead of playing stereotypical bad guys / good guys in big budget movies. It's really a good movie - a mechanical horse racing contest and two-stage dancing can be stupid, but you have to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with slutty brilliance) - and shortly thereafter, they are married and live in their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real fight for sex. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be a pretty cowboy. But today, the roles of men are not so clear. Where can Bud prove that he is a real man? He can do his dangerous work a day and drive with a mechanical bull at night - he may be a "city cowboy". But Sissy wants to drive his truck and he wants to drive a mechanical bull. So when it leaves Buda? As Sissy confirms his independence, he is riding on the bull and flirting with the ex-con and the prison rodeo star - a true puller -, Wes (Scott Glenn perfectly greasy). Bud is threatened and Bud and Sissy break. <br /> <br /> Sissy hangs with Wes, who abuses her. Going further, Bud turns into Pam, a rich girl whose father is in oil and it all means. Sissy comes to the trailer to clean it - Pam doesn't. He writes a letter to Bud, but evil Pam picks it up and takes credit for Sissy's housework. <br /> <br /> Bud's Uncle Bob dies tragically at work, striking a blow and causing an explosion. Bud and Sissy have the chance to come to terms, but they are too stubborn. Later, Gilley's mechanical horse riding and you know that Bud will win. Pam realizes that Bud doesn't love her, but Sissy - she did it for her. Wes tries to rob Gilleys, but you don't know that the city is a cowboy, Bud saves the day and wins the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course you can ask yourself why Bud and Sissy go to Gilleys about every night and "live like pigs." Maybe it contributed to their bad marriage. Or why Bud wasn't Pam - he wasn't so bad and money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why did Buddha and Siss have such foolish friends as Marshall and Jessie, who always tried to break them: Marshall tells Buddie, "He {Sissy} is driving this bull better than you!" But part of Urban Cowboy's fun is a bit of fun - and saying it isn't Bonnie Raitt on stage!
