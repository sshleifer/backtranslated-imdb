This is one of the biggest movies you may even have the biggest movie ever. I had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years. Until I saw ADGTH on TV and it reminded me of memories when I was a little boy. And when I looked at it a couple of nights ago, I became addicted to the film. Usually I don't like animated family movies, but it's special, it's a perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> Stopping the movie always touches my heart and saddles me very much, but it makes this movie amazingly better than all the garbage that comes out today for a child's films. I mean, the movie is called G and it's about 2 dogs that are involved in gambling, the movie has a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell. What I believe makes the film great. I mean, movies don't bring reality to kids and they made the movie. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
