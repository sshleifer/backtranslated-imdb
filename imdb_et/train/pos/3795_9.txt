After watching this movie at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a speech (Q&A) about a film that presented his ironic situation: how to get a film depicting minorities (women, non-white) who deal with controversial issues (teenage pregnancy, teenage maternity, racial identity, single parent households) and how to write a faithful script on all those topics that are the thirty-white white man. The multi-racial, multi-gender, mostly adult, was attacked by the fantastic story of the film, the detailed characters and the fantastic image of "real teenage life". Most teenagers, however, had left the building - led me to think that this was the film that was best viewed by the children, which was the starting point of the debate, as many adults felt there, "the film should be seen by teenagers because it is about them." can we get it? The internet (retail) would be a great way - this is a film that is buried like "boys" or other radical modern teenage movies - and McKay seemed sensitive. Concerning his credit as a writer / director, McKay was sensitive and detailed in his work - associating himself with the Crown Heights neighborhood, where the film was set up, working with actors to portray the characters in their vision of what they thought they were - rejecting the results is realistic.
