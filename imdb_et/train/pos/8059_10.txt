I just saw this movie on Turner's classic movies last night and was talking about Victor McLaglen's performance: Every word was "tour de force". The 1922 Dublin atmosphere, created through cinematography and product development, really showed the methods used in the best cinematographic works of the early 40s and early 50s. Very nice attention to detail, too, during the awakening of Frankie McPhillip (Wallace Ford), prayers of all the praying Gaelic language. Max Steiner's result is unforgettable. As in later films, such as GWTW of 1939, he separated folk balls to give local color and place and time. John Ford: already a movie giant in 1935!
