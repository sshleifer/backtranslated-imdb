First of all, no one understands why this film is so badly appreciated. Not only is this the first real terrible movie that has been for me for a very long time, who has been hard-boiled with decades of experience of horror, starting with driving blinded ghosts (ghost trains) as a child. Secondly, the main actor is Cheri Christian's face, which gives hope that she will be the leading actor in the big images of the future. Thirdly, this woman is tremendously beautiful that I would recommend directors to leave all those Cameron Diases, Eva Mendezes, and ever the names of these short-lived bulbs. Mrs Christian is not easy, but the sun. <br /> <br /> However, "dark residues" are also of significant metaphysical importance. They think that photographs show the beings of dominance between reality and intermediate imagination that are not visible to their own eyes are not new. But I've never seen in the film that these creatures are only visible to people in photos and only at certain times. This means that the photo is not only an iconic image of reality (for which reality becomes a sign), but becomes an alternative to reality that can change as real reality becomes. Changing a character means that it affects the captured objects, ie the character behaves like an object. Now, in our usual world of perception, it is common for things to change signs. F.ex., when someone grows a bird, his photo shows him a beard, not without, as before. On the contrary, changing objects using characters would mean that a photo of a beard is first and only a beard will grow a man. This is a very simple case that happens in a prison in films made by the main character in this movie. This is new, and we must be grateful for all the new horror films that usually repeat and reorganize the well-known effects and functions that are usually known after a quiet time.
