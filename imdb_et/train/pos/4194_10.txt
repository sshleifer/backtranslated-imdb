Samuel Fuller brings his usual playful and stylish direction to this fruitful and fruitful story and is able to create one of the 1950's cinema from undiscovered gems. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark plays a small ride. a lot of movies) that grabs a young lady's (Jean Peters) wallet on the New York subway and hence the much desired microfilm. It's 1953, so the microfilm is, of course, the property of Commie spies who can't get back. When a girl appears on Widmark's shoreline, sent by a malicious boy to get back to the movie, Widmark feels the opportunity to shake her and her "comrades" for great money. The plot thickens, people begin to die, Widmark and Peters fall in love. <br /> <br /> Fuller is an embarrassing love story, but more indifferent than a bad writing or direction. It would have been like a love story that would have been deliberately unbelievable because love stories were so often and still in Hollywood movies. Peters gives a remarkable result as a tough New Yawk cookie, part of a gangster minor and a partially distressed girl. If there is violence against him, we really take care of his well-being and it is typical of Fuller's renegade, his age-style style, that a happy ending may not necessarily be direct. <br /> <br /> "Pickup on South Street" is a highly successful feisty lady of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, making money in any way so that it sells the neck or acts as a police informant to the world tired shoulders. Ritter gives his career; in a breathtaking monologue, he transmits, without ever being directly involved with the sadness of all his character's life, and the hopelessness he wakes up every morning to fight, into crime and hardship. It would be like every Ritter would have played in one short moment to give all the emotions the air they could not open in these other films. The scene is the highlighting of Fuller's film and the highlighting of the 50-year-old cinema. <br /> <br /> Rating: A +
