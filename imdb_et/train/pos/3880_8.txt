Well, starters, it was actually the most elegant Clausen movie on that date. <br /> <br /> The man always felt a sense of humor for them, but I think he adds the film's dimension, which is parallel to what he used to do. His work - in very black n 'white words - is accepted by a broad, but not critical audience, and we have always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a clear way to give the audience the message he needs to say. <br /> <br /> "Villa Paranoia" surprised the first-ever, insignificant minorities with wisdom and respect. Not only ethnic, but also ordinary people you think of in Jutland - a country - it deals with the question of the lack of eternal love, but in a close and sometimes brutal direction that keeps you looking and keeping you focused. yourself manage to play ab ****** d! A real b ***** d who wants the right thing, but he has no idea how to get there, and people therefore suffer. /> I have to say that this is one of the best films I've seen this year, and I look forward to seeing her next.
