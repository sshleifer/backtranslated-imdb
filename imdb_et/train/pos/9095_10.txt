A captivating, funny movie that gets a grade-grade grade. I recently saw this movie at work. It was so nice to see this movie unlike all the scary horror movies I see every day. So much I thought I was writing. Not sure if this movie goes to the theater, but I hope it works. This is a nice movie to see with friends, its magic, and funny jokes. Action was terrible (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf. Leadership was pretty good (not a movie that was supposed to be overly targeted). rhythm. As a reversing scriptwriter, I notice these things! (I am a dork) Anyway, a really cute movie I recommend.
