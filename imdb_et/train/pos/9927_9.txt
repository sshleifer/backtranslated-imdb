Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who gets her lifestyle because of the boredom of a tombstone. He joins two co-painters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and starts with adventures. The script is good. Very down-to-earth and film-like realistic. The only problem with this movie was that it focused on the different things they did, not the Domino character. <br /> <br /> Even that is why Kiera Knightley gives a close look. He shows the right anger and commitment at this stage. Mickey Rourke follows his Oscar in "Sin City" performance with another tough. Edgar Ramirez really does nothing but speak Spanish every time and staring at the treadmill. Delroy Lindoi gives a good supportive result. Mo'Nique was himself, although he surprised me in one particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes. <br /> <br /> The best thing about film is, however, the direction. Tony Scott's fast paced style brings the movie to life. Cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen. It takes a normal movie and puts the acid. All blacks are darker, whites are brighter and have a green glow. Action scenes are inspiring. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll love Domino.
