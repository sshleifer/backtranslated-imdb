At first I didn't think Ben Affleck could really pull a funny Christmas loan, the boy was wrong, my daughter called me to see it with him and I wasn't disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, "I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O 'Hara was good too, that's what I was really sold to," I think too, with my family, people you barely see but once or twice a year , and probably not going to get along with it, you really need as much alcohol as you can handle the system at Christmas, so I thought the assumption was good, buying a $ 250,000 family was a bit far from the side, but it turned out to me pretty good because it was a riot that shows the class struggle of different families. it has many funny moments, including the embarrassing thing for teenage boys. All in all, I loved this movie and look at it again at Christmas or earlier when my daughter wants it.
