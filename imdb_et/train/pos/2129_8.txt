A lovely romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullivan who write love letters to each other without anyone knowing who the other is. Of course, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's beautifully worked all over (especially Sullavan, Stewart, and Frank Morgan), is wisely a sensible script and seems completely stunning. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing I could see Budapest! Everything seems so perfect and dreamy. One kind of movie. Don't miss it!
