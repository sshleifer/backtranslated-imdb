The secret of watches is the film I've been waiting for years after I saw the material in the Kilkenny Cartoon Salon early. I'm here to tell you that it's been waiting. Cartoons are highly stylized, but not outrageous as I was afraid. The whole film is beauty and great imagination, especially I love an animated, illuminated book, where small numbers live on the page. Characterization is great, I love Brendan Gleeson's voice as stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of sprite Aisling. The forest is a triumph, so beautiful place. The story is well realized, a combination of facts and fantasy. and really draws the viewer to Brendan to rejoice in finding suitable materials for his book. I am still a lover of calligraphy and lighting, so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who have seen it and who are not handicraft fans agree that this is a cute little movie. I will definitely buy a DVD when it is released and I would like to say well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. Could be much more. :) Going back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the happiness of the Oscar world, so glad to see it.
