I was very fond of this movie. It kept me away just before the end of what would happen. One of the best movies about the partition I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is also great. This is one of the most personal and underground movies I've seen on the partition. It's a little less mainstream than Gadar, and it's really an emotional skateboarder, where you start with one opinion on what's going on and coming out to the other side. This is not a typical Bollywood price, but rather an art type film. The best part of this movie is that it does not damage one partition conflict when focusing on another story. It does not blame or cost, but allows you to draw conclusions about things.
