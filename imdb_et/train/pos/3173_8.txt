Imagination is a wasteful thing to waste ... especially if you have talented actors. Writer / Director Jones does not waste time on the viewer's main character. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will laugh. Anyone who has arrived while a girl meets a ticket on her windshield just cries. We all wanted to rob a terrible toupee from the man's head. These are just the ones that are recorded when you watch "Cross Eyed", a hearty movie that should be for Jones and his funny sense of humor both in front of and behind the camera.
