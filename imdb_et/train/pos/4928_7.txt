Considering the time of its release, the story that was broken in 1950 in the thriller "Panic in the Streets" was hardly surprising. The body of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and is going to be found only until further investigation by the public health inspector, who claims that the body carries the plague of bubbles. But with today's world of drama, it strangely makes this movie credible to today's viewers. Cast and team are flawless. Richard Widmark in his first role after his breakthrough "Night and the City", Jack Palance in his cool film debuted in this film starring Paul Douglas and young (and quite cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. The remaining unchecked non-professional actors (typical director Kazan) fill the remaining slots. Elia Kazan leads Joe MacDonald's films (later worked with Widmark later, much better "Pickup on South Street") and great Alfred Newman appreciates it. Almost all of the participants here have done a better job, but "Panic on the Streets" is a promising one. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast.
