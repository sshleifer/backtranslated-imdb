Mother's Day is one of my favorite novels and I see that I was expecting great disappointment. Instead, I received a film that perfectly depicts irony, humor, injustice, and above all the sadness of the Vonnegut novel. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best result of Nolte so far. He hits Howard Cambelli Jr. win and self-esteem your speech from subtle intonations, keeping in mind the tears behind your eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is absurdly fun like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee refutes his separation from reality as Cambelli's younger lover. John Goodman is underestimated and more effective than Cambelli's "Blue Fairy Tale". <br /> <br /> This Pinnocioesque story from Cambell, who is trying to be his ideal hero and involuntarily his ideal tragic wool, is a mature and lively look at what we are human. And besides, it's one of the deepest romantic movies I've ever met. Cambell is the embodiment of both foolish and wise love. And in the movies where it is a painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy because his blue fairy tale gives him his desire. And he realizes that ... we look at the movie and see. <br /> <br /> My mother-in-law is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made. It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deeply into our emotions and is faithful to the original author.
