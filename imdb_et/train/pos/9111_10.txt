"Capitães de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 Revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. The story of fiction is not very interesting, but it does not break the film. The activities of Captain Salgueiro Maia's heroes are not exaggerations and the film is a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia is still one of the greatest heroes of the April 25 revolution. <br /> <br /> All actors are very good and even the smallest roles play wonderfully. Lisbon looks beautiful like never before. Don't miss it! I really liked this movie.
