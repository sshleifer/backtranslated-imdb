OK - you want to try someone about how comfortable they are in adolescence and embarrassing and manic changes - then get their immediate reaction by looking at this terrifying dock for children who make socially important horror flowers in the 80s of the suburbs. More than any movie I've ever seen, the film deals with the encumbrance of sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human, never boring, and rubbed into the youth of nature that is frightening to the unchanging color of the adult world. young people have managed to accredit something crazy about the perverted. It seems that the Mini-mogul Darren Stien will come to a deeper understanding of his triumphs and worries as a patriarch of a strict child world. What she finds about herself and others is not always quite beautiful - but she shows how to age and reconcile with age. What does thinking mean without thinking. I love this movie.
