It is a FBI entertainment history, but it should be seen as a fiction because it is exactly what it is. What more could be done if Mr Edgar Hoover personally approved and had sympathy for the production. James Stewart is excellent, as usual, and supportive cast, except for talentless Vera Miles, is good. Murray Hamilton is a very good Stewart partner and best friend. The FBI's achievements, which the film emphasizes, are undoubtedly true. What matters is what it excludes. One of the most disgraceful parts of the film is the depiction of the murder of John Dillinger. It is pretty much depicted as it happened, but Melvin Purvis, the head of the Chicago office who led the operation, is not mentioned at all. Instead, the operation is depicted as if the fictional Chip Hardesty had done it. It has been said that Hoover was jealous of Purvis's death after Dillinger; Then Purvis was transferred to a far outpost and soon after, the FBI left. There is no doubt why the Purvis movie was never mentioned. But this viewer stopped at least thinking that if Purvista was treated in this way, how are all the agents who carried out all the other operations depicted in the film. They were ignored and replaced with fancy Hardesty. <br /> <br /> The film is probably accurate when it depicts the FBI until the end of World War II. But after that, in the film, we believe that the only threat that the United States faces is from international communism, which is no doubt what Hoover believed. Don't forget the mafia. Remember that lunch is still in the south. Do not forget that black was intimidated to keep them voting in the south. I don't know if the FBI had started setting up Martin Luther King by the time this film was made, but if not, it wasn't very long after that. <br /> <br /> As I said at the beginning, this is pretty good entertainment, but it should be seen as disinfected fiction.
