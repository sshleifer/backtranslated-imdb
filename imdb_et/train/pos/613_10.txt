please, future writers, manufacturers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> has never seen such a bold and original story created on a big movie screen. bold, because the script kept going so many fantasy movies safely - step into something new, creative and bold. just when you think "oh, I've seen it before" or "I'm sure it's happening now" - StarDust makes an unexpected twist and adds you more and more of the story. <br /> <br /> The actors are great - even the smallest part is made with a talent that fills me with the creators of this movie. Robert De Niro is proud and performs such energy that he just steals the exhibition in every scene he is. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch and Claire Danes is a great choice for innocent and loving stars, Yvaine. Other big names are prominent roles. I had the stuff that everyone was trying to do for my movie. But once again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he "invented" for this universe - are just outstanding. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie today, before the official release. and I hope it will be a great success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments and loving fragile scenes. Vision in Yvaine's eyes, Captain Shakespeare's "Frivolities", Lamia's Passion, Witch - Impressive, Unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me this is a more fun movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy it <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Outstanding <br /> <br /> Peace and Love
