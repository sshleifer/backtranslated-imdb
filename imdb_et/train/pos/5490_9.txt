This is really an incredible movie. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous peoples and liberated people to obtain their legitimate voice, but also shows the United States of its dishonesty, contempt and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very courageous and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be described as a despicable elite with no sense of proportionality or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup in contrast to what they saw before. <br /> <br /> And in cross hairs we see the US pulling strings again and blurring reality. It is the heart splitting to look at the early stages of the resurrection, knowing perfectly well that the humiliation we feel is a tool that American governments and their seemingly poor citizens have been using for a long time. The film clearly shows that it is not a manipulation of the TV or general game, but the active documentation of the people and the government that fights for its future. A truly mobile experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our thanks. Elagu Chavez. <br /> <br /> We need to understand that every country must be allowed to choose its own government and develop in a way that most people find fit. The first step in this process is the need to know the realities of the situation, and this documentary does it very well.
