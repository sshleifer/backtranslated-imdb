Not to mention the possible schedule and budget, the films came out much better than you would have expected, certainly much more true for Peter O'Donnell's books and comic books than the previous two films. You can now read the Titan Books Reprint or Comics Revue on a monthly basis. This is the biggest adventure comic ever. The film is not big, but unlike most low-budget movies, it does the most to what it got, and it keeps your interest. In the DVDs, there is an interview with Quentin Tarentino, who is probably stoned, gas. Some people have accused Tarentino of associating their name with the film, but without him it would never have been done. He is a modest fan of Blaise and chose a good writer and director. All things worth 8 stars.
