The cat and mouse are involved at normal times when Jerry dives into an invisible ink bottle and finds that it makes him disappear. Instead of seizing the opportunity to spy on a woman's dressing room or something else, she uses her new invisibility discovered to torture Tom. And it's pretty funny and quite inventive, though it's a bit of a fun comic. And it never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually the lower-than-average T&J shorts. Still worth 7/10. <br /> <br /> But I'm not sure how the invisible mouse keeps the wall shade, it breaks the physics and is the invisible nature.
