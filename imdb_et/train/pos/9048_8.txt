I couldn't see this movie and I understand why it wasn't a big hit in theaters. "October heaven" seems and seems so familiar. And that is. All films - and perhaps even better - have been studied for all plot contractions and emotions. But despite being sensitive and resilient to all Hollywood formulas, this film has won and enjoyed every step of the way. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this heart, mind, and soul journey. Like Steven Sondheim's music MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG, the characters stood agape at his apartment roof, hoping it would launch his new generation ("What do you call it? You call it a miracle."), Sputnik has a similar effect on the young rocket boys of this true story. Though the townspeople abandoned in their 1950s coal city rejects this event, Homer Hickham Sputnik sees his ticket out of the mines life. <br /> <br /> Mastery and casting make the rocket boy Homer and his palettes journey fresh and new. Homer young school teachers who are in difficulty are particularly affected. A significant limitation is shown in the representation of these delicate relationships. Also noteworthy is the father / son who anchors the film. Perfectly played. Even Homer's mother gets her moment without a clich√© or invasion. His ultimatum to his wife is both dignified and warm. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> The bigger the video chain that I despise is a sign next to this movie that confirms that you love this movie or send money back. Once I agree with them. You never look at the sky in October quite the same way. <br /> <br />
