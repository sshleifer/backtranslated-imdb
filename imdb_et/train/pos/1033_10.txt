Say what you do about schmaltz. One of the beauty of this movie is that it is not American. It is a moral that some Americans are called to high goals and how they rose. It's inspiring because it's a noble target. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother of Bette Davis). As Fanny says, "We have been shocked by magnolias." <br /> <br /> In today's political climate, led by the President, who shamelessly lied to us and used the qualities of the absolute worst Human Beings in 9/11, we dropped to 9/11 to find the level of bleeding. It is not all possible to blame Mr Bush - ultimately, we promised him to lead us in that direction and even chose him again after exposing his lies. Now, with full justification, we have been kidnapped by our Americans all over the world. <br /> <br /> Today we look at this film with a new awareness: that the arrival of the Nazis in Germany was not due to a lack of German character, but a human error that allows us to rationalize something that justifies our immoral and frightening action. I don't compare George Bush with Adolf Hitl. But I draw attention to how the leader can whip us into the frenzy of fear, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is a jailbreaker who does everything he has to do for his generation, no matter how immoral, the leaders of our country, the ones who support them, and those who have their head they are buried in the sand that they cannot even vote. br /> <br /> Film, like Watch on the Rhine, reminds us of what we once tried to be - the power of humanity improvement - and that we have it inside us to strive for high goals again. > <br /> Geoff
