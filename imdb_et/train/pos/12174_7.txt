I think dealing with this movie is that it has really funny moments for about 2 minutes and it makes a very good trailer and many people came with a trailer with expectations and this time the movie trailer does not live. It is a bit slower and slows this exciting assumption a little bit slowly, and I think I see the comments people love / hate about this movie. <br /> <br /> But if you look at this movie, what it is and not what it could have read for cast talents, I think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly a star, she's so dirty and carefree to make everyone else compliant, she just glows and the whole audience loves her with Lee. The rest, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled colleagues, his elegant mother, his dirty friend Jim and his bride - all do a good job of matching stereotypes and boredom that make Stiles stand out. <br /> <br /> Lee does not live in his costumes, I do not believe, but you could see that so much that they are hard to live. Perhaps this is one source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film itself, despite the somewhat slow and some jokes that aren't as funny as the writer's planned, is still pretty funny and I found an intelligent film. The topics of compliance and the "safe route" seemed to be good for each other. For example, there was a whole motive of depicting scenarios, but would never work for them before the last scene, or how he listened to the radio program on the road, how everyone responded, or how all the characters of Selma Blair and Julia Stiles said and did that one person is a safe choice and one is a risky choice. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about the movie was that it was a kind of screw comedy where Jason Lee had to stick through the movie and who played a fool (for example, a pharmacy guy who turns out to be a good cook) and some of the skills he gets from it mostly away. <br /> <br /> Although it wasn't as funny as I expected and had a bit of a dead talent, but in general it's still a good movie.
