This movie got terrible comments, but because it was amazing and because critics usually don't get "stuck", I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, they were quite right in this case. <br /> <br /> The film also has an awkward feeling that is most off. The feeling that is impossible to describe, but it is not good. To further confuse things, the script is a dull target that is only vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> The tremendously talented Thurman just runs through this confusion that makes little effort. Hurt and Bracco are trying to add nothing to the film in an enthusiastic way, but there is nothing in the script. Maybe it was less embarrassing for them to have chosen only Thriman's deviation and over. <br /> <br /> One thing the "reputable" film critics did not mention is that the movie is actually quite funny. Whether it is the exact satire moments or the somewhat extraordinarily strange moments when the cowgirls are hurting off the hurt with their scents, they are not washed ... ahem ... front north. <br /> <br /> Chortles gathered all the time, although I wouldn't recommend this movie, there is entertainment that was needed and even looking at Cowgirls. Get the Blues is worth something else.
