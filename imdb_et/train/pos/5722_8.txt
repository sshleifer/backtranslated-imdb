It was great. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the most terrifying film I've ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was terrible, atmospheric and terrible. When my mother responded to the Japanese version of the bed, I had almost a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would shake and Buffy would take away the dark, horrible nuances of the original version. I don't have to worry. The makers of this film wisely kept the same Japanese people who came with the original film, and gave the film the same person. They put it in Japan in the same place, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director took the pain to make the same film as it was in the original, the only difference being casting American actors. It really became useful as it added "Strangers in a Strange Land" to the general horror. They were worshiped not only by an absolutely frightening and relentless ghost, but also by a completely foreign country where they had difficulty integrating into society. It just added the general anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was a great touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy really does a great job. She looks vulnerable and is able to pass her fear well. There are no clever remarks that would be so common with American horror or one-liner, which would reduce the overall darkness and horror of the characters. In fact, it was just as good as the Ring, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I hope that the future of the American horror will follow Japan's new horror, which began with the incredible success of Ring. Finally, we get movies that can actually be classified as "Horror"! 8/10
