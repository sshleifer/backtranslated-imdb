Three Stooges have always been some of the many actors I loved. I love almost all of the short they've done. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are fun and also celebrate many other great actors and actors, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, the three Stooges are one of the greatest actors and are always a more comedy team! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is nothing more than Husbands! All these short are beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great shows here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a very fun short. There are another three Stoogos that are short, called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!
