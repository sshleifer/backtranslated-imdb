Andy Griffith plays his role again in this CBS movie, though not in the movie. The plot is simple - Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and children scatter her ashes, the place she called (hills somewhere). Although it can never be seen on television and the video is not published if you have the opportunity to watch it - TAKE IT.
