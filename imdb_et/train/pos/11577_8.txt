It was really a cool movie. Simply proves that making a movie does not require stupid things like continuity and scripts. It passes through the continents in seconds, people shoot and nothing happens to them, fire swords, samuari fighting for sinking galleons, David Essex is slimey villainy and John Rhys Davies is just a guy. I liked this movie, but I like s ** t movies, this is a great example of a very cinematic movie that just KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you will love this movie, its alternation, fast, stupid, samuaraitaste !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> As it would have been done in 1972
