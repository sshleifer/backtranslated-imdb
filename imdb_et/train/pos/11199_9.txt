Sometimes, reading some of Hitchcock's less well-known films is growing, because almost everyone starts with someone who says that this movie is extremely neglected or is hidden from Hitchcock's pearl or a real Hitchcock big or some other - if only - people - either - watch - this - they - see - that - this - is - great - Hitchcock - movie - just - so - much - like - Vertigo - North - Northwest - Psycho - behind - window - So I would like to say I would like to say that if - only - people - look - that - they - would see - that - it - is - great - hitchcock - the movie - just like - a lot - like - vertigo - north - northwest - psycho - behind - window - etc. <br /> <br /> Now that may be a bit overwhelming, the Ring is in no way imaginative. in the same league as any of the above-mentioned films, but compared to other movies Hitchcock did in the late 1920s and early 1930s, I think it is â€¢ Ring is one of the best photographs and presentations of most of them. Almost as a new director, there are some amazing dream and brilliant editing segments that show why Hitchcock received so much attention at the beginning of his career. <br /> <br /> It is allowed that the movie starts with things, the very disruptive spectrum of the idiotic black circus performer (and I use the idiot definitely, as Stephen King does so often), where eggs and fruits are thrown to him by the crowd white people. I think it only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were at that time, but I think it's one of the Hitchcock movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock out one person, but when he meets, he is the one who challenges his power not only in the boxing ring but also around the woman's finger. This is the beginning of an entertaining, if not very tense, challenge for the love of a woman who seems cumbersome and pointless to one man to another. <br /> <br /> (Spoilers) There is a scene where her husband looks at him when he has fallen home at night and just before going to the building, he is construed to kiss the car. This kiss has never been explained and it is also a fact that even if she proves her loyal or at least finally chooses her, they look at each other's eyes but can't really kiss. br /> The film is certainly beautifully captured, even more than the many films Hitch released in the years to come. Gordon Harker's performance is also one of Jack's coaches who, with his stone-faced expressionism, quite often reminds me of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves a little unclear, but this is a great example of his early work.
