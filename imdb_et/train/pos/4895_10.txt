It's rare that I sit in front of a TV to watch a specific program. It's even rarer when I finally enjoy the program, but the last Blond Bombshells was one of the best films I thought. <br /> <br /> A remarkable cast of Dame Judi Denchi and Ian Holm and a wonderful, witty and poignant script that makes it a truly satisfying experience. I can't really express how good I thought it is, so I'm not trying, I'm just saying if you get a chance, PLEASE SEE! I hope it comes out of the video.
