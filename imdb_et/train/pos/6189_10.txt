Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley creates a film for Syria while retaining its signature idiosynthetic style. Fusion is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Having seen Hal Hartley's film for about ten years, I turned to it with care. The superb productions of the nineties made critics and audiences unique in their style and dialogue. The director's earlier films had colorful characters, and they gave attentive and meaningful attention to life observations - often in the Long Island region of New York or New York. <br /> <br /> My initial caution about the description of this movie as a "spy-thriller". It was a surprise to me that Hartley managed to put a network of very original international intrigue into his network with his well-established style and focus. It works more than you could imagine. The Hartley film retains the focus and focus of the marks, which are its trademarks, with a singular cinematic style. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is very relevant in view of the current global situation and the war situation, supported by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to a new - political film - worthy of mentioning in the same spirit as Syria. Truly, he has come to him. The work makes fine interpretation of Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans see him in full bloom here, with us and more mature and prouder than before.
