I was never buggy when I was watching a movie, it was meant for an idiot box. I always thought it was a very successful movie in the late 90s. But after I saw on the Internet that it was meant for television, I was surprised because the television movie is absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> What I was most concerned about was length. I felt that one battle scene should have been removed because it was totally unnecessary. It also began to drag to the end, as it seemed like the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> The plus side has a strong, very interesting and enchanting plot that has great productions for everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze seemed a little haggard. I also thought that Gogol, who looked at dementia, turned a bit stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also, the first half of the movie would have given me this movie a. 9. Yet it's a great movie for television. 8 out of 10.
