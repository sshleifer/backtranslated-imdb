The first installment of this infamous horror rhythm presents a woman who has been abducted by black men who torture her several days before she is finally killed. He was beaten terribly, spun around the chair, finger nails pulled, the animal's gut thrown over him, poured hot boiling water and finally sprayed with his eyeball with a needle (really sick and nasty scene). The creator of this unforgettable torture exhibition tried to make it as real as possible, and for me this one is the closest thing to sniffing, which you can kill without a shot. Of course, some special effects are pretty poor, but the idea of ​​making snuff is pretty tough. I've also seen "meat and blood flowers" which are more gory and sadistic, but less disturbing.
