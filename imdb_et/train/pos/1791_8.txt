It's not a deep film; Most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "tried and true", but it worked well and made interesting points about what we could regret (our "mistakes" when the film calls them) when we look back on our lives. I hadn't read the book, so it didn't know much more than the story of a dying woman who has long had strong memories that she hadn't really shared with anyone. Luckily, they got top-notched ... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays young Lila and then Meryl appears as an old lilac at the end of the movie ... maybe not quite with your mother's caliber, but who is?) All of the others in this movie were good, though I want Glen Close to have been more and thought Buddy's character was too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more for girls than for boys, but it's good to see your mother or your daughter and maybe start some dialogue. How difficult it really is to feel a parent than a "person"!
