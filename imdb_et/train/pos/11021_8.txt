After Die Hard's success and success, it is not surprising that in the 1990s, the wrong wrong man, the wrong place, the wrong time concept, was in the movies of "Die Hardi ... ...". That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard Hill just in time to save Sly 'Stop or my mother to shoot' Stallone's career. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one big funny dream, especially for those who are experts in mountaineering, base jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all, it is full of excuses for firing a movie as one of the overcrowded spam. Stallone even managed to get out of the horse! But if you forget everything, it's actually a very cute and undeniable entertainment that offers so much excitement and a lot of unintentional smiles. <br /> <br /> You have to love John Lithgow's greed in evil, his mark on each of the badger box band and the best, permanently harassing and unhappy "turncoat" agent, Rex City as Travers. <br /> <br /> He may be a portrait of Henry 'Serial Killer' but Michael Rooker is a remarkably worthy performer than Hal, he insists that he will strike painfully incredibly against his prisoners that he will never hurt anyone. although he definitely can't, he really looks like Ralph Waite's Frank character grabs when a girl pushes to death. <br /> <br /> Craig Fairbrass, a former London burner, also has to be mentioned as a British halban who comes to the farm while using Hali as a football, Yeah, you can't enjoy it a little, Hal needed a good shot. <br /> <br /> So forget your better judgment, who cares about whether "it may never happen", lower your hopes for action, increase volume and enjoy! And if you are looking for Qaulen, he is the one who carries the helicopter.
