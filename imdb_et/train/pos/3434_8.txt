If an Australian post office ever needs a recruitment film, that's it. This is one of those movies that are in the right place in the heart and can be viewed over and over again. Miranda's performance concerns, because it shows the Australian aspect that many Europeans portray, because it can be cold, wet and dark, just as everywhere else, and like everywhere else, the people around you are important. The film's characters are warm and friendly, and the career prospects move to the "dead letter office" that is thought to be. Miranda has made bigger films, but I hope she always keeps that idea inside?
