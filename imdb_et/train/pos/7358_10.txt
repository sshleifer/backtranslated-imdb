One of the most provocative films with excellent cinematography supported by Mc Clarens Lisp and stunning quotation "do you believe in love on the first site?" <br /> <br /> This picture showed traces of expressionism, catapulting the film with flawless integrity. Gabby (AKA Joey) played by Eva Longoria clearly loved the film and the role she played so much that she couldn't even film. Lol. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie should undoubtedly be the heroic rescue of the MC hero by rescuing the speech disability of the young "Disabled" child. acted perfectly! The use of James Cahil's sound effects is unbalanced to this day. The drug bust that it fills in at an early stage of the film is painfully realistic pain. When I first watched this movie, I was so compelled to pay tribute to Gang Inthus's brothers Southside Gang and CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). It was certainly one of the most encapsulating images of Cahill, who is committed to filming. <br /> <br /> Personally, this film has a sentimental value for me and I will download it in the near future. Thats if I can find it, LOL!
