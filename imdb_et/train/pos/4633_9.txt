Here is another beauty in the series of beautiful films staged by Eytan Fox. The film introduces the story of today's Tel Aviv starred lovers (one of Israel, one of Palestine). The effectiveness of the film is not only due to the depiction of ethnic ethnic conflict, but also to the personal and political conflicts of ethnic groups. For example, there is a moment when one of the secondary characters who are publicly gay is visited by his boyfriend in the hospital, who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his family member, and suddenly we see discomfort. wash through the room. It is obvious that the young man is not as open as he looks, and the family is not as accepting as he might wish, while the boy is confused and rejected. A lot of complexity is packed until a short moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is the master of packing emotional and psychological complexity into short sequences. The film is also effective evenly, so that it is a brutal interplay between Israel and the Palestinians. If you are not heartless, you cry through the last third of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how good melodrama can be.
