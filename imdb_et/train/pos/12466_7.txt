When Jean Renoir's first film "Destiny Bubble" takes us to the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasants he continues, it just seems that his second film mostly deals with the rich and privileged, the upper class and those who are trying to grab their way up. Put the first two characters of the movie together and you have her "Grand Illusion" and "Game Rules". It's beautifully filmed, the troubled camera makes full use of the amazingly large apartments and back areas that dominate the interior of the movie, and show, though often burnt, also offering great moments, especially Werner Krauss' Muffat. But the glamorous and suffocating Mrs. Hessling, who at first seems to be able to give Louise Brooks money in vampishness, never goes beyond one sign, selfish intimidation. Perhaps this is partly a problem with a script, which seems to be mostly for high scores and outraged emotions; without reading the novel, it is not quite clear whether the choices were well made or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between Nana's fumes are well drawn and especially liked by the muffat relationship and Jean Angelo Vandeuvres - the tragic perceptions that everyone seems to have their ultimate destiny and compassion with each other, especially at the bottom of this huge staircase, where Venduvre Muffat warns , and we do not know whether the violence breaks - and this and the effort of the ridiculous ridiculous ideals give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far away from your biggest achievement and probably just a general "destiny bubble". is still worth a look at Renoir fans or silent cinema enthusiasts.
