James J. Corbett, a world-heavyweight 1892-1897 champion, turned out to be a favorite with Errol Flynin. He may not have used the sword or be in the West. She grew into fatigue and she said in her autobiography that she felt she was in western relations and didn't understand why people liked it. This is an enjoyable movie, but almost doesn't tell James J. Corbett's real story. <br /> <br /> As shown, Corbett was the first heavyweight boxer, the man who used the brains and accelerated the winning win. He won John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons a heavyweight crown. She was also a compulsive female woman and there was a lot like her man. Of course it was not shown on the screen. As a character that Alexis Smith plays, his bankrupt girl has no basis in reality. Corbett was actually twice married and was severely unfaithful to both spouses. <br /> <br /> Even after he lost his title and after the end of this event, he suffered a great personal tragedy. At the time of his father's depression, probably over finances, because he lost a lot of money from his son to win Bob Fitzsimmons, fired his mother and then turned the weapon himself. Murder / suicide barely speaks of the happy clan led by Alan Hale. One thing I liked with Gentleman Jim. Ward Bond got his life playing John L. Sullivan. Director Raoul Walsh got a great performance from Bond, but it was lovely Sullivan. Even if some of Sullivan's bad points that don't do it like rabbis racism, Bond's portrayal is John L. and the best thing about Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> Talking about racism, one thing that should have been said, was that Sullivan and the master refused to meet Peter Jackson, who was black and from Australia, and probably the best heavyweight of his time. I'm probably saying that as the challenger Corbett met him and fought for 61 rounds to lead. It fights more than any other claimed the match of Sullivan-Corbett. Of course, when Corbett was a champion, he refused Jackson's title. Maybe he didn't want another 61 round marathon with someone who could have been better on that day. <br /> <br /> Gentleman Jim is not a story of Jim Corbett, a movie by Errol Flynn that plays James J Corbett. But Corbett would have lived in 1942, he would undoubtedly have loved the film and loved the depiction of Flynn's life. It's like he wanted to remember.
