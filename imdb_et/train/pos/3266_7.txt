Another Downey must see! If you are a fan of obsession with me, you have to see this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale Grad, who realizes that the life he just came is the life he left 26 years earlier. Alex is the revival of a nonsense lawyer, Louie Jeffries, who has been happily married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed on their one-year anniversary when she is hit by a car. She calls back, only this time in Alex Finch's body. Enter Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and lots of laughs. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is 15 years old, it's still a wonder whether there really is a situation like re-instating. And if so, how often do you meet the same life after life. I don't know the answer. But I know you have to watch this movie. It's a rebellion and Downey looks so good in the tuxedo. This film makes you believe in love and true love never dies. It just goes into circulation.
