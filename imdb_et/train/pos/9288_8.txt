I found it surprisingly light with a 1950s culmination. John Wayne would hardly be the first choice for cultural addicts, being as good diplomatic as Harrods' bullfighting. But this time he was playing a part that was much more passive than his usual bluff person, and he achieved his style of style. Duke was a man who really worked well. His facial expressions and body language can be extremely fine. <br /> <br /> Despite being remarkable for both actor and screen time, he was unable to dominate this film. Many of his good intentions came to the grower. He was somebody in power, and the interchangeable narrative was given by the title geisha to whom he was a barbarian. <br /> <br /> The story of America's attempts to punish isolating Japan was a political intrigue rather than a hell or hell-leather struggle. I cannot comment on the accuracy of my research, but the strangeness of the oriental culture to Western sensitivity has been well demonstrated. There was a lot of precisely choreographed ceremonies that meant this observer, such as an authentic costume and props. Sets were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought was applied to it. <br /> <br /> The broken romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra component and stopped making the film just political or flagged. The script was good without being too wordy. There was a lot of Japanese dialogue, but the long translation periods did not interfere with the story. It was nice to see plenty of true orientals. Whether they were Japanese or not, I couldn't tell. But still they saw some. At least the references were not played by baptisms with Caucasians, unlike other efforts, such as "Blood Alley" (yes, I know they were Chinese) "Sixth Fort Inn" or even "King and Me". Frankly, I enjoyed it more than any of these other films. The script was better than the beginning. I never liked the song "King and Me" and was not impressed by the "blood alley" of heavy loaded anti-communist subtext. I admit that I have never seen this work before and found that it is compared to many of Duke's most popular events. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
