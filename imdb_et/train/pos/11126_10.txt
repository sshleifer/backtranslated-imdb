Sopranos is arguably the biggest exhibition in the history of Dramatic Television. The epic scope produces fresh and iconic characters and consistently high quality. Focusing on one of Tony Soprano's lives in two families. One of them is a normal woman and two children of the nuclear family, the other is the big New Jersey mafia group, of which she is the boss. Tony, who played James Gandolfin, True Romance, and Mexican fame, is an exciting, frightening but also pleasing man. Gandolfin must be given the perfect praise for making a feminine and terribly aggressive, powerful, truly identifiable and perfect leader. American drama has never been as arresting and iconic as Tony. <br /> <br /> The true genius of this story is the brave and revolutionary traditional drama series of the creator and writer. Twenty minutes of dreams, symbolism and powerful and original use of metaphorical images and truly shocking scenes of violence. But all of this style is filled with issues that truly affect love, honor, and family respect. The series can never be cold-hearted or free of charge. <br /> <br /> Now that the TV is competitive and often poor, the Sopranos stand high above the rest of America's most original and compelling drama. Forget the family Redifined. This is Television Redifined.
