"Pecker" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore, who will be a big star in the scene of the public, the media and local art with his pictures showing the dirty reality of life like black underwear or human faeces. The typical theme of John Waters's independent comedies based on Baltimore is to show the strange aspects of the American way of life between political correctness and conservative setbacks, exploring the background of the middle class society in their hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong's "Terminator 2" fame is played by Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and longtime water actor Mink Stole. Although the plot change sometimes becomes a big mistake and is unable to compete with the brilliant "fierce" serial "fever" attacks of water, it still has good smiles and some unforgettable scenes like a former junke girl who became a vegetarian with herbs for sniffing peas ... "Pecker "is a great comedy of artistic arrogance, media hype, middle class sex and strange ways to become a pop star without understanding it. Recommended!
