When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it meant. When I saw this in the Australian cinema class for the second time, I realized another point: communication problems. You see, when the baby of Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) hit Dingo, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were exhausted, but didn't show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted to do it, and that they could not mourn it. But when people across Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone began to believe that Lindy did it herself. Although it was a pure accident, it still happened. This can be one of the major disasters arising from the existence of mass media, regardless of the political views of the media. Sam Neill is equally big. It's probably going to look like here. Definitely one of Fred Schepis' best movies ever.
