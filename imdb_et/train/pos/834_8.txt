Dark Comedy? Galows humor? How to Make a Murder Comedy? It can be a risky business because the viewer is required to release his moral values ​​and laugh at people who kill people. So, this story is rocky with a good hung reality to make it work. So, Pierce Brosnan, Irish's answer to 007, is now a chain-smoker, sex-dependent alcoholic who kills people to live and lives in crisis. He meets Greg Kinnear, a fighting businessman, and after a rocky start he learns he needs a friend. But Greg is happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees the basic things he does not have, love, home and life. Add the character's actor, Philip Baker Hall, as a man's manager and we're in the races. Brosnan is an excellent crass and crude oil like anti-hero and Kinnear delightful as his colleague, a very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a spark to Kinnea's very ordinary woman who is fascinated by the abandoned one who lives in her life. The end is gratifying and with some surprise. You should at least partially feel good about the theater - if you can stop killing people.
