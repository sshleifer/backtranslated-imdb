Out of all the northwest of Princess, Disney has been out there, Cinderella is probably the most enduring complaint. I can't really say why, but for some reason the generation is pulling him to the top of his list. As a little girl, I wanted something to be a Cinderella with a glass stick - this was my absolute favorite costume. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I don't think there is any story that can understand the human heart more than Cinderella. Who has never wanted to escape the drudgeries of everyday life and find someone who sees you like no one else has ever been? The story is older than English and somehow it really rings. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, Disney can make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is evil to T, probably not publicly physically. His cutting tongue and eyes work for him - he does not need fear in his heart to cause relief. Animal friends tend to grab, especially the idiotic Gus. I'd be glad when he met the fate of Lucifer's jaw. The cinderella itself was not, from time to time, somewhat justified. But he just had no incentive to make him completely sympathetic. Of course, he was a nice and fed animal, but what kept him there? We never know. Even if he only became a servant of another house, he at least receives a reward and strikes. It seems that the only reason things end up working for Cindy is that everything comes down in the way. She never works for her dreams that she sings so tenderly. <br /> <br /> What brings me to music that's beautiful like never before. Ilene in the woods is a lovely, rich voice, probably my favorite Disney hero. Some great standards come from here - the dream is to wish your heart, so it's love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a great affectionate story with lots of musical items. Although it lacks some character development, it offers classical villains and excellent voice work. If you have heart failure, it jumps in and warms you Mmm Mmm Good! <br /> <br /> Movie Quote: <br /> <br /> - Stay! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- Congratulations!
