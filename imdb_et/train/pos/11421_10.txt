I don't know what the previous reviewer was looking at, but I think that's what reviews are, personal taste. In this film there was no depth, very deep film, many emotional layers that influenced. Submerged currents of love due to social beliefs, taboos of classes and classes, competition is not very good in equality, guilt, longing, hate, confusion, emotionally very dark I thought it was under the skin to produce this air, a flowing film that is not slow As mentioned earlier, free yourself from the film flow, emotions show themselves, the characters reveal their shortcomings, their nasty insights, great and really very cruel!
