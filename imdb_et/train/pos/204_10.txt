First of all, almost all of Neil Simon's films are not liked. But there is something that is unique that pulls me in and I'd say it is one of the most entertaining comedies I've ever seen. The second time I watched it was the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? Ah, I'm afraid they can complain so he made them men. And how boring it would be if they were just housewives, biz stars are more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at the age of 97 (she even lived for Walter Matthau's great embodiment!) Denies it - but some of you have to find resonance in these notes. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he turned to one of the best presentations I remember (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, though he couldn't recognize the remarkable similarities he had with a movie character shared). br /> <br /> Very ethnic taste and from above, whether you laugh and laugh or turn it off. For me, joy is enjoying.
