The film was a sub-par, but this television pilot gives an excellent jumping board, which has become the ideal program for Sci-Fi fans. Actors deliver and special effects (for TV series) are remarkable. A sensible interesting script does not harm either. <br /> <br /> The SG1 Stargate is currently one of my favorite programs.
