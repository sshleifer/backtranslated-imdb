I didn't really look at the sample until FX. I was bored and I had nothing to look at and I saw the rumors of the show were premiere, so I decided to watch it. I was so upset that I hadn't watched the show when it first came to v.v. I loved this example so much! I remember things in plenary and family and step by step, and they were well shown, but just not funny enough. They would joke and laugh at things that were just stupid, but not at the 70s. This 70s exhibition was fun, smart and so real. I think it was the best show ever made and I'm very sorry that it ended. Although I love this example, I think it should have ended in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. The previous season was not just right, Eric was the protagonist and the show should have ended when his character left. I love this play and I hope the TV will show more shows.
