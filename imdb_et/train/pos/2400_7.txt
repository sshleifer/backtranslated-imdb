I see what my ancestors saw in the youthful Bette Davis. He's all this almost crazy political comedy that actually means Warren Williams as a political operation, constantly behind his alimony. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as her former and I found myself rooting. Williams's character is not at all likable and he is not even a decent op. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best he does. Since the candidate drew her sleep in a political convention and called her governor to prevent the nomination of a rival candidate, this confusion is borne by the international political war called "progressive parties". If you are a political mind, you will probably see the "Progressive Party" invented by Williams and Kibbee, with the exception of who you are associated with. I can do the parallels, but we are not here. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those who love these old comedies. If you've ever watched an old Wheeler & Woolsey title (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, like Williams' right hand, looking and behaving like Bert Wheeler. He was deceiving me. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my husband and I recommend it.
