Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very happy lady years ago. He was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had a lot of freelance money. His passion was animals, and he dedicated the fur shelter to offering his property. Trudy also raised two chips in his home to have more children. They were dressed and had many amenities. One day he learns about an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing the big monkeys, he relies on his wife's medical abilities and expert opinions to save gorilla life. If there is a threat, Trudy decides that he will also lift the gorilla as one of his children. It works well for years and Buddy, a gorilla, is truly remarkably intelligent in addition to his home. But Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity are becoming tremendous. Can Trudy keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a black film. Trudy and his monkey work on the basis of a true story that is unique in animal history and tradition. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla in the movie, but a mechanical one, but he is seemingly quite real. Russo gives a nice performance when the woman before her time and supportive players are also pretty nice. Costumes are exemplary because they fit the story of the story and the outstanding settings and production values. Most importantly, the animals are rich here, not just the Buddy, but the divine cheks, ducks, rabbits, etc. For those who want to watch a movie and transport it to the sky, it's a great choice on earth. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a big family film, go to "monkey" on Bud.
