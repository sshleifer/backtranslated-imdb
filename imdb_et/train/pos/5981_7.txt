TRICK OR TREAT is a good example of the Hollywood jumping "reverse messages in metal music" that Tipper Gore and his Washington women started in the mid-80s (other, less successful entries in this mini-genre are the terrible BLACK ROSES and the silly THE GATE). I was in college when TRICK or TREAT came out and couldn't wait to see it. By the end of the 1980s, it seemed to disappear from video stores, but eventually I took a copy of a budget-priced DVD and it brought back a lot of pleasant metal memories a day. Any teenage metal nerd can be associated with attempts by Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer (Marc Price of "Family Ties") in this film because preppie "beautiful" people in their high school persecute their heavy metals and musical tastes. Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammi Curr (who looks like Tommy Lee, Motley Crue), who is killed in a movie at the start of a hotel fire. Eddie is unexpected until he gets Sam's final, unpublished album DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss short home) test. Eddie will soon discover that this LP, when playing back, will allow him to interact with Samm Curr's unprecedented spirit! Soon, Sammi will advise Eddie on how to get even his preppy tormentors, but if the messages swell in the rarity ("Leave All ... Not Wrong Metal!") Eddie tries to destroy the album, resulting in Sam's returning life through Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi strikes Eddie's high school dance and performs a crowd and breaks down some unfortunate "wrong metal" before Eddie arrives to save the day and her dream girl. (SIGH) No, it is not terribly frightening in 2006, it wasn't even scary in 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT is a film that brings a smile to any metalist of the 1980s and has a kick-ass soundtrack courtesy cult Fastway . It is worth looking at whether you have ever hit your head or the taste of class B horror movies (or both, like me).
