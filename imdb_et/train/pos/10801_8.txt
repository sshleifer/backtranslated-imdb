Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago, I wanted to turn it off immediately. After the next 10 minutes I sat down so I realized that the actor playing Navin stole the show. His facial expressions and comedy behavior make me shake my head so WHAT he hasn't done more comedies. He has this "Marty Feldman" thing that goes to him, but MORE, much more talents ... without taking anything from Marty. The film was surprised by how close it was to the original Jerk, but then again it was so much. I really think that when this movie was first released and I saw another Steve Martin movie, I think the second was a cheap burst. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but that's true. I like Steve Martin, but his performance for The Jerk Too is another actor. I wish I could have a copy for this copy. I invite you to look at it when you find it.
