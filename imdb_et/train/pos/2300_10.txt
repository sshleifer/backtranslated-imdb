This movie has so many great elements! The debut of Reese Witherspoon is, of course, wonderful, but also her chemistry with Jason London. The result is remarkable, windless and clean. James Newton Howard improves the quality of every movie ten times. He also seems to have lost the younger young films, surely he is the result of his recent "Peter Pan" and "The Village" haunted Gothic music. I saw this movie for the first time in about 13 or 14, and now I just don't call the end, I put a tear or two nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. It will finally become a lifelong movie.
