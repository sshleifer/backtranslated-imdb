EARTH (2009) *** 1/2 BBC / Discovery Channel's "Planet Earth" large screen customization offers pretty majestic samples of all your beauty with some really jaws "how the hell did they get that picture!" The fantastic scenes of the animals of the habitat and the environmental message of the life circle can be cruel (witnessing a white shark that draws fast meals!) and divine (different children and their rentals). Narrator James Earl Jones's bass profundo tones enhance your "God's Eye View" and depth. Literally pulled through hundreds of hours, the only grip is that it should have been in IMAX format and could have gone even longer! Oh, well, there is always the next time (since Disney Studios has had to come more than this). Dirs: Alastair Fothergill & Mark Linfield.
