This is "odysessy through time" computer animation, allegedly through more than 300 artists. Made in the late 80s and released in 1990, it was a top-notch affair for the day. I thought it was good on the sites and quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Most short scenes didn't make sense, but the forms evolve into other forms, but it was fun to watch. It concerns visuals, not really a story. There were some strange sequences where the odd-looking men danced with the heard birds. All this is computer animated, which was new. Even the term "computer animated" was not well known. <br /> <br /> It's just an opportunity to show this new technology in short comic-like events with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words but pictures with electronic music. Stoners must really love it. <br /> <br /> It's a nice, intriguing 40-minute "eye candy" and "headgear". Due to today's CG effects, it may have lost its effect, but I think it would still be entertaining.
