I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audience like white noise and scary kids. They usually lack originality and contain a lot of excess. The only horror film I liked was the Kevin Bacon echo. It worked well and had a great story. But it is united and perhaps even surpassed Stanley Kubrick's bright, quite probably the most terrifying film ever. it is closed in winter. There were rumors about the place where the ghost and the last inhabitant got mad and murdered their family. But Jack is convinced that this is OK and he can quietly use to overcome his writer's block. But after months of loneliness and silence, Jack becomes hellish and later violent. Is it a cab fever or is there a hotel that is angry with her? The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are large but always empty. There is also a peaceful peace when Jack's son rides his bicycle through a barren corridor. Jack Nicholson's presentation is also one of his best, scaring me out of hell and I will definitely put me out once. My favorite scene is when she talks about the ghost inside the refrigerator. Witchcraft project. It may be old, but it is definitely good. 8/10
