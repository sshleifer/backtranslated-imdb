Okay, here it is: if you are easily offended, you might stay far away from it. There are some funny moments in the movie, but I probably chewed as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed more than I laughed. And if I hadn't literally braided the outside, I blushed from the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that tortures you, then you are not ashamed. Regardless of whether it is an honor or not, the viewer is in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that I smiled quite a bit, but this is a film that I just can't give to a general recommendation because of its content. When I say, "This movie is fun, go through it!" and some sweet, old, ecclesiastical women run to the theater and have a heart attack during a graphically explicit sex situation, well, that's just something I don't need for my conscience. > So, how is it dirty? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than Wedding. Honestly. My mother would have stepped out of the first scene. I think it is my duty at least to warn you about what to expect. <br /> <br /> Here are some cleverly intelligent comedies, but I'm looking forward to the man (Judd Apatow) who went both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for Michael McDonald's fun; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers money for their money. Paul Rudd, proclaiming "If I hear Ya Mo Be There again, I will burn Ya Mo under this spot," is fun, but it is one of the things most people don't appreciate. <br /> <br /> And when we see Steve Carrell's quick 3-second rebound on Cameo Word's song, I laughed two minutes after the end of the joke, while most of all laughed and then forgot. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, there is an admirable morality despite hope. The film does not portray Carrell as some envy because she is a virgin. She really represents a pleasant, admirable character. Of course, he's a little weird. After all, he has framed an Asian poster, "more video games than an Asian boy" and a collection of toys that contains Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we never believed that there was something wrong with being a virgin. As strange as it may seem, there is a little message "it's OK to wait". <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, please warn me that it will push your R-rating as far as possible. That was certainly Apatow's intention. He said he promised some boys (especially Rogen and Malco) to improve and talk about how they usually talk, all to find many new ways to be dirty. If you can solve it yourself or talk about it, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of overflow and sex jokes. I find this exquisite, intelligent humor a lot more fun than about 200 f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. As I said, there are absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself whether they are worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you will probably see in the theater. I just don't know if most women are interested in what men are discussing during a poker game. Honestly, ladies, you may not know. If you've ever been curious about why some girls think boys are big then this will give you a good idea. <br /> <br /> Here you go - my humble, honestly take what to expect. Let it be your guide. It should certainly not be seen in your Sunday school class, mother, grandmother, family members of the opposite sex, children of all ages, or someone who is easily offended by excessive robbery or sexual debate. If you want to see some of the above, you probably have no idea what it means to be uncomfortable.
