I myself feel that this film is a rare treasure. This is not just the beginning of the Shirley Temple career, but a rare look at the transformation of our society. You have to understand that certain things that we see as sexual today are considered innocent. For example, the parents of the children living in the film, as well as many of the parents who took their children to see this film, only saw children as adults. Most people didn't think of anyone looking at children as sexually attractive, except for teenage girls. It wasn't sexual for them. Remember that it was before we had the internet, TV, etc. Most sex offenses were not detected publicly. Sometimes a funny "funny uncle" would be a whisper. But it was often all that came from it. Yes very sad. But today it is sad, because even I see this movie than what it was meant, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley's dance and the eyes of the boys stand out, I felt disturbed. I have to remind you when the time it took! These kids didn't know what the sex was. The parents knew this, both in the children in the film and in watching them. The idea may not even enter their minds. It was no longer sexual in the eyes of the average adult when Shirley played the house. Even today, children get into a beauty contest, many dressed for a very mature three year old. But the child is just pretending. I do not blame the child for being an adult. Or those old movies that show it. Frankly, our media has done a lot of things that seem to be back and seem sick and wrong. It can sometimes be the best. But I really believe this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare appearance to the innocent mentality that we have long lost.
