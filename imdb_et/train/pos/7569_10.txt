In our culture, where the reality displayed as a narrative is capable of playing fiction, as we know it on small and large screens, "In addition," is a film that reveals real moments that are more honest, fresh and innovative than I've ever seen. Conventional spoon feeding conventions do not exist in this film, leaving the content to the audience and watching the real moments that trick one after another on the screen. Watching the movie and even after contemplating it is hard to believe that these amazing performances, in fact, are performances. Every moment, the big actors were shaking that truth in their daily lives. Nonetheless, "apart from this" does not know the documentary or reality television, but surpasses its category, which has a unique cinematography and direction. Look forward to watching this new storytelling category by watching films by other directors, Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen.
