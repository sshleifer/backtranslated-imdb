I watched it in my girlfriend movies and I can say I didn't have the best time mainly because I didn't know Ned Kelly or her story. <br /> <br /> Since then, it's biological, it's important to know what to expect from the tide. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the way things are spoken is true, or if it's all fancy. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice makes me believe that everything is true. I don't think he is a redneck criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a Western-style movie for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is great, as always, and sexy Naomi Watts loves the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance when it breaks through the cable. Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it.
