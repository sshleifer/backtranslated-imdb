Brazilian films often get more positive ratings than they really deserve. Rather, I believed that Contra Todos (against all) (the original title that the producers gave up: God against all) got very low GPA (average of grade) on this website. It seems that the female spectators have rejected them smoothly. In fact, it's not that cruel. I mean graphical violence. Its brutality is essential in nature because it represents future lumpeners, I mean sub-commissioners who actually own high-tech devices that coldly execute murder orders against "grana graúda". Is this a postmodern person? Is he just worrying about a fast, almost impersonal, highly unacceptable floor that is in the middle of food? This picture is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004. Its glossy editing style, à la Godard, its curious soundtrack counterweights, its overall effectiveness and, above all, its original narration, in subtle non-chronological hidden points that appear only in the epilogue, deserve at least 8 characters.
