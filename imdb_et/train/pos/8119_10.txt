I think the opening of this movie for 20 minutes is perhaps one of the most exciting movies, with the brilliant music score working to create a tear-off climax. What cinema visitors did in the 30s can only imagine. "Times" said at the time, "There's a miracle on the screen." Look at it and admire it.
