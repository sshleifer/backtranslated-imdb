The potential planet and Satan Pit together form the two best episodes of the two new seasons. Having said this, it should be clear that much of the story is basically the transfer of the Quatermass and Pit (1967) plot into space, where the universe's history intertwines with the beast 666. These episodes cement the emotional connections with Rose and Doctor, while at the same time emphasizing Rose's increased self-confidence, creating her as a rather unequal but-but-getting-partner with the Lord of our beloved time. Also note is Matt Jones' elegant scenario, which from time to time reduces the superfluous dependence on a single-lined doctor and the entire cast of championships, especially the excellent Shaun Parkes as Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
