This film resonated with me on two levels. As a child, I was evacuated from London and planted unwanted hosts in the village. Although I fled from a bomb attack and had experiences that gave treasured memories (for example, listening for the first time to a dark night song, and enjoying the life I never had in London), I stayed with my family and worried about them. Tom is an old man whose wife and child are both dead and living alone in a small village. As an old man who is now without a spouse whose children are married and living far away in another province, I am never lonely again. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas for raising a child. As there is a deep affection among the old Tom Oakley and his young boy, Tom is going to look for him and eventually rescues him from strange and dangerous circumstances. There is great tension at the end of the story because, as a result of some bureaucratic decision, the child seems to be losing someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
