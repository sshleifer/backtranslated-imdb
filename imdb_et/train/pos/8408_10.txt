"It wasn't me! It was my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when he's standing over Sally. I've been using this line dozens of times over the years (no one has believed it yet). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best exclusive rights and incredible. Steven Oliver was perfect for Dugan's part, so he was on the same beach in Malibu in 1978 (not nearly as much time on the screen). <br /> <br /> "No one calls Dugan a deaf!" is another line of age. This classic film was definitely worth the price of admission.
