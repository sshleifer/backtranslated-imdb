For those who love the mysteries of their murder, it is definitely visible because it is full of interesting and suspicious signs, most of which are wealthy Long Island social species. As a star detective, William Powell alternates between starch and inspired, from time to time, when he and his suit went to the cleaners and were crushed. Mary Astor is very cute here. <br /> <br /> Powell had made a career in playing Philo Vance in a number of films made in a couple of years. Between these films, he turned into a somewhat fun romantic cord, sometimes even for the essayist gangsters' roles. Already in the Middle Ages he was somewhat in his career during his career. As with so many early-talking stars, it seemed that his time had come and he was fined for films of the early episodes of the ban on depression, but with changing times he was too mature and clever to tolerate. <br /> <br /> The Kennel murder case, led by criminals overlooked by Michael Curtiz, is one of the last of the old Powells, while next year will be the first to be announced by the new, Thin Man, whose success will put its leading players in the Hollywood stratosphere. In Kennel, we see movies in a somewhat rigid, ritual pattern, because the camera doesn't move much, acting like a presentation, leaning toward the theater. This approach has no harm with its charms. This gives the film a baroque quality.
