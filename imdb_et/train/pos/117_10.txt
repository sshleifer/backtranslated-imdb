Lars von Trier's Europa is a third-man echo of America coming after World War II and finds itself in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German American who refused to join the US military during the war, arriving in Frankfurt as soon as the war is ready to work with his uncle as a Zentropa railway sleeper. He does not know that war is still a secret underground terrorist group called werewolves targeting American allies. Leopold is strongly opposed to accepting any side, but it is pulled in and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the railway company owner femme fatale. His father was a Nazi supporter, but the American colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) has received grace because he can help to re-launch the German transport system. The Colonel will soon publish to Leopold or force him to spy (without him having a choice or a chance to think about it) to see if werewolves can attack the trains. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold stops in an adventure, being a mysterious and noisy way of dealing with both sides of the conflict, where everything and everything is not what it seems. His amazing look at the na√Øve Leopold (his lover, terrorists, colonel, annoying travelers, his peaceful uncle, even railroad company officials who come to study his work ethic) before he finally takes control and humorously and violently. The film is endlessly unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The film is captured in style, always taking place in the winter, with lots of snow. It was photographed in black and white, randomly appearing in color. You can also see wallpapers that show images that work with the images in front. The hypnotic narrative of Lisa von von Sydow and Europa becomes a dreamy place out of this world. <br /> <br /> This is now my favorite movie.
