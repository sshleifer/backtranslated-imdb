David Aames is a rich and beautiful man living in New York. When her "sleeping partner" Julie Gianni goes after David falls to the beauty of Spain in Sofia, she gets to David in her car and tells her she is the only man she loves and wants to be, but seeing she's in love with Sofia He decides to commit suicide with David by driving a bridge. David lives over the crash, but there is a face left. He is then charged with Julie's murder. The thing is, David does not know what is real and what is not like he keeps these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares.) Everything comes back immediately, even though he begins to find out the truth. Well, here are all the stars, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor, who are good at the movie. In the film, they were all throwing up different things, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. The film also features a scene from Spevenberg hero. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Heaven is a well-made, different, interesting and original film that leaves you much to talk about after it finishes. It's not just a thriller, it's a real psychological thriller. The movie trailer is really good, but the film is as different as it could be. It is very well targeted and here was a couple of really great scenes. All in all, there is a pleasant film that needs attention. They're sure they've done a lot recently "Are they dead, if not who's dead."
