For the first time, we watched this movie as part of the new film festival Walter Reades in Argentina. Although we liked it, we didn't think it was extraordinary. Looking at it for the second time, here in Buenos Aires we found a different meaning for life. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in one of Argentina's darkest days when the DeLaRua administration ended. The country was confused after the economy that had flourished in the 1990s, artificially making President Menen. It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got a nightmare themselves. <br /> <br /> The story begins just like Santamarina, a bank employee, fired due to the collapse of the economy. Instead of getting his wife's compassion, she locks it out of the apartment and becomes homeless for practical purposes. She goes into the streets trying to get together. The second story introduces us to Ariel, the young Jews, interviewing a Spanish company. It is almost a miracle she can get to work. His father Simon owns a small restaurant "El Once" in the middle of the city in the Jewish quarter. Things get worse than Ariel's mother suddenly dies. Only Estela, who is in love with Ariel, comes to help her father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, a pure person, must use showers wherever possible. She chooses a woman's room in one subway station. When the sender Elsa sees her naked, she becomes furious, but she gets in her mind when she understands the unhappy situation of a person who has seen better times. They become romantic and Santamarina finds a toddler in one of her trash bins while traveling. Elsa, though surprised, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of innocent life in her life, cementing their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who has met with the magnificent Laura, is starting a peaceful and difficult sexual relationship with her beautiful co-worker who is unrelated to the lesbian affair. Ariel, who releases the dances by photographing weddings and other events, is passionate about Laura, but she understands what Estela has sacrificed to help her father and still loves her. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose "El Abrazo Partido" we thought was great, did a miracle with this film. Things are put in the right perspective after the last viewing, and we have to apologize for not having seen it for the first time. If anything else, then, for the second time, the nuances of the screen were written by Mr. Burman and Emiliano Torres, because they reflect the confusion during the blind days of that country. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, has been a surprising result before Burman. He's not a "movie star," but he's beautiful. This actor enjoys immense sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another great surprise. His Santamarina is a disarmament. Despite all the bad things that have fallen upon him, he keeps a rosy attitude on everyone he meets. Interesting Italian actress Stefania Sandrelli makes a great contribution to her Elsa film. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentinian actors, plays Simon's small part. The magnificent Chiara Cosell is seen by Laura and Melina Petriell appears in the noble Estela. <br /> <br /> "Esperando al mesias" proves that Daniel Burman is in the Argentine cinema.
