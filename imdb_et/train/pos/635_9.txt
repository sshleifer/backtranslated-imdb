On July 19th, I went to a small prediction of this film, knowing not only the names of some actors and that it was some sort of fantasy / adventure search. <br /> <br /> The plot line really isn't something I've seen, and the unique story is definitely appreciated by everyone else who is currently in theaters or soon in theaters. Regardless of what first impressions can be given, it is not cheesy, dirty, sticky or ridiculous and is actually very fun and funny. The stream is pretty well done, nothing seems to be rushed or pulled out. Due to the lack of better words, the soundtrack is magical and adds much more to the film, not just by performing silence, as is often the case in films or on TV. And though I knew what had come to the point, I still couldn't stop viewing the screen; in my opinion, no person has left the theater during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> My one handle is that it looks like there's almost no marketing for this movie and as brilliant as I can't explain why.
