OK, OK, don't turn around. I was joking. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is actually a better and more serious title at any time. <br /> <br /> Racism and criminal dramas will get satirical treatment by our X-rated animated friend Ralphie boy. And she's doing better jobs here. <br /> <br /> Crime is the truth. They build it, protect it, then boredom and stronger rivals cause it (perhaps) to lose. See for yourself to see what falls. <br /> <br /> Racist? I do not know. Scatman (RIP) and love wool (including RIP), which is a black and the main point of view, saw it as an attack on racism. The fact that Richard Pryor liked him also says so much. And the younger (before "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas was a great surprise. <br /> <br /> This is an animated movie "Blacksploitation". This is good. Ready and well done. This makes some terrifying (like a lynching scene), but unfortunately it is based on the fact. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie REALLY should have reconsidered this title.
