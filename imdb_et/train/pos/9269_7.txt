I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now I know about four times more (I doubt I found out that there is not much without Not Without My Daughter (1991)). <br /> <br /> Outside is a great budget for the Iranian comedy group, where girls (working individually) participate in a decisive football match over their country at the World Championships. Women must not participate in football matches so that the people's armed forces are mobilized to save women trying to enter themselves. Some (teens?) Girls try to break the party as boys, but they are caught. The film is mostly set in the pen where the girls have captured the soldiers, waiting for some unspecified punishment (although the girl dressed as a soldier says she was one of the insignia that is not filled!). The film examines the absurdity of the situation. Thinking that women are not allowed in football matches is that it is too furious for a fairer sex? Philosophy that is not unknown in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce comes up when the girl has to go to the bathroom, so the soldier who sent her demands to cover her eyes so she doesn't see graffiti. The conflict is not entirely related to the battle of the sexes: at one point, there will be some friction between rural areas and townspeople. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film was not too culturally esoteric, that comedy was lost because of the great Satan's neighbor and cultural birth. You have to be in this mood, but no one should avoid this movie because they think they can't.
