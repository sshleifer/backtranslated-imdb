Takashi Miike's invasion of the child's territory won me almost immediately, as he demonstrates the nervous and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be in the dark. Even as a child, I thought there was something ominous about most fairy tales; terrible things happen to most people in children's books. Miike realizes that these classic stories are a bit more frightening (and more annoying) than they seem at first sight. The filmmaker takes out the archetypal story of the child with admiration from the pre-school classroom. He brings out the real fears of a world full of endless dangerous missions. Westerners want to lower their bedding especially for children. I appreciated that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He's going to make the story jugular, but he also shows limited. But independent Miike is still alien to most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
