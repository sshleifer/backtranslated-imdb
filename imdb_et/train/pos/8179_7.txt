It would have been so fun to see in the theater and in 1996. The taste of my film is an innocent joy, which really appreciates the well-made shocking films. <br /> <br /> A dentist is sometimes panned by the fact that people usually have strong feelings about dental issues. Perhaps ADA launched a campaign against it, as dentists report that they have to apologize for this film and "Marathon Man" (which is only one scene that is comparable to many dentists). <br /> <br /> It is amazing to note that the trivia page was filmed within 21 days. Of course, post production can sometimes take longer than filming and "Dentist" editing is perfect. Rapid trimming increases the strain so much that the scene where the dentist takes care of his wife has only two quick cuts that show what's going on. The rest is left to our very fruitful imagination! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for this role because he has a lot of experience in psychologically "off" characters and he sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the pace of the movie was just right. The filmmakers show the woman's despair in the right direction. All the characters in the dental office look like people in the real office. There is a lot of tension when dealing with impatient people waiting for a dentist to arrive. At the same time, the dentist has turned off a huge psychotic breakdown! Unlike so many movies in this genre, the script is very tight. All victims fall into the trap of the dentist in a very calculated way. Two types of law enforcement are even taking part in a small subpopulation that will eventually end with the end of the blow. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not a weak heart or dental-phobic, but a real rolling ride and highly recommended for intelligent gorefest fans.
