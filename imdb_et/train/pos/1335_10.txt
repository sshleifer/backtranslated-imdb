After the love triangle Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karegas, these 3 stars were re-selected in this controversial flick. The film would have been considered coincident if Bharat Shah had no disagreement with the production values. Then the director Duo Abbas-Mustan did a very different and unique job compared to their previous and subsequent results. They are considered Bollywood thriller producers. But in this CCCC they proved that they can handle the romantic family drama in the same way. It is unlikely that a Salman colleague in his apartment rapes Preest, then Salman will blow him. <br /> <br /> The film has almost all the standards and ingredients, such as song, story, casting, performances, etc. necessary to capture the film. Of course, this was a surprising gift for a Salman fan. Why? For so long, he has done roles where he has his own open body and la-la-la dance pattern. His role as a rich young businessman with a non-existent and normal attitude is really impressive. After all, the role of Madhubala's outgoing prostitutes is amazing. Later, when he ponderes his life, he deserves enough attention. Her facial expressions and body language are becoming more attractive and mainly focused on her. His previous role as a pregnant woman, Kya Kehn, was not as close to her heart as here. Of course, this can be called repair. Then Priya, a very innocent and helpless Raji woman, who only depends on her for a better result. He has no powerful influence on the story, because the main ingredients are in Preities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the main point of the story is something that is rare and unique. In the real world of this time, it is not impossible for such a replacement to look for a mother. Perhaps many in this great world, where they are considered secret. In this way, the CCCC scriptwriter has discovered the hidden truth that is happening in other everyday lives. But it is still a doubt.
