SPOILERS NEEDED. <br /> <br /> It seems that von Trotta was much easier when he balanced his personal story and history of events when he was in his earlier film Versprechen, Das (1995). /> <br /> The direction seemed to be carefully controlled and visually felt it was very appealing - especially when it touched the visual narrative (the title-sequence mixture and the lighting of the new candle today, marking the death of various characters) earlier). <br /> <br /> To explain two points that many people are confused about: <br /> <br /> First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although it may seem indirect, this was not the purpose. Von Trotta told me so! (And by the way, she's a very nice lady!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the schedule of events was actually historically accurate (actual dates are marked in the vicinity of the monument) and the prisoners were released suddenly as well as on film. There is evidence to show that Goebbels was annoyed when he did, and eventually intended to restore what he had freed. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, what most impressed most was that it was a lot of story about "excessive movement". It seems disgraceful that this film has taken so long (for various reasons) that this film would hit our screens. <br /> <br /> More, please, Margarethe!
