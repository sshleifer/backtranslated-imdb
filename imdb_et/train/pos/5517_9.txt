Che: The first part was an exciting experiment that not only talked about a very interesting story, but also tried to do something other than a "biological" genre. Together: The second part is the culmination of this experiment. <br /> <br /> This movie offers all the same attributes from the first, from extraordinary performances (especially Benicio del Toro) to Steven Soderbergh's superb direction, without forgetting his intention to break the usual rules of bioplastics. what I admire about Soderberg's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual and they succeed at most times. <br /> <br /> The last message in this movie is perfect and it contains everything we've been talking about about Che Guervara's life. The only thing I found about Che: the other part is that some parts felt a bit irrelevant. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'll give Che a second part to a very enthusiastic suggestion because first, it's a brave and exciting experiment for the observer to challenge and leave us thinking.
