Although Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project because of Hitler's inaccuracies, and yes, it is dramatic, but important. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years, during the documentary that only focuses on Hitler's childhood until he became German Chancellor, including the night of long knives. This TV movie (including a two-part mini-series) shows how many factors made Hitler come to power, eg. A financial disaster in 1930. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and little, except for the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengli. All in all, valuable and interesting actors, but I think it should have been more strongly directed to cinematography; most of the participants are depicted in half-body frames that (for me) represent a theater, not a cinematic. The tempo is sometimes floating and the film suffers for about 2.5 hours.
