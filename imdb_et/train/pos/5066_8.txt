I know some people think the film is boring, but I disagree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters of the movie and think that leaving the parts of Archie's life in the mystery hit his humanity. I don't think a good biography should be a detailed description of someone's life, but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what is more exciting than someone who invented it so successfully? "Men get what they dream - you've dreamed well." Good work for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really distinguished me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see her more in movies.
