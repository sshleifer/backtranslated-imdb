In this documentary we meet Roger, a rich manager of a factory in China, who sells and sells beads and other trinkets sold at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger claims that the girls in the factory love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it offers, but interviews with four speak quite differently. The gloomy lives of girls are shown in harsh contradictions with the strange passion of Mardi Grasi. The filmmaker David Redmon should be praised for being an excellent and rare filmmaker in the Chinese factory's daily life and having an interview with the head of a US company who imports and sells beads. The film is convincingly said and clearly serves its purpose as the window behind the "Made in China" labels.
