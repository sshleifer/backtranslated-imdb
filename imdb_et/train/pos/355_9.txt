I, like many horror fans, have been hit by the same banal big budget Hollywood remake and MTV high school over the past 20 years. Finally, this is an original movie of horror movies that drills all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You want a hot lead actor, you want vampires, you want cool guns, you want to cool vehicles and want blood, lots of it, because of buckling - you got it. <br /> <br /> With a great choreography and a supporting role for Hammer Horror's career, Stephanie Beacham, this is really a fantastic thing. <br /> <br /> Despite the small budget, choosing 35mm stock and adding high quality CG effects to the blend, James Eaves has created something that looks much larger. <br /> <br /> Fans for the old school's horror.
