One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history began. The members of the Summer Summer of Love, at the end of the 80s and early 80s, were finally aids for the beads of love and the whole night party, and developed back into the mainstream, no matter what. For those who could not grow their youthful and sometimes irrational surprise, their miraculous culture was. The film that the film takes is love for drugs and knowledge of the law with authority, values ​​and "establishment". <br /> <br /> The sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that broke the American "house". When the battles were over, we all had to deal with the consequences of the killings. The characters of the Wonderland House are the icons of the seventies of malformation; part of the biker, part of the hippie, part of the cramp, all dead. No ideology to express, just feel dissatisfaction with everything and fidelity to something. Ron, Billy and David pride themselves like some Robin Hoods. They talk about love and act violently; they take the rich and sell it wrong; they lurk from everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is skilfully managed and stretched and captures its element in the world of drug entertainment. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. This story was "Boogie Nights". This is a story of transition and forgotten time.
