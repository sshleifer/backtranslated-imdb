This Twilight Zone episode combines a quiet section (1890) with melodramatic and visual disturbances, respect for early Buster Keaton films. Lots of beats: Buster falls on a partition door that falls into a bottle and runs less pants. The invention of Silly scientist Time Helmet, reminiscent of Flash Gordon's idea of ​​what the future would be. Cheap prices, like $ 1.95 for hats for women, or 17 cents per pound for beef, seem extremely big for Buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking it is when it is mistakenly transported to the "modern" world of 1960! Buster tried to go back! The "scientist" of this time wants to return to the more peaceful world he has learned and nourished. They go back together and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the "scientist" regrets that they do not have electronic devices, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with a mad helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone has no heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last efforts. That's quite one. <br /> <br /> Another lovely thing - longtime unused Maytag Man Jesse White is a repair shop that fixes Time Helmet - predicting his washing machine career.
