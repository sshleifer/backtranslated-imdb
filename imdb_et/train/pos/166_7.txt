This was the first movie Joan Crawford and Clark Gable did together and made several more. Crawford stands for a young rich girl whose father is wiped on the stock market and has nothing left for her and her brother. They've never worked before and their brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it's a simple job, but gets in his head quite quickly. Crawford becomes a journalist journalist, but wants to work on big stories, but he is given worthless things. Among them is a massacre where several Gable men are killed and Crawford confessed the whole thing. It's a good movie, but not their best.
