That was what I expected when the premiere of the star trek DS9. Not for a small DS9. It was a great show in his own law, but it never gave the fans what they wanted. Enterprise is what shows. Similar to the original trek, it is enough to be original in its own way. This again makes the idea of ​​exploration exciting. And this was one of the main ingredients that made the original so loved. Another aspect of success was the relationship between the crew members. Viewers take care of the team very deeply. The company also has many promises in this area. Bakula and Blalock chemistry seem very promising. Although sexual tension at the exhibition can often become crunchy, I feel that tension in the company can lead to much more and say much more than is typical. I think if we deal with such large-scale characters of such races or species, we get very interesting ideas and television. We should also note that Blalock is very convincing, because Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have some confusion and strength that provides excellent performance. The other majority also gave good results. My only grips are as follows. Theme. It's good, it's different, but with a little light heart I like it. We need something a little bigger. No need to be an orchestra. Maybe a bit more electronic sound is enough. And my second complaint. They sell too many additives. They could fix it by selling fewer ads or changing all two parters. Otherwise, we will see that the final act of exhibitions is changing too quickly, as was one of my complaints at Voyager.
