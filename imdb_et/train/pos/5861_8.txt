In general, I fully agree with the revision of Ebert. In some ways, I feel I shouldn't even comment because it's so much a vet movie and I'm not a vet (I was a resister). The disadvantage is that Marta is poorly developed and does not act consistently. I think Stephen Metcalfe is a veterinarian himself and has spent too little planning time on his character.
