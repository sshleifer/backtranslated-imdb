This show is fast, colorful, dark but fun, hip and still somehow clean. Casting, including private guests (ie Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space), is a major rotation. It has murder, romance, family and zombies without ever having come out of comics ... Somehow. In fact, you connect these characters. The whole production is an unlikely magical act that left me, which is something skeptical, when I say it, completely engulfed and come back every Wednesday night. I read it again and it sounds a little like someone paid me to write it. It's really so good. I just heard you hear it was canceled, so I thought I'd get a good will. It's one of those that is under radar, because networking opportunities can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars. Make a big difference if you haven't already, and enjoy this jewel until it lasts. OK one more thing. This show is smart. This means that every Hollywood armchair critic / "writer" adds their own youkle that before they sit to watch it, defended themselves as "I could have written" a type of speech to someone in their lonely renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words, the internet. This is a general interest / anonymous website. Before you give your Wednesday TV lesson to dirty sexy money or the next hot model or anything else out and out, these internet critics will not comment, give my fave a spin. This is fun. Good, modest fun.
