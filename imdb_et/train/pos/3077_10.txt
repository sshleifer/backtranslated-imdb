I left the show for the season and started to see it in the summer of 2007 on the ABC website. I'm totally crazy about the show. I think the whole cast is great. This is one of my favorite shows. I just checked the lineup of this Fall ABC program and didn't see it according to schedule. It's really sad. I hope they bring it back ... maybe they're waiting for Bridget Moynahan to have a child? Or is it just my wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments about the show and see so many glowing comments that are similar to mys. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or expect the other station to accept it.
