This very funny British comedy shows what can happen if one part of London, in this case Pimlico, declares itself to be independent of the rest of the UK and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. Cheerful chaos is what would happen. <br /> <br /> The explosion of a military bomb leads to the discovery of old documents that show that Pimlico was handed over to the Duchy of Burgundy a century ago, a small historical footnote long forgotten. For the new Burgundians, this is an unexpected opportunity to live the way they want without the intervention of Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is an excellent minor politician who unexpectedly finds himself among the world's smallest countries. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a joy as Professor of History of Pimloo. Others include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
