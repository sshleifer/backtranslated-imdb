The Home Room really surprised me. Compared to other films written about Columbine High School, this is the best. The home room does not show school education but the consequences and consequences of the community and the city. The film focuses on two opposite characters. Alecia (busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an attack that saw all the shooting. He doesn't seem to feel any emotion about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna Hospital to stop. In the meantime, Alecia is being investigated by the police because she could have known that the shooting is taking place. Alecia and Deanna are very different and not the first. Finally, they develop mutual understanding and become friends. (very much in breakfast club style). Home Room Shows the power of proximity and instability after school. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone.
