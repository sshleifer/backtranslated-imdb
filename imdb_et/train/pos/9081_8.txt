If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, you will love this movie !! <br /> <br /> Special effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park has hit the screen for years. While action may be a little less desirable, the story and its effects are sufficiently compensated. <br /> <br /> I would now like to see it in movies on a screen, not a 42-inch large screen TV. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals and tastes for myths and children .... you must see this movie !!
