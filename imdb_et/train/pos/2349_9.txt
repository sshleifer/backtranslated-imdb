It is a pleasure to see such creativity on television again. This exhibition is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters are well tied and writing is not bad (I think it will improve when they get their feet). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Girls are stealing this exhibition so far. Chuck is as adorable as Olive. Two aunts are happy. I sincerely hope that they will write them into larger parts because they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, this is all the news that is suitable for printing. Go yourself to a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in the old way. It's like Dr. Seuss for adults.
