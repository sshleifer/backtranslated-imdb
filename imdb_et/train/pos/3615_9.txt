I did not expect a "Girlfight" powerful filmmaking experience. It's indie; low budget, big names without names, director of newcomer. I had heard that it was good, but not good. Latinos. The main character Diana strives for her high school peers with anger and lashes, getting into school and her friends. He has been raised by one of his father who seems to love him and his brother, but applies a strict, gender-based double standard to his children. The father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that his brother Tiny takes boxing lessons at a local gym, but Diana is not given the same exercises. To the gym, to meet Tiny, Diana's boxing burns. Tiny doesn't like boxing so he and Diana are trading; he gets money from his father and gives him the lessons to Diana. and dealing with very serious problems. It's not ugly, "everything that goes right, goes right" in the resolution "Bend It Like Beckham". The reality and the related personal issues are too great for resolutions, but I think "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying film for it.
