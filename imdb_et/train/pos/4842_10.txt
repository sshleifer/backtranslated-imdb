If Arthur Askey's idea spins into your gut, don't worry, you can still watch and love Ghost Train, just like the same wonderful Back Room Boy, it's a movie that's just too damn good to drown even the performance of a leading actor by one woman. I personally love Askey, maybe it's because I'm going to my world, not to wait unexpectedly for him to go to me, which is the mistake many people make. Ghost Train is such an intense atmosphere that you wouldn't be able to anticipate it without being amazed by the deep, dark world that it transports you. 40's and it's a movie I imagine that few people have ever watched just once. The cast is exceptionally good, perhaps Linden Travers makes it a bit thick, but in the wartime lonely railway station, he could hardly play and not stand out. The sad passing of the loving Carole Lynne this year broke the link of the last unbelievable movie and now it is in the past but is patiently waiting for us to play.
