Charles Boyer should be Spanish, and he has come to London to buy "Confidential Agent" coal, in 1945, with Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard and everything is off except Bacall. His documents have been stolen, accused of murder, but he has decided to get his people coal to fight the fascists. It's high for the atmosphere and breaks, and it's great fun. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is average, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix is ​​appropriately pathetic and Seymour terribly wonderful. <br /> <br /> Not so good points: Bacall should be English and Boyer Spanish. No no. Boyer is terrible in his role, even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not British. These two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat confusing. Her behavior is also not sabotage; she's better than other movies. But she is an amazing looking woman and much can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost up and angry. Dan Seymour steals almost the entire movie as a hotel guest who learns human nature. It is a big part and its performance is perfect, while the direction of the other participants is not so good. It was certainly for small parts, but for small players. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing even your mistakes.
