"Such a long journey" is a well-designed film, a good shot and a presentation of some good performances. However, it is a story of sub-blocks and peculiar characters, that it becomes a kind of Jack of all plots and of any kind. Likewise, the western audience is likely to find a lot of the esoterics of the Parsee culture, which is quite hidden, to handle their hands within 1.7 hours. Recommended for those interested in India.
