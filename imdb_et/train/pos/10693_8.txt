This is a very small film that is very unique and creative. All the characters are big and the story is strange, very interesting, and Nicole Kidman is just amazing! It is very difficult to describe this film because it is really weird, it is comedy / romance, one minute it becomes a thriller, but it was still very fun, plus Nicole's Russian accent was fantastic and extremely convincing. Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry, and I loved Vincent Cassel's performance! The end was very cute, and it's always unpredictable, plus this movie is also quite undervalued! You're sorry for Chaplin and how he's scammed, and I thought all the characters were really nice, plus the final is particularly good. This is Nicole's movie, but he wears it with his incredibly sexy presentation!. This is a very small film that is very unique and creative, with some great plots and great performances! The direction is very good!. Jez Butterworth does a great job here, does a great job with the camera, has a firm angle and keeps the movie fast! Action is wonderful! Nicole Kidman is amazingly proud! And as amazing as ever, he is incredibly sexy, very pleasant, was one of the coolest accents, added a lot of presence, was a very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin and had a very mysterious character! , he was amazing. (Kidman Rules !!!!). Ben Chaplin is great here, he's very pleasant, he had a cool character, Kidman had a very good chemistry, the only thing I didn't like was taking his anger to Kidman, although what he did was wrong, and I loved it how he finally got revenge! Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain, yes he was an OTT, but he was sometimes very intense and quite scary. Mathieu Kassovitz is fine here, but there wasn't much to do. The rest is good. In general I recommend it!. *** 1/2 out of five
