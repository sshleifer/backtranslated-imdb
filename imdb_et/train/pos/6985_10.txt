I have to say that as a BSG fan I was not exactly sure what I would think about this exhibition. I saw it today on a large screen at the Arclight Cinema (as part of the screening of Paley Center) and cast and filmmakers spoke later. Ron Moore said they wanted to make a clean break from Battlestar and do something else, and they would lose some fans, but hopefully they will get others. "<br /> <br /> Even without talking, I am now a fan of the new show, but here's what I was thinking of the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it. It was really very good. I think I'm a real sci-fi (or "syfy" - do I really have to write it?) Geek, because I look at it as a series with a strong and rich story and my interest. > It starts with a small group of teenagers who were drawing something that was the weakest part of me and a bit confusing. The actor who played "Ben" should have given us a glimpse of his intense beliefs, the actress who played "Zoe" seemed a little posy but played a teenager (and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought "Zoe" was a cylinder at the beginning of the BSG geek threat.) If they hope it's a new Bamber / Helfer / Park, they might want to think about it. who took the audience's attention. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz provides a perfect job like Daniel Greystone, a man haunted by his family's tragedy that he jumps out of grief as soon as possible and doesn't let him go. work to convey your character bring knowledge about the world of computers and people, especially in a scene where he spins the web for his young teenage friend, catches him, then fires and releases. There was no sign of the "serial murderer" he played from Gray's anatomy was really impressive. <br /> <br /> Equally strong, but not nearly the same, is Paula Malcomson as her husband Amanda Greystone. She's just as smart and well-written and beautifully played as Stoltz's part, and I believed they were a couple and a couple who had been forever and had a strong relationship, something rare that day. I look forward to seeing what happens to this family, and I hope they will give her as much work as in the Roslin BSG - she's strong and intelligent, and when she slips on her child, you will stab it, it's really big. Not to mention his eyes, which may have magical powers, they are so intense. The scene in which he takes a government representative - a very short scene but beautifully played - really gives you the idea of ​​your power. <br /> <br /> The second part of the show that didn't work for me was the scenes with Esai Morales and his mafia-type clan. He does a good job in general, but I did not believe in the power of the mobs or their threats. I found that I want this whole story to be a little mysterious and harder to find out; how it is presented is almost a worship against the godfather, they hit you with a little head. But from this time I can see how it will become an interesting "upstairs / downstairs", poor minority (Morales, etc.) and the planet's rich rich people (Stolz et al.). Frankly, I enjoyed it when he told his son about the origin of his name - it was a very well played scene. <br /> <br /> Note for BSG fans, a boy who plays Willy Adama doesn't really look like Olmos, but he's just a kid. Is he more visible than he is in the movie who knows? I couldn't say that. But it didn't bother me because he was not as interesting as everything else around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays "sister Clarice" and she's cool and strange in every scene she is. I'm not sure where he is going or with whom he finally comes, but I was very impressed that he was acting. In this film he was on a sort of side, but of course he was later made a very important part. He was not like his character in Rome, something that I always find impressive in actors. <br /> <br /> One nice surprise - music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, though it's the same guy who does it, Bear McCreary. It has a haunting and unusual approach that surprised me to buy this score if I had the chance. <br /> <br /> As for the panel discussion after the show, it was hosted by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very intelligent and literal, David Eick was very smart (like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was cast, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and didn't really answer the questions (but I've always been for him something). Paula Malcomson was tough (he was instructed by Seth Green to mistakenly say he was at '24'), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both expensive. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were also there, answering questions about how they worked with BSG. In general, it is a very interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I'll give the show to 9 out of 10 and look forward to it all unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I just watched it for a second time and hope they will explore what HOLOBAND originally prepared. I have no idea what it may be, but it has a lot of fascination for me.
