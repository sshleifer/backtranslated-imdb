My clock came a little too late, but I'm glad to look at this and the sequel ... which makes me compliment this flick maker to give such a clean and basic treatment to romanticism ... and very marginally separating it from relationships! Since a lot of the film has already been written, it would be just right to point out some of the parts of the film I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think that the point where Jesse and Celine make counterfeit phone calls to their friends were very cunning ways to tell each other what they meant to each other through a 24-hour trip because of the curiosity of two people who both think that the other has made an unmistakable impact on the other, has been very intelligently treated ... <br /> <br /> Making a romantic story on the face of the plot is not easy to do. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic flaps for such a taste, the characters are not clearly written even in the mind of the writer and director. What the actors bring out is what turns them into ... the right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify ... to get the character, the life the actor gives, must go beyond the instructions and story ... here both actors do just a better job! Kudos .. !!! And before sunset there is another bracket that makes it even more beautiful!
