Once you've read the books, forget the characters that Tolkien built. There have been "disney" treatments for hobbies, dwarves, etc. The dark riders are great and as I have always imagined books. <br /> <br /> Cinematic is a great movie that combines live motion and animation to achieve amazing effects for the year. I just want him (Bakshi) to be given money to complete the epic. <br /> <br /> Paying for a video is worth it because they are a bit after the Lord of the Rings of 2001!
