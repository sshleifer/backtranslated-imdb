Although it is one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots", this movie is a favorite of Vincent Price's work. Gallic has a quality that is so many in horror characters. When you look at it, you know him, you feel his disappointment, his injustice and you rejoice when he goes to revenge, even though he scares you with his original rage. As the film continues, his character becomes tragic. He has killed his murder, but now he has to kill him. And again to cover it. And again ... your belly sinks with your soul because it goes down to its spiral as you look at your beloved brother becoming a hood. Even if the revenge story is old, the plot equipment itself is original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill more and more ingenious ways. The shame it's not available for wine at home.
