I believe I got this movie when I was young. I remembered it as a child, but I could never find this movie. I remembered Head Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, Greedy, King Koo Koo. I was looking for this movie high and low and still lucky. But one day, when I came out of my childhood, I found it. We were reunited. I'm 17 years old now. I still look at it. All the time actually. It's one of the funniest and most touching movies I've ever seen and enjoyed. And personally, I think they should follow. Mmm, yes. Now I'm even considering masters birds tattoos somewhere in my body!
