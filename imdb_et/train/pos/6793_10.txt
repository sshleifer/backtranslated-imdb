I love the death of this game. Since I was 9 years old (I'm now 15). It's great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions and don't forget to definitely fantastic dragoon forms! I'm still waiting for the remake of the remake, prequel, or this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> Play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be a pretty hero. On this adventure, wonderful creatures are experiencing and the boss is fighting. You also have some friends with a special element. For example, fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder / lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also objects known as dragon spirits that allow you to transform into a magical legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called wings and evil creatures are facing this adventure of excitement and excitement. One of my all-time favorite games, The Legend of Dragoon!
