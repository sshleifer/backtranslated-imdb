This excellent production of Amicus is based on four great stories of master Bloc, developed by the best actors in the early seventies. It was a kind of movie that was very popular in the sixties until the mid-seventies and is one of my favorite type of horror movies. This is especially true for sweets in the episode, where Christopher Lee is the heir of the traditions of his evil little girl, his mother. Great fun from start to finish and good to very good are the other three episodes (the last one is a bit comic, but Ingrid Pitt, the most famous press of English cinema).
