Well, of course, women are not average-minded and poor, interestingly shown from mother to whore, though not in pseudo-artistic, extravagant or blatant life. Unlike many of you, I've only seen La Mama and La Putain twice. Like many good movies, I noticed that my opinion improved after the second review. All I know is what I've seen and haven't complained yet until I have a DVD. I still need to find out exactly why I enjoy this movie so much, but what do I really like? Although I'm sure I'll get and get some great explanation. Okay, so you can't agree, maybe it's sometimes a bit boring, I'm not an expert. Blonde reminds me of lovely Grushenkat.
