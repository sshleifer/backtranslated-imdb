Here is a rare gem for those who haven't seen it or even heard it. Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity in the 1980s, but Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene in the early 90s. In 1993, he broke into three films on a big screen, which unfortunately was bombarded. I liked these two movies very much and let me work out one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy flick about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), who have ... firefighting equipment: yes, they have the power of pyrotechnics. <br /> <br /> Wilder has decided not to use his power anymore (anything that is not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youth, where he and his brother threw up an abandoned house that killed the men who were inside what was the greatest of them. Nowadays, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to a weak Vida (Debra Winger) who is under house arrest, guess what, firing (see this movie to better understand). Wilder hasn't spoken to Wallace for 5 years as Wallace put her hair on fire during her bachelor's degree. He is also in charge of the carnival and is the head club. When the carnival reaches the city of Wilder, Wallace decides to reunite with her brother and see Vida with whom Wallace is in love! Vida's house arrest looks like it's over, but Wilder is busy. So Wallace comes in and the fun begins. Brother vs brother ... fighting with fire! <br /> <br /> Some big fireballs throwing in this flick ... eat your heart out, Drew Barrymore! sings acapellat with songs during firefights and after the wards. Jim Varney (globally known as "Ernest") will appear on Wallace's red neck carnival. "Wilder Napalm" is superbly fired ... and wisely assembled ... from the wall and the gate. <br /> <br /> Give it out ...
