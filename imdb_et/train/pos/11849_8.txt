If it was great only ALL animation. This film is classic because it is strong, has two simple aspects: story and character. The characters in this movie are decorated. I felt that all the characters were filled, and the human-animal relationship in the film works great. Beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation have not worked better in any other movie. This is a great movie for kids and adults looking for a classic hero's journey. 8 out of 10
