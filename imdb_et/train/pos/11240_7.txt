The low budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, becomes one, and then finds it a little too much. Good pouring and feeling of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice sounds like a Mini Mouse! He lost sight soon after making this movie - so life can imitate art! You have to see if you want to see if Star Is Born is a punk version.
