I liked this exhibition for two reasons: 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. The two performers performed the exhibition with the support of proper and repetitive participants. Replacing the RDA at Seasons 9-10 was enough to bring the heart out of display. <br /> <br /> The chemistry of all major characters is just huge. You will feel that the actors want to move around after the camera finishes. This relationship goes beyond the program we see. <br /> <br /> RDA gives its "O'Neill" character to a credible personality. He will never know when to give him opportunities. You look at others speaking their eyes for some of their voices. However, they know that he is the person who is in a situation where the situation is dangerous. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of work between Carter and O'Neill. They can hold the lid, but often just barely. The episode "Solitudes" in the first season was some of the best dramas ever seen on television. The love between the two gave the prospect of death to endure, because they stand together. Yet, O'Neill's tactical instincts seem to always sound. He understands what to do without having to think about it. The team has on several occasions threatened others who did not listen to his orders. <br /> <br /> Quality dropped significantly during the 9th and 10th seasons. Ben Browder was much less than RDA at the show. He had rare moments with Claudia Black, but it was all. Amanda Tapping called her presentations during these two seasons. You saw her greatly changed appearance after the baby. He probably thought more about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> Spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' is a few moments, but is usually weaker. Larger characters don't have the original cast of chemistry. Risto (Wraiths) is so unlikely to be ridiculous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe in the program or it won't last longer than the fourth season. <br /> <br /> There have always been special effects for me. For spacecraft to be shaped like pyramids, Sci-Fi is rarely the same design monster. Using burners to illuminate these ships is just as bad. It is also extremely difficult to accept the old Egyptian interior design, which hides the ultra-modern technology. <br /> <br /> I also thought about showing continuity. In season 2, the opening of the "Daniel Jackson" opener is opened, and his uniform has a opening hole where he was wounded. She climbs into the sarcophagus and heals her body and restores her uniform as she just brought it down in the wardrobe. In the episode "Hathor" there is a sarcophagus, which belongs to the SGC, but it is never mentioned. This device could have been used for several later episodes of "Daniel", "O'Neill" and "Dr. Frasier".
