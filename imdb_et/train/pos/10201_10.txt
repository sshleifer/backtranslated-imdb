This is a very good movie, not only for fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who like animated movies / adventure adventure and fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film is about an innocent girl who has been killed by something she has not done, but who is her daughter, the daughter of the ruler of hell, Lucifer herself. <br /> <br /> Then he looks for revenge ... and the rest of you can see this movie better. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie a lot, the characters are like the original comics that make up the chaos. I never had a story about the first part of the stories in the comic, but the last one, after the movie, so I can't tell you if the events are just comic, but ... one direction or another is the story of Lady Death!
