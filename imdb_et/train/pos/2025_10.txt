Anne Brontese's epic novel WILDFELL GALLERY should be explored and read in schools and libraries and in people's living rooms. It's a fantastic story and tells the "true" truth about alcoholism and destroyed marriages, and mothers fight to keep their son out of their cruel wife. It's so similar to today's stories we see and hear, and I believe people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on the real experience that the author had brought back in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Have a look at this movie, the big version of this book and really moving. I'm sure Anne would have been happy with this way of production. <br /> <br /> Great actor and great place.
