A few years ago promoted the satellite channel U.K. Gold "Hurry Men", who repeated the leap: "Here's the original apartment-sharing!" It was actually wrong. "The man about the house" was also flat sharing sitcom and ran from 1973-76. <br /> <br /> It was the spiritual Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, the creators of the popular sitcom "Father Dear Father". When it came to an end, they decided that they wanted something to do with time. In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) organize their Myddleton Terrace apartment, following a natural party when they find a man in their bath. He is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a Southampton chef who has no definite residence. When her clothes dry, she puts on a woman's bathrobe and prepares them for a meal. They are so impressed by the culinary skills they call him to stay. But there should be no naughty business. So Robin has to pretend he is gay ... <br /> <br /> BBC-2 'I Love 1973', which was shown in 2000, said Julie Burchill said "House" showed her the way she lives cadet. He was not alone. One of the most iconic (for me) British television pictures of the 1970s was Sally Thomsett, who came out of a London subway with a sunshade, and a "blind" man who did twice when his northern swing passed. <br /> <br /> The man who lives with two girls was a surprising issue by then, but Mrs. Whitehouse didn't need to get hot at the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke scripts went as far as they did without crossing that edge. Richard O'Sullivan still played "Bingham" I.T. In fact, the second phase of the second income overlapped the first "House". He was born to play sex-crazy Robin. Paula Wilcox's "Chrissy" was more on the street than "Beryl", her character she played "The Lovers", while Sally Thomsett's "Jo" was a loving dizziness blonde. As time went by, he got almost like an older brother to them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole an exhibition as Warring Roper. George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred was not. They went to their show - aptly entitled "George & Mildred". The recent Doug Fisher was good when Robin's friend, Larry. He worked so well that he became ordinary. <br /> <br /> In the year after the debut, the inevitable movie spin-off. I'm not a big fan of "Man About The House" because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen. Most of its characters had never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to America, where it became a long-term "three-component" starring John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. This was a lot more clues than the British original, where Somers was often seen in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, "House" ended with Chrissy, who married Robin's older brother Norman (Norman Eshley). Fans were destroyed to see that Robin didn't get the girl he loved, but had some comfort in letting his own 'Robin's Nest' show off.
