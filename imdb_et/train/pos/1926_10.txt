In 1967, I visited the glacier of Lake Elsinore and flew with the yellow Pratt Read glider. Returning to Germany was the flight of the big aircraft mentioned above on the TVs and on one segment in California in the early 25s. (The real-life pilot was Bill Ivans, I don't know who played him in the series) It turned out that the glider had the same (same N-number) as the one I had flown to Lake Elsinore. Since I saw this segment, I've been looking for it and wondering if it's available anywhere. (other serious segments were related to the Baker crowd-seat; tool for finding avalanche victims, etc.)
