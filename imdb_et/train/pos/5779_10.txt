To begin with, I didn't even know the exhibition after a year or even the Internet. I haven't seen it on television in my country before, and many people don't usually know this show. Unfortunately, this is because it is just the most original and smartest animation I've been witnessing for years. <br /> <br /> I don't give 10 points out, but this is one show that really deserves all 10 points. Even if at first glance it may seem like a typical comic, but keep in mind that this is not a children's look. When the complete story appears itself, you know that it is a true deep story with a spiritual message. The story of this spiritual part is largely based on spiritual animals, an old Indian faith that has survived for years. This gives the exhibition an original twist, which is often not found in animation exhibitions. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also very different. Sometimes it is a bit like gravel and in other cases it takes more cartoons. I believe that David Feiss, who created and staged a cow and a chicken, created a segment in the show (as he also pulled this segment into a cartoon). <br /> <br /> Show that it takes a variety of topics, such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then that's something you shouldn't miss. If you look, you probably look at it until the end. One small fact may be that the exhibition takes less material from the comic, but it is not too annoying. The only question, however, is where is the DVD?
