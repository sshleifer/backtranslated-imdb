This is one of the favorite films. The Parker Posey character is extremely entertaining and the librarian's motive is not lost to anyone who has ever worked in books and chimneys around the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a student at the library, RENT HERE. Then buy a poster and hang it on your wall. Soundtrack is also highly recommended. I've shown this movie to more library lovers than anyone else - they all love it.
