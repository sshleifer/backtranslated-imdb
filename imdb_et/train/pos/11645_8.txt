I was in France on March 5th and I love this film festival. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I've never gone. I decided to go and then I got Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is stunning. It didn't affect me like the Mexican users because it was French subtitles, but it's still shocking. <br /> <br /> This movie is a satire about city violence, kidnapping and crime on the streets of Mexico. This is a raw portrait of the city. Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with its enchanting Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of abduction, but with a more serious tone, is and I think it is a relationship with Cero y van 4. A, sort of, the story of redemption and how much is too much? Come on, who was amazingly strong, was not a satire, but a prodigal portrait of Mexican streets. Or it's like brave. A film that shocks you and hits you with great courage. It's like ordinary suspects, it has some plot twists, but it makes it even more plausible. Decision: A film that shocks you and makes you believe that there is no more security on the streets. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performance. Cero y van 4 is a movie you will soon forget. Leaves you shaking and stunned.
