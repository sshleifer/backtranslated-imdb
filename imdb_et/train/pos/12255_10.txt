Austen's films since the 1990s are my favorite, even more than "persuasion" that transformed me into Austeniana. Before I saw this "Emma", I had seen two earlier versions, but in one Emma it all seemed wrong, rather with Lady Teazle, and in the second it seemed half-wrong as a possible impostor, while she seemed right, young and stupid and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude of the production and the atmosphere gave the novel's magic extremely well; Indeed, this is one of the sweetest, most joyful things I've ever seen, rather Santa Claus. The script is unusually well formed and the add-ons to the adapter, such as the light shaft that shows Harriet in Emma's Church, are fine. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would have expected, but I enjoyed it very much: he brings out the characteristic, practical side, unlike Emma's influences, and his chilly outbursts against Frank Churchill are pretty funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr Woodhouse almost an absurdity of carrage; Samantha Morton, as Emma's protector, is just as soft and as sure as she should be. And as with the same "Pride and Prejudice" producers, care must be taken to ensure that the true links between the characters can be believed - in some cases uniquely. For me it was production and pleasure.
