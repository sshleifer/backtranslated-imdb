This may be the most underrated film in this genre. I can't remember seeing advertising or advertising what could be the reason why it wasn't as good as it was at the checkout. But Frailty is a wonderful and truly original horror film. I'll put this list with my top ten horror movies. <br /> <br /> The film begins with photographs and news articles that tell us about the killer who calls himself "God's Hand." And then the man walks to the police station and tells the chief officer that he knows his killer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a place where the victims are buried, which can help resolve the case. During this trip, the man begins to talk about his brother's story and we go back to the beginning of the events. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father who one day claims to have received a divine message from God, asking him to kill demons that seem to be ordinary people. He receives a list of the names of demons to be destroyed from God and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely terrible and tense film that will keep you in your seat. Tensions go high, innocent people (or demons?) Receive death and religious experiences are questioned. At the end of it there is not one, but few very intelligent turns. If you like this genre, I suggest you Frailty. I have a DVD and this is one of my all-time favorite fears.
