Accumulation of unexpected events and feelings of world-famous conductors in a small village. Some people threaten how he experiences the church choir and how people are gradually changing it. This film is warm-hearted and makes the cinema go away with a smile on the lips and tears. It's the best way to get people out and Kay Pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous. The actors are outstanding, Michael Nyqvist, whom we know before, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming acquaintance to me. He has the most vivid face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg makes his part of Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is also terrible. I just wish she could play a nice man one day so that we could see if she was in charge of that character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that doesn't leave you intact. If you haven't seen it yet, do it today!
