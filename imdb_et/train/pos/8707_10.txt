"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I've ever seen. The film's name can be translated into English as "sword carrier". The main hero (Sasha) was born with one extraordinary ability: he can defend himself with an extremely sharp sword under his skin. In the first half, he may seem like another silly superhero meaningless from unrealistic events and feelings. But it's not Mechenosets. He can't even be called an anti-hero. I think he is just a person who lost his life and faith in good, justice and love. In his life he has never met anyone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Each of his steps is colored with blood; He punishes for each one his gift, which became his death. And suddenly she meets her. He doesn't need empty talks and explanations. She loves her for what she is. He doesn't care what he did. The fact that he is next to him is more important than anything else. But soon he will discover his secret: he will kill two people (his former boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect him from his eyes. Even after that, he couldn't escape his feelings. They try to run, but this is a charter to hide. Finally, they have a serious car accident. He's drilled; he's in a mental hospital. They don't know anything about each other, but he believes he will save him. He pushes many obstacles, but he finally finds it. They run again, but they are not vulnerable. She is wounded, she needs to rest, but the police almost catch her. He does not know what to do, they ride in the corner, and then his sword begins to lower the tree, the helicopter around them, but it is not necessary because he is already dead and he is a lonely person around the world.
