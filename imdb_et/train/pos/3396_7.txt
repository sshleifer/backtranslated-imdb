Very interesting. The big twist was not such a big shock as suddenly they had hoped and it was very dated, but it seemed to me to work. It really meant to me a world where there is no flora and cattle, and I made me value the world where I live much more. Charlton Heston does a good job, as do all the supporters, and it was a very realistic film that was surprising. Sometimes this direction was lacking, and many settings and backgrounds needed more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent film. The main mistake I find was that I didn't want the movie to stop when he did, I would have liked to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
