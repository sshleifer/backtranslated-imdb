I just want someone else to have led the Jedi return, I think the scenes of the ewoks are too much, totally unnecessary. In addition, our heroes see different people: Princess Find is no longer fighting with Solo, Luke looks bored, Darth Vader is not as bad as before and Yoda just dies. <br /> <br /> But there are many extraordinary things. there is an episode I just can't hate. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS 1 - Jabba Hut 2 - Sail Ferry Attack. 3-Emperor (now it's evil) 4- Speeders pursues endor forest. The last 5 battle. 6-Dark side seduction scene. 7 - Anakin's return to strength. 8- And the last party. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good that they can bring their eyes. If a scene had been cut and another director was hired, it would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still exceptional. 9 out of 10
