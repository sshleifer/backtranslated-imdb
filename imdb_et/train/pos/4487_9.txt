"Fraidy Cat", the fourth of these cartoons, is good. At least I like it, so I'm surprised that it gets confused. <br /> <br /> This is a funny story rather than funny, although it has comedy moments. The atmosphere is dark and horrible. Here's another relationship. As for humor, it is mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> In this short perspective, Tom is listening to a horrible radio show at night and is completely frightened because it is a ghost he believes. While Tom is scared to death, Jerry looks at everything and can't laugh at all. In fact, Jerry quickly finds how to torture him more and more. With a white shirt and vacuum cleaner, she creates a great "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom lives a more frightening life experience. While Jerry scares Tom without good reason, the way the story is done is funny. What's more, there's no violence here because it's one of Tom & Jerry's older cartoons. But I can't just suck this joke from the life of Tom 9 in the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally finds out that it was all Jerry's scheme and that Jerry made him fool, Jerry "caught his hand in a cookie jar" (he deserves to be discovered). But Tom shows incredible patience before the reaction. He looks at Jerry in about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry calls Tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that Tom looks at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom doesn't laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a different, original and remarkable experience from Tom & Jerry.
