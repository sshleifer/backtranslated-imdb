I didn't expect much, but I have to admit that I started to laugh a few times during this movie. If you are not severely offended in the first ten minutes, it may be a movie for you. If you're the type that would enjoy Amanda Peet's alternating cards for an hour and a half. This is definitely not an important work of comedy, but because it is a low budget, it is masterful. For comparison to equal opportunities, imagine that all studio films with your budget are cut by 100 or more and see what you get! Weaving to Peter Cohen and his network to see it. I look forward to his next effort.
