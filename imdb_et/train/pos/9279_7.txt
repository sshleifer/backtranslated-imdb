Jafar Panah's Comedy Drama "Offside" depicts some women trying to enter the Tehran sport, where women are banned. Official Reason: Many unpleasant languages ​​and footballers' feet show. But, of course, it's sexism. So, most of the film consists of a light comic relief, because women try to ask men serious questions about why women are banned at the stadium, and one woman even has a scheme to defy men. <br /> <br /> As I understand, all Jafar Panah movies (this one) are forbidden in Iran. The real tragedy is that the overthrow of the CIA prime minister in 1953 and the subsequent brutal shah supported Ayatollah Khomein's apology for using his narrow interpretation of the chauvinist society, and that George W. Bush's current Iranian policy towards Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse for cowboy and censorship. . <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a clean look at people who challenge the system. Not a big movie, but it's worth seeing. Given that all Jafar Panah movies are forbidden, I don't know how he can even do them.
