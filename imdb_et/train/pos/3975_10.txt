When you lived through the 1960s, this film can be painful and sometimes quite joyful. It's all there, but at that time it was spread in small letters in counter-culture tabloids. These are the roots of the social revolution that are still playing: "Don't talk too fast that the bike is still spin because times are a-changin". Although the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its distribution at that time, it alone played a major role in the development of intelligence, influencing engineers, scientists, and contributing to the hyper-development of computer-related activities. Greeting to the filmmakers who have been there - you've made this era better than I've seen before.
