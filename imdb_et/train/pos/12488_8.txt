I'm not at all nervous about the movie and I'm ready to watch a lot of them. That doesn't mean I'm ready to look at them a lot, or I don't have any criticism about them. This movie is horrible and very well done. In fact, I think this movie will do a great double bill with the 9th session. <br /> <br /> Before I receive my comments, I should specify that I looked at it alone. I started watching it before going to bed and got about 15 minutes before I realized it was too effective so I saved the rest of the morning. Even if seen in a wide range of daylight, it was still horrible. However, I cannot guarantee how effective it would be in a larger group. <br /> <br /> After your daughter's death, the couple will move to a distant cabin to try to come to this death. Let me note this death - this is one of the rare films that doesn't abandon the child. This is much more important as it determines the actions that affect both the tone and the film. <br /> <br /> The couple is not working well. The husband has distanced himself from the relationship and the husband does what he can to bring him back. While some comments have complained about their actions - one specified that they act more than father and daughter as spouse and husband, and that is justified. He's trying to give him more direction. Men sometimes have a role to play. <br /> <br /> The movie has different fears and most of them are quite violent, though grotesque in some ways. The story itself is very simple for most movies and ends indefinitely. Though the procedure is not absurd, it is certainly not what you expected from the way things were progressing.
