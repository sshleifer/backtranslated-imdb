This movie is superbly paced, you never have to wait for the stomach to laugh, to come in for more than a minute and there's much more to it than the original assumption of the movie. Throughout all this, the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-head-cross-dislike genres exist from which this parody is. Don't let anyone tell you they're trying to laugh cheaply, just using discomfort, - sure, there's a lot, but it's all contextual, not free. I loved this movie and it cost only 2.99 pounds on the DVD, so for the entertainment price it was the best movie I saw this year.
