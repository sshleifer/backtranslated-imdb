If you were ever sad that you couldn't get a movie from a DVD, you probably looked for it "Delirious". How often do you laugh when you look at comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor in his biggest time and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's 'Delirious' and 'Raw' (not so funny), I never knew where Eddie got a lot of inspiration. Now that I'm older and I've seen Pryor and many comedies after Murphy, I understand two things: Everity STEALS from Eddie, while Eddie loved Richard. This is a big difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. He had seen something before. He was all we ever needed. Nowadays is Eddie Murphy bored and old? but once he was king and "Delirious" was the largest castle ever built. Really one of the worst routines ever.
