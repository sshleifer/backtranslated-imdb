It was a very entertaining movie and I really enjoyed it, I usually don't rent such films (eg indie flicks), but I was attracted to the movie because it had an incredible part, which included Jamie Kennedy, whom I loved since Scream's trilogy. The film director took the risk (and this is a risky risk) to talking about and interweaving many (and many people) different people at different intervals. Taking this risk was a good idea because its end result is an extremely good movie. <br /> <br /> The film has some main characters; Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) - An unpleasant fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is due to stones due to stones. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) is an airplane loader / technician who loves all living beings (except the servants of the meter) and who, despite his good heart, is more and more bad luck. Cyr (Brian Cox) - The owner of a Chinese restaurant / donut shop, who is a german mob and his fear of bacteria, puts his assistant / cook Sung (Alexis Cruz) under pressure to keep up with his phobia. Ernie - (Christopher Bauer) is married to Olive (Christina Kirk), who is convinced she is trying; stop him, look ridiculous, go crazy and don't live a normal life. They have small and almost crazy arguments, and Olive is serious about Ernie. Gordon - (Grant Heslov) is a man whose life doesn't go very well, because bad things start to add up in his life, he decides to take it. Mitchel - (Jon Huertas) is convinced that Gwen - (Alexandra Westcourt) is a girl of her dreams and that they are assigned to each other, although she is more skeptical. He's trying to get him out and he's trying! Johnston - (Michael Hitchcock) has just released his work and doubts about his role as a provider, he is taking another job he just doesn't fit. Her husband Annelle (Arabella Field) comforted her through her job loss experience until she learned that Johnston was not a pretty loving husband she thought. <br /> <br /> All in all, I definitely offer this movie! <br /> <br /> -Erica
