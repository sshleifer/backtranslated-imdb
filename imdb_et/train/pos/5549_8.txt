The silent film, which was proud of the clan of Mary Pickford, was supposed to be assigned to a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the external shots were filmed in Marblehead, Massachusetts, near Marblehead, near several rocky seaside geographic areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) The location of Marblehead's film in my home town and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired for Mary Pickford during the filming of several scenes. "bald scene". Both women were small (5 '), and both my father and grandmother associated the fact that he was part of a rocky scene behind the camera as part of the Chiefton movie set. I wanted to relate this story to future film historians and players. The film itself (my DVD copy is somewhat poor) is very well done with a lot of action and expressive action, including several scenes where Miss Pickford is a strong female character. I liked it and it would be nice to have a better copy of it, although I'm not sure if it exists, as I've seen in different movie sites, where the rest of the copies are blind due to the deterioration. Very nice movie with a silent genre with lots of activities!
