I just watched this movie and I have to say I was very impressed. It is very horrible and it has many moments that will make you jump out of sitting! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes to soothe your nerve! If I had to criticize, I would say that maybe, if anything, there would be too many moments of jump. It reached the point where every new scene was jumping, and it gradually brought out an amazing effect because you're new to what was coming. <br /> <br /> Although it contains almost every ghost they all did well to keep the horrible and frightening. It had elements of Shining, The 6. Sense, and The Changeling (especially the music of The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for good old-fashioned intimidation!
