An excellent, pre-code immoral story with Barbara Stanwyck, who has just been inspired (through Nietzsche's writings) to eliminate her sensitivity and exploit her. Not quite fair about the German philosopher, but it's interesting that this was the year Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version, doesn't do much for me, but definitely works well here, directing myself and the movie forward. There is not as much meat here as one could have expected, but many distressed situations and amazing peaks and innuendo. Very fun, if not very attractive, men's presentation, and I think honestly, a gold mining woman is not a very attractive view. However, it's life!
