Julie Waters is remarkable and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very warm, very real and exceptionally fun look at the complications caused by gender dysphoria and transvestism in the lives of young leaders. At the heart of this film is the very real truth that you must accept before you can hope that others will accept you.
