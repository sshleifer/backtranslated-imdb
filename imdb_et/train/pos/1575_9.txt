Van trotta film rosenstrasse is the best film I've seen for years. I'm not really interested in movies with historical backgrounds, but with it he won my interest in it !! <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing about the movie has been in New York, and the impression i was "trying to be as American as possible" ... which I think it has been completely unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> The scenes on the back really got into my heart. German actress Katja riemann earned her a prize. he is one of the most impressive actors I've ever seen. in the future I will look more at my films. great luck to me that i am native german =) and only a year inside us, so as soon as i am back, i buy some riemann DVDs. <br /> <br /> So everyone who hasn't seen this movie yet: WATCH IT !!! I think it would be too long to describe what it is all about, especially when all the flashes and time switches are hard to explain, but just make it, you have zesty !!!!!!!
