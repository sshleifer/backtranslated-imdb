I can't tell how closely the film follows the novel, has never read a book, but since the clocks are around six and a half hours, it is good that most of the base is covered or at least we can say with certainty that this is not a reader's digested condensed version. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are high up to other BBC classical series standards such as Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe that Dickens' London saw, sounded and thought so much. Sometimes it is a minor from time to time - some athletes shoot a pistol with a strike in 1840 or 1820 or when it happened. <br /> <br /> Action must also be commendable. Suzanne Burden is a polite and honest hero who is quietly doing good. She is also cute, in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature in some kind of flirtatiousness. Denholm Elliott is his guardian (and more than it turns out). Burden and Elliott are two very few characters who are good and inappropriate. The other is the former sergeant, who is forced to do evil by the people. The other is a poor and helpless young boy. <br /> <br /> I don't think anyone else could have written it. It has all the characteristics of Dickens - poverty, tragic deaths, capitalism raw, generous abundant man in his home, hidden parent, shady motives and impotence of the legal system or direct malice. Well, not the legal system as a whole, but the office, which was probably the court that ruled on things relating to the division of property. (So ​​I gather in Wikipedia.) It became so infamously rigid and dilative that it was thoroughly renewed in 1973 in England. Twice, Elliott's character describes it as a "curse". The most impressive scene is that during the competition, he hides a retired soldier in his high school. In the traditional sense, the Sergeant is more masculine than any other male I remember from Dickens. Apoplectic money lender and tenant scream threats from their seat and the sergeant turns to him and makes one gentle workout with another sword, every progress brings him closer to his tormentor, while the scarlet-covered old creditor falls back. <br /> <br /> A couple of things are missing. Often, Dickens will stick to at least one or two entertaining dialogues. ("Humbug!" Or "The law is the ass.") Not here. "Happy" house is the right title. Secondly, there is virtually no Weber's "ideal type" - neither Mr. Micawbers nor Artful Dodgers nor Scrooges. Third, the atmosphere, the whole ethos, is relentless. One affliction follows you, usually money or shameful peccadillo out of the past. <br /> <br /> My God, it's frustrating. It would be like the author sparked his spleen with everything he knew in the world. Poverty, okay. He's KNEW poverty. But wonder what Chancery did to Dickens to earn this service. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I just watched the first episode of the 2005 series - and it's better in two ways. The direction is more zipper, so the pace is a little faster. And Jarndyce versus Jarndyce has been clearly explained just in front of it, instead of concealing its mysterious "curse" so that the plot is easier to follow.
