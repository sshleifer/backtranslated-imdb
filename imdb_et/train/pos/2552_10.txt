Fatal Error is really a cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr, Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis. The film's cast all worked really well. Robert Wagner played a good role. Saboto Jr. and Turner's relationship was great. There may be a big age difference, but they are unique couples. Both participants worked quite well together. The film's music is really good for Ron Ramin and fits very well. The film has a number of things you don't know what's going on and what's going to happen next, and this movie keeps you going from start to finish. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr and Janine Turner, check out this great movie!
