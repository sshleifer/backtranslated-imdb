People critically say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed Bug's life a little more. I can't remember Pixar's animation except for two Toy Story movies that I was so hard to laugh at. The animation is clean, the story is original and no story. Audio broadcasts make this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant who gets into a lot of trouble. Hopper is an excellent character always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as well as Haydn Panettiere as Dot. Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn also support, and I could go on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It has no Antz social messages, but we have rock-solid entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox
