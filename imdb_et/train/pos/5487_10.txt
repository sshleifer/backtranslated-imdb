You've never seen anything like that before. When the coup begins, it is the most dazzling thriller on your spot that you will ever see - even if you know the outcome. And it's all real, because it's a documentary - amazing. <br /> <br /> By the time it was over, it was in my Top 10 list of the biggest movies ever. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the sliding right fanatic. Anyone I know who has seen this movie will give it a 4-star rating. Even if you don't care about politics or Venezuelan politics, you will find yourself as a nerve floor and - believe it - at your seat. <br /> <br /> This is a skateboarder.
