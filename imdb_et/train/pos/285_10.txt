I would just like to say that no matter how low a budget is for film, it must be shown all over the world on these films. We don't read that much more, instead people want to see movies. Taking this series off the DVD, I have wanted to read the whole series and want more. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 FILMS. Please do not change any characters, it will destroy the effect. Because I've grown to love the characters who have played the characters. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 FILMS. I want to see the message and see how these books and now the movies are here. We can't get that enough. MOST WORK!
