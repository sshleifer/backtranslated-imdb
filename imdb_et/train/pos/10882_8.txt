It's not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, in the film movie, a well-known actor who works in the first scene of his life. This film takes off the old psychological killer convention and can do something new and interesting. It's also always nice to see Molly Ringwald attack. <br /> <br /> So this can be an example of what the genre has changed. The cut hits all the characters and is actually scary in some respects. I liked the fact that I gave him eight.
