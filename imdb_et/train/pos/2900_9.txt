If it were an American film, I would appreciate it 7: we've seen it before. Being this Argentine film and being an Argentine myself, I would like to give him 10 because it is the quality that I was hoping for - waiting to wait. It's a great quality is amazing considering all the 3rd world restrictions ... <br /> <br /> I don't forget this scene when Díaz forces Silverstein to admit - you know what I mean when you saw it Movie . I think this is the main moment of the film, maybe not surprising, but the original. Then the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before I watch a movie, I always try to get past information. Being mainstream, satirical, commercial, I click on "Play" and stop the reality and logic, I would say it's the best mood. It is impossible to discuss the credibility of the whole plot, but it is credible in a certain way. As for me, I couldn't laugh with every joke and comment - "sos malo" ("you mean") ... put Díaz's mouth that is the biggest. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty tired of seeing movies for "Peretti". I know she's a great actor, but sometimes I feel her roles are unfairly transparent, the role of Luis Luque in this case. I don't want to watch television from Argentina, so I haven't seen much work from Luque, but it's quite obvious that she's a great performer. His physical role, his jokes, his attitude to this film made me love for his production. I think his role should be somewhat improved to let him show us how big he is! <br /> <br /> I don't know if Szifrón is going to make a sequel or not. I know he won't do it by following the rule that "the second part is never good," so if he does, I'll certainly look at it. And I hope that in the future we will take into account the possibility of giving Peretti colleagues the same opportunities to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Big movie, great shows and lots of laughs!
