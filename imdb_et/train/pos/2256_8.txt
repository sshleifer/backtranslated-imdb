Did not know what to expect from Van Damme's partner and friend / coach and his choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him acting as "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer and other Van Damme films. He is now himself. He and his wife make a great team. That's where Qissi CEO and leading bad guy and he's a husband was a writer, producer and directed most of the scenes that did not require action, well done the movie, did a great job together, the story was meaningful, the fighting scenes were well edited, the leaders were real fighters and saw good together - the story came together well and if you can do it believe ... not a bad language, sex, just action.
