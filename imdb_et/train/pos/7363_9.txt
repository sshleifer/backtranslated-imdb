It's not a love song. <br /> <br /> My one-word summary of this movie would be "Excellent." <br /> <br /> Do you probably not like watching the mass movie in public? It's a <br /> <br /> movie that forces you to participate. You follow, think and ask. <br /> <br /> You can make comparisons with the Deliverance (Theme / Theme) and <br /> <br /> Blair Witch Project for general filming style. But this film is unique to both. <br /> <br /> Cinematographic effects (solarisation, freezing frame, turbidity, etc.) have been seen earlier, but are often used effectively in this <br /> <br /> film to support the story's natural tension. <br /> <br /> Action is raw, threatening and completely plausible. <br /> <br /> The real theme of the film is friendship; The title really gives the game <br /> <br />. This is probably not the kind of friendliness most of us have experienced or would like. <br /> <br /> This is a love song.
