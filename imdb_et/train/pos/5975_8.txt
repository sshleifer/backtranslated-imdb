Every movie critic and metal head hated this movie, but I enjoyed it. I saw it as a child on television somewhere and was surprised by the scene where Sammi comes on stage and plays tricks or cures on fast roads. <br /> <br /> The film itself was a typical 80-year-old, the guy goes to the bullies and increases supernatural help to beat the tempters, but goes a long way and must be destroyed. <br /> <br /> From Matt Melrose's place, Skippy chooses family associations from Skippy to get Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks out, highlighting where Tony sings (lip-sync) and dances to a metal song before shyt hits a fan. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes and things, but the music and the overall picture was enough to keep my fists from 8 out of 10
