I loved this flick when it appeared in the 80's and still! I still quote the classic lines of "say it again" and "you said my balls hanging on the siren". Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it was undervalued and abandoned by MAD, I have to say that this little pearl is always my treasure and the film I would take with me when sent to an abandoned island! I just want someone to release a DVD because my VHS tape is about worn out! If you like the comedy of cheese, it's definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! This is the best and worst military humor! Rent it if you can't own it!
