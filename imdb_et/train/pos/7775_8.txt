One more of them does not make this category. The story of a family with real skeletons in their closet still qualifies as a good clean, sometimes too fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are in trouble with Hadley's siblings, and they really took their roles and ran with them. Malone won Oscar and Stack was nominated for supportive categories, both of which were highly deserved. They balance the good wires somewhat. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called a bad actor, but they both have better parts and they played much more convincingly than here. It's hard for me to embrace Rock Hudson, who plays such red blood heterosexual as he does here, but it's more personal bias than anything else. But it does not take the overall entertainment value of the film, which is remarkable and the film is very observable. If you are at night and this movie comes, I'd say I look at it. It's worth it.
