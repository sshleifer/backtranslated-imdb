It picks up the "Basic Instinct" after about a year. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is currently in London. Having sex with a football player when driving at about 110 miles per hour (not asking), he goes out of the way and arrives at Thames. He's alive - he's not. The police are hired by the psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if he is mentally competent to carry out the trial. Of course he starts playing with his senses and follows a lot of murders and sex. <br /> <br /> This movie was doomed before it even opened. It took eternity to get the pain and the director, the problems of the script were persistent and the cast was not happy (Morrissey complained often about the film). However, it is not too bad. It is much like the first one - there is a lush music score, beautiful places, lots of sex and nudity (it had to be changed for R), a nicely twisted plot and good action - but it doesn't. The first seems to have been restored. People are being killed here with a strap (I believe) ... just as people were killed on the first ice machine. One lovely moment picks up the stone's ice selection and looks at it long. He also plays mind games and may be guilty of murder. Similar similarities are too obvious. <br /> <br /> It's also very much appreciated - there's a lot of explicit sex, nudity (Morrissey looks much better than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks good)) and some bloody murders. Operation is good. Stone is just fantastic here; Morrissey looks unhappy but is OK; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis support roles. <br /> <br /> So it's not bad at all, but it feels first. However, I recommend it. People attacked it just because the stone was not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do the "basic ..." 14 years after it was made.
