I went to Chesapeake camp. It was at the end of Chesapeake Bay northeast of MD. It was a similar summer camp with cabins. It was founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camper and later became a junior, senior counselor and later head of Waterfront. If the camp had continued, I would have made myself in charge of the camp. JMCA's authority decided to close the camp and sell it to MD. A few years later I went to a former camp and I have to worry about neglecting the condition of MD and natural destruction. The area of ​​350 acres was so much with the benefits of using all nature benefits. The black man, Curtis Ford, and his family were the inhabitants and carers of the property. Mr Curtis was my friend and mentor. I idolized my every being. Even if he couldn't swim, he was a vermin. If I asked her where the fish bites, she would set the place and I would have a ball. At the end of the summer there was a family camp. These memories are with me forever.
