Although it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, it was definitely worth $ 8 (which can't be said about many movies these days.) <br /> <br /> It was a nice account true story, although many of the real The story details were twisted for the film (ie the story of Billy's character on Sunday was a total of four or four people). Robert DeNiro was, of course, good and Cuban Gooding, Jr. , was also impressive.
