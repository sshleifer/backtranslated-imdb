I didn't expect this film to be influenced by a family like what you wanted to live in the neighborhood. They are ordinary muscle-blood people, not like a typical Hollywood price. They are facing an overly general problem - getting sick. But the story grabs the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, scripting, direction, and acting flow with the rise that drives the viewer deeply into the story. Give this film full attention and its message inspires.
