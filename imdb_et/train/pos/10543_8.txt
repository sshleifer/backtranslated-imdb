Bright comedy, Nothing shows us the world we sometimes want to escape: nothing in the world. Something you don't like, be it bill, bad memory, or even hunger, can disappear at your request. They approached this film very well and there was nothing I didn't like with the duo with an enjoyable head, and they were not even part of the main movie. <br /> <br /> First, the post-credit scene (and yes, there is one): Good to eat, but what did they try to do with it? I was confused and eager to see a return for something if nothing was done. Instead, we just hear a random sound and they scream. In my opinion, he tries to create a sequel and it was not really necessary, nor was it funny after the turtle frame. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the trailer: I saw a trailer from a DVD and, as others have already said, it promotes a horror film that has never come. Well, bad marketing I think. <br /> <br /> If you see it in your movie rental store, look, because nothing is a great movie to watch. However, if you have a large screen, you may want to wear a shade if you wish.
