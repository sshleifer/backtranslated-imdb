This documentary explores the story recorded in 2006 in Pilger's latest book Freedom Next Time. It shows the shocking expulsion of one of the islanders of Indian island of Garland, an island in the Indian Ocean. Saarels are technically British citizens because Diego Garcia is a British colony, like Mauritius, a nearby island where indigenous people were refugees. But the British government has ignored their claims to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the United States Army, which has used it as a basis for bombing Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking, especially when documenting the survival of surviving islanders and the current impoverished living conditions. All of her interviews are great and her best friend is in her parliamentary corner, where she uses government information. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction to share a series of recently released documents that illuminate the British conspiracy to repel the natives. Weaving this material with interviews and the music of the islanders really adds to the film's impact. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to see, but "Nation's Stealing" is John Pilger's best. Recommended.
