I've been a Hindi movie buffer at the age of 4, but I've never seen such a moving and influential movie, especially the Hindi movie in my life. In recent years, I have finished watching contemporary Hindi films and returned to watching classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But this movie changed everything. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found that this is not only mobile, but also found it to be a very educative person who is the first-generation Indian woman to grow in America. It helped me to understand the history of my family, which was always very abstract to me. But to see it, feel it and realize that it helped me to understand generations and the struggle that the Indian people suffered. The film helped me look at a lot of things, especially considering the current world events. I've never thought that the film could change the way I think, as before. The plot is fantastic, the actress is great and the direction is flawless. Two thumbs up!
