I have to say that this was one fun movie. Despite the fact that dubbing was quite cheesy and there were some odd moments where the film seemed obviously dark blue, I wasn't disappointed. The story was actually quite interesting: the last member of the poison poison must follow the other five members and discover who uses their skills for evil and who uses them for good. The catch is that during the training all the clans were masked and everyone has since returned to society and changed their names. <br /> <br /> Fighting is a joy to watch because each poison member, Klan, has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and hundredths. On the battle scenes, the actors are jumping all over, and fortunately the camera remains planted and uses enough shooting to get a clear view of all the actions. <br /> <br /> One of the drawbacks of the movie is that the story tends to drop in the first half until the first fight. But stay with it and you don't have to be disappointed!
