Cure is an amazing movie ... So stopping and just so real! I was fortunate to have received this "Cure" screening during this NYC premiere and it completely flew me out! I also heard that it won the festival award, and it certainly deserves it. The first thing that hit me was cinematography. Eric Giovon did an amazing job. The halfway of the love scene movie was amazing. In this movie, love was needed, and Jafri got a point, but he liked the scene tastefully. Giovon and Jafri create an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together for future projects. The narration of Judy Maier was so surreal, but at the same time heartbeat, it made me feel what the main character felt. I'm a very tough critic, but I have to say that Cure is one of my favorite films. JUST LOVE IT! If you haven't seen it yet, look at it!
