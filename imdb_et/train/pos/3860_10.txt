In the Netherlands, gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) speaks. She's staying with the beautiful Christine (Renee Soutendijk) overnight and she's having sex (imagining she's a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but looks at Christine hunky's boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to try him out. Then things get strange. <br /> <br /> The great X-rated art house hit the US in 1983. Let's see ... there is exhaustion, full of frontal male and female nudity, castration, distortion, simulated sex, scene in the church with a cross that shocks most people, gays sex scene encrypted ... and that's all comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did it for "Spetters". "Spetters" attacked critics for its extreme sexual sequences and were condemned to the trash. So Verhoeven filled this film with a very obvious symbolism, thinking that critics think it is art and praise. He was right! Critics loved this movie without knowing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke. However, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> It is a beautifully taken down by Jan de Bont (now the director himself) and there are so many symbols and obvious "hidden" layers in the dialogue you are never bored. All actors are great - Krabbe plays a profoundly despicable character, but (somehow) he is rooted for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to see and play its part perfectly - the little smile he gives when Gerard agrees to stay with him is chilling; Hoffman is extremely beautiful in terms of his body - he deserves praise for the order of the church and encryption at Krabbe. <br /> <br /> It is not meant for easily offended people or heart weakness, but if you like extreme movies that play against you (like me), that's for you! 10 all the time.
