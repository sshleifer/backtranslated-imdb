Heh, when I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with an 18-year-old comic movie 5.9, are you calling me crazy? It's just catching your attention. Every day I meet people who complain that there are no good films that only seem to be the last blockers. It is never a bad thing to look and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic value. Dick Tracy is one of those that can't be outdated with technology. <br /> <br /> Negative ratings mainly complained about DT's "confused" story. But it seems to me that the story is pretty clear and I had no problems with it. I didn't see comic books, but I'm not a big US comic fan, but I appreciate top-notch movies and performances. Perhaps most people's expectations were too high a story he says. But when you see a movie that comes with Madonna and Warren Beatty, what you expect. I had scratches on my heads and I can't wonder if we really saw the same movie? The title role, though not as competent as it sounds, was still able to attract him and attract the audience. Madonna had less than "breath" in her seductive role, but added a lot. Al Pacino was funny and proud of himself. Obviously, he is bold enough to go sarcastically to his earlier successful roles. We see a hybrid between Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro that splits our stomach to laugh at us. And many thanks to make-ups. <br /> <br /> It's not bad for me at all. Surreal feeling really got me.
