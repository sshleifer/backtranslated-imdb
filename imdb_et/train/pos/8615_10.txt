I was expecting this movie to come out in Canada for a while, and when he finally did, I was very excited. I really enjoyed it. Of course, this is a very sad film at first (and it was New Years Day - it made it even more sad) - but it sticks to you. The next day, I thought about it again, because although it spins something so emotionally drained, you realize in a few days that it is such a beautiful story. How one person can have a connection with so many people, but sometimes so many things can be dazzled. And how Diane Keaton's character will reuse the rest of them just by being there. And how they save the process. It was such a great movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actresses) offers the perfect comic strip. This is definitely a movie that needs a box in the box, but it really will stay with you for a long time.
