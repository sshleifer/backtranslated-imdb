I saw it for the first time at the film festival. There were many good films, but few kept me thinking for a while, and An Insomniac's nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a talented filmmaker. The shots were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic seemed to play a role that he perfectly designed. He didn't know much about his character, but he wrote this story so we took care of him. And Ellen-- I can't wait to see where he gets! She shows a lot of talent and I hope she will make some more movies. With a budget of millions of dollars, trying to get cheap excitement, Tess shows that it's not necessary if there is a good story and actors. Tissue to all those involved in this film. And thanks to Tess and cooperation. to distribute it on DVD!
