Eventually, this classic TV movie on an old VHS recorded on an unofficial disc was a classic horror. This is more of a detriment to this overlooked fear of the official DVD and VHS publications ... TV movie horror. Recommended for all fans of 70's TV films, such as the trilogy of terrorism. Interested in getting a book on David Deal - 70's Television Movies. Send me a chance to see it ..... its amazing to see it again. <br /> <br /> It has problems like many TV movies that they have to be effective, and even 70 minutes it seems that we may be dragging that we are all accustomed to more modern editing, but still big things and much better than many theatrical performances published today.
