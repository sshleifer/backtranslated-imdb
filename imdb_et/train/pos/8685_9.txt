It was the first regular filmed episode of the Columbo movie, but it was still the second after Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: Murder of the Book". At the same time it is one of the best! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was one of the great creative directors! No wonder they later asked him to run three more Columbo movies. The film has some real creative and innovative sequences of shooting, and the film as a whole is clearly made with style, passion and eye detail. Each picture combines and is the reason why this movie is better, and it is also better to just look at other average values ​​for video movies. This is definitely one of the best leading Columbo films. <br /> <br /> It's just a few reasons to leave Columbo's initial admission. Murder is more or less an accident and it was an impulsive act. So, at this time, the killer has no time to plan ahead for the "perfect murder" and cleanse his footprints and must destroy his body. The killer of this movie is not only treated as a criminal, but rather a man who helps Lieutenant Columbo to resolve the murder. This makes the character more interesting and layered, and it also helps Columbo make the whole crime so interesting. Of course, Columbo will start to suspect him very early and as he always puts it in order, making himself vulnerable and seemingly more obvious when he is, of course, and gaining the killer's confidence. This is not obviously a spoiler, because it will make every Columbo movie structure. I liked the story of the movie and its progress. <br /> <br /> It also helps the film with such fine casting. During this movie, Peter Falk really made Columbo's character and his character was already fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as a short tempered Brimmer. The funny thing is that he once again celebrates three different Columbo films and one "Mrs. Columbo" episode in completely different roles. He even played murder in some of these films again. By the way, he was not the only actor who did it in other Columbo films. Ray Milland also appears as a wife of the victim. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great big early Columbo movie and for the better ones who have come out of a long series of films. . <br /> <br /> 9/10
