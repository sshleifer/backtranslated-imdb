If you are a fan of T-Rex / Marc Bolan, I suggest you check it out. It shows the bright side of both Marc Bolan and Ringo Starri, which is probably a good time to take pictures of some scenes that are not part of the concert, but to have fun watching you just get to know them, and if a gifted musician is playing, as playful as also professional, tends to and impresses impressive girls impress. Looking at her as a concert, you would never have known that a rock star is a job, but it's just a good time to play some good friends with good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr, who perform in some live shows. True, a few songs are missing, which I would like to see there, but like all albums, it can't be all. I just bought it in 2006, but if I knew it was released in 1972, I would have bought it for years. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about car love will never manage to drive and die!
