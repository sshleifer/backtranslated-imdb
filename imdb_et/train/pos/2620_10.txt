With a pleasant surprise: Disney's DTV (Direct Video) sequel, which is actually good. "Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy event that includes everyone's favorite sounds and warthogi, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts with them, watching the original movie and commenting until Timon complains that "we are not here yet". After fighting with remote control, Timon and Pumbaa decide to listen to their audience. They start a new movie and laugh. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I lost hope for Disney. Most of their direct-video ticket price has been aggressively terrible, with the story desperately in cash. "1 1/2" decides to try something else: it tells the original story from a new perspective. Okay, this adds some things like Timon's advent and how he and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly accept the bond and friendship that loved us in the first film. There are also some clean movie parodies (including one scene that simultaneously violates "Good, Bad and Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke") and the script is full of funny memorable lines. <br /> <br /> The added cast is Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") Timon's worried mother and Jerry Stiller as Timon's crazy crazy uncle Max. Matthew Broderick appears in Simba and his "teen" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone does it well, especially Robert Guillame (how are you writing it?) As Rafiki, who is increasingly expressing Yoda speech in this film (Timon commented on it several times). <br /> <br /> 'Lion King 1 1/2' is the perfect choice for those who are tired of the Shrekification animation. 10/10
