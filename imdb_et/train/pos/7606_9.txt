Lost's first series began with a wave ... literally and slowly. It might have turned off some viewers and people who started to look halfway would be bored or just confused. <br /> <br /> I would advise people who have lost the world simply to look at it from the beginning and not in slow episodes. Acting the whole is great, but why are 5 series planned ... WHY ??? All this means that there are no answers for at least four years, yes, see if it keeps tension up and the dialogue flows.
