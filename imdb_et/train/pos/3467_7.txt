I still don't know why I watched this movie. Indeed, before I saw this movie, I knew virtually nothing about bangs. I didn't even know all their names! I knew they had many fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the biggest, they broke, John married Yoko Ono and John was murdered. <br /> <br /> VH1 is not even my favorite music, MTV is. However, for some reason, I decided to look at it, not much to wait. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well when there was light pressure. This is very important because John and Paul are pretty much talking about the whole movie, even though they are taken out to explore more ways and keep you looking. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give a good overall result. <br /> <br /> The end was also very smart. I liked how the film gets excited about SNL and then hits you and understands that it would be better if they just let go and finish with a good note. My favorite moment is probably touching the roof scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. This is a very good way of solving your curiosity that could have happened when Paul appeared just at John's disposal 6 years after the break. What is probably the main reason for watching this movie, solving my curiosity, who actually beat me and what might have happened to them after the break.
