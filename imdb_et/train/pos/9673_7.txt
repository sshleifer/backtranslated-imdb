Paulie sounds like the most sacred, lakselos and sentimental rubbish you could ever find, but it's actually much better than you might think. The charm of the plot would be so easily set for the whole film, but in most other departments the film is charming. <br /> <br /> If you mean, Paulie is a parrot. She bought a little girl with speech disorder, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes anywhere with her. He also sits at the shoulder of speech therapy lessons and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker. However, Paulie is sent to the mother of a little girl and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get NYC to LA to reunite her. <br /> <br /> So why does this terrible movie succeed relatively well? First, it offers some interesting and impressive animational effects. Secondly (and much more importantly) he has the courage to embrace his ridiculous assumption and talks about a truly moving, often humorous story without worrying too much for obvious mistakes. Third, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr, a charming dwarf, Gena Rowlands as an old lady, and Cheech Marin (yes, smoker Cheech Marin!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be classic, but Paulie is a good entertainment for kids of all ages.
