enjoyed the film and the effective Crucifix of Confucius, in the old order, the threatening young greedy man who undoubtedly represents modern society is preserved. I thought the last scene was strange and did not understand if we believed that the big D was punished for greedy or that part of it was long. I loved the scene and once in the Chinese film there was no violence in the choreographic martial arts festival. What I still care about in HK films is that the main effect that Britain seems to have been on introducing the "yes sir" and "sorry" of the local language and its fun to be long after we're gone they're still there.
