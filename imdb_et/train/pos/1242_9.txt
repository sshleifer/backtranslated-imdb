I love this movie. It is well written and acted and has good cinematography. The story combines activities, humor, mysticism and tenderness with amazing sets and beautiful location images. Check it out, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> The actors are good and Murphy is doing a great job of reluctant / unlikely hero. I liked all the characters and found them interesting and well developed with dynamic interaction. <br /> <br /> I took care of what happened to these people, and although the result was quite predictable (good guys to win, the hero gets, the hero becomes an amazingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives - who doesn't see it?) happy if everything ultimately worked well. God thanked that the dignity of the film was never violated by a dirty sequel. Grab some popcorn, tap on the couch and watch this fun, happy and fun movie.
