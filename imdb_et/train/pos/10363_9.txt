Spoilers: I took the book "Evil Angels" when he first knew nothing. Just to give the press and the oyster a break, I was far away before I began to question Chamberlain's guilt. The author has probably tried to understand the reader why the public jumped to their conclusions. John Bryson told the story exactly as it was presented to the arterial spray, the tile (??) tile, Dr. James Cameron's fortune that the collar was cut with scissors so that the child could not take his clothes intact, the buttons were still made, the bloody hand printing, etc. all convincing. After all, they were experts in their field who admitted that they had no obvious falsehood, and the fact that the evidence was totally wrong was not at all obvious to me. It was also very technical evidence that was difficult for the layman to understand. Here, after some testimonies of rumors, no one had ever heard a man attacking a person; people didn't believe it was possible. The public was suspicious of Seventh-day Adventists, whose origins showed that they were cultic, and any beliefs about them helped to create guilt. If it were not dedicated, selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and reluctant to investigate, Azaria could not find clothes later to get Lindy out of prison. The book shook me for this reason and I've been reluctant to have someone else's guilt ever since (except of course OJ). I was delighted that a film was made about the case and did not think it could have been done better. I've always liked Sam, whom I could fully recognize, and Meryl was perfect as always. Beautiful photography, haunting of music. I think it's not just a very good movie, but a very important one. Too bad it wasn't published at the time of its publication.
