Genre: Dinosaur, Animation, New York, Time Lapse, Circus. <br /> <br /> Key characters: Rex Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa pterodactyl, Dweeb Parasarolophus, Ooo Triceratops, boy named Louis, Girl Cecilia and Captain New-Eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs Clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa), etc.? <br /> <br /> What Happens: Four dinosaurs (see above) are fed to some "brain cereals" and are now cozy, friendly dinosaurs who are nice to children. Are they going with big plans in New York? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: It's a cute animated movie. Dinosaur animation, when they are moving and friendly, is a bit floppy and not so good, but they look so pleasant in the same way. I like dinosaurs if they are soft and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like others too. In general, I like this movie a lot! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended: People who like good children's movies, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think circuses aren't always what they look like? Enjoy! :-)
