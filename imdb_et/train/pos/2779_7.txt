That "Bend It Like Beckham" may not mean a lot of Americans who know very little about other football (football), but for English sports events it is equivalent to "Hit it like Bonds" or "Dunk it like Jordan". All young football players dream of a football match around a single player and a competition network like David Beckham, like a young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), makes Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play football games that have been banned by her traditional mother. One day playing, the passing friend Jules (Keira Knightley) drives his game and invites him to try to travel, all girls' football teams. After the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) satisfies, he does what he knows the mother does not agree with. Film does not mean parental disobedience, but a girl who does what she wants to do, even if it contradicts culture, not just parents. The film has been thrown into humor, especially when Jules's mother thinks she is a lesbian. The film uses a little clich√© moment because the big football game is the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, but it doesn't come from the cheese but rather from the fun and the light. Football action looks good, so sports fans enjoy it and the story of girls growing up in the boy's world, the football world inspires some of the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about football, but about a girl trying to find her parents at the same time, which is quite difficult.
