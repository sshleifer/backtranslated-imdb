It's about a mad scientist who creates a half-shark - half-man type of criticism on an unopened island, then invites all of his old business and academic friends to come and see his creations (laugh laughs), but in fact he wants his shark to kill! There are many bad GCIs, goofy plot elements, and tight t-shirt sweats. <br /> <br /> These monster films follow a similar formula, but it spiced up a bit of humor (I guarantee people who did it, the tongue was firmly seated on the cheek), not to mention the sexy girls. But we mention these sexy babes - several hot babes, in tight T-shirts, sweating proudly. At first, her panties, the other at the end. Thank you, thank you, filmmakers! The plot is full of funny things, the guy rides the Jeep, slams it directly into the tree, then the helicopter offers everyone to fly out of the island. Yes, well, how do we think about it for a while; we will return with you. Sharkman is fun - either a terrible CGI or equally comic rubber wash. The crazy scientist gives a pretty good result; he's bad, it's his motivation, he's not excuse. <br /> <br /> Generally, if you want a fool, FUN B movie, it should work.
