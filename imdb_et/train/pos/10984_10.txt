One question to ask immediately is: has this film been made if its women were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? <br /> <br /> The answer is: Probably not. <Br But fortunately they (or were) Jackie's cousin and aunt. <br /> <br /> This Maysles Brothers documentary about (one barely can call it life) Edith B. Beale, Jr. And his daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie) is the same steady train wreck - you don't want to look, but you have to. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie are living in New York at East Hampton, which slowly collapses around them. Once beautiful gardens are now jungle. <br /> <br /> Excellent oil painting tilts to the wall (the cats behind them have stools) and beautiful portraits when young women take the covers of old magazines next to the walls of the room. <br /> <br /> Living alone for many years has split many obstacles between two women, but has set others apart. <br /> <br /> Clothing seems to be optional. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of short trousers that are pulled over them, and her body and head wrapped around pieces of fabric fabric. <br /> <br /> Edith says, â€œEdie is beautiful in the 56's. And he's really. There are times when he is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that had ever been. <br /> <br /> There is a constant flow of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Their eating habits are (up to be polite). Ice cream spread to crackers. Edithi Wonder Bread Sandwich Dinner Party, served in a fine portion with a plastic dish. <br /> <br /> Time is insignificant in their world; as Edie says, "I have no watches." <br /> <br /> Relationships with men are oh-so-strange. <br /> <br /> Edie feels that Edith has failed his attempts. He says, "If you can't suggest a man to you, you may be dead." What Edith says, "I'll take the dog every day." <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Edith does not see his role with Edie's male. At the beginning of the film, he says, "France fell, but Edie was not. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes difficult to say exactly what is being said. Both women talk at the same time and are in constant contradiction with each other." All the animals in the movie have a strange relationship: Edie feeds the palms in the wash basins with Wonder Bread and cat food. The cats (and many of them) are everywhere. <br /> <br At one point, Edie says "the trait of aristocracy is responsibility." But they can't afford Take responsibility. <br /> <br /> It's a tough movie to watch but worth it.
