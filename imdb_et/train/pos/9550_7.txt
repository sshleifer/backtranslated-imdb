Despite the success in comedy or drama, Turkish directors have failed in the horror thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples of terrible Turkish films. <br /> <br /> But when you look at "Gen", you realize that it is a strike. The film's atmosphere is impressive and dark. It is also colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks are compatible with the film, but the script is not perfect and the theme of the movie is normal. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Gen" makes no difference to horror movies, but it does not disappoint the thriller fans. In this regard, it is successful for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
