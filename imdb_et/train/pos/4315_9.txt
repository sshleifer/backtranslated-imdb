I watched this movie again and I'm still scared of the number of cynics who just leave it to the New Age priest. A great movie that takes time to evolve, it is close to crossing the edge, but never does and is finally a meditative, influential and more real life than most movies. I was angry at the time that films such as "Prints of Tides" and "Bugsy" (although I liked the latter) were nominal for this year's best picture (not to mention that "Lambate silence" won!) And it was completely ignored one of the best scenarios. When I review it, I think history will support my first reaction!
