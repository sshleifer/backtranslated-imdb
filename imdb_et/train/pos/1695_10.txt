Usually the best way to disturb me in the film is to include some references to Orson Welles. But here's the sci-fi comedy that cites the world war ... and it's gold! A small bunch of small, aggressive and stupid aliens who have been wrong with the kids in Halloween dress are great. Don't be fooled by the idea that as it seems like a child's film, it's complicated - it's not, there's a lot of hidden treasure ... Gem!
