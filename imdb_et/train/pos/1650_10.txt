An excellent series, masterfully operated and directed, but I liked (told to me) by Mr Deighton and that he took back after a one-time presentation. It is now visible only in private collections and through a special request from the British Film Institute. It is very unfortunate that Ian Holm's subtle imagination is tired, but the determined Bernard Samson is great; one of the best performances. Supportive cast, including young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are excellent. When Mel Martin played a controversial and embarrassing wife, and Michael Degen as Werner of Mercury, the story is positively shaken by the tragic and fatal personal consequences of the great game.
