If your idea of ​​a thriller is chasing a car, explosions, and dozens of people thrown by a firearm, "House of Games" is definitely not a movie for you. If you want and appreciate psychological drama and intercourse, always look at it. <br /> <br /> "The Game House" speaks to a reputable psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who is trying to help the patient and participate in the shady world of charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna) guides. To say more about talking, would disrupt the relationship. Frankly, I find it hard to believe someone who says they saw the turn. Just like a smart con artist, this movie pulls your web and repels your vigilance. <br /> <br /> The story is tense and well-designed, the dialogue is smart and laconic, working smoothly evenly (Mantegna is perfectly charismatic). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse so physically attractive. But Dr Ford should be cold and kind; moreover, his homework is very important for the plot (at one point I believe that damaging his sexual self-esteem is an important part of his motivation ... I won't say more). <br /> <br /> "Game House" is a dark look at the bottom side of human nature, ending with a sign of discomfort. It keeps your attention every second when you look and stay with you for a long time.
