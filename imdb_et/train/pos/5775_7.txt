See people, see the title! LOL! I remember seeing the film as a function of creatures created on Saturday late night. It's a big, cheesy monster that is a funny bad actor and two wonderfully moral mountain songs that add a schlock factor. The movie has 2 boat boats with red boats! LOL, and you love a boat scene where an English man and his wife talk about all the stars and are in midday and sunshine. Bloody fun !!! You can say that they just don't care about the plot, they just wanted to film the movie as soon as possible. The bottom line, you love it, if you love the 70's.
