I don't know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive respect for some Muslim religious activity (hairy), but I just felt that the film was so underestimated. I just can't believe that only 223 people have recently voted on the film, since the film was produced in 2004 and since then has won many awards. About the movie ... this is one of those well-behaved sweet movies. Reda, a French teenager sitting for the Baccalauréat, asks her dedicated older father to bring her to Mecca. Oddly enough, as it may seem (if you don't know much about Islam), Dad wants his son to lead them from his home from France to Saudi Arabia during a religious pilgrimage. The intergenerational difference between father and son is based on simple enough conditions ("you can learn how to read and write but you do not know anything about life, "unnamed father to your son", but some bromide generation gap will be avoided from literature, they are fond of their frustrations. Father does not speak French, although Reda understands the Arabic language but seems to be the answer in French. touching the road with many people: "There's a frightening old woman they pick up at the Bosnian border in Belgrade, and a talkative Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian) who helps them on the Turkish border, reluctantly and shy women who wear the Burkas on their way from Damascus, is always in conflict. Daddy and son, there is not much talk in the movie that makes it more pleasing to the eyes. every city they go to. The director even shows you the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, although the film is not quite long. <br /> <br /> In general, I don't like movies that don't have enough dialogues and they take power from camera nuances, but it was really great. Despite some unanswered details (such as Reda's inexperienced French girlfriend) she wants the movie to mind. A great work of art and remember this film is the debut of Ismaël Ferroukh.
