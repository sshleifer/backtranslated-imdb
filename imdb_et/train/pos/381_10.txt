I gave this film 10 not because it is a perfectly consistent film, but it is a pure ability to bring out emotions in our audience. One woman's fight-against-all-odds are now an old clich√©, but very few films have carried so much heat and sincerity as The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> showed a different aspect than the African-American experience, which shows that after the freedom of slaves many hated "white men" fell and abused their people. I think this is an important point, because it contradicts the trend of a portrait-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar. <br /> <br /> The actors are also great - especially Oprah, whom I now have a new respect for. <br /> <br /> Worth viewing - but keep the tissue at hand.
