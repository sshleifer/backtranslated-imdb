This is a movie that would probably be Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant when it was done today; in fact, now that I think about it, it's probably one day. It's nice, but without depth. It suffers from James Stewart's almost deadly mistake, which is about 20 years old for him and, as a result, he and his beautiful Kim Novak are not chemistry. Ernie Kovacs is the only actor in the film in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer whose approach approaches what you can name. (** 1/2)
