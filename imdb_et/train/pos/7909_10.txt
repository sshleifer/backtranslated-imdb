When this first came out, my father brought it home - we were surprised at it - It was so different from what we saw before. I was looking for a specific movie last night and again found "Minds of Mind". The box breaks down and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! Although it is not a "Nemo" quality graphics, it is still very good. They should resell it - this is a landmark for computer animation images. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> This is what it is: <br /> <br /> "Mind's Eye" is a spectacular odyssey over time. Your journey starts from the threshold of creation and moves through the human and the rise of technology. Traveling in the Abstraction World and Future Computer Animation Photos. <br /> <br /> "Mind the Eye" combines the imagination of more than 300 of the world's most talented computer animators with a powerful and original music track. This unique collaboration leads you to the incredible road "Mind's Eye".
