I watched this movie randomly, having purchased it as a B-side on an Omega Man DVD. The omega man was a bit disappointing - except for the beginning, which was clearly an inspiration 28 days later, the rest is just TV movies. But Soylent Green is in the second league. I bet it's one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie I've never seen before. Heston slowly got into the "furniture" bed, discussing something else that is completely connected! A whole crowd of people gathered in the mechanical excavator fleet! A priest who confesses and confesses the testimony. Maybe it has already been done - but such films are not so consistently original. And what the hell is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple, or what? Fortunately, I saw the end of the movie without knowing what is probably rare. Then I looked at it again and enjoyed all the little tips that make a long early scene worthwhile. Very nice script - and also some great kits. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
