This movie surprised me very much. I doubted it first, but the film got better and better every minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be for the audience, but for those who love a very strange portrait of a very strange criminal, husband, lover and spouse. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, it is not really for you. <br /> <br /> The story is sometimes somewhat difficult to follow, but in the end, I think it did better. The end was unexpected because you were almost disappointed if you thought it would end. <br /> <br /> As for the example, I think it was good. It's not a long Oscar award, but it's at least in my eyes. Gil Bellows Prison's human portrait is not always perfect, but it's a lot of fun. The portrait of Clinque, a companion of Shaun Parkes Bellows Prison, is great and extremely powerful. On the backside, I think I'll put the portrait of Esai Morales on Markie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, whether you love it or not!
