According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. These Mats Helge movies are somewhat difficult to take, as most of her movies are very tight. Almost USD is not at all. But it is fascinating that Mats Helge will end up with something that can be called an action movie. Ninja's mission is - I think - the best of all the staged films. Some special effects are quite enjoyable. It's not a "B" or "C" movie. It's a "Z" movie - but an enjoyable and fun "Z" movie!
