Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades complete a space mission that sees them through Saturn's rings. His comrades are killed instantly, but they seem to be really happy. Steve constantly returns to the mass of humanoid cellulose; when he becomes a wild killer that melts all the steps, he follows his friend Dr Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). <br /> <br /> It's often so funny funny - enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that I find it hard to believe that laughs are all involuntary. It seems to me that this is the effort of a low budget genre of the 50s and 60s, and so it is an amazing film. This sequence of sister is just fun. We are even treated with a split screen sequence that really doesn't add anything but is still a gas to watch. his extreme character is really memorable. I think his pace is little; some scenes (like a couple with the elderly) go a little long, but eventually give it a solid, stubborn, B-movie with some degree of panic. Klimax is especially fun. <br /> <br /> The music of Arlon Obers is tremendously shaky (but also somewhat funny foolish) and Willy Curtis's cinema sometimes creates some very great shots. It brings me to Rick Bakers' fantastic and convincing make-up effects that make the film a very venerable center until the final thaw. <br /> <br /> Rebar is a difficult makeup for almost the whole movie. (Sachs also gets his praise for hit the ground on the film) and does what he needs to do well. DeBenning makes a rather harsh and silly hero and Ann Sweeney is not a woman or his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are well supported. It's also worth seeing people like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (making a remarkable topless shot), Janus Blythe (Tobe Hoopers 'Eaten Alive' and Wes Cravens 'The Hills Have Eyes') and even director Jonathan Demme a bit. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining midnight movie that is gore, chills, and laughs to judge it to be worth everywhere for low quality sci-fi / horror lovers. <br /> <br /> 8/10
