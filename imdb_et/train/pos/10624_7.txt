I thought I should qualify after reading the comments of others. The film is not big, but it has many great elements. Lighting and scenes with camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but fun. Operation is bad, but not inferior to the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good and gore is good. It has a big face in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched a full movie and, although it was mostly predictable, it was still enjoyable. Women are attractive enough and the leading person does a good job to be whore and horrible. The film was very clean for contemporary film and violence against children aged 13 and over. Gender was not. I gave her ten out of 10 and I think it's fair. I would look at it again if I had nothing better to do. The gay sounding angel was the most disturbing aspect of the film, the devil is quite scary.
