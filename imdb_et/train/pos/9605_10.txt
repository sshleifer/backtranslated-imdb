Well I wasn't sure what the movie was like I had only seen a small clip, but I thought it was going to be good and I was right I looked at it twice a day when I got it and it's me I think Alison Lohan played a very good part because he is such a lattice actor and the writer must have got into a lot of research to find out about bulimia, though the end when beth is in hospital is after 2 Horus observation after meal, because iv was told that 1 house is OK and hospitals do not help with bullying because iv was told what is probably the reason I am still at home, even if my sister and mother would like me to be hospitalized because I have bulimia, but this is a restraint that I recommend it to anyone who has a eating disorder or with whom, or to people who know some eating disorders, because it may let them eat a person alive and see the world how they get a little bit over the rest and I recommend it to anyone and every type of person
