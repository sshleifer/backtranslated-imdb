All dogs go to heaven, one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time as I was 3. Now I'm 12 years old and I rented it, it makes me think, and it brings back so many memories, these were "days". I love music, I love when Charlie comes to heaven, I love the song "Let me be surprised". I love how Charlie sees and his voice, Bert Reynolds, could only play this Charlie's voice perfectly. I love this movie, the first is the best because it is so original and great. It draws back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could go back to these days. I love the characters. If this is the case, the memories come back when I think I feel like I am 19, I hope I can see it when I'm older. When I first saw it, I didn't know I was really looking back and feeling it, I hope it can be tracked. I'm so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a perfect 10. This is an amazing film. It is very difficult to explain when I get old and when I have children, I hope they can feel that feeling.
