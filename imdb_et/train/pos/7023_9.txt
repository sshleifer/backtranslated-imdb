I loved that this film knew the intelligence of the viewer, allowing the layer to peel the characters in their interactions, which concerns the unspoken loss that has so affected them. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is beautiful and it is an inspired reflection of the human vision I believe is a very talented new filmmaker with a maturity and artistic understanding to tell the story that others with much more experience are failed to achieve. I see the bright future of this writer / producer / director who was able to focus on the goal and achieve it in a holistic way. <br /> <br /> Tissue for this achievement.
