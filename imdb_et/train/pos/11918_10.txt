"Angels in Outfield" was originally the Ted Turner Library 1951 film; Disney remade it in 1994, this time using the California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disney previously owned by this and Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team, as well as good use of words, ah ?????). <br /> <br /> This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. One man only allowed the boys to have a family when the angels won the pennant. So he called God one night out of it. The boy who prayed saw the help coming through the aid (and ONLY this boy); For example, when the first angel came down, the player hit such a hard ball that not only the bat break, so did the ball !!!!! For the great part of the 1994 All-Star season, the angels were at the top of the western West (of which my group Rangers is one and it is still). But they lost the game because the boy was in court instead of white Sox / Angels game (at that time Baseball was not a central unit, so Chicago was in the west) and no angels were there. So a new rule was created: no angels can play in the championship. But wait! In the final championship, the angels won !!!!! It was really a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: it's a good movie. I mean, I prayed every night in recent years, asking for help in school and things; Look at me now! My job was good !!!!! So it shows that if you believe God can send his angels down to help you with any kind of problems you may have in life. And second, it's a family baseball movie that's always exciting. It's also an old Disney movie; I just saw it recently on the New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Angels Outside" will change your life forever if you have seen it !! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
