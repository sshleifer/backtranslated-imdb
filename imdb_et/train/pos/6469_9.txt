Hal Roach is very short. This is due to two main reasons: Littlest children short are some of the most loved ones who have ever been on film and have so many funny and well-written elements. <br /> <br /> The small Rascals, frankly, do not think of a child over forty years old as Spankyst. Despite being a rather plump and unpleasant child in later years, she was just valuable here. And taking responsibility for taking care of a small little boy for even younger children was not only funny, but once again a very cute factor. any funny chaos breaks open. The gags are quite effective and well done by then - with a random crank call that involves murder and the last scene where Spanky finally controls those who are most memorable. I haven't seen these short decades, and I'm glad I gave you this opportunity.
