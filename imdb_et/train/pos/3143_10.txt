If an exhibition of the last ten years deserves 10, it is a rare gem. This allows us to get back to the time when things were simpler and more fun. Filled with heart and laughs, this show keeps you laughing for three decades. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colored and even the drugs were tolerated. The hair was feathered, the music came with roller skates and, according to Merle Haggard, "the common was a bad place". Take the trip back to America for the most time. Feel the characters and the small town where people were more comfortable with each other. This classic is as much as "Full House" on television. Don't forget to remember and always remember to "shake your groin!"
