Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Never ever did I find myself in space during the film. Konkana Sen did a good job in the film, although I think someone would have been more glamorous or enthusiastic, but she did a good job. All supporting actors were also very good and helped with the film. Boman Irani did a great job. In this film, one thing stands out. READING it's great and very realistic, it doesn't turn around the bush, it's very easy to send a message. I think more of this movie should be done, I'm sick of watching the same candy fiber movies over and over again. Everyone should look Page 3, this is a great movie. - Just my 2 cents :)
