You can discuss prince talents or even his choice as a parody in his life in this movie. His musical talent is not, or is currently being discussed. It seems that the hidden has been twenty years later, but the music is still relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> Having lived through this film (high school in the 85th year) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at that time. From Tipper Gore (Al-wife), who tries to censor "Little Nikki" and all the other things under the sun through the PMRC (Parent Music Center) into every "Air Band" that impressed, it was the absolute hottest thing. For at least a few weeks, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie and we were as excited as it premiere. It is not disappointed. ALL was left behind. I was at that time MTV junkie (they played the music then .... all the time) Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I have to qualify this comment by saying that at that time my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, Fixx, Sheep Cattle and others in the Punk / New Wave genre. At that time, Prince's music surpassed all types and styles. One of the reasons why some seem so funny and controversial is that it was SOOOOOOOO great. All the things that remind you of the 80's were then iconic. It was the mainstream and it now seems like a cliche. It became so popular that it became ridiculous. It's like Rappin Granny's commercial Wendy Hamburger. <br /> <br /> Now it seems stupid because EVERYTHING got into it (unfortunately, like a kind of odd purple macarena or something. Anyway, I hope it gave you an overview.
