I have personally seen many Disney movies in my life, although none of them fit in Bedknobs and Broomsticks in any way. Though I wouldn't have been acting in animation in person, it was better when I tried to dress people as animated characters. The film has two world war evacuations sent to a silent and socially uncomfortable woman in the country. I have to say that the pain was great. Angela Landsbury did the perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great desperate entertaining interest. The end will always surprise me and it was no exception. It wasn't happy or sad, though I don't know if it was deliberate. The dialogue was not great, but given that it was meant for a child's picture, it is all right. In general, I would give ten out of ten performances, ten out of ten, nine out of ten, and eight out of ten costumes.
