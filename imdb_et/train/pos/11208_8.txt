Where are you going, my little one, little ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you are two, turn around and you're four ... <br /> <br /> Remember these shows when they first came to Disneyland transmitted. I remember sitting there, electrifying with the explanations of Werner Van Braune's missile science. I watched that history, science and humor were all intertwined with the story of opportunity. <br /> <br /> It was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series and into the treasure they belong to. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who didn't even come to the room at first, but later changed her mind when she saw that they were partially animated. When he looked at him, and finally he was almost as deep as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you are a young woman whose babes are yours ... <br /> <br /> Of course, some predictions about getting to the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive. I found that my daughter's teacher wanted to show them to her class, not only as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as a fun and easy-to-understand lesson in history. <br /> <br /> Turn around, turn around and over again ... you don't know how much has actually changed in 50 years.
