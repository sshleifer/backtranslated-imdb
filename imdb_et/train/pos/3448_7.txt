Documentary without losing words ... ever ... <br /> <br /> Suppose that narration is more than a fraud, let's say it's a commentary on Japanese society. And since this movie is as fast paced as the absurd documentary, as they come, this constant word game has been translated as quickly and as badly as it is - in its current version of the festival reader, which is to be seen this evening at the Copenhagen Cinema - it's still quite enjoyable. But with the patient and only the truly patient and open minded, I'm telling you Jim Jarmuschi fans who have ADD relapses, I believe it's a movie for you. It's a smart movie if you let him win. <br /> <br /> Pretty pretty and quite narrow and quite Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in 3D world. All in all, it is fun for those who want to see a Japanese film that violates Japanese food culture. Tiny up when you're in the mood for something completely different.
