This hidden de Sica supplies the goods. And it is said that "the poor will inherit the earth." This is a story about classes on the surface, but really an allegory for all homeless people who lived in Europe after a great war. They are homeless, but joyful, in a society that is too impoverished and selfish to care for or recognize them, the Italian carpet bags. de Sica decides to talk about it as a fairy tale, Cinderella story. I haven't read this book, so I can't predict if the deus ex machina is a writer or a Vittorio construction. It begins with the words "From time to time ..." to show your story of timelessness, because the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. The sketches of the aristocratic cartoons that cut the bone, the charming nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to give their desires and finish directly from Spielberg's picture, make this boulange a joy for everyone. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best. The abandonment of neo-realism, he always left this and pure good old film, creates a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fulfills the desire for hope that man must continue to leave the world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
