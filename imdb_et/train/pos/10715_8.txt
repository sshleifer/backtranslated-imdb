Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of another city in Toronto. He has made several guests and ads in Canada. Finally, it makes sense for someone to create a show for him. The supporting case also seems quite good. I've been watching the pilot several times now and I'm still refreshing. Although I'm not sure why the show is shown for the Jane Show 2004. (Maybe I was wrong) But when I know it was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared in Canada at the beginning of 2006 on global television. fresh idea and hopefully it well. Too bad that it couldn't be linked to Corner Gas. Now I know that angular gas is on the color TV, but two examples would be great companions.
