This is one of the best crime drama films in the late 1990s. It was filled with great pain, a powerful story, and many of the players involved performed great performances. Pacino was great; he should have applied for something. John Cusack was also good if the viewer did not hold the accent of his Louise siana. He may be irritating if you fail in this dialect. The way Pacino's character responded to Cusack's character was plausible, dramatic, and sometimes somewhat comic. Danny Aiello was great as always. David Paymer played a big supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too much. It might take another look to remember what "Zapatti was?" After so many cross references, you need to stop and think about just summarizing. The end was not much. It was built so long and was a bit devastating. It was one of the few problems with the film. Since the film was not taken as a big picture, it made some forget that this film even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of "splash" in theaters may not have been a candidate. It was a semi-successful home market and viewers still learn that this title is there. Made in 1996, it still stands today and remains popular over many years. <br /> <br /> So, make yourself some lemon porridge (you see) and watch this movie!
