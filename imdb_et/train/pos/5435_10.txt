I saw this picture for $ 11 in 1940 and in 2006 I would like to protect the DVD. The film was the greatest adventure of time, and like all epics, it is still an entertaining wonder (B&W and all). the real connection between the chemistry of acting and the performances of the actors and Sam Jaffe & Eduardo Cianelli is outstanding (it couldn't be done today, especially the end where the colonel speaks to the end of Kipling's poem over Gunga Din's body and says "Untouchable" "You are a better man than me I am Gunga Din "They don't do that today. The only cast member who's still alive is Joan Fontaine
