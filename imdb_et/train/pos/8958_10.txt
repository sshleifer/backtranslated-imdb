After seeing Vertigo, check out Bell, Book and Candle, which has been done in a few months. <br /> <br /> My second favorite Kim Novak movie with a picnic coming third. <br /> <br /> All three performances are great, Vertigo, the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came from somewhere near the town of Kansas Prairie, in the 50s of Salina, Kansas, to Picnic. The clock, the book and the musical result of the candle, I believe it is one of Alex North. Ideal for this comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart, and Novak, this comedy made fun of dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It is worth your time if you like Kim Novak. My young Greta Garbo.
