I don't understand this movie's low 5.7 rating. It is a pleasure for people who like a strong mid-range and dark atmosphere. The tone resembles midnight good and evil in the garden until the west (Savannah). The action is strong and I was surprised by the truthfulness of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval has a small part and Embeth Davitz is BOMB. Also her perfect naked scene. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly standard but efficiently executed.
