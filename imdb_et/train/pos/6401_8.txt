Honored men have many great aspects to this. A good sequence of action, a lot of "good feelings" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really changes the film is a great actor. Mainly Robert Deniro. The story of men Honor focuses on Carl Brashear, played by Cuban Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African-American deep-sea diver in the Navy. It crowns its harsh struggles from the poor farmer to the entrance to the diving school and beyond. This is a good story, but it seems to have been done many times before. Man can not give up all the odds until they reach the goals they set for some time for a sentimental reason. This may happen, but much of the struggle for Brashear's faces in the film is questionable, including C.O. Diving School Violation With Its Final Test. But it's all done for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday, who is a Brashear diving school teacher. As soon as Deniro arrives, he leaves this extreme arrogance that cannot be hated if you have no incredible power. Before the end of the movie, Deniro will give you several speeches that would laugh at how cool he is, but you are too amazed at how he hits them. Finally, you have to doubt some aspects of the movie, but admit it, if it were true, it would have been twenty minutes past you.
