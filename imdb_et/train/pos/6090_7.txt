jealousy is not as funny as I thought it was originally, but after some comments I read that it is much more fun than the people to whom this props were given, now it is not a minute film like zoolander or dodgeball, but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and Christopher walken is as big as ever, so the story is related to Jack's black, which invents a nozzle that makes dogs pooh disappear, obviosly ben does not want this part, but if the product does this jack black rich ben stiller begins to see envy, its not great by all means and so ben stiller as well as jack black is your belt under the fun and better movies, but if your fan would recommend it still funny flick and smiled my ass several times because big fan Ben stiller id has to say it is less quiet but still very fun to watch it
