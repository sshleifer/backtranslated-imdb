Shortly before the moral code was introduced in the dark, the spirits of writers, directors and actors, adaptation of W. Somerset's Maugham's "Human Bondage" first film to countless filmmakers. This is not a shock value today, just a good one. <br /> <br /> Although this is great, it is Bette Davis' first big role and one of Leslie Howard's best productions. Howard is an English wannabe Parisian artist Philip Carey, who is gently and firmly told that he has no talent and that his commitment is not a substitute for a true genius. Feeling at heart, he returns to London and enrolls at a medical college (one, by the way, seems to have no female students - at least some would have been at that time. Maybe the author / doctor Maugham was not taking care of distaff medicine). <br /> <br /> One day, Carey has attracted the speaker, Mildred Rogers, the role of Bette Davis morally, and basically a wicked evil. His Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle. His repeated attempts to greet him so far are less than an enthusiastic answer: "I don't like it," is a sure sign for all men who have headed to spend the depths. Maugham's Mildred has added some old-fashioned street walks to the advice of his speakers, something that is not clearly outlined here. <br /> <br /> Carey's packed torture is a little worth of financial support for Rogers. She loves her desperately - she plays her as an organ of Sunday Church effortlessly. There is no sex here. Recognizing that he is not going anywhere, he starts a brave relationship with Nora, the woman who adores her. Enter Mildred again, full of children, and his usual need to care. Get out of my heart with Norah. <br /> <br /> Another separation from Mildred and Careys begins with Sally's long-lasting friendship, which his father has been enthusiastically helping with, as he seems to see marriage as good as for two youngsters, and the possibility of being released from one of his nine offspring. <br /> <br /> The film is reasonably, but not completely, Maugham's great novel. Howard Carey is naive and vulnerable and a large part of the film is reminiscent of her sad eyes with a double-shot pistol. Mildred is an unlimited evil, the worst type of user, his only concern for his needs barely concealed when he tries to leave Carey with thin affectionate words (and offers - at one point he promises to do something [he wants, "a bold statement of those times and one The place I am sure the audiences have fully understood. <br /> <br /> Pre-code that may be, but ending Mildred's quick route would be a satisfying Catholic peace of mind. /> <br /> Director John Cromwell made great performances of his two main stars, one of which is well-established and the other is largely due to this film. The return of London and travel is worth it. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD l. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for Davis and Howard shows)
