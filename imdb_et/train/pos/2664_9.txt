Although The Shining is over a quarter century old, I argue that Jack Nicholson's descent into madness will not happen. It is a rare example of something unique that no one has been able to cut it off; Instead, it is referred to again in pop culture. Gemini, blood lift, RedRum, crazy nonsense "writing" ... it should be seen if nothing else to understand all the tips given to it in everyday life. The film is both intimidating, suspicious, beautiful and psychologically intriguing. This is the classic Hitchcock secret and the fear of modern thriller. And it also has fiction films that are usually absent: a big script.
