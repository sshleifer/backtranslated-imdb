This exhibition succeeds because it invites all adults, regardless of where they are in their relationship. Like a man who was married for 26 years, I know the character of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but he assumes he knows it. I also have his monotonous delivery; never get too excited or too low. Nice character. This is a nice addition to Monday night. <br /> <br /> I don't know how David Spade is in his role. It is best to enjoy small doses. She also seems a bit old to still troll for women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to the progress of the series.
