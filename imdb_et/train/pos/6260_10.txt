It was provocative of the soul! I am in Iran and live in the 21st century, I did not know that such great tribes have lived in such circumstances during my grandfather's time! <br /> <br /> You see that today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world, a woman or a child would be able to earn everything in her purity and on demand, but here 80 years ago people suffered their lives to go anywhere on the grassland. It is really interesting that these Persians carry these difficulties to find their sheep pastures, but they lose a lot of sheep on the road. <br /> <br /> I commend the Americans who have sent this tribe as hard as the Bachthian people.
