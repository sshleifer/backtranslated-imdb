I don't know if it contains a spoiler or not, but I don't want to risk blacklisting until 3462. <br /> <br /> I completely disagree with the viewer's comments that describe * Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neoraristic". They couldn't see the same series as * I * did. The series * I * looked at how the history of European colonization in America and South Africa did not describe particular inaccuracies. I didn't see anything in this series that would depict Europeans as bad people who were happy, though Europeans were often * happy - and luck has nothing wrong with happiness. Nor did I see indigenous peoples depicted as things of bad innocents. If anything, the Ink was quite arrogant - as you think any leader would be dealing with aliens if his country has not been captured by the memory of any other world. <br /> <br /> I didn't see anything that could be considered Marxism or Neorarist except for the most incredibly elastic imagination. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African people * have built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. At a time when they were at the height of their advancements, the Aztecs, Mayans and Inca civilizations were as advanced as any other in the world - and so rich; sometimes more. American natives and Khoi-San populations * were destroyed due to diseases caused by smallpox and other Europeans; just like the European colonists destroyed tropical diseases like malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from all other sub-Saharan African peoples.) <br /> <br /> So I don't see what some other commentators complain about. The only thing I can find is that the series doesn't tell me something that I didn't know at the end of the seventh grade. There is really nothing new about historical information in this movie. Nonetheless, it presents some dramatic dramas of events such as the conquest of Incas; production values ​​are very high; and it fills here and there with some holes that were not covered in the sixth hour of Mrs Gruber in the social science class at the high school in Milan. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy it, assuming you had a decent basic and / or high school education, you don't learn anything new, but you have a pleasant and entertaining time when you look at what you've already passed through high school .
