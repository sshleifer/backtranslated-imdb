NYC, 2022: Greenhouse effect, lost oceans, unemployment and scarcity of water, electricity and food, and the population of New York has exceeded 40 million. This is a little picture, especially since the exhausted future of resources is for us the citizens of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie's low budget opening is great: the music-based, low-tech 'tape-slides' sequence, which consists entirely of archive photos from the dawn of photography until 1973, represents a pristine American pastor that develops in less than 2 minutes polluted and crowded during hell. Fine and unambiguous, it's truly memorable. Budget constraints are also quite unimaginable behind cinematography and other constraints that contradict the brilliant premise of the story. The police station sequences are similar to the episode of the 70's TV detective samples, and other interior sets look best. The budget is likely to have all been trying to "futurize" the Soylent Executive's Chelsea West apartment, with state-of-the-art benefits, which means that other costumes are insecure, some of the shots are under-funded, and the daily exterior looks seem to be fired through a smoke filter. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share meals in expensive and rare foods, bring their society together: they enjoy a real bourbon, salad, celery, tomato, apple and beef and we really feel the lips of the value of someone else's rich privileges. <br /> <br /> Robinson's main death scene, where his character is happy to be a place called "Home", immersed in a world of beautiful flora and fauna once he remembers them, as opposed to the beautiful Thorn threshold that the future is bankrupt, among other horrors. <br /> <br /> This is one smart movie and its main message is as relevant as it was in the early 1970s. Yes, I know we're not eating dead yet, but because of our longevity, poverty gap, global capitalism and the loss of uncontrolled habitats associated with climate change, Soylent Green can make a lasting forecast.
