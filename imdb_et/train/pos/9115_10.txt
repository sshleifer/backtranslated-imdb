The idea is a very short film with a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining, and leaves the viewer more wanting. The producer has created a superb quality short film that cannot be compared to other short films I've seen. I've rated this movie with the highest rating possible. I also recommend that it be presented to office managers and the business community in every company. It follows that people with ideas will never be heard, their voice will never be heard. This is a lesson to be learned by any institution that wants to go further. I hope the produced part will produce the second part of this idea. I look forward to seeing the sequence. Once again, Halaqah congratulates the media on creating a top quality and quality film.
