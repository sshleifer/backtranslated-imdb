This movie is funny SOOOO !!! The actor is WONDERFUL, Ramones are sexy, jokes are fine, and the plot is just what every college dreams about at school. I loved both the soundtrack and the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, you love this movie. This movie is a tad bit of "fat" Esk (without all the disturbing songs). Singing songs are nice; you can even find that these songs sing when the movie is over. This musical place is the musical music (next to the blues brothers). But please, don't think about it as music? Seeing how the songs are so nice, it's hard to say a carefully choreographed scene. I think this movie is more of a comedy with romance. You are reminded of a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you remember the days of your old high school after seeing the movie. Highly recommended for the family (as it is very youthful, but also for adults because there are many jokes that are more fun with age and experience.
