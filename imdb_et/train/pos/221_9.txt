I remember this movie originally in Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I didn't really feel humor since then, but this movie can laugh loudly at me. <br /> <br /> With respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar of this film. His performance is amazing - given that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. Her ways are first-rate. ("You know what songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when you spoke to a Spanish-speaking person at the reception: "No! No! No enchilada !!") Fun! /> Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who played directly with Matthau. <br /> <br /> I just want it to be on DVD because my VHS recording becomes a bit old. <br /> <br /> With Woody Allen, I have no interest in seeing a remake, because it is in no way compatible with the original.
