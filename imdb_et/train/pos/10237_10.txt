This is one of the best films coming out of Hong Kong's "New Wave", which began with Tsui Hark's "ZU: War Mountains Magic Mountain". Tsui gave a tone to New Wave's approach to the martial arts film, so that all new wave leaders (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) made known since then; namely, the approach to such films needs more than irony, if not direct comedy. The "burning paradise" stopped everything from this and revenge. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of humor; but it is purely human humor, as in the case of the early obsolete Buddhist priest, who manages to swiftly recognize the young prostitute in the bundle of shoulders. But it is the same as people, not even Buddhist priests, can always be holy. <br /> <br /> When the film finally has irony, it is the least possible that comes from the Temple of Red Hope, a study of pure nihilism, as it has never been recorded before. He is the embodiment of Milton's Satan on "Paradise Lost": "It is better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven!" And if he can't get Satan's hell out soon, he will turn him around the world into a living hell that he can rule. : It's not that Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to feel despair, feel completely hopeless, accept their nihilism as a comprehensive reality. Thus, there is a definite concept that passes through the scenes of the Red Temple that there may not be any other reality outside the Temple - it has become all in the universe, and Abbot, who claims the mastery of endless power, is responsible. br /> <br /> Fortunately, the movie doesn't end there. Although there are losses, a person who is usually a human being is in control. (If you want to know how to see it, check out the movie!) However, there is no doubt that when we watch this movie, we visit hell. Hopefully we will not recognize our own aftermath; but we feel that experience seems disappointed - and somehow better.
