It's not my favorite WIP ("Women in prison"), but it's one of the most famous movies in the genre. It has been produced by Roger Corman, who has already produced some WIPs. It is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. The film takes place in a US prison, not a "banana republic" like most WIP movies. I'm not sure if this was a wise move, but it is an acceptable pace change. The writer-director Demme really does his job, always complaining about new ways to present a familiar scenario. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for himself. The filmmaker creates some surreal dream sequences that are borderline, but it is nice to see how hard he is trying to put this movie over the chains of his average chicks. But don't worry, Demme is still working on sub-genre parameters. There's a lot of nudity and violence that corresponds to hardcore fans. The film is a little slow, but it's a lot of fun. The cast is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so he doesn't need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is like a wheelchair crazy guard. However, Pam Grier is seriously missed.
