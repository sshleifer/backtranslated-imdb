Like a Western country looking at the views and traditions of another culture, I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying parents by mutual agreement between parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet this is the Hindi film. We said with humor and a fresh perspective that we are learning from Abhay and Ritsa, who have only met once and are now in their traditional five-day honeymoon. As has been said, it is difficult to believe in this wealthy age of a mobile phone, so that archaic practice, like organized marriage, is still happening. We see the inconvenience that this young couple is feeling when they come together the first night and how they try to make a connection, although they don't know each other. We see the different views of marriage and dedication that other couples present on vacation, twenty years with others who are married to others, still insecure in divorce. There are songs, spiritual dialogue, bright moments, mixing and comparing new ways and traditions. Watching a movie with subtitles will definitely lose the truth of the story, but it is nevertheless a joy to watch. The plot is somewhat small and the bus incident is a little pulled out and picked up; however, it was worth watching the whole movie.
