I enjoyed the first part of the two bands, The Impossible Planet, and I was a little worried that the second part would not be as good as it was in the past of the last two parties. But, fortunately, my fears were unjustified because I found myself in this episode as much as the previous one. Anyway, we start with surviving crew members from Ooda, who has become a devil's pawn. There is also a bit of a philosophical physician in the episode I enjoyed quite a bit. Needless to say, this was a good solid thesis story. For young viewers it may be too intense. <br /> <br /> My class: B +
