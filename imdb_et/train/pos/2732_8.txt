Herbet Clutter, the wife of Bonnie and their teenage children, Kenyon and Nancy, were very much in their small town of Holcombis, Kansas, and were honored, but in the early years of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. Rather, the crime unexpectedly created an impression on the author Truman Capote, who hurried to the scene and followed the end of the incident. The result was a book called COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking and exceptionally well written, it became the international best seller and remains a critical factor for today's criminals. <br /> <br /> Capote's 1967 version is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Black-and-white filmed in many real places, it is a bit of a documentary of high quality, icy and separated - the general casting is exceptional. This is a film with Robert Blake's reputation as an actor and earning it. As a killer, Perry Smith, Blake strives for a shock between deep distast and unexpected compassion; this is a masterful performance from start to finish. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less good. <br /> <br /> Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock when they travel to Kansas and bring them to Clutter's home - just to suddenly overcome the crime to detail the investigation that eventually led to their arrest And the central part of the film has always been the moment we finally saw what was in the bunch at home; actually filmed the Clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, terrible and deeply disturbing. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful way of thinking, just in the sense that it allows the film to preach a little. Given the overall power of the film, this trivial annoyance is changing. Strong stuff - and recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
