I recommend watching this movie as important as you plan a romantic evening with him. Chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan between Tarzan and Jane is so steamy that it can blur the screen. <br /> <br /> After the original movie, we begin to see Tarzan and Jane adapt to the jungle and to each other. Jane's dirty jungle wear and Tarzan protest, when Jane covers her visitors, illuminates that they are not only romantic but also sexually in love. <br /> <br /> Your imagination can be complemented by Tarzan and Jane depicts how much Jane actually teaches Tarzani emotionally, romanticly, and sexually. And Jane's student has not only embraced but also promotes her untapped sexuality. <br /> <br /> The leather competition for this movie is out of schedule. In addition to Jane's two-stroke sexy stroke, leg and hips, she also has an underwater naked swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan, but the Olympic player Josephine McKim, who is doubling for him here), Weissmuller also barely shows his body and perfect pectoral barely inside. Women rejoice when the Weissmuller comes out of the water after a long struggle with a giant crocodile and sounds like his gold - his water-soaked smell drops from his hip. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that excessive censorship, which has been highlighted by the adult character of Tarzan's films, is highlighted by this entry. Although Weissmuller Tarzan's films will be successful in the coming years, they would rarely approach the sex of this film.
