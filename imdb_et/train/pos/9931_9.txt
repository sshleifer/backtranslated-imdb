I rented dominoes capriciously, not even knowing that it was inspired by the true story, and although it is the least likely and true biopsy, you probably see. I found it pretty fantastic. <br /> <br /> With Richard Kelly, he wrote 2 hours of pure entertainment with masses and narrative masses. And if you've seen it more than once, you'll get it and appreciate it. Domino is a model that turned a wage hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life not as fine or perfect. It has a dirty acidic style offered by director Tony Scott. With fast-paced music and editing, it provides a visual burn to keep your attention, slippery performances and unexpected comedy, the film is well done and enjoyable and should reach a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I offer it to anyone who wants to think and entertain at the same time for 2 hours.
