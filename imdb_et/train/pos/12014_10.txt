This is by far the most amazing film I've ever seen. The actors gave great movie characters. The story was accurately depicted. The story begins with a young wife and father from the British Isles, who is driving a steamer to Nauvoo, Illinois. He has become a member of the LDS Church and he is not. He thinks it is ridiculous and frustrating for the trip. He encourages him to read about the Prophet Joseph Smith. Here is the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The film correctly depicts your life and part of the history of the LDS Church. It was at times graphical, but it was needed. Emotional expression was very plausible, which caused my emotional outflow. Filming was fantastic. The way to play the story was about. After the movie ended, we just sat down so we couldn't move. I was stunned. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the prophet of Mormon, I encourage you to see it. If nothing else than to understand your life. To those who are members of the Church, I encourage you to see it. This will increase your testimony of this most unbelievable person. This is a must see.
