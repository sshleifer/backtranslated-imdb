Personally, I couldn't get into 'It's not a love song', it's a brilliant movie, and it's a great story, I just found myself on the phone every two minutes to see how much I loved the relationship between Spike and Heaton, where they depend on each other to live in life. At the same time, I want a relationship more than what it is. Heaton is in love with spike, but Spike Ibsen doesn't love Heaton, or he doesn't know how to love him. Two men have a major impact on both parties' betrayal. Both have been devastated by the fact that the other ran away and gave up at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
