What a big pearl is. This is an unusual story that is fun to watch. Yes, he's singing, but it's a story very well designed and very melodic to hear. It was such a pleasant look; I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in World War II in England. It's about a trainee witch who is looking for the missing part of the spell she needs. He uses his untreated "magic" to transport him and 3 children under his care to different destinations to find him. They are united by his correspondent teacher who is surprised that the lessons from his school actually work! <br /> <br /> Although special effects may seem slightly out of date, these accustomed hobbies become part of this movie. In fact, the film won the Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> Film is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like tuned songs. The characters are of great interest. I think everyone can find something pleasant in every movie.
