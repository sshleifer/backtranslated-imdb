For the beginners, I have always been a fan of Batman's cartoons, because this topic is so universal that "everyone is an alternative ego". This also applies to Batwoman's mystery. Although the overall story is good, I am disappointed that they have not done much for the franchise. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, you are trying to find out who is Batwoman's identity. You can find out by simply looking at the credits published on this website (so if you haven't already seen it, don't go there already). I was kind of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer. 75 minutes is too short for every movie. Batwoman's secret identity comes too early in the film, in the meantime, and later becomes climatic, because you know that good guys always win and that a new character known as Batwoman disappears after the movie ends. br /> <br /> I'm not sure about the new animation style used in this movie. I love sleek new characters, but there should be more detailed details where details are needed. Some parts of the animation seem so inconvenient and rigid that they will grab your attention right away by directing your attention away. I also didn't like the bright atmosphere used in most scenes, losing my dark and gothic feeling, Batman. Similarly, we should have learned more about the personality of the batroom so that we could build the same deep compassion we do with Bruce Wayne. I also think that fighting Bane should have been better. In a typical children's fashion, a bad guy with his death will meet too lightly, either by firing, falling down, having a power outage or something foolish against them. Come to think that there wasn't even one drop of blood in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, this is a good entertaining flick and I recommend someone who is a Batman fan. It has a good story, a universal demonstration and even great action to prevent it. I just want them to make a more permanent change of story by making Batwoman stay more interesting. Don't just introduce him and then kick him out when he's done. I would also like to see someone else finally explain the concept of change. For someone other than Batman to solve the mystery and fill it with details later. <br /> <br /> I hope there will be animated movies and I look forward to the time when we actually see Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. She has been trying her forever and she doesn't like her and I can't believe she was stupid enough to fall in love with someone's 20-year-old parent. I also want to see the time Tim Drake leaves because he's getting an old man's illness. In short, I want to see all the things that referred to the characters beyond Batman. Otherwise, the same recurring formula will only end faster than if they just decided to go ahead. <br /> <br />
