Good times are working with Quiroz Brothers and choosing this whole project "Guy on the Bench". I was surprised how well they achieved all the identifiable features of a real "B" horror film. Hopefully I will be able to work with Pumpkin Patch Pictures in the future. I moved to Detroit immediately after graduation and has been publicly recognized on several occasions since its release. Once upon a time there was actually a video shop and the girl was lost near the fucking. It was pretty funny and it was my first real autograph moment when I signed his receipt. One day I asked a Blockbuster girl whether the movie was often rented and confirmed it by searching for a computer. At a time when it rented more than Ring2, which was also a new edition at the same time ... The title really immediately attracts more urban markets. He also noticed on several occasions that the client had not returned the film, which made me believe that the film was just so good that people didn't want to give it back. Look out for ZoMbIeS when they get on the hood ya! Jaysun Barr (Guy Bench-2005)
