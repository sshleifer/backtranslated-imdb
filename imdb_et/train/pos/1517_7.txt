From the fame of Robert Bloch, "Psycho", in this Amicus anthology movie, there is a narrative of the four spoken fears that are not quite as fun or frightening as I would have liked, but still offer some decent genre entertainment. <br /> <br /> This is related to the story of a very skeptical Scotland Yard detective (John Bennett) who is investigating the disappearance of an outstanding actor; he has suggested that this case is related to another house where they all happened, and our movie is off and running. <br /> <br /> The "murder method" is by Charles Hillyer (always fond of Denholm Elliott), haunted by the latest fictional creatures that are seemingly alive. There are some good surreal and rather embarrassing moments in this queue, reasonably limited by the revelation of revelation and pronunciation. <br /> <br /> "Waxworks" marks the horror icon of Peter Cushing as retired shareholder Philip Grayson, who, along with his old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland), becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman in a strange wax museum. In this episode, the most effective dream sequence is, although it's nice to always look at Cushing. The final images presented to us in this story are quite shocking. <br /> <br /> "Sweets for Sweets" is another beloved horror star, Christopher Lee, John Reid, who doesn't treat divine moppet Jane (Chloe Franks) with too much kindness, and it's up to a new companion / mentor Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to find out why. The secret of this particular episode is treated perfectly; filmmakers do not smartly wield their hands, so this is a more real shock when we get the full truth of this unhappy family. The "deadly" moments are especially terrible. <br /> <br /> "The Clone" is the four most direct comedy; Jon Pertwee, one of the many actors who have been playing dr. The role of Who is very fun as a useless, temperamental star of horror movies (in fact, he is the highlight of the story) that has been left behind by lack of quality film, extinguishes and buys his volume. This shadow has strange powers that I don't dare to publish here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as a Pertwees companion; One wonderful example of humor here is the known stabbing that has been taken by none other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The switchover story then comes to a predictable but still effective way, as Detective Inspector Holloway learns he should have taken all the warnings more seriously. <br /> <br /> Michael Dressi's unusual, striking and frightening score "House, Dripped Blood" is an entertaining combination of stories; even though I don't enjoy it as much as saying "Songs crypt", it's still good. Drivers led by Peter Duffell are moving slowly but firmly towards every cooling decision and are definitely a good type of film. <br /> <br /> 7/10
