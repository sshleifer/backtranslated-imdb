This timeless proverb speaks in this film and in my heart. For so many years I've been waiting to see this eternal story! I wasn't ready. It is possible that my feelings would not have appreciated this power. So thank you now with joy in my soul. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI has been long. He is now a legendary luminescence. But now I have finally discovered the priceless gifts of the great talents of LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many faces can I talk to like her? Some have said that it was made from his silent years and that this well could have been just his speech, beautiful enough when given the opportunity. He earned a lot of his Oscar. <br /> <br /> This movie is epic in classic proportions. All parts are equal, necessary and perfect. Naysayers can walk away if they wish, but they would have told the story of storytelling with one lifetime. A GOOD COUNTRY enriches one in a way one does not expect. But not everything comes with the joy I made. But I can only hope that this movie will be remembered for years. <br /> <br /> Don't just give me the technical details of the main players' race. These are today's expectations when we are extremely perfect. But I dare tell a million newer scores of PEARL BUCK's story of such astonishment, power, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist dares to film this masterpiece again, I warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic smell that still comes from the core of this message. Time does not reduce this effort and does not promote its size.
