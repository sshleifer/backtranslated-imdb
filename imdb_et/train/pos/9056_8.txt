So we threatened. It was a pretty charming film, I liked the direction of art (it seemed much more "real" than most kids movies) and costumes were not too cutesy. Children's artists were not bad to watch (adult performances were trendy). It was great that they showed how the bullied son tempts others and the children against bullying. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many adults would like to see it, but it's a great movie for a child. And since "Barnyard" probably participated in the 100+ children at the same time, I am really glad that we have chosen the "worms" exhibition that was sparsely involved.
