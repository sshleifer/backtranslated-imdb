Hey: <br /> <br /> I heard from a co-worker who was obviously in disagreement about entertainment, he loved it. Well I looked at the episode or 2 in the early years and was bored, so I tuned it out. In a few years I stumbled lost; current sci-fi ticket boring. Wow I was surprised. Do you say gravity well, I fucking sucked in. The pace and scripting is very good, some of the flashes on / off are both cameraman, but all good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are definitely immature assats, very spoiled and immature. Kate one step above them, Juliet was as classic as Kate. Mr. Eco didn't appreciate enough and at Charlie's level, if not more, they too died. A man dressed in blueberry, who talks to Jacob (back), is a real curiosity. Whole big, very layered series: looking more. <br /> <br />
