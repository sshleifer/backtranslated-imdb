I had grown up with Doc Savage and was angry with the green death as a child, but even now, I found it to be a lot of fun. I have made countless friends and colleagues who watch this film and who have been most interested in the variety of reactions when they mostly think I'm strange but you are. "I don't know what this is about Doc, but he always gets girls" must be the ultimate line when you look at his sadness. This film is a classic assault on the genre of the super hero and was not to be taken seriously before it was time to move Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a god.It is unfortunate that this movie is not published on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be rebuilt and bastardized, as I said it is classic, it can't be done without Ron (like Italian work without Mini and Michael Caine). I will give it a 10/10.
