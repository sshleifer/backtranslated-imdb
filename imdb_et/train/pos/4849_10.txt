Ghost Train is a treatment for those who value typical 1940 humor. It includes a plot of the Second World War, but not as much as I originally believed, and characters are a unique blend that plays its role quite well. Askey, who plays the role of Tommy Gander, is the one that shines a story about parts that could be depicted as boring or "dragging". <br /> <br /> The story of the station to be haunted is really terrible even today standards. It's unique and the way the characters interact with everyone is fantastic to boost the concept of Ghost Train. Gander is basically uncomfortable with all other members, the rest are pretty good. He is always the focus of attention and can be dubbed as "annoying", but it is done by those who do not know the humor of the 1940s. His humor is innocent and childish, which makes it sweet. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for Askey / Gander, this movie would be shorter in action, fun, and the result would not be as effective in my opinion.
