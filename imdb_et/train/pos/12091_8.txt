"Blood Castle" (aka "Terror Castle") is a well-designed, surprisingly spooky entrance from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black-and-white cinematography, flawless copying, excellent casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pace and surprise (albeit perfectly suited) to end this one. Only movies are sometimes annoying and quite suddenly "love at first glance" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi√®re) is otherwise a surprisingly fun movie. <br /> <br /> While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe is sitting in a pub, talking to one of his ghostly stories at Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, asks for an interview with Son. During the conversation Poe shows that all his stories are real. Alan, Alan expresses his life of skepticism after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet on Alan's 100 pounds so that he can't stay at Blackwood Castle that night for Halloween as a dead walk. Alan can't afford this bet, so he puts his life for 10 pounds. <br /> <br /> Unlike Mario Bava's "Black Sunday" (called "Satan's Mask"), "Blood Castle" is quite restrained, making some moments of violence even more frightening, especially surprising for the director, usually associated with 60's -You're in terrible Italian space films. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the only version of this movie has been found in a badly degraded (and recorded) pan and scan version. However, it is worth mentioning and calling the modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt as Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that is very comparable to Robert Wise 'The Haunting.
