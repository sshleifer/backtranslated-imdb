"House of Games" is a flawlessly designed movie and one of the few films I've seen that I had an impressive screen surprise as it cleverly and unexpectedly ends. For the first time I saw it a couple of years ago after reading Roger Ebert's review, which declared it the best film of 1987. I had doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films of this year. Boy, I was a surprise. It was one of the smartest, most well-written films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The scenario is quite a lot of work, not just in terms of the plot (which spins and pulls the rug) if you think it is all developed, but also in terms of character development. In my second review, I began to realize that the Mameti scenario is successful not only as a wise midway, but that each plot's development contributes to understanding our characters and their motivation. The climax of the film is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable. This is, of course, what we know about the traits, and so it is much more than just an arbitrary twist. The film is also enriched by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna's performances. I can't take photos of Mantegna's other actors who play the role of Mike, and Crouse plays his role with just the right amount of restrictions that point to repression. Their work, plus Mamet's extraordinary scenario, combines the creation of one of the greatest films of the 1980s. It's really black.
