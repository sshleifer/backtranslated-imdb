"Good Earth" is a great movie that you no longer hear. There are many great disasters and events, but it is also a passionate love story. All this happens in just over two hours, which is short for today's standards. Special effects and costumes are very good over time. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a restrictive role. In principle, she has only three emotions: ally, hungry and damaged by heart. <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors are terrible. <br /> <br />
