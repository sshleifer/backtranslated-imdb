*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie always looks very exaggerated until I remember that my college campus was a former student-Nazi-racist-killer-who-then-committed-suicide too: her the name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> Look at her in wikipedia - I added some photos of her to her article. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but this stuff really happens. <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
