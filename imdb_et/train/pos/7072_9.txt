Twelve Monkeys is a crazy time traveling, an exciting movie that marks Bruce Will, who plays James Cole, a man who is sent back to gather information about the devastating plague that occurred in November 1996. Unfortunately, he is sent back to the 1990s, where everyone believes he is crazy. <br /> <br /> This movie is exciting and has excellent exhibitions by Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twenty monkeys are one of the greatest time-traveling movies that I believe anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
