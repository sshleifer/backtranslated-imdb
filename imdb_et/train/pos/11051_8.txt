"Maléfique" is an example of how a horror film can be effective as more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart. It has no recognized names, has no big budget and is definitely not a visual effect; but it compensates for everything that is intelligent and well-written with a manuscript, an effective director and a director's vision focused more on story-telling than on cheap excitement. Eric Valette may not be a well-known name, but "Maléfique", the debut of his feature film, proves that he has a modern level like Jeunet, Gans or Aja. <br /> <br /> Film is a story of four prisoners in a cell, four different men, with very different backgrounds, but with one purpose: to get out. Carrère (Gérald Laroche) is imprisoned after being found guilty of fraud by several millionaires; his cellists, the violent Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), the intellectual Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and the spiritual challenge Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud) have been convicted of murder and have given Carrère a cold welcome. Their personalities come across when Carrère discovers an old book describing how the former prisoner escaped using black magic. <br /> <br /> Alexandre Charlo and Franck Magnier wrote, "Maléfique" is a fantastic combination of dark fantasy and horror reminiscent of Clive Barker's stories. The strongest point of the film is how he builds the characters, they all have very complex and different personalities, and many tensions and tensions come from their constant personal clash. The supernatural element of the story is very handy and gives the film a feeling of reading the Gothic novel. Despite the fact that there are about four men locked in the movie, the film never gets boring or tiring and actually isolates the group to increase mistrust, claustrophobia and paranoia in particular. <br /> <br /> Director Eric Valette uses the atmosphere, mood and his lie to give life to the plot. Despite her obvious budget deficit, she has created a brilliant film that looks original, fresh and very attractive. His sophisticated and effective camera work helps the film's dynamism, despite its one location, and the slow pace of the movie is great to create a climate of isolation and mistrust on film. Very few special effects impressions are very well done and Valette trades in quality in a few but terrible gore scenes. <br /> <br /> Characters are what makes this movie work, and it certainly deserves to be cast. credit. Gérald Laroche is an excellent Carrère, who is at first sight an innocent man, but who conceals a dark past. Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud are also very effective, especially in their very demanding role. But does Clovis Cornillac steal the show with his performance like Marcus, a violent and disturbed person who wants to be deep inside. The characters are perfectly developed and most are cast. <br /> <br /> The film is terrible, but it's not without their weight. Of course, the most notorious of them is a low budget. Some CGI effects are somewhat bad compared to the effective make-up and prosthesis of other scenes, but it is never too bad for it. Probably the bad thing about Maléfique is that it seems to lose the final smell when it focuses on supernatural black magic rather than characters, not too bad things, but the end may seem weak. view. <br /> <br /> In any case, "Maléfique" is one of those great horror movies that have come out of France lately and deserve more recognition. The lie is definitely a talent to follow, because this modest (though complicated) story of supernatural is enough of its abilities. Personally, this movie is a new favorite. 8/10
