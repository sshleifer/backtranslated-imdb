I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised to see people refer to it as a comedy. It was at times fun, but it wasn't funny at all. If I had expected it to be a comedy, it might have been a disappointment for the film, but without expectations I found it to be enjoyable and interesting. Perhaps this was because as an engineer I identified the main character. I was less concerned about the satire of capital or work, and rather the main story of a person fighting for this invention. A man who is less interested in the financial benefits of his invention when he sees its achievement and production. He is absolutely heroic when he refuses to squeeze his invention for a big money and a hot woman. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; I compare it to Fountainhead.
