Seeing that Keifer Sutherland was playing his favorite sign in TV history, it was a conclusion that I went to the movies and spent $ 15 on it. I think this also applies to fans of Eva Longoria. <br /> <br /> The film moves around the leak that a secret service agent intends to kill the president. The investigation shows that the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). The pursuit of innocence, Pete goes into a fun, escaped style to look for the truth. <br /> <br /> It is certain, but certainly not remarkable. Decent, decent story, but it left me a little bit empty, but you could definitely make it a lot worse.
