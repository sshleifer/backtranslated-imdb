And this is a great rock'n'roll film for yourself. No matter how it changed (about the disco in the film), it ended up as one of the top films where kids want to rock, but the main thing is on their way. Think back to the 50's rock'n'roll movies where the day is recorded when Alan Freed arrives at Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is really cool and safe for kids, and on Tuesday, Weld will get a new dance sweater. Next to 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw DA RAMONES, whom no one understands then, would be one of the most influential ensembles of the next quarter (and then the obligatory DJ guest photo "The Real" for Don Steele)). Also, throw away all the elements of the comedy film produced by Roger Corman, with the exception of the two-day shooting plan, some familiar Corman repertoire players such as Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (from "Bucket of Blood"), and one day's big stops. One of the few movies that uses deliberate joy and gives up. I showed a new DVD to a friend who could only remember seeing its parts with stoner-induced blurry, and he agreed that it was one of the great movies to watch drunk, not least the cute ladies and the great Ramones movie material.
