One of the greatest scientific literature of all time, such as vision and thought-provoking, such as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's Brazilian. Willis gives you the best result here, but Pitt is incredibly potty, unlike what he did before or after. Even Stowe isn't here in his league. The story is very layered and offers a lot of thought. The climatic scene is beautifully beautiful and the last lines fit perfectly. The mental hospital scenes are horrible and in their own way so funny. Here's a lot of dark humor. A fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography. My tenth.
