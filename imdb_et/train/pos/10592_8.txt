A pleasant story of the London-based Pimlico community who, after exploding an unexploded WW2 bomb, finds a royal charter that states that the area they live in is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This movie works because of the fantasy that we have a lot of to create our rules and not listen to them. The solidity of British stalwarts, especially Stanley Holloway, makes it credible. <br /> <br /> There are some very good moments in the movie, for example, when people are on stock and on the other side of the barricade running out of London, they are eating and throwing other things. <br /> <br /> Even if you knew Pimlico was going to be part of Britain again, the people of PImlico and the viewer wouldn't mind it happening, leaving good luck. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to think that these low budget movies from London's small studios are still so popular fifty years later. The manufacturer must have something right.
