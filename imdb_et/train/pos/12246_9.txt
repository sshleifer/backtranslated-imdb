The moment I started looking at it, I realized I was looking at quality production, so I wasn't surprised that the scenario was written by Andrew Davis and that it was produced by Sue Birtwhistle. So my only handle is that Emma did not run with 3 or 4 or even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. It was great because I think Prunella is great as Miss Bates, but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong as much. Is the language a pleasure to listen to, you can imagine that day, and the age to go to someone without really swearing a word? Samantha Morton was great because Miss Smith was actually casting on the ground as it was with Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I looked at it twice in two days !! So thank you again for the BBC for another high-quality television. I've seen the Paltrow version and it's okay, but I think the BBC version is much better. Great production that I am very happy to have on DVD !!!
