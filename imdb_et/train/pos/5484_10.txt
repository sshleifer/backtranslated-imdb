This film is mainly a documentary about a series of chronologically organized events that took place from 10 April 2002 to 14 April 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace in Caracas, Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The film's sin is real and one feels the pain, sadness and joy of the people who lived through this failed head of state with Head of State Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> One of the movies does not show that Hugo Chavez is a really big historical figure. The personality of Hugo Chavez unilaterally brought the Venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day-old junta installed by the army and re-launches the democratically installed government of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that George W Bush helped and supported the coup d'Ã©tat in Venezuela. That the mainstream media George W Bush supported and abetted is not surprising. <br /> <br /> It is surprising how few people have seen this movie and how few people understand the complete corruption of American mass media. <br /> The abolition of Ronald Reagan's doctrine of justice in 1986 has only taken 20 years to make America a blind and rutderless state. <br /> <br /> Hugo Chavez can open the eyes of patriotic Americans to the truth and beauty of a true American vision.
