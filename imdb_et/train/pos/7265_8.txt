Good story. Good script. Good pouring. Good action. Good governance. The direction of good art. Good photography. Good sound. Good editing. All right. Put it all together and you will be entertained with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that these days there are not enough films in this caliber. We may find ourselves happy that writers / leaders like John Hughes are able to hear their creative voices from time to time. <br /> <br /> If I notice that I watch the movie for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfied, I have to conclude that something about this movie is right.
