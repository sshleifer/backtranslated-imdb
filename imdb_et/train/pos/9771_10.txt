Exciting and innovative! In the beginning of this undervalued Whoopi Goldberg flick, writers Theodore Rex and the 1941 Orson Welles classic "Citizen Kane" draw a parallel. Writers are justified by such seemingly different parallel drawings, but the audience is considered too often to see that Hollywood chocolate is surprising to gauge the fine similarities of these two films. "Citizen Kane" Charles Foster Kane is afraid and admired by his colleagues and his motherboards, similar to this film by Whoop Goldberg. This film talks about finding love for everyone's differences. It is an epic study of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-immolation. Who combined Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated a dynasty for age, the only legitimate comparisons were Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you would like to look at raising the deepest ways of mankind, the philosophical study of cellulose; Bergman-esqe, but not depressing, must look at Theodore Rex immediately!
