"Nothing. There is nothing in space 237". But you don't have any company anyway to go there. <br /> <br /> There has never been such a psychological horror as this movie is getting. It is a horror film of all, and most rightly, with the highest rating. Jack Nicholson is a great actor and is one of the biggest performances in the cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a family moving in an isolated and abandoned hotel for one month in winter. Then the dad (Jack) gets into the hotel for horror. <br /> <br /> The direction of the kicks is not short, then perfect. Tense tracking shots, tempting music, mystical messages, and the amazing plot make it ever the best horror movie ever. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, there is a constant reference to danger, death and horror. Red is used in EVERY scene. Is it purposely imposed by Kubrick? Of course! <br /> <br /> This is the ultimate Kubrick classic and it is the third of his films I've given to 10/10. She is a perfectionist in her direction and can be seen in all her films. He loves to cherish his observers in all his films. <br /> <br /> I'll talk about this movie in the coming months. It's an infinite depth. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is the cornerstone of horror and tension. The Terrorist Masterpiece is 10/10
