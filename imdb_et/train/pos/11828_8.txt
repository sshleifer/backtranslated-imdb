"Dick Tracy" is one of our family's favorites - the actors are great - the artistic direction is exceptional - music is magical. It shouldn't be "Mockingbird killing" - it's a fun experience. <br /> <br /> Songs by Stephen Sondhemim are Stars: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Earlier or later" is just right, "What can you lose" is haunting - even stories like "Live Alone and Like It ", add a story <br /> <br /> I love Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Head, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, support villains ... The list is too long. And yes - even Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome. Written in a minute with a smile (how many times have we looked at each other and said, "Wait a moment - I have the idea - it's gone!"?). <br /> <br /> One of the most important things about this movie is that everyone involved seems to have a good time - and above all, the viewer's enjoyment. So, if you haven't already, why not give Dick Tracy a chance - accept it for what it is - a Sunday comic that is alive - and a great opportunity!
