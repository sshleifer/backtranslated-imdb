Farrah Fawcett is a great powerful drama of 1986, where he plays Marjorie, a woman who can escape the bondage of a potential rapist. Well done to Farrah, the best actor in Golden Globe. <br /> <br /> When his rapist Joe (terribly James Russo) arrives home, he shares his two roommates (who is comfortable with Marjorie playing with Joe's terrible demands. It makes some disturbing and shocking images! <br /> <br /> When his roommates come home, they are surprised (at least) by Marjon's action and Alfre Woodard's excellent performance, who is desperately trying to persuade Marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police, making the film even more nasty. it is quite irritating, but when Joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all That makes the movie really a very emotional drama device. <br /> <br /> All in all, extreme movies have been well thought out and worked well and I had to do it hundreds of times Well done to all participants.
