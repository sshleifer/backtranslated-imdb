This is a very dramatic and halting movie. There are lots of plots and turns. The story or director opens question marks on the death penalty or the alleged crimes by black people. This movie is very well staged by Arne Glimcher and the sound of James Newton Howard is great. Sean Connery and the strength of Ed Harris. If you liked it, don't miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
