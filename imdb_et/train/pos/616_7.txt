If any movie style could be called "innocent joy", it would be a general type of fantasy. The wrong word for this is because I am very happy from time to time to be a digger. "Stardust" is a good stock fantasy, which should look like Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman's adaptation as it was). This is not a Mirrormask visual dream, it is not an adult claim in Pan's maze, and it is not a fun loving classic princess bride, but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is introducing enough to be completely comfortable throughout the viewing. Fantasy lovers should rejoice - special effects have finally become good enough and cheap, these things are now regularly produced. <br /> <br /> Stardust's story relates to a young man named Tristan who, in order to get the love of his most beautiful girl in the small town of Wall, and the approval goes on to find the adventurous star. But to complicate it, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and she is not the only one who is looking for her ... some sorcerers have their greedy eyes on the immortality that the heart of the star can give, and the brother's way of thinking in the magical kingdom leads her the murderous prince. <br /> <br /> It is all quite predictable, but it includes some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted comments about the nature of love, and the best part, Robert DeNiro, like a gay pirate. This remark has DeNiro's performance on the ground ... it is not an excessive extra image that most participants use to portray homosexual people, but surprisingly effective for someone who is used to seeing harsh and inaccurate. a constant joke that surrounds his character and fits into DeNiro's own opening to alternative forms of action). Since Brazil, DeNiro has not been so unique that it is something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is probably a film that lasts a long time on the shelves of children and fantasy lovers. I can't say it offers something new, but it doesn't really exist. In fact, they are the most sensitive slings that most enjoy it. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
