The actual second installment that can be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Again, casting is just wonderful. I like how the first and second episodes have nothing in common, except wit and wisdom. The second episode is just very funny, very silly and very enjoyable. This is the first Christmas episode about a woman tortured by a descendant dressed in Santa after killing her husband. Just like the first episode; tough. <br /> <br /> The most humorous scene is linking her husband and her phone murder, first of all, trying her fear until it becomes real.
