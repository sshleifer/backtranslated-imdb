This is undoubtedly one of the best films I've ever seen. For the first time I saw it about 9 or 10 years old. I started watching the rape scene before. And when I saw it, I was very shocked to think, "What is this sick movie?". Today I have seen it from the very beginning and really realized how big this movie really is. It is exciting, frightening, shocking and disturbing in a unique way. The best thing, however, is the end where the audience is shown that this experience refutes the characters of the rest of their lives. It tortures their conscience and they worry for the rest of their lives because of the bodies of this river. And something they can't do is something they have to live with. This end is one of the most unfortunate end of film history and very smart, brilliant and terrible <br /> <br /> The actor is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Great for this movie. All in all, John Boorman has created one of the best films based on Dick Chaney's novel in the history of the film. Must see all the film students
