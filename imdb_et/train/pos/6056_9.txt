Super Speedway provides an excellent demo of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel audio system. The IMAX camera puts you right in the racing car, where you drive at high speeds with different tracks, recalling the Grand Prix driving cycles (if only on a DVD!). I enjoy it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The only minus and why I didn't give it to 10, some driving cycles are suspicious, as the movie was accelerated. Music also requires little to believe - everything you hear on a real car is a motor. You're not listening to swoosh when you go under the bridges.
