A couple of years ago I bought several $ 1 DVDs that contained both movies. One of them was three Broadway girls (an alternative title for the Greeks who had the word for them) and this, Happy Go Lovely. In principle, it is a musical comedy in Scotland that concerns an erroneous identity that involves one of the millionaire's limousine dancers. Vera-Ellen is this dancer and wow what legs! Ceasar Romero is his producer who takes the chance of leaving his original leading woman because he thinks he's been familiar with the millionaire I just mentioned. And David Niven is the abundant man who has been mistaken for a reporter looking for Vera-Ellen, who should interview him, but Romero stops. What I have just mentioned may be confusing, but it is (usually) helpful if you are ready to control your brain by looking at it with the charming musical numbers performed by the superb Vera-Ellen. Romero can be a little bit frustrating here, but Niven is getting confused all the time. The print I saw was really very good, given its age and the fact that it is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen makes her lines pretty well because she's not really an actor. So I recommend to Go Go Lovely who love old fashioned comedies.
