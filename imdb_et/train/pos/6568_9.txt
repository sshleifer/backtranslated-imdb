I enjoyed this movie as a child when it came out, and still still. A simple story in search of a robbed girl and an adventurer who is literally in direct writing. It has participants who were more recognizable during the day. It should not keep the viewer from spinning. Wayne Crawford stars are the main character of Jake Speed. Of course, it can bite certain Romancing the Stone elements and Indiana Jones. But this movie is well done to keep it out of the basement. I'm surprised that too many people don't know about it. It must be hidden in other theaters in films '86. I watched it on cable TV. It can be difficult to find because it is unpublished on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get less than 8 dollars from eBay! Cool flick.
