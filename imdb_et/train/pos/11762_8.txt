Have you ever come out of your life, sporting activities, tried your best and found yourself in an important segment where for a short time you were given the opportunity to be a hero and master and. . . failed? I believe many of us have been alive at this moment. This is a prerequisite for "The Times of Times". This story is borne by a middle-aged banker named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), who has been a deep-seated melancholy of football error years ago, inspired to play the game again. . again. To achieve this, he must once convince the excellent football exponent, Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell), to restore his return. For Reno, who is happy with his current life, see that there is no need to change the past, because it is better than age. Both of these problems are accompanied by factual years and, in addition, both marriages are slipping and needing a vampire again. It's not easy if his father (Donald Moffat) usually reminds him of the biggest drop. However, Dundee is persistent and does something to try and correct the biggest sudden in his life. Great fun for everyone who wants to re-enjoy their youngsters. ***
