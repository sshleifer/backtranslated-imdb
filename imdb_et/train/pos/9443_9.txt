It is a shame that Deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rapeseed film and Dueling Banjos. Even the people who have seen the movie cannot understand the rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It is certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in almost every movie. People tend to lose the power of a movie that includes a notorious buggery scene. <br /> <br /> Functional, plot, cinematic, and Deliverance soundtrack give hands to this scary charisma. The return area he shot is beautiful and is quite the opposite of the dark topic. Both large and minor actors feel like rafting along the river. <br /> <br /> This thing that separates this movie from others is a tangible feeling that it inspires. Not many films can make you feel like it is getting out. Bottom line: this movie is classic. I can't really say much more.
