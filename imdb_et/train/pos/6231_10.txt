It's just a great, fun and cute movie. It includes the true nature of the decade and of the people, and speaks of a two-sailor with two sailors a beautiful love story. Although this film can only be black and white, it is certainly not against today's. The main goal of the film is timeless. This movie features great actors, beautiful song and dance numbers, and great design and film photography. Follow the fleet is also comical, there are funny moments, moments that make you laugh, but also other moments where the actor just gets you involved. Its amazing how this movie can be set for a decade, how it affects them today. If you want to see something big, look at it.
