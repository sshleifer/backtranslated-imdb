I love this example, it's definitely a winner. Jessica Alba is doing a great job, it's time we got a kick-ass girl who isn't a cutesy. The whole cast is great and all the episodes have good plots. Everything is well positioned and thought out. Together, it will be put together for a while because it was not someone who hurried anything together. This is NOTICE!
