The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: it is funny, witty and offers great voices. The exhibition is dedicated to the Lion family, who acts as a entertainment show for Siegfried & Roy. Indeed, all these are stereotypes, but it makes them so funny. FOTP is not a child comic that contains some adult humor, but very lightly. It's full of pop culture references and celebrities, and most of them are very well done. I'd say I give the exhibition to 7 out of ten because it's pretty pretty well done, but not very original, I've seen most of these stereotypes many times before, even in that particular order!
