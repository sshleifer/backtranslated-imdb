It has been a long time for God when I saw it. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> Film tells us (children) about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally assembled - Disney-style animation, plus actresses - starred by Frank Capra! <br /> <br /> Overweight. I don't know if a very high production value is worth, equivalent to the value of a film strip for the human body? But the boy gets the children who learn it: even now I can clearly recall that Hemo himself challenges Dr Baxter, which general material most closely resembles human blood, which the doctor immediately answers in "seawater".
