The quote I used to make my summary is about halfway through good ground, because the captain of the Chinese Revolutionary Army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes on the mobile that he doesn't have time to shoot more of them because his unit is just called back to the front lines. Of course, the next pilot who needs to know and hit, the main character of the movie, the former kitchen slave girl O-Lan (whose depiction Luise Rainer, who is now 99 years old, won her second best actress Oscar) <br /> <br /> The next scene finds that O-Lan is obliged to give his bag to the robbed jewels of his undervalued wife, farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni). mobility is the direct inverse of his moral decline. <br /> <br /> A movie about topics including slavery, false accusations, misogyny, hunger, home invasion, family pet eating, mental retardation, grandchildren, exploited refugees, riots, civil war, summary mass executions, bigamy , beating children, adultery, incest and biblical proportions of insect scourge, a good country is a surprisingly warming film. <br /> <br /> In the form of another classic quote, O-Lan's self-worthy soup, his son has just admitted that the old woman is stolen from stealing the cooking pan after her husband, Wang Lung, was angry with the dirt on the other side of the forest. Meat is meat. "
