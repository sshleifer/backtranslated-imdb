We have great expectations for this. . . because of his Zombie 3 official sequel to Zombie 2 and director Lucio Fulci. . . But. . . his director is Bruno Mattei (zombies from the night) and was not written by Dardino Sachetti, but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of Zombies) and firing in phillimines like a zombie night and resembling a zombie night (Hell Living Dead). as a result, it is rather a companion to living dead hell than Zombie 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis, who produced Zombie 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi, gave Zomb 2 his own magic. . . Zombie 3 is not magical. . . it is like peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But over the years I have received Zombie 3. I can swear I saw a version where a soldier bitten in his hand and went to the hotel room. . . there was a pointless Fulci-cut and Mattei / Fulci-cut on the DVD.
