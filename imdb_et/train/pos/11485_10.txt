Zero-day leads you to think, even to think why two boys / young men do what they did - commit suicide by killing their classmates. This includes what has to be for two people who have decided to abandon their normal viability to define their own / mutual world through binding destruction. considering the money / time the filmmaker and the participants were - this is a remarkable product. When explaining two young people's suicide / murderer motives and actions, it is better than "Elephant" - when a movie that is under our "rational" skin, is a much better film than almost everything you are likely to see. <br /> <br /> An error, but honest is terrible honesty.
