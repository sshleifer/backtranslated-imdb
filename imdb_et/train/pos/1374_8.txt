French film Ester Williams would love it. But synchronized swimming was just a hook that gave hope to three girls in the Paris challenge. There is no question where the Sciamma sympathies lie, because all the boys are depicted as "animaux", but in fact only three girls are focused and all the time, when few adults and other adolescents are mostly in the background. Marie is a girl who is not attractive but sure. She wants to be a swimmer and forces herself to Floriane (Renascence's high-quality beauty for one reviewer) and she is also friendly to Anna: not unpleasant, but for her the perfection of her body was short, and now she is a young woman's body. What happens is the path to self-realization without a road map, but for the three that are unhealthy, there is a bow: where is the entertainment of young people and meaningless flattery? While DÃ©nouement was breathless, Floriane's own absorption beautifully, as well as the beautiful Marie and Anne alliance, all seemed abstract, the Sciamma dolls.
