I think the film is educational. But this does not address the issue that caused so many contradictions: plural marriage. The film does not reflect what the LDS Church offers. There was a great opportunity to say to the world what they really believe. I did not get a clear idea of ​​what LDS views are the central theme of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends and they are nice people. It would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they see their prophet's most contradictory statements. Perhaps these statements are simply too controversial to be considered in film format, but it would have been good to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's truly interesting life. After all, it gives an overview of American thinking about religion in the 18th century. I hope they will make documentaries on this exciting topic, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. We may have a day for President Mormon. After all, Smith ran for the president.
