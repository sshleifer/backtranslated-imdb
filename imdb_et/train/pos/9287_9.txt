When they are caught, they are placed in the area where the game remains in sight but not in sight. Prisoners say they have to be released, but the rules are rules. <br /> <br /> Given the descent of his director Jafar Panah, it was disabling to discover that Offside is comedy and often fun.

They are just football fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are being treated fairly unfairly, they never lose their game and historical victory over their people.
