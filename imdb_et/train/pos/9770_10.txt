This movie is great and I would recommend renting it to anyone whose local video store has it. Or even better, you could buy it because you probably look at it over and over again. I remember watching the movie as a child and it was great. But after I looked at it again yesterday, I found it amazing. <br /> <br /> A good comedy mix (though not as big as "Mr Magoo" - one of my favorites) and action. It deserves the 10/10 and I hope they will soon (the fingers intersect). If you need to have a baby or take care of babies, I recommend renting this movie because it keeps them feeling entertained :).
