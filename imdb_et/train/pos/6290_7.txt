The use of Buster Keaton in the darkness of his career was an interesting choice. He may be the most talented comedian of the quieter age. It gives him the opportunity to show these talents in a little time. He grabs a man in modern life and it becomes clear that we are the best ones left in our times. Keaton can do very well with his vision problems. I've heard her voice before. I believe he made some of these Beach Party movies by playing some free signs to earn a few bucks. Serling seemed to pay tribute to her and imagined her so. It's not a bad story. This shows how one reacts when we want something we don't have and get that desire.
