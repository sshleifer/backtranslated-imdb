I understand why some people like this movie and why some people don't. But I really like it, even if I noticed some good bits and not so impressive bits. Animation was really great, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best was Anne-Marie, which was expressed by late Judith Barsi (I was physically ill when I read what happened to her). Carface is also a very convincing villain, especially by the wonderful Vic Tayback. (I especially liked "Morons I Surrounded by Moroni") and with Rasputin and Warren, T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all Don Bluth villains. Charlie and Itchy were not the same shine, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some movies are very haunting, as Annabelle "You can never come back", which scares me still. Unfortunately, there were some bits that I didn't like so much. The story was a tendency to become clumsy and unsuitable, but Disney's Black Cauldron had the same problem. There were also some dark scenes to make young children anxious, but the end is very terrible. The biggest mistake, however, was fairly blissful songs and their way of singing. Except for "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives", none of them will leave out and Burt Reynolds will not sing and Dom DeLuise will have a much better song. All in all, there is a traceable film that could have been more, but definitely memorable, and I would definitely look at it again. 7/10 Bethany Cox
