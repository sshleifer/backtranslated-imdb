One of the best Tarzan movies is also one of the most pressing (and graphical) activities. <br /> <br /> A year or so after Tarzan Ape Man was picked up, Niel Hamilton Holt asked a wealthy friend to finance a safari back to the elephant graveyard to collect ivory. His friend also comes with wearing costumes and perfumes that Holt hopes Jane will win back from Tarzan. Before they leave, Holt finds his card stolen and becomes a crazy dash to try out a competing expedition. When they finally take the thieves, they find the whole party dead and surrounded by themselves. They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find that they are out of the pan and fire. Finally, Tarzan and Jane will appear and everyone will be turned off for even more adventures. <br /> <br /> The infamous film has been censored heavily to reduce graphical violence (its graphics even according to today's standards. all nudity tips removed (there are several minutes of nude floating scene where Jane is full of nudity, only recently This is a clear look at the restored version of why this movie was reduced to 20 minutes during the television's working hours. Since it is in a restored version, it is a very adult movie that is romantic, touching, executable, and everything else the movie should be. The film is almost every standard, the best thing is a movie that plays well as an independent adventure if you don't have to see the first movie to enjoy it, but also a movie that deepens the characters and themes created in this original film. It's an amazing thing. <br /> <br /> I like this movie very much, the back screen is often very obvious, for many monkeys gorilla suits and some other effects are more v. eider, not convincing, but at almost every other level, this film is the upper limit. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and spit on the couch and let yourself go back for a simple time. This is one of the biggest adventures.
