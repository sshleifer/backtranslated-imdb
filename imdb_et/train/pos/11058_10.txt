I have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I've ever seen. it was deep and even though you knew from the beginning who was going to come together, there was still longing and expectation. the idea that maybe they won't come together ... it's all the movie. this film was well written, directed and acted. Dancing on the side of the street was great.
