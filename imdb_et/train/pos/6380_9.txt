Atlantis: The lost empire is a better movie than I thought. I've never thought this film would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slowly, but when the movie was worn, it changed my mind. The story takes place in 1914 and it's about a boy named Milo. Milo believes in wise Atlantis. Together with her grandfather's friends, she starts her own amazing adventure. Along the way, he must wear friendship, betrayal, trust and much more. The voice is great. They will certainly know how to transfer movies only with their own voice. Music is nothing special, but pleasant anyway. Animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. In general, it is a good family film for all ages. I appreciate this movie 9/10.
