Excellent and accurate film ... McGovern makes its written investigation and documentation very painful and pays off. She is not afraid to tell the truth, although it may draw in adverse comments and comments from some who love the stories clean and sweet and shiny. <br /> <br /> McGovern brings Christopher Eccleston again, though not as high-profile as he played at Hillsborough. I found this film to be accurate, well-functioning, and well-presented as Hillsborough and I congratulate McGovern on his terrifying writing. Well done and my hat is for the writer, actors, production team. Great movie!
