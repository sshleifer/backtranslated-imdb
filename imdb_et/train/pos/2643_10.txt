I can't really say much more about a movie that hasn't been said yet. I haven't seen the movie for about 25 years and my memory has never left me. I was looking for it everywhere. I've been looking for it in the past, but I was empty. Last night I thought about the movie again and tried to remember who it was, but I was only about 10 or 12 when I last saw it, and I wasn't even sure if I had the right movie name so I decided to do another Search and i finally found that vision. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, please give me now tawnyteel@yahoo.com. And anyone who hasn't seen this movie and who has the opportunity to do it is worth it.
