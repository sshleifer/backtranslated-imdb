I'm not sure how I left it for the first time, but I'm glad I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in and around the 19th century Okabasho Red Light. Japan. This is about prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of the Japanese samurai code. <br /> <br /> This is the unique Akira Kurosawa! Even if he died before he directed this film, his scenario adjustments showed. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is known and illuminates how these systems interact with one another. The characters can turn around each other, but the caste system remains intact when every character returns to the world they belong to. The Samurai warrior, who penetrates into a good heart and a loving prostitute world, goes back to his life when he begins his life. another way with a man who is part of his box system. Many will reward the samurai for the rest of the world, but there are still lower box residents who can support one another and who can love without limitations. The samurai of this film turns out to be weak, while the lovers of the classless are venerable. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher rating. This is the story of women's viability in feudal Japan. During this time, men were thought to have survived. Strong, while women were thought to be just pointless and weak. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they survived, and how their strength enabled Japanese culture to continue as it is. <br /> <br /> I recommend "The sea looks" to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they are not fans. It's a cute, quiet and soul-resistant film that is valuable for every film collection.
