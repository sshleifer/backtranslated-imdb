We loved the movie. I'm the mother of two little men. I love the movie that I can see with them where men have integrity and character. Move where money is not the most important thing. And the family is forever, and love means more than words. I wish we saw more of the Davis family. But all I loved was the same feeling that others did "please no longer". We both want the actors not to change. The new actors were good substitutes. My 9-year-old son also loved this movie. asked me to buy them all. He is a film critic that he says it tells me something. The family should see this move buy for friends. Help bring the values ​​back. We're reading books now when we're hooked. I really hope to see more. Be blessed with happy moves
