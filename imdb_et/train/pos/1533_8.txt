What was the network? I thought it was CBS. Am I entitled or ??? Also at this time, the actual production of H.Q. was near Van Nuys Airport. I remember for sure, because I did almost two episodes. More. I remember the first days. I found an article from Reader digest that gave this actor / writer a hint of a terrible episode. So it was this honor that gave me the honor. Awarded or not, I unfortunately did not develop it and it was cut out of it because my ad was bad. So, if I have learned to justify it, if I always have it, it's a difficult road. Just sidebar Mr. Van Dykel. He had a house on Chalon Road in the Brentwood area and it was an incredible festive house. Dick had a fantastic sense of modernism in building this house.
