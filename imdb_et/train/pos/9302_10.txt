Most of the comments have been positive, but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on collections. The set designer used many beautiful art deco treatments with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It is worth paying attention. The film is driven by character and symbolism, which is very rich. All the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was petting. The dialogue was sometimes amusing, but at times nice and I think it should have been so. This is a movie buffer movie. This was done by people who love the media. Don't miss it.
