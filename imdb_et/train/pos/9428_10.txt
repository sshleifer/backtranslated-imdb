One of my favorite films begins as an adventure through the natural side of the four men in Atlanta. The idea of ​​living in the Chulawa River before it has turned into a lake originates from Burt Reynold's Lewis, who involuntarily drowns his companions into his worst nightmare. But when the first part of the film appears as a feature film, the other half carries the viewer in a completely different story, where our men are forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the film, every human being is forced to deal with scars that were supposed to be quite river for the weekend, but silenced against survival. The movie (except for some pretty obvious horses) is a very well targeted and beautifully fascinated paradise of nature that steals your soul. Photography is also great. Voight, Reynolds, Cox, and Beatty show you how one event can, in different ways, destroy four different lives with just the same mistake.
