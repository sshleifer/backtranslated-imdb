Daniell Steel Daddy, a refreshing story. This film respected the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is this? At these times, "Heather has two moms" (or whatever, fill the spaces) it's easy to see why this topic isn't for everyone. When the father's roles were prominent, I was hoping it was the second Daniell Steel Saga. When disappointing it to the end. Every character was important and did a fabulous job that had a role to play. I would have loved to see every character over the years. I loved this movie, this is the one I look at every time it is. Good story, good acting, and I hope it is not a spoiler, but not a messy sex or a bad language. Yes, it touched my heart. Warning, get Kleenex ready. I think this family life party is in our entertainment, be it television or. The movie is. Daniell, if you listen, you go to the girl, give us more.
