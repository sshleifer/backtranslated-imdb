Steven Spielberg wanted to win the Oscar so badly that he thought he wouldn't win through special effects (three of them were called "Third Class" Meetings, "Lost Ship Raiders" and "ET: Extreme Landscape." Spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie, but the Academy voters who voted in 1985 did not give any respect to Spielberg. surprised if he wasn't mentioned as the best director. ‚ÄùOscar was completely turned off, it wasn't right. by some special friends throughout the film. Oprah Winfrey also made his film debut here and gives an excellent result as one of Celie's friends, Sofia. Since I'm from Chicago, I had already known Winfrey from my chat show (which was not nationwide at the time of publishing this movie). With Goldberg as the movie is filming! Margaret Avery is terrible as another friend, Shug Avery, who is also a lover of Celie's love husband. All three actors received a well-earned Oscar nomination for their work (Goldberg was the best actor; Winfrey and Avery for the best support actor). "The Color Purple" south of the first half of the 20th century is such a strong film that it made me cry. It also made a laugh. Why are the Academy voters so hard that they didn't call Spielberg's best director, a mystery that still makes me understand. But Spielberg could eventually win two Oscars years later for "Schindler List" and "Saving Private Ryan", making him one of the best film directors. But he should have applied for this movie. The work he did on special effects blockers like "E.T." a serious drama like "Colored Purple" was remarkable. <br /> <br /> **** (Four)
