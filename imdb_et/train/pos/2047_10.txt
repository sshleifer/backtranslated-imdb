This movie hit my home. 29, I remember the 80s and my father's factory. I thought if I worked hard if I had the pride and never gave up, I would have an American dream, a house, some kids, all the cars that would call my name. However, I have pointed out that without a degree, something (unlike your father who gave up ninth grade) and sharp greed and laziness will not get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it's done on TV and I just saw it one hour ago. Ic can't find it anywhere! I would like to show it to my friends, my pseudo friends, my family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that Americans will ever work for glory and that we are proud of what we have achieved! I think the feeling is still there, but a heavy downward spiral, so many things are done abroad ...
