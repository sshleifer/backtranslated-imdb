This film will not be able to participate and even move in 2008 to an audience familiar with advanced sound and computer advanced techniques. <br /> <br /> A movie user experience in 1922, who only saw it in the cinema of other big screens, must have a truly profound and thoroughly satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> One question is whether the filmmaker makes a two-hour silent movie today and makes it interesting and at the same pace and balance of the same structure as this movie. Quiet film making was pure art, it had to keep its structure, direction and functioning in mind - there were no more words or a computer-causing disorder. A poorly made or uninteresting silent film is invisible. <br /> <br /> This movie needs to be contextualized for those who can mention Christian themes. It's not a "Christiany" movie, it's not selling anything. These topics, together with a reference to the current moral standards, often appear in this age - the Sunday church was a national past, Christianity was given to most households, so the film represents only a normal life, as it was. Themes would have truly and deeply walked at this time. <br /> <br /> It is very strange, given the strong support for this Christian thinking of this particular film (and it doesn't tell anyone about religion, just emphasizing the difference between hypocrites and honesties) that in 1922 the pastor sent an open discussion with a film industry representative with a large crowd Pickford as an example of immorality with another person he called. NY Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should have seen the movie that was released in 1922 and learned some lessons. <br /> <br /> Pastor complained that as the film industry had begun to attend, the church's presence had fallen by 500,000. However, the film's representative made the following observations; the fact that visiting the cabin was also diminished, that there were many more pastors in the prison than the actors (fact) and that the selection of some examples among many was not representative. <br /> <br /> Fight between church and film industry in the first days of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that is honest and true to family friends and willing to sacrifice. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, weak, full of happiness and joy, faithful, humorous and quietly sacrificing - though poor and uneducated, she represented the perfect character. However, it doesn't pull our throat down, but revealed a bit of the film. <br /> <br /> It resembles some modern Chinese movies, where the characters are slow, inclined during the film. pace that creates a stronger relationship with nature. <br /> <br /> This is a smooth uniform on the first half of the pace that builds all the elements in the last section. The last 30 minutes are great cinematic art and it has to be understood that it was achieved without sound, through the ongoing dialogue - it was achieved through competitive and great leadership. It is sometimes surprising to understand that you have not heard the word at the end of the movie, but it seems that you have heard everything. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast performers, especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. The last few minutes are typical of Pickford's undervalued humor when he goes out under the pretext of snow sweeping, an almost perfect balance and end. This is a special moving humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin used this device frequently and copied some of Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special observation to be made about Silent films, and especially Pickford films, is that the star must often keep the camera on most of the film without scattering the audience or getting bored where the participants are over-exposed. This Pickford is mostly in the focus of his films, but people still can't get enough because he is a testimony of his subtle ability to act.
