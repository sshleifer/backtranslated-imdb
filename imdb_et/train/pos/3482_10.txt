This is my first comment on the IMDb website and the reason I write is to talk about one of the best movies! "No goryuy!" makes you laugh and cry at the same time, you love (if you are not a fan!) the Georgian choral singing tradition and maybe you accept the difficulties of your existence and feel good after watching it :) What I like about this movie is the fact that non-leadership roles create vibrant and memorable characters and are as interesting and important as the central character. The film starring Vahtang Kikabidze (who is great), but you remember the movie around him. You will find yourself quoting your own lines that have become the names of so many Russian-speaking households. The movie to live with. Simple but deep, you want to watch it over and over again.
