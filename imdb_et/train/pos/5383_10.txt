I thought this movie was great because Corrine and Sean are newcomers to the company. It was full of activities and a little romance, but there were some points if Corrine didn't speak very clearly (when she threatened with a Seani gun) and she affirmed your teeth ... maybe he had to? I think the role of Joseph and Sonny was very good, and there was obvious contrast. and Sean did their stunts, which happened very well. I am looking forward to another pair of movies because they make a great team, or perhaps a sequel to contribute to their life, called "putting on a big apple". 'This may be Carmen this time.
