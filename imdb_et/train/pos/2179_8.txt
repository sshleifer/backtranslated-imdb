Prix ​​de Beauté was made for a change of silence and sound that came in Europe a little later than Hollywood. Originally it was quiet, it appeared in France with a dubbed soundtrack, where the French actress spoke about Louise Brooks' lines, but was quietly released in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was fortunate enough to see Cineteca di Bologna's flawless new Italian Italian silent print restoration at the Tribeca Film Festival. I haven't seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's silent to assume that the silent version is much more satisfying because dubbing is badly done for all reports (Louise Brooks speaks English clearly so her lips can't be too well quiet style, little headlines and little dialogue needed. Prix de Beauté speaks his story visually, with exciting, imaginative camera work. Opening is instantly kinetic, quick-cut urban scenes, and swimming artists spraying on the public beach. , ornaments and symbolic images, like a bird in a cage, a bunch of photos, a diamond bracelet. This is a silent film technique at its top. <br /> <br /> Of course, Louise Brooks is responsible for the ambiguity of the film. the last major role: charmingly beautiful, she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a very natural but very lazy His role here, more than in Pabst's films, for which he is best known, is the woman with whom we can fully understand and understand. She is a writer from Lucienne Garnier, who has a proud fiancé who wants to get more life and secretly enters the beauty contest, making immediate progress. Then he has broken his glamorous new life for the excitement and love of the person who demands that he give or lose everything. All the characters are nuanced. The team inspires regret and is not just brutal: he loves Lucien but is a limited person who is unable to live with him or to attract other people. Even the "second person" story is not a simple slim ball that we first take, even though its intentions may be as prevalent as a fiancé. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** WARNING: SPOILERS DOWN ************* **** <br /> <br /> There are many fine pieces of equipment in the movie, including Lucienne's triumph in Miss Europe, shown by comic reactions by members of the assorted audience who stopped heroing the flowers with the heroine; his affliction as housewife, peeling potatoes, cuckoo on the pendulum of the clock marks the time behind him; a spooky trip to the amusement fair (in a quiet version, this happens with a delay in the film after marriage), where Lucienne, who has been broken by bad lives and forced by her husband's mass construction, decides that she cannot go with her present existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room, where he looks at his speaker's screen test. Louise Brooks may never be more beautiful than she does here, because the projector beam flashes on her alabaster profile, her shoulders rolled out of white hair, her face glowing under the black hairline when she sings on the screen. Especially amazing is the double image of his fine body and his still live image: Louise Brooks's image, like Lucienne, remains immortal, despite her frustratingly interrupted film career.
