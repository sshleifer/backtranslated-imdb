Hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love Twisted Desire, and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart in tv, because I think she's fine. I'm also a true sabrina fan among teenage sorcerers, so it helped me look at it (don't ask). I love how nicole plans to kill his parents very carefully because he makes sure someone else pulls the launchers and practices on the bottles so he doesn't give up his fingerprints (a very well-planned idea). they all returned to Nicole when she arrested when her old boy came and put the hidden camera in his shirt. I give this movie to nine out of ten and put it in my top ten movie listings. And last but not least, if anyone sees it in movie stores, tell me when I saw it on the TV and didn't record it. bye
