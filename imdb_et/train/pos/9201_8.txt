Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are siblings bred in single-parent families. Jasbir (sister) grows in a prosperous environment, but it is not enough to reject her life and eventually join a hippie movement that will eventually lead her to drugs. Prashant (brother), on the other hand, grows in a less prosperous environment, but grows up with a mature gentleman. The story marks Prashant to save his little sister (who is constantly on the tide) in a hostile hippie environment. This film is a test of time, noting that cultures and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives if they should instead step on and take into account accidents. Large musical compositions in this film that mean different things in different situations and different people, and the director brings fear to it.
