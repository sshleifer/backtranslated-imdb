The series, full of perfect great episodes, stands out as one of my great favorites. It is not the deepest episode, no meaning or message. But it is very fun, and there are some fine performances. <br /> <br /> But what really makes me stand out is that it's just * only * the Twilight Zone episode with * double * snapper ending. At the end of the story, the zone was rightly a big surprise. But this time you will be surprised and think this is the case, but it turns out that there is another * surprise. I like it so much that it's probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is deeper, message-centered).
