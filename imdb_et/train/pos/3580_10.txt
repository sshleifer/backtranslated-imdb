I don't think such a movie could be released today. It takes time to display the depth of characters and the plot is not full of turns to keep your seat edge. <br /> <br /> But what does this film have to do: to explore how families deal with grief. How when the language of healing and overflowing loses us and relies on raw emotion instead. Fear without cause and patience is anger, even hatred. And unfortunately, the film's leading figure (a young boy who can randomly and kill his brother in hunting) is more than his fair share of it. He leaves and moves with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes him clear that he is an accident. I had the impression that this young man knew it in his heart, but he had to listen to these words from his parents and forgive him. <br /> <br /> What I loved about this movie: lack of dialogue. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to really follow the actors' reactions. Something we don't do much with today's movies. <br /> <br />
