I finished watching this fine and beautiful movie. It was nip and tuck whether I was going to waste my time watching the movie in Lifetime Movie Network because of terribly annoying ads. Reading previous comments convinced me to hit. After all, the worst thing that can happen is that I can fall asleep during one bored but long bite-in advertisement. Why did I watch it? mainly because when IMDB provides the film 5.8 WHO STATISTICAL AVERAGE "WEIGHED AVERAGE" was 7.3. It must be a definite blow. <br /> <br /> I was totally glad I was watching this movie, a commercial poison and everything. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with my ability to take on difficult roles by adapting my basic skills to every role. <br /> <br /> The portrait she painted in this harsh but attentive film by a human police officer was beautifully executed. If the scene requires a quick spiritual intercourse with a timely oral intercourse, he can join each actor with his toe. However, he is adept at communicating the volumes of emotional response without expressing the word, relying only on facial expression and body language. Without ads that, according to design, destroy the continuity of good movies, it would have been a true seat elbow. I gave her 9.0
