This movie is beautifully designed! There are no shortcomings. Not in the set design, lighting, sounds, plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where participants are in a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is the best in this role. His admonitions, infections used in his voice are not saved. Every shot carefully done! Surprises appear one after another when the film reaches its first hour. It may not be the best picture of the year, but it is a pearl that is very polished. It's not easy.
