I gave this movie to such a high mark, because it was really cute, really funny, at the same time modest. I went to watch this movie when he played in the Philly area, and it was a great night with my friends. The film is well written and well-functioning and although it seems a bit like sitcom, not a movie that doesn't take away from the movie. You just can't find such comedies any more where you don't have to shock people. The film focuses on a Ukrainian housekeeper who finds himself in favor of a young couple in need. At first he helps, soon he adds more madness to his life, then a couple wanted. Things go farther and farther until .... you have to see! I had a smile on the catcher even after leaving the theater. This movie made me feel good. I can't wait until it's published on the DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
