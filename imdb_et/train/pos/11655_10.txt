There are too many topics in the cinema and one of them is eating disorders. This movie shows it as it is. It is not glamorized to make the viewers enjoy, a true truth that makes it even more powerful. I've only seen it once and it was a few years ago, but I remember all this and how it felt to me. This is a very powerful film and it is a good support for all those suffering from eating disorders to give them the will to stop. Such films should be - they should be there to help people and not to lie about things that are wrong.
