OK, I wouldn't normally watch Farrelly's brothers movie. I never remember that I look at it. I also don't remember watching Jimmy Fallon's movie. Okay, I looked at the taxi, but I said repentance and was forgiven for this mistake. But this movie was Drew Barrymore and I think he's the sweetest thing. I don't know what he is, but I just smile all the time I watch him. He just admires me so. I thought I was looking at Adam Sandler just to see him 50 on Monday. How sad is that? It wasn't the biggest baseball movie - it shouldn't have been. It was a love story of a sad puppy hanging on the only thing that would never let him down until he found something that was worth it. It had a predictable end, but there was so much that it was worth.
