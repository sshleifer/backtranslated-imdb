This film goes down one of the biggest in history, right next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Waterfront. Someone please persuade Leno to make a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo, similar to Abbot and Costello. Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Evil from Cobb gives you chills. Dingman's character, like a buffalo oil, is back to Shakespeare's comedy days. And the climax. My goodness, the climax. I will not destroy it for you, but it will make the death star burst into light. If you can find it hard to pear it, do it yourself and your family and buy it right away. I'm still hoping for a DVD that's one of those days.
