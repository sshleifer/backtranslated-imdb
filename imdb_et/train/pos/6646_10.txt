Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, in search of India's freedom struggle, ignored his family and son, this film is about his son Hiralal, who feels he has forgotten mahatma because of his service to society in Gandhi. The film begins in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and fights against Indian freedom against Britain. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father, who is a barrister, because the gandhi was involved in the fight for freedom, he wanted his wife and children to join the society as a service and as a result, the hiraral cannot stop his education and fail his exams, marrying him with the love gulab (bhomika Chawla) against the wishes of his father. Hiral has the ambitions to travel to England and become a barrister, like his father, but his father refuses to give him a scholarship offered by his family as a businessman, and gives it to another person, saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his scholarship family and should be open to the colonial living for a more valuable student. This anger in the hiral and the division between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father to ignore him and accuse him of being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and land on the streets through unsuccessful business trials and high debt, losing his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna has given stellar power like Hiralal gandhi .. all her famous, direction and script are fantastic, the picture is great. In general, great film and black. I will give it a 10/10
