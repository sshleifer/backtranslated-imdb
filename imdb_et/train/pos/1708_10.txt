Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to think about what some people are doing for fun ... <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see the movie all my way too short. The audience laughed at his head. I look at it when I write, and it's still funny! <br /> <br /> It is also a sweet side with unexpected real sins. Late, the great Royal Dano is especially effective as a lonely, under-on-his-lucky farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is big as the leading children. And Mars suits, though limited to mime, do an excellent job <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for is background information. The film is full of stories, pastes and references to other SF and fantasy films. Next time look at Mars costumes. One of them is wearing Marty McFly's costume, the other is Ghostbuster, the third is in uniform at Atreides and the fourth is the last Starfighter aircraft.
