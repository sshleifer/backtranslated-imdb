I like this movie ... when I started watching it, I thought I missed pretty soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and seen it a few times. The characters are plausible and I have to say I loved Brian Austin Green again (for the first time in Beverly Hills 90210). I recommend this movie if you are a fan of it, but I agree with another comment earlier that the end is a sort of disappointment. I would have loved it to make it a little different! Don't forget that this is good.
