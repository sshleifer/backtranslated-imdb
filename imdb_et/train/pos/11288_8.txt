Almost all critics consider Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan's film to be the best, but I have no argument with that, although there are a couple of others that I thought were so fun. One thing: it's the longest I've seen in 105 minutes. I've only seen these six, but it was longer than I was used to, and in the case of a drawn-out finale I thought the whole thing was too long. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good activity, intercourse and romance. The only ones are color and stereo sound. Primitive special effects do not interfere with me, as was all they had in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Among some, this film is most important to one thing: skin! "Jane" never wore this movie after Hays code was created for the next Tarzan movie. His outfit showed how big Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. The naked underwater scene wasn't her - long-lasting. The underwater woman had no good indicator of who it was. <br /> <br /> There are many actions here. It wasn't superfluous until the finals. The end, however, lasted 15 minutes and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch. <br /> <br /> However, this movie offers everything - except "Boy" (their child). He wants to see Tarzan in the movie, even O'Sullivan makes Tarzan a few dozen times. It wasn't a problem with his "lung".
