"Before the devil knows you're dead, it's one of the best films I've seen for a long time <br /> <br />. Excellent band casting behavior is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman brings outstanding results and revives every time he is on the screen. Ethan Hawke fits with her scene and Albert Finney just looks at the screen. But Marisa Tomei has been abused but looks like an amazing 42-year-old. The script is great, the story is non-linear, but easy enough to follow. Sidney Snow, though not known for its blockers, has become one of the pearls!
