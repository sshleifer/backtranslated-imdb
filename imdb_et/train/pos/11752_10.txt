For all Has-Beens or never or curious, this movie is for you .... Ever played sport or thought what seemed after the lights fell and the crowd left ... this film explores this and more. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams (Jack Dundee) is a small town assistant banker at Taft CA whose life has been troubled for 13 years in a BIG rival high school football game. he gave up on the passage that would have won Bakersfield, their Arch-Rival, who will be delighted with the Taft Rockets season after the season. Kurt Russell (Reno Hightower) was in this famous quarterback game and it is a local legend that is now a van repair specialist whose life deteriorates into lethargy, like Taft himself. <br /> <br /> Williams gets the idea to recycle history by playing GAME! He encounters skeptical opposition, so he goes to one man's frightening man, literally painting the city, orange, yellow and black to raise the ability of the inhabitants to re-create the game. After the 1972 team reunion, the players get together and try to practice what is hysterical. The game is on, Bakesfield is full of high-tech gadgets, game strategies and sophisticated training modes. Taft draws mud, sticks, rocks and bottle caps that rebellion! Whether Taft crosses the odds whether Robin Willians cleans the demons from his gut, whether Kurt Russell rises from lethargy, "The Best of Times" looks for one of the best viewing experiences ever! <br /> <br /> One of the best UNDERSTATED performances by Robin Williams, the chemistry between Robin and Russell is magic. And who is Kid Lester ??? <br /> <br /> Holly Palance and Pamela Reed provide memorable performances such as Williams and Russell women. Successful on many levels. The 10!
