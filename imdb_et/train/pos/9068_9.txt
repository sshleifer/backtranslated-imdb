I thought the kids in the movie were great. I deal with children of this age group and I thought their behavior was very plausible. I had a problem with five-year-old personal parts. I didn't think the comment was necessary and it actually reduces my opinion of the film. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is up and coming up with stars. I'd like to see her on the big screen. I enjoyed his reactions to the situations he took in. Often, children in this age group do things without consequences. Almost all participants did it throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I also think that the bullying message needs to be studied in films of this age group. This is a big problem in schools today. <br /> <br /> The end was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts about winning or not winning were very surprising. How he dealt with this situation was great. Too often, children do not agree to compromise. Participants in this film showed that compromise is an essential part of life.
