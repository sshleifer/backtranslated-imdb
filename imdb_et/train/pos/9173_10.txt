I think this is a great version, I came here before to help me find what version I should use and I went to Jane Eyre in 1988 and read the user comment and helped me get this version. I do not regret choosing this version or you. I tried to see all the other versions and none of them fit. There is nothing like this book and TRUST ME when you read the book you want, what it fits. If you are looking for something real and moving after reading a book, it's hard because you want something that fits it. I would say that God personally took me to this version. It shows true love for people. I would say God's love is greater. If something is better, I'd like to see it. but so far none!
