It is the first in Guinea pig series and is one of the most famous films in the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time for a person to finally get hold of and copy their hands on this infamous group of movies. I bought a guinea pig box and decided to look at the collection by the date of publication. So I jumped into this sucker and sat down. <br /> <br /> I had read on the Internet and waited for the full force of my nerves in realizing the contents of this film. It ended not so. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who abduct a woman and start torturing her with the hope of discovering a person's breakpoint and how long a person can suffer from pain. <br /> <br /> It seems like one sick flick? Wrong. The film is not shocking. This may be because I have become desensitized over the years with my obsession with horror, but I think it's safe to say that every real gorehound can easily sit through it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, an individual who is not familiar with this type of film is likely to be puzzled and reluctant to display the images on the screen. Although it couldn't shock me, this film contains some violent and understandable violent scenes. Including nail, unconsciousness thrown into the unconscious, and stinging through the eye. <br /> <br /> In general, I think most of the gorehounde of this table, which you should just copy for the novelty of this movie, but I suggest that you should do this for every new participant of this type of film.
