Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, along with Jennifer Aniston, are one of the funniest films so far in the 2003 season (end of May) and a good step forward in the past with the crazy and personally forgotten roles of Carrey's past. With a bit of toning in Carrey antics with his old self-punching and cracking, Carrey is wearing the film heavily on laughter and for some dramatic, tiny moments. The elements of Jimi's real ability to act continue to appear in this film. This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements with amazing moments that fit perfectly with this script. Still missing from the brilliantly polished comedy / drama ensemble Bruce, it deserves an eternally false image of being a great date movie with a strong message and soft mental cynicism and parody that preserves its natural taste. Eight out of ten stars.
