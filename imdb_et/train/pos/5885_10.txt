This movie surprised me a lot. I had no great expectations for this, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well written. They did not spend too much time in transforming the past that they did not rely on the success of the old TV show to carry the film. Overall, it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented it might be a weekly sit-com and I think I agree with her.
