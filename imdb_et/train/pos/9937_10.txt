This TV series was one of those I had loved as a child. Although I see it through nostalgia through pink-shaded glasses, I can still say that it was high-quality, very educational, but still funny. I have not seen the French version but only Swedish. I don't know how good dubbing was, it was too long to remember. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the show was to show how the body works. I swear the school still hasn't taught me half of what I know from this show. It is also related to other things, such as what happens if you eat unhealthy food and do not use, nice examples in the body. Who wants you to have another chocolate plate if you know that miniature virus tanks can penetrate you? : D The classic looked beautiful, of course, very kids, but carefully. Cells, viruses, brain electrical signals, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoons, looking pretty much how to expect what they should look like in the animation body. <br /> <br /> This and the history (especially the green finals) of the famous series in my childhood. I'm so happy to find them here.
