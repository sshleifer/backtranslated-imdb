This Batman movie is not as good as Batman's mask Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero. But that's a good contribution to Batman's cartoons, which I say is as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This film fits all the same reasons. The style is good not as good as the other, but still pretty good when it has many activities. Classical effects are good. Actress's voice is really good, like Kevin Conroy as Batman Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal Robin. Roses are good, like Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Batman's mystery. So make sure you rent or buy a batman Mystery of The Batwoman movie because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ******* ********* * <br /> <br /> *** *****
