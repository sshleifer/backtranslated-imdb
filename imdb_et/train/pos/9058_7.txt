I read the book in 5th grade and now a couple of years later I saw the movie. There are different differences: <br /> <br /> 1. It was claimed that 15 worms were eaten within 15 days, not 10 worms for one day at 19.00. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy is probably getting $ 30 after he has eaten all the worms. In the film, after Billy eats all the worms, Joe must go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe is probably fake with some worms, but he's not in the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Although there are changes, this movie is still something children enjoy.
