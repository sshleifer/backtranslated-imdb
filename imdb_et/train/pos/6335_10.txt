Well, I come from Bulgaria, where the tornado is almost impossible, but my imagination says I am "very, very fearful" !!! This man (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this movie! t you know exactly how old he was, but he didn't act like a child (NOTE)! Now the tornado is not very realistic but scares you! If you want to have a nice time in front of the TV - it's a movie!
