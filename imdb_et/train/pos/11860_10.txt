This movie is everything. This is a classic picture of the events surrounding the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is just one of the thousands to get his fate in America. In Miami, the cinematic but extremely accurate imagination of the drug empire is surprising. Brian DePalma is doing an amazing job of drawing this picture so much that both the story and all the cast characters are involved. Under the pressure of Tony characters that he is so plausible and strong, Brian DePalma put out the raw talent displayed by Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's Boss) and Michelle. Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I liked every minute watching this movie and I still watch it once a week. This year, on the 20th anniversary of this classic criminal film, I am truly believable that in 20 years' time people will refer to this film in amazing numbers. For other criminal films that are so dramatic, I find this film a shock to the system.
