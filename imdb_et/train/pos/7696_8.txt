When the "Good Times" premiere in 1974, it was one of the first leaders of black families. It focused on the poor Chicago-based Evan family and their struggles to end. Most early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans and their struggle for the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were terrible actors and had great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. was a skirt but well thought out teenage boy who made his lack of artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, brilliant girl who traded with J.J. Michael was a close childhood who was well educated in social matters and was a lawyer. In 1976, manufacturers made a big mistake with John Amos, literally killing his character. It actually changed the focus and not the good I could add. The exhibitions began to focus more on J.J. and his buffalo-like behavior that angered the black viewers as well as the Esther Rolle series, who left after the end of next season. At the exhibition, which focused on the important African American issues that existed at that time in the society, the viewers were exposed to exhibitions that were overwhelmed with a skirt and fat jokes. <br /> <br /> When Esther left for Rolle, the show was even worse. Although it was still traceable, it was no longer a very ground-breaking show that it was once. . All open ends are tied during this season and the show was silently silent.
