We looked at it in our women's health class to point out how women in many societies are treated less well than men and I loved this movie. I'm going to try to see this copy myself. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this film was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family, despite their assessment. This is the movie I show to my kids. Our class professor was meant to educate women mainly about the film, but this film was more. This is one of those films that will forever remain in my mind and be a favorite.
