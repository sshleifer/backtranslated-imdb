This is a great movie. I love it more every time I look. Most comedies can get pretty flat because you know all the gags, but the mysteries are writing and characterizing so many traces - just as Ben Stiller tears the limousine bonnet or the Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography or Tom Waits mumbles, when he looks at the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses to kiss Paul Reubens - is a pleasure. It's a perfect show for the band. The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all settings are over. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been for a while, check it again and if you haven't started it. You can't look at it again until you see it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, sampling scene. Too many good things!)
