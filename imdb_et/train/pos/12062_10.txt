This movie has frightened me since the first day. <br /> <br /> My mother had been watching it when it was ordered behind '92. I remember waking up at night with his tears ramblings when my dad helped him up the stairs. He said something like: "Don't let him get me" or something like that. I asked her what was so upset and she told me she had looked at the woman in black. <br /> <br /> So I probably had to look at it and while I was only 11, he gave me. It frightened me to go. I've looked at it immune to fears!
