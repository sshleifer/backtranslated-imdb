The rigid and deadly Ace Batsman Tony Arzenta (Alain Delon's divine smooth and commanding play) wants to give up the murderer, but the dangerous mobiles he is working on will not let him go. After announcing his wife and child's death, Arzenta will announce all the deaths for the season. Director Duccio Tessari associates the absorbing story at a steady pace, maintains a serious and non-nonsense tone, confuses outlooks and exciting car ties with significant hanging brio, and writes narrative with explosive explosives. bloody violence. Deloni's smooth and charismatic presence adds an extra class to an already enticing process. This film still benefits from the pound sterling acting on the bang-river, thanks to Richard Conte's worthy contribution, when the mafia is Nick Gusto, Sandra, Marc Porel, and Arzenta's loyal prayer, Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring as a merciful, Calculating Grunwald and Lino Trois as a poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitta. Silvano Ippolit's glossy cinematography is on many graceful pans. Gianni Ferrio's funky score hits the drowning spot. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri open briefly in small parts. Better yet, there's no filler to talk about, and we even get a decent coffee of tasty, free woman nudity. The amazing conclusion is packing the middle and lasting wall to the right intestine. A strong and satisfying winner.
