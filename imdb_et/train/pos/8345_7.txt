I recently saw I.Q. and although I'm not a romantic comedy type, I think it was just a nice and sweet movie. So many movies in my opinion are not honest. You know that you feel when you watch a movie and you just feel robbed because it takes a story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was in the trash? The story between the scientists is sweet and funny. How they were together and they tried to help Tim Robbins' character. I liked the love story of Tim and Meg because it was simple and brought a pleasant point when it comes to love, "nothing is what it feels". I recommend this on Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
