saw it in preview - great movies - wonderful testimonials - funny and intelligent dialogue windows were fantastic - Peter Falk is ready for the Oscar - Paul Reiser was charming - photography was wonderful. Reiser was in the theater when we saw the movie, and gave a lively overview of how the film was made - his long dream was to write a semi-autobiographical report on the relationship between the sons and the father, and more precisely between him and his father - this was achieved in dramatic and fun fashion - supporting cast was well chosen and gave film family feel - I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see intelligent drama and great performances
