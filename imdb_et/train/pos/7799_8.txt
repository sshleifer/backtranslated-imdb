Very slow pace but complexly structured and ultimately very touching. A nice, very real life look at the small dead city of the Florida beach village - I've been there and it's absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> This is also the actress debut by Ashley Judd and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old - I remember it in theaters, and I recently rented "Ruby". With the exception of the 80s, it has grown very well. Ashely is so radiant and touching here that it is hard to think of her later career without being twisted. Boy, talk about failure to fulfill your early promise! Anyone who sees Ashley here at Ruby In Paradise expects this elegant, natural beauty to go into all kinds of interesting feature films and serious actors - instead, she has become a "go" movie for movies and movies! Very disappointing, but at least we have this beautiful performance to maintain his early promise. <br /> <br /> As some other commentators say, it's not for everyone because it's a very slow pace. This is not a feature film, nor is it a romance. Director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another great character training) treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect, allowing her story to be built slowly and in detail. So I think this is one of the most mobile and respectful stories of young women I remember - it's not Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her innocence", but her life choices and her growing maturity. <br /> <br /> Lovely movie, if you look at this time ... I think it would be a great movie to show teens and young girls (or boys on this subject) give them a chance to think and discuss it. <br /> <br /> Specific praises by director Nunez, who also wrote a script that is so realistic and nicely detailed that I assumed from the whole film that it was based on a female novel or memorial, but in fact it is Mr Nunez's original work . Rated 8 out of 10.
