A big movie, enough to laugh and action for any audience. <br /> <br /> As the last person who posted this movie, he called himself an Woody Allen incest and didn't comment on the movie, here I am. The film follows the unlikely duo, Johansson, and Allen, as they follow the ghost of a recent British reporter with a ghost. Their search leads them to the killer's home and finally to a somewhat tragic end. But don't let the plot fool you, the movie is really fun and the actor is great. <br /> <br /> It seems that drivers will come to the point where they really get things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen, and Pollack seem to be the most imaginative work of their career. Also, when you watch a movie at the Cinema Theater, you can simply say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready to actually come back. The other one walked to the screen audience. The man is just something and he looks really like Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out for a trip.
