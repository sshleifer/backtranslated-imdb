I remember this movie years ago, BBC2. I'd like to look at it again - does anyone know how I get a copy? As I remember, this was a particularly powerful film, especially the eye-catching scene of horses carrying a gas mask. Besides, I can't remember much of the story - that's why I want to look at it again! I'm a trawler on the web, but I can't find a copy that's unusual in my experience - maybe there is no DVD or VHS on the market. It would be grateful if someone could help me. Thank you in advance for your help. Best Regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
