I watched through my region's film list yahoo and saw a movie that wasn't advertised. I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were there. Having watched "mad about you", I wasn't a fan of Paul Reiser. But I'm a big fan of Peter Falki. So the husband and I took the opportunity. We were both under this story. Beautiful landscapes, affectionate action and a sense of family and moral values ​​that are rarely seen in films and in today's world. Not as gently emotional junk, but in real life as in real life. I even have to say that Paul Reiser was great, although I still don't look "mad about you". I don't know where this movie has gone. I heard it was a limited release. It should be shared with the world. This is one of the best films I've seen. M.
