Bromwell High is a comic comedy. This happened at the same time as some other school-related programs, such as Teachers. My 35-year-old teacher-profession made me believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than teachers. The peaceful joy of scrambling, attentive students who see the pomp of their pathetic teachers, the deception of the whole situation, remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw an episode where the pupil repeatedly tried to burn the school, I immediately remembered .......... high. Classical line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to wear one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I hope many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far removed. Sorry it's not!
