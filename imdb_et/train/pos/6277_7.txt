Good activity and interesting plot. Having seen the original, I have to say that it was an interesting fix and showed more film. A good cast .. meaningful action .. though it would be nice to see some extensions of the action scenes, not the background story. A fun movie to watch and warn you all the time 7/10 is the right voice.
