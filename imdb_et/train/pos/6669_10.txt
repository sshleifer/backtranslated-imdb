I saw this movie the day he came out last year. Funny I thought. Well, now it's the video and I saw it again. I love this movie! The things they do are sometimes stupid, but that makes my third favorite movie all the time. Special effects are okay, but witty dialogue will take you. I'm a person who says I'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other things, avoid it. But for all others enjoy! Action is great. Hank Azaria is the best hand (he is not candy or fruit), followed by Ben Stiller (ee, don't correct me, this sick me) and then William H. Macy, who offers his best result (fargo). praised all the macy for the Garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as an invisible boy. Two Problems: The most boring part of the film is the sub-romance between Stiller and Claire Forlan and the listening to Casanova's passwords. Some scenes are progressing absolutely no way, but they are a blast. Kinka and especially writers tend to drag the scene until it's all fun, but bam they change and you're ready for more. I swear after you have seen it, you are tired of an explosion (which I think it was pretty cool) The camera is pretty cool, moving at the fierce pace of the participants. Tom Waits also provides excellent performance (he has this cool cool bad hero to him) and, as someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show them some bad. Captain Amazing is pretty funny (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan - I ran) and the rush is pretty cool like Casanova. One beef: a more fun comedian (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So everything is a great movie. I'll give her twenty stars and I hope one day everyone will see the best parody of the movie, a six million dollar man, shining. Now laugh when I think about it. 20/10
