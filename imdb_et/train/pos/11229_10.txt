They have a great choice with the participants they work on. A nice star ship in CGI locations where their green screen needs to work. Anyone who heard about Adobe After Effects 7 should buy to get their keys better. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out, with lots of trek elements to keep it in the right context. But when two boys kiss, I put the episode forward. I'm not homophobic, but I can't help that I can't find men who can entertain (don't forget women). Anyway, for the Fans series, this is a good thing. The small improvements, practice and some instructions on your green screen give this series a stunning look. Anyway, I recommend the series that TNG and DS9 ever liked.
