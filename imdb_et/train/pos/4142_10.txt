FATTY DRIVES BUS is just more fun, the most original and entertaining work I've ever had a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> This movie is by no means a Hollywood-compliant or even straight-line video-fluff comedy, featuring a terrific "hogan" hogan, camera work, editing, operation, budget or anything else. <br /> <br /> What this movie is about is a very original and enjoyable story, and it is probably the people who love to do it, and all the cast and team enthusiasm pulls through their budget and acts. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that t need a big movie or decent actors to make a big movie, all you need is some original ideas and passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> Just the best movie. I don't care how you can, rent, order, steal, download, just watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I hope they will make a DVD version.
