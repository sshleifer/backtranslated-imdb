Undoubtedly, this film must be one of the greatest ........ in cinematography. I looked at it too many times to remember, and every time I see the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where does one begin? <br /> <br /> The central performance of Meena Kumari is undoubtedly one of her best, followed by Sahib Bibi's Ghulam and Phool Steam Pathar. Every movement and nuance of his production makes any other Bollywood hero regrettable. His masterful Kathak interpretation, along with his grace, the tragic vulnerability and the poetic handover of Urdu, is like nothing ever seen on the Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is probably the most stylized interpretation of the human situation; photography, rich cinematography and the mass scene have been blamed for the symbolism and meaning that the viewer remains breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Naushad's music is insurmountable, his knowledge of obscene music is incredible and the way he captures narrative with dark atmosphere motives and overwhelming romantic melodies is truly remarkable. <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the entire cinema spectacle should look at this epic mediation of life and art.
