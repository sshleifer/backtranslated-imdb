Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman who lives in a 19th century England-crowded Jewish ghetto. He is surrounded by intimidating, oppressive, harsh, prominent, worn brick architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, blinded windows and masses of black and brown coats. <br /> <br /> She lives in a small apartment with her big family running a clothes shop in an apartment. As a child, she did not work for her privacy, dressed in colorless clothing, shared her bed, and remained silent to avoid the mocking of her mother and siblings who ridiculed her away from boredom. <br /> <br /> The young woman, her life remains the same - she has no privacy, lives in mental and physical hebrews and lethargy and inertia, casts an empty, prominent expression, is dressed in ordinary, unobtrusive clothing and is constantly stressed and dwarfed gray, secular, massively occupied buildings and narrow streets, narrow corridors and narrow doorways, and his hard-mouthed mother and siblings and his family's prosaic, banal lifestyle. <br /> <br /> His only form of spiritual escape is Yiddish Theater. Being on the balcony by the balcony is a big difference between your spirit and the stage, a room that allows it to breathe, think, feel and miss. Freedom of thought, which the open stage for Esther is, is his face and body sleepy, uncomfortable, unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Stylish and plain look Summer Phoenix excels in Esther's emotional behavior - Summer / Esther doesn't want to do anything, or do anything about it. <br /> <br /> After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decides to get rid of the dark life she's trapped. <br /> <br /> Finally, in some stages, small parts are poured and meet Nathan Quellen, a British actress Ian Holm, who starts teaching technical skills to Ester. <br /> <br /> From this point on, Esther begins a terrible double journey on how to learn and get to know. He / she will begin to feel the emotions he or she did not know before and begin to experience the full understanding and handling of the technical aspects of the action. <br /> <br /> Nathan walks through the stage through physical and emotional surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-esteem, etc .; he will walk through these emotions in his personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three truths, Nathan tells him - the truth about how a character reacts, the truth about how an actor reacts, and the truth that the character and actor are not the same person. <br /> <br /> These technical steps and the three truths will slowly deconstruct Ester's defenses and lead him to two changing experiences in dissuading the film, marking the beginning of his freedom of thought, movement and emotion. Esther Kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because it is odd and narrow camera shots, the direction of bad photos that transmits Ghetto's realistic brilliant setting and the character of Summer Phoenix and the amazing and unpleasant image that gives an excellent insight into Kahn's mental and physical fears and lethargy and the weakening nature. <br /> <br /> A black-and-white film for people who want to learn the actress's technical handicrafts, and for people who appreciate minimalist f obvious and distinctive research.
