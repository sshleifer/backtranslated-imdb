Of these Pokemon movies (best for me): Pokemon First Film, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and Unknown, it's probably the most environmentally friendly, arguably the most beautiful and soothing. Whether they are good points for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever" has still offered a lot of entertainment. <br /> <br /> In addition to the three above-mentioned points, this pokemon movie contains good humor and good CGI. anime). The theme of the movie's time travel is well represented and Team Rocket (comic reliefs / dumps) ends up being pretty good and ultimately the main characters as sidekicks. Disadvantages are, as always, rather unnecessary violence and action, and baddie is quite uninteresting, even more than some Pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is watched in the woods in the forest. Young boy trying to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Ash, Brock and Misty enter the big forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious? Watch the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokemon fans and "American" anime movie fans, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
