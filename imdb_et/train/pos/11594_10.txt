I just found IMDb and I was looking for this movie and I was moved to almost all the people who saw this movie as I did when I was 6 or so old in 1967. I saw it in front of the Jungle Book, so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgl next year. I came to the cinema as a tear when the boy turned to Eagle and always wanted to see the movie. When we got home, we had a roasted chicken dinner and I got a wish for bone and I think I want to be? My father then said, "I bet you want to be an eagle," and of course we all know that you want to be broken if someone thinks so many tears and a little annoyed that you can't fly away ...
