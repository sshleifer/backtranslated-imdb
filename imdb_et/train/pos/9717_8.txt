How to lose friends and alienate People are honestly one of the best comedies I've seen this year with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It is not one of those "gross pictures" comedies that are heavily based on jokes and toilet humor, but are moving at a good pace and can be easily attached to the narrative that opens. Simon Pegg nails this coffin with his funny images of the nature of the underwater character and quickly releases from a tripod he once owned in England (the other two being Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Staying at the top of the Hollywood food chain is hard to do, as we can clearly see with Pegg, his first leading role was David Schwimmer's Comedy Run Fatboy Run, but he got both critics and audiences with cool comments. His second challenge is this movie, mostly quite positive comments, but there was a flop box. I, because one has not lost faith in him, and I am still there when he wants to take that third shot to glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters were Jeff Bridges from Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, in my opinion, Kirsten Dunst was very fond of this film as a love corner of Pegg's character, but in an interview with a vampire I still saw sparks. He must find it, fast or he may suffer from the consequences that they will disappear in "rom-coms" forever.
