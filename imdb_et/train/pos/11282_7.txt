It was the second of a series of 6 "classic Tarzan" films featuring Johnny Weismuller as a title and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, this series was a great movie; and perhaps stands out as a progression in the "inter-movie", which can, as an example, lead to the development of cinema from the early 1930s to the 1940s. As such, it was at a good pace, though not as good as the following films. Similarly, cinematography is less achievable than the films in the Tarzan series. Previously, what I saw was an unequal quality that contained some cereal landscapes and some under-filled and over-saturated scenes. There are no later Tarzan movies here. On the other hand, there is a very early scene where the jerking movement of the camera, which flips upwards in the jungle, reveals that the camera's upside-down motion is really a modern style, and is strongly opposed to the stationary frames remaining on the film. <br /> <br /> As for the design, there was an interesting feature of Jane's almost weakness and insecurity when she was flirted with Martin. Kiss ?? and Jane is stunned and partly guilty, a reaction? Predict something like Jane we'll see in these movies in the future. Compare for example Tarzan Finds a Son! Jane's double action, which tricked Tarzan and gave the Boy to his family. Later he admits to Tarzan that he was wrong. There is nothing so clear here, but we have Jane "back" to last year's Jane Parker and almost a regrettable action series, removing herself from Martin and Harry's evening dress to lure her away from Tarzan. /> <br /> There were a number of images and sequences that hit me especially when I was watching it. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, Tarzan's home life image here, as it is, is always a combination of sensual idyll with the possibility of a nearby violent death. This is at the heart of Tarzan's experience for me. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some very violent scenes, even in today's standards. <br /> <br /> Scenes that made me particularly happy: Tarzan led elephants to the elephant graveyard; Tarzan was released by the reservoir by a hippopotamus and then to monkeys for health; Cheetah looks for Tarzan when Jane and other men are trapped at the foot; Cheetah, especially when crossing a river. The final battle scenes of wild and lions on the ground and wild and monkeys on the tree. Jane, showing us that she is really the Tarzan world, quickly showing her enterprising wood industry to work out a fire to keep the lions away. <br /> <br /> The ultimate series of scenes is great: suddenly Tarzan is on the scene, despising the wild trees and taking charge of the lions and inviting elephants to rescue! This Tarzan's last crying triumph, lucky Jane, with dance and joy alongside Cheetah, is a memorable picture and really a fine amount of Tarzan's and Jane's story. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another classic classic Tarzan movie. I'd like to recommend this movie to everyone.
