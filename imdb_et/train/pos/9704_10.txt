I can't believe it has been ten years after this show for the first time on television and rejoiced at the unique mix of comedy and horror. This is a show that gave birth to a good part of contemporary British humor: Dr Terrible's Horrible House; Garth Marengh's Darkness; Powerful Boosh; Scallop. Many have imitated the style of this exhibition and I do not deny that some have exceeded its quality. However, Jermy Dyson deserves to be remembered when he started the trend with actors Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. <br /> <br /> Together they created Royston Vasey, a happy little town in the idyllic countryside of England, where unexpected tourists and passers-by fall into an obsessive pair who wants to keep the city as local and alien; where the unemployed are abused and offended in the work center; where a farmer uses real people as peacocks; where the vet kills all the animals he is trying to treat; where the gypsy circus robs people; and where the butcher adds something secret, but irresistible food to grab people. <br /> <br /> This is just what the viewer can find in gentlemen's league. These individuals give birth to tens and dozens of unique characters. The composition and dentures are so good that I actually thought I was looking more actors than there was. But it is also an excellent activity: the way they change their voice and body movements really become other people. <br /> <br /> Most jokes start with something ordinary, real life, and then blow something. unpleasant, sometimes intestinal intake. Sometimes this pure horror is without reconstruction, such as the character of Papa Lazarou. Imagine this is a terrible circus provider for makeups who go home and robbing women to his spouses. No explanation given. That's horrible. There are many references to horror films: Se7en, Silence of Lambs, Nosferatu, Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> Fans of love love it, comedy fans love it. As every inbound traveler knows, there is a sign that says, "Welcome to Royston Vasey: you never miss." Any viewer who gives this exhibition agrees. If you discover a gentleman's union, you never want anything else, you never forget it.
