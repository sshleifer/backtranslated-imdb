As you move on in a terrible song, you'll find a classic fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken has a very humorous and surprisingly good role. Her trademark style works well for a clever boot. Other participants are good at their parts. I didn't find any terrible forgery or inconvenience. Especially the king seems to be a real dunce and I don't know if he should be. I don't remember the original story. Special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not too fake, like some of the computer-generated ticket prices we see today. In general, I recommend this film to children and adults who are heartily children.
