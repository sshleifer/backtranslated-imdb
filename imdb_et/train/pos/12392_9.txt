"The Second Beginning", when this title explains, shows us the end of the beginning of humanity. Long before the matrix existed, Wachowski's short anime has shown us a world that may not see us in the near future, which is at the beginning of the 21st century, the second renaissance symbolizing the problems of human behavior; greed, power, control, vanity, and the like. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common in science fiction / fantasy stories. The second renaissance is not the removal of this concept, but instead of a simple man and machine placement, this story explains the struggle that machines have made, the struggle for acceptance in the world-wide world. When matrix films show us a human perspective, these short animations tell the story to both sides. <br /> <br /> Another renaissance part 1 + 2 answers many of the questions raised by the original Matrix movie, such as how the war broke out, how the sky would turn into a change that led people to use batteries and also introduced us to a machine called 01, which can to be associated with a future Matrix Revolutions movie. <br /> <br /> I don't play too much because I don't want to break the perspective of perspective viewers, but I recommend it to anyone interested in the matrix world, or just someone interested in anime animation in Japan. <br /> <br /> 9/10
