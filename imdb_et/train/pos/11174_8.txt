Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King. Not surprisingly, the king himself wrote the manuscript. The story follows the family of Creed, who is moving into a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud, a pleasant old man who knows a couple of things. One of them is the roads that run straight through their front. The other is the road that leads to Pet Sematary, where children have been killed on the road for decades. Soon Ellie Creed's cat, the church, is dead. Fortunately, this happens when the family, except Louis (father), is away for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another burial site outside Pet Sematary, where the church is buried. Later, Louis is welcomed (not so politely). He has come back, he seems to have chewed his way out of what he was buried. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing says more about the story without breaking it. <br /> <br /> Of all King's adjustments I've seen, it would be the most terrible. The characters are real and the situation is normal. Mary Lambert does a great job of directing the procedure. The hero is kept quite high throughout the film, partly due to the development of the plot. The scene where Gage is killed will remain in your mind forever. Then of course we have the conclusion. Easy to determine what happens, but Lambert pulls some really frightening and sometimes distracting moments. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a good movie and a great adaptation. If you like to scare and don't mind that sometimes disturbing pictures, then "Pet Sematary" is just what you are looking for. Non Horror fans want to avoid it.
