About two hundred Cleveland, Ohio US film society members, named Cinematheque, gathered on August 19, 2000 Michelangelo Antonion's "Cinemascope" publications of 1970's Zabriskie Point. Cinematheque Director John Ewing, who makes the best prints for his series, tells the audience in advance that this print was the only one in Italy that was shown. <br /> <br /> The audience was detained because the movie opened its artistic high on a panoramic screen. Looking at this great publication showed how Antonion intended, knowing that it was indeed a contemporary work of art. It was even more appropriate for the series to be in the University Cleveland Insititue. <br /> <br /> Antonion's compositions are designed for the Cinemascope landscape. Her beautiful image balancing, striking use of colors, choreographic movements, everything is the work of a true artist, using the screen as her canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally, the audience could understand "Zabriskie Point". As a narrative, it turned out that this work does not mean the story itself, but rather the artist's impressionist design of the hidden images of his object. Setting some of the more turbulent activities of the sixties gives the artist just a dramatic engine for a sweeping collage. <br /> <br /> Antonion is not bound by the usual narrative standards and can at any time stop creatively embroidering the event with grandiose decorations. The audience was delighted with its remarkable imagination, as his big pictures on the massive canvas found each other's attention. Although the audience could only be tangentially related to the character of the relationship, he realized that the subject was human alienation, the director's recurring theme. <br /> <br /> It was also understood that no lower or lower quality in the Cinemascope original might justify this particular design. Thus, the audience was even more acclaimed for watching Zabriskie Point in its original, breathtaking form, and at the end of the day with an acute applause.
