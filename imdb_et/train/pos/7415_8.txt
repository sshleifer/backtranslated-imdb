How powerful and amazing simple high-quality filming can be. This film tells us that it is a story of a daily scene that can be enjoyed in hiding. This is true, as others have said, how this film really makes it clear how the lost Hollywood is in its special effects, overwhelmed emotion and upper climatic conditions, and has forgotten the essence of a meaningful story about simple realism. So much of what these characters go through reflects a scene, not a literal dialogue. One aspect that I really enjoyed in the film was the contrast of the two brothers, one very publicly expressive in his childish way, and the other completely stoic, but both could produce deep emotions. The older brother had to say a little as he usually did, all this was his dead face. Beautiful cinema, great acting, great direction! Don't be skipped!
