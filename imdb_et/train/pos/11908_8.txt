This movie plays very well with the audience. Especially when the chase begins. Plus, Trevor Howard with his reasonable, smart charms and Jean Simmons's innocent behavior and piercing eyes is terrible together. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a psychological drama, but after the murder this messy chase thriller as both run the line. Some may think that chasing is superfluous, but in fact, chasing is essential, as it helps relieve Jean Simmons's mind by pushing him out of the oppressive household, and it helps to bring out a real killer who suddenly finds themselves having to stop working. The killer rightly believed that when Simmons was arrested, he would be taken away. And it is true that the lack of control over the household - as well as the evidence of his way - is in no way a murderer. The chase that arises will help to raise the truth. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie. Seek this if you find it.
