"Moonstruck" is a love story. There is no romance, there are at least three, but they all have the same family. Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) marries Johnny Cammarer (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love her, but she's a sweet and good man. When she leaves her dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets with Johnny Brother (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny have not spoken to each other for five years and Loretta wants to invite her to a wedding. Of course, they fall to each other instantly. <br /> <br /> How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is just what you just see. Every vision is a joy to see where Cher is a bright star in the middle of everything. He won and really earned the Oscar this year. The drill is pretty good and also silly, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia when her father is terrible. This movie is funny, charming and so very enjoyable.
