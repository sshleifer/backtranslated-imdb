*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Recently I watched this movie with my 11-year-old son and I was happy to see that he laughed at the right place and was thrilled with sequences of action. Ron Ely is just like Doc. Cold, calm, almost always under control (and eye blinking at random). What more can be asked? I have never read Doc Savage's book, so I don't know if it is faithful to the source, but I enjoyed the light tone and derring-do. Many people have compared this movie with the lost Ark Raiders, which I think is not fair. The budget difference is amazing (Raiders must have at least ten times the budget). Doc Savage has no extensive location on Raiders. Special effects are also minimal, but come to people, the story is fun and humor is just right. Sousa's music is memorable (I love the song of the theme - every time I watch the movie, I have lunch every day.) The best way to approach this film is just RELAX and enjoy. Highlights include an exciting opening sequence where a fabulous way and Doc pursues the Indian sniper on the roofs of New York and a very funny fight between Doc and Captain Seas. Not so good is a villain who sleeps in a giant crib (really!). All in all, a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I'll give him 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank you lord for being here!
