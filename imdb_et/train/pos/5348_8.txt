Another great film by Arnold. This futuristic film has a great deal to do with it and is one of Arnie's best films. Arnold in this film depicts halban and plays a death game. This movie is a great and great Sci-Fi / action movie. I have always liked this movie and it must be one of the biggest adventure films of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
