Although I live in Minnesota, I recently studied in France and met this strange pearl. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing. Creative and unique film, different directors gave something different from interpreting their love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try to match each of these small stories into a general story, as can be done with the love of 2003. \ t However, this experiment makes the charm of every single segment obsolete. Taken at face value, along with every short segment taken into its own individual film, the love stories speak together of a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The film is quite odd at times. confusion - and every single segment is difficult to track. For the observer who pays special attention to each segment, the short plots will become clear in a short time. Confusion is almost intriguing; it keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for what follows. It leaves the viewer thinking, "Did it really happen?" they are still happy that it really happened. This is a movie where, when leaving the theater, the viewer can't really decide whether they loved it or hated it. The primary reaction is to go and see it again and again to see that these individual lives are connected to a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> An interesting decision about multilingualism in a movie adds something to people who may be involved. This increases the reality of the film - here the American tourists speak English, French and so on. The number of people covered by the film brings an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From the disease to the supernatural, the love of the parents with the love of the spouses, this film covers all romantic storytelling. In a unique way, each time a unique event comes into play, it tells a story: the shape of everything, size, nationality, and love.
