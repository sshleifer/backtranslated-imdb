At first, I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came to my guide, so I looked at it on IMDb and thought the cover seemed pretty cool, so I thought I'd give it a try to wait for a movie like an elephant. <br /> <br /> When I went through the fact that I should have thought of the character of Alicia, which Busy Phillips has played perfectly, I realized what this film did to create the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so important that Deanna played Erika Christensen almost throughout the film, but finally we find out that, despite being polar opposites, they have one thing in common, apart from taking part in the shooting. They share loneliness and to what extent the film evolves. <br /> <br /> I just said how much I loved this movie and was happy to see all the positive comments on it. I couldn't even go through Elephant because it just seemed to have used the Columbine tragedy. However, this film was convincing and realistic. The busy Phillips works in OFF CHAIN ​​!!! This is a good thing, and I would like to see his progress made more mature.
