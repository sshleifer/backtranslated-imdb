This film is perhaps the most touching and uplifting I've ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes such a film, like this film, can give me almost a religious experience. Maybe you realize that it really makes sense to life. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that when I first heard this movie, I was skeptical. I thought the plot sounded and I was afraid that this story would be banal. But as a fan of David Lynch, I decided to go. It took about 30 minutes to capture the film, but I lost it completely. There's so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema feeling that I had really learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical movie by David Lynch, and in some ways it was surprising that he should make such a movie after he has studied it. the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he can convey deep emotions and deep human understanding, because I thought he was successful in being thrilled. Lynch is one of the most talented directors and I think Straight Story is his best. 9.5 / 10
