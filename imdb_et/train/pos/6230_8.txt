1936 was the most fruitful year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second film in RKO this year is the third collection? Mark Sandrich is "Follow the Fleet". At that time, Astaire is painfully uncomfortable when a seaman on vacation, Bake Baker, just happens to get into a southern beach cafe where Sherry Martin (Rogers) casts a romantic sweet hearing on everyone. Yeah, you guessed it? they are hot again. Only this time, Sherry's spinster sister Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens all the fine romance, falling for Bake's strong sailor Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); sort of use of "em up and toss" mother-type man, forcing Sherry to reconsider all sailors in general.

When you get a bit tight and sometimes softer focus on picture quality, the overall impression of this impression is more than acceptable. The sound is mono but very well balanced. The extras include featurette, theater trailer, and a short theme, but strange? no voice comment. Considering the importance of this film in the general canon of Astaire / Rogers, it is a typical oversight of Warner Home Video.
