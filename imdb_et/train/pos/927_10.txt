"Father of Pride" was another good example, which unfortunately is not a very long life. And this is quite sad, especially if you think that almost all the time when the worst exhibitions are still in the air (think of "Simple Life"), I admit that it has many similarities with this exhibition and "The Simpsons", but despite the similarities, the exhibition has its advantages. Animation is just enough, not incredible, but good. Characters are best. All the animals are very pleasant and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy had moments. The music was good, I liked many songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the show is not very original, I think it had a lot of potential. very famous, but I liked it a lot, it wasn't worth what it deserves. What a shame.
