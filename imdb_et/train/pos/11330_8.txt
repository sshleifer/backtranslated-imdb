This is a lovely story of a guilty obsession. <br /> <br /> Matiss, a lonely walk in Riga (?), runs by the woman on the bridge side of the bridge. He goes without words. Only splash in the water, followed by a search for help, makes it work. And then just too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film crowns its efforts to learn more about the woman. At the local bar troll he finds his pocketbook. She is increasingly sharing her life together. His "appearance" changes when his obsession grows. He must do things right. In an amazingly filmed dialogue with "bastard ex-boyfriend", he forces Aleksa into the guilt that both know. <br /> <br /> Bullying long shots, sharp sound to emphasize guilt and dog. Steps. Lovely movie noir nice. Good Indie End.
