According to Robert Louis Stevenson St Ivesi, the film tells the story of a young French captain of Hussar (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars. In the fight, he is sent to the Scottish Highland War Prison Camp, led by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). In short, he loves a local girl (Anna Friel), strikes a friendship with a major, and discovers that her long-lost grandfather, who fled from France during the revolution, just lives by the road! The amazing performance of all the cast and some memorable lines makes it above average.
