<br /> <br /> "The Dark House" is the hands designed for the best adjustments of Charles Dickens Novel. Alway one of my favorite novels, I was excessly satisfied with this Television Mini Series. Late, the great Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast when noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg were perfect, like the doomed Ladty Dedlock. The film reflects the nature of the Dickens era and is extremely loyal to the book, making smaller plot cuts that do not affect the story. over a brilliant, moving and atmospheric film.
