A remarkable documentary that gives a vivid picture of a country from a deeply divided country (see some IMDb comments ... for more proof). It compares very well with the thorough investigation of Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which is mainly for Fidel Castro's nostrils). I don't know if Chavez is all that he himself is, or another long line of populist Latin caudillos. Nor do I know if he can make up for the enormous expectations he has clearly created among the poor in Venezuela. It is hardly reasonable to assume that such a film would be able to answer such questions - but I have definitely got a pretty vivid idea of ​​what is at stake and what it feels like in the midst of a coup. Someone says "we make history" and that's exactly what the film feels like. Outstanding things.
