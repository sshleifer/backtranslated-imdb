In the near future Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a subordinate in the suburbs, hires a huge corporation Digicorp, who has been appointed as a spy of its competitors, Sunways, to steal. Morgan is brainwashed in his training, assuming Jack Fourby is an identity and traveling to bored lectures. One of them turns to her beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) who advises her that nothing seems to be. Morgan recognizes a new reality where he does not know who to trust. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a big surprise for me. This film has not been released in Brazil, but an interesting and exciting story is quite complicated, with lots of landmarks and great scenarios, directions and performances. In the last twist, I reminded Arnold Schwarzenegger of "Total Recall". This film definitely deserves more than once, and I really did not like the last scene when an independent spy disposes of the disputed plaque at sea. Only the familiar director Vicenzo Natali from the fantastic "cube", and the other work I see is also stunning. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not Available
