I just don't understand why this movie kicks here. Jeez. It is pointless, it is not polished and it is (as I read) somewhat wasted. The production of this movie plays its characters on T (if you looked at the Permanent Exchange and became a fan of Ben Stiller, then yes it is disappointing). They have been misunderstood, well-intentioned, who are trying to save the city / world, but not just fear and determination. The problem is that they don't understand their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! This is a triple film that The Spy Who Shagged We got sealed by the same demographic group, probably the same people who know the first AP movie compared to the sequel. I just can't get it. Jokes work at more than one level; If you didn't get it, then I know what level you are.
