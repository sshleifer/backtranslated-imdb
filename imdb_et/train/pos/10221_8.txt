Faith and Mortality ... seen through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who does not want to be in touch with each other and honestly talk about how their lives have expanded over the years. <br /> <br /> Mostel's character is a tailor worker with chronic back problems and a sick woman; Belafonte's character is a career player who is never in a normal job and fatal car accident leaves him in an odd Purgatory - he has to convince Mostel to renew his faith because it has failed with his wife's health (and his own) .. but Belafonte's Levine she has her own problems, still pining a girlfriend she left behind. <br /> <br /> The character of Belafonte leaves the film before she should seem, and so the end is coming to an end and the film suffers somewhat vague end. <br /> <br /> This is not a "typical" Hollywood movie about ethnic relationships or a human faith crisis. main actors.
