Anyone who knows our legal system - or the lack of it - finds this movie really satisfying. There were not too many shades of characters and plot. Almost all the characters in this movie showed what is the best and worst in our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags with namby-pamby, lily-liver-stroke, so-called. correctness ‚Äù. <br /> <br /> The performances on the board were compelling. I had sympathy with the victim of rape - at the same time, I found it joyful to see that he wiped his secret, cruel arrogations on the face of his former attackers. In particular, I found one of the toughest characters in a single-film movie, so it was nice to see her former victim close her mouth. The leading rapist and the psychopath were equally ugly, so it was only suitable that Dirty Harry himself played him loudly in a grotesque manner. It was the only order of the dirty Harry saga that was equal to the first one.
