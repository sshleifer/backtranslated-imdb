<br /> <br /> In 1970, Kurosawa, after five years of absence, made her first film. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film that focuses on many intertwined stories that take place in small Tokyo slums. <br /> <br /> The title comes from the sound that a spiritually slowed boy does when he thinks he's running a train. We are slowly becoming more aware of people living in small communities, of two spouses who are not satisfied with theirs. An old man who is the center of a city that helps steal the burglary that is trying to rob him. Very poor father and son, who can never afford a house, so they are one. At the end of the movie, all the stories come in a full circle, some turn out to be happy, others are sad. <br /> <br /> As it was Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that she uses it for her own good and shows. Maybe too much. This film goes in many different directions and it is difficult to get in and get there. But don't get me wrong, Dodes' Ka-Den may not be Kurosawa's best, but comes from the biggest director of all time, it's much better than 99% of today's movies.
