This animation has a very simple and understandable plot of good and evil, and that's all about action. What distinguishes it from other animations is how well the human movements are animated. It was really nice to see that the fleeing woman ran from the left to the right of the screen and looked around, so her movements were so good. Why don't they use this rotoscopic technique these days? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and ice, in its prehistoric environment and hardly dressed women, were obviously dedicated to a beautiful girl with different sexual ways, her robust body that works clean. Some may hate it and consider it to be another male sexual fantasy, others (including many women) love this aesthetic quality. I certainly don't mind! Bakshi just loves lush, breastfeeding babes, as can be seen in Cool World, and I don't think he needs to apoligize because it's pretty much animated for adults. But I also had this animation as a child and I never forgot about it. <br /> <br /> It was just special, so different from the usual price of Disney or Anime, and so it was worth watching. this is Bakshi's best. For those who like animations for lush women, try Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I'll give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
