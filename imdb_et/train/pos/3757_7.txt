As with schoolchildren, we have to give up this thumb. Even Grim Ripper made us smile. These two alien things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were still in the stupas. It's much better than the first one. And somehow, for some reason, I feel it is going to happen. Something great. Something important. Made better house and girlfriends. No, I'd say better crooks. Use clones instead of robots. I gave it from 7 out of 10 because these two robots were. <br /> <br /> Grim Ripper, don't be afraid he's not deadly, it's funny. When he fell from the sky, I shared the gut. Splat, I'm not sure about these aliens. What are they there? Scientists? Not possible.
