I have to agree with Cal-37, this is a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and cute, of course Jim Belushi has earned his strip! But you want me to really like the piano song, if you are a musician or you don't watch this movie, you know what it is. <br /> <br /> "You are not someone who loves you" by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh. <br /> <br /> So look fun <br /> <br /> Look, <br /> <br /> Nelson
