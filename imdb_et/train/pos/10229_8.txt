YETI deserves an 8-star rating because it is one of the biggest films ever made. I saw it at midnight at L.A, and people thundered and rejoiced in the madness - this film is one of those cinematic works where you think it's not stranger and then! Millionaire, who finances the Yeti project, looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman, who poured the wrong suit - a scientist playing man is one of the worst actors ever appearing on the screen - and yes, there is a mute boy (who looks like a sorta glove girl) and she's silenced because she lived over a plane crash that killed both her parents (hmmm-maybe child care)? Then Yeti sees this hottie Italian girl (when she melts - which takes FOREVER) - and she loves her right away - what is one of the most hysterical things in the movie is that this giant Yeti makes "bedroom eyes" with her - it's big Barry White who is trying to attract a group. In fact, when the big Yeti rises in the hottie and he has his chest, he accidentally touches Yeti's nipple and yes, the film takes time to show his big gray nippled GET HARD !!!! For all YIKE Yikes! In addition, it is a collie dog, because the Italian producer has heard that an American audience like dogs and his sorta glove tried to get Lassie - there is also this crazy scene where Yeti eats a giant fish - holds a big fish and uses this comby Italian girl's hair "Gee, thank you yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like a dead trout. This film is more bizarre than anything that Ed Wood would ever have dreamed of. If you are a fan of classical cinema - look for this baby.
