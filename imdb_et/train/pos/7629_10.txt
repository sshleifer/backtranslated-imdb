Kurt Russell is Elvis, simple and simple. His commitment to this role led to what I think is the best film ever. If you are an Elvis fan, see if you can. <br /> <br /> The TV film was made two years after Elvis's death. <br /> <br /> One tip, there are two versions - one in 180 minutes and one in 117 minutes. The only one to look at is longer. More than one hour of recorded material is shorter. It just doesn't work because the scenes in it often depend on the scenes they cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you through Elvis's childhood as the greatest star in entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurdish real father) are excellent Elvis parents. And Pat Hingle gives a very competent colleague, Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
