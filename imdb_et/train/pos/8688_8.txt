A very high-level Columbo story, which was actually the first long episode of the first filmed episode, but which was originally broadcast second (after "Murder By The Book"). <br /> <br /> Robert Culp makes his first of three performs as a guest murderer in a series and plays a private detective bureau who sends a rich, influential businessman's wife (Patricia Crowley) who is a powerful influential businessman (which Ray Milland understands very well) ) after the discovery he had a thing. Later, a woman rebels against a woman's blackmail system but kills rage .... <br /> <br /> Very satisfying episode in many aspects, especially since the plot is so heavily structured and later developed and also because Columbo's rare ingredient is a crime that is unpredictable killing. The whole thing is even better if the widowed spouse uses a murderer in her investigations to help Columbo: a feature that facilitates many high-quality scenes, especially in the first order when three middle characters meet and Columbo's critical scams are a great proof. <br /> <br /> The face of Bernard L. Kowalski, and it worked at an appropriately high level, really made the whole series shade (because "Murder by the Book" was badly finished). Columbo Creators The script by Richard Levinson and William Link is accurate, well-structured, and thought-out, supported by continuous, productive pace and meaningful sequences that really show the story's unpredictability. Ultimately, the final shows that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very detective work for Columbo and strongly encourages the production team to work positively and constructively to change the polished Columbo story.
