This is the first movie I've seen about John Singleton and he's a pretty good director. The movie starts with a bunch of incoming refresher and it shows what happens to several of them. Omar Epps plays a partial scholarship story and has difficulties with his work. He's friends with Ice Cube and creatures who are familiar with Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is a date of rape and becomes a friend of lesbians Jennifer Connelly and is not sure what direction to go. Michael Rapaport is an Idaho boy who coincides with a neo-Nazi group and is headed by Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science who is trying to help them. This is a great movie and it is unfortunate that the studio had to do the movie several times.
