When our local TV channel was launched for the first time, he filled up a big schedule with old British programming. "Lock your daughters!" was properly on the air and I - watching the movie in a few seconds - blank tape. The best thing I ever did. <br /> <br /> Actors perfectly match their character and bring them to a pleasurable life with matching accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington leaves you stitch, like Hoyden and his family). Dual intruders are abundant, wheel wheels mix and match up with characters, fun vistas lurk in every scene and risqu√© comments are done regularly. <br /> <br /> I showed the movie to friends a few years ago and they called a piece of "lost treasure" as much as a story. To date, I can just think of dialogue. If this pearl would ever find a way for a DVD publisher, then I'm in front of the line.
