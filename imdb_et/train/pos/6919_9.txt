"Winchester '73" celebrated the first series with James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Like most of them, Stewart's hero is a violent edge that threatens to explode at any time. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the "one thousand" rifle in the race. Dodge City On July 4, 1876, Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his high spade High Spade (Millard Mitchell) arrive in the city for the dirty acts of the past on the Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally). They will arrive on time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) who runs out of the cabin at Lola (Shelley Winters). It turns out that Henry of the Netherlands is also in the city for rifles. Lin and Dutch Henry shot this winning prize with Lin, but the Dutch Henry robs with Lin and escapes. <br /> <br /> The Lin and High Spade Trail with Henry of the Netherlands, where they meet Lolat with their coward Steve Miller (Charles Drake) captures a US Cavalry Camp waiting for an attack on Indians by Young Bull (Rock Hudson) who has won the rifle winner John McIntyre. He was a weapon to deceive the Dutch Henry. Young Bull is killed during the attack and the gun goes to Steve. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Lola and Steve meet the infamous Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea), who kills Steve and takes a rifle and Lola himself. When Dean meets Henry of the Netherlands, he allows him to take back his weapon, which is going to kill him later. In the city of Tuscosa, Lin Dean kills because Dutch Henry's plans to hold the bank go bad and he escapes to the mountains in the mountains. One of the best final shootouts is the last two showdowns. It is beautifully captured, especially the scenes of "widely open spaces" and especially the final showdown. Stewart, who plays against the type, plays the hero with a violent vengeance motive, with the emotion he put into future films with Mann. <br /> <br /> Like most Western parts, it also has experienced veterans and daytime players. In addition to the above, JC Flippen as Cavalry Sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette, and Chuck Roberson appear as a variety of heroes, as Ray Teal as Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers, and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles Dodge City order. <br /> <br /> Classic west in every sense. He was responsible for re-establishing Stewart's career.
