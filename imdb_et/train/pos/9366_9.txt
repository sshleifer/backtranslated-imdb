This movie was screened last night at the Austin Paramount Theater as part of the SXSW Film Festival. We liked director Mike Binder and the stars Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle who followed the audience after the film. This is a remarkable and powerful film about losing yourself and starting your way back. The performances are phenomenal and the story is as tragic as funny so rarely. (The trailer of the movie tries to emphasize comic aspects too little.) <br /> <br /> This is Adam Sandler's attack. Although he has begun to move on to more dramatic roles with Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish, this role for him as a dramatic actor is an important step forward. He deserves an Oscar nominee as he continues to move on to more dramatic roles, as Tom Hanks did and Jim Carrey does. In this role, he seemed to try to direct Dustin Hoffman to Rain Man. While playing the autistic man is definitely very different from Sandler's traumatic character, both characters have, for various reasons, trapped in the world of isolation and confusion with their children. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle's performance is less surprising, but just as good. After Hotel Rwanda and Crashi, we've been waiting for Cheadle's remarkable nuances. He has the sincere and honest qualities that come in this role. But he is also broken and fights, if not as deep as the character of Sandler. Cheadle has difficulties in both marriage and dental work. Together with the characters played by Cheadle and Sandler, they fight each other as the true friends often do (so I remember Matt Damon and Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting). They both look for the part they lost and try to find again. <br /> <br /> Reign of Me is one of the best large studio recordings released this year. The soundtrack, which is almost another character, is wonderful. It's also pretty nice filming on the streets of New York - a city that has suffered a tragedy and healed itself. The roles supporting the Pinkett Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland and Mike Binder are all pretty good. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director Mike Binder has really given the story that so many get in touch at multiple levels. It is a story of sad, family, healing, male friendship, spiritual health and the meaning of love. Governance over me does not disappoint. The film is almost hypnotic because it pulls you into the lives of your characters. Hollywood would have a much better reputation if he made more distinctive films like Reign Me.
