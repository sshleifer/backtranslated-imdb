The classic offer of Amicus, by Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ("The Far Pavillions", etc.) turns into a stylish, intelligent "square" with a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) all giving stylish performances despite the low budget, resulting in some "un-special effects". The most striking feature, however, is the seven-year-old Chloe franc, who effectively turns his part into a cold that makes the blood cold. Only the spoiled title of his films suggested by his distributors is the underrated release that has been cut across the mill's "blood" rodent shocking movie, designed for those who appreciate a bit of thinking with their horror.
