Get a tip on GOODFELLAS, mix it with GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and a lot of mattress comedy, and you have SOPRANOS, about a mobile class on the North New Jersey River. It's almost as fun as pro-wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire James Gandolfin's very complicated Tony Soprano, a psychopath with a casual conscience. I have also come to admire such people as gravel-shaped Dom Chianese as a confusion, but the murderer Uncle Junior, the silver haired Tony Sirico as constantly puzzled by Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as a double, harsh nail of Carmela Sopran. Violence is sudden and graphic, the body is constantly growing every season, but often the most important moments are small moments. See Paulie and Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli LAW & ORDER) when they disappear at Pine Barrens and sit in a bitter cold night in an abandoned truck, both convinced they've done it.
