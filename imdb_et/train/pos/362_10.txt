In 1985 (my year of birth), Steven Spielberg led an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl Celie (the debut role of Whoopi Goldberg) whose life is being watched in harsh times. The story begins in 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. He has given birth to two children for his father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. The widow sees Nettie's eyes, but their father gives him Celie. It is the start of a terrible era of abuse and constant control. Women are lower than men, and especially from an African-American woman, their rights are less than zero. Celie's story is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "Colored Purple" is a Spielberg masterpiece and an underrated film. He should do more drama that "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are a good concept. <br /> <br /> Cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is better known as a dirty comedienne, but the introductory role of Celie is a remarkable word he can really draw from a difficult drama. Danny Glover was a surprisingly nasty "Mister". I've never seen him in such an evil role. Oprah Winfrey is great as deliberate Sofia. <br /> <br /> Warning! While watching this movie, prepare yourself with many tissues. You can really combine a strong sister story. Especially if you have a relationship with your siblings like my sister. <br /> <br /> Mr. Spielberg praises great!
