After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie with something positive to say. It wasn't one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still OK. Morgan Freeman was just like God. Jennifer Aniston had good moments. I miss Steve Correll's "Daily Go!" <br /> <br /> I like the selection of films by director Tom Shadyac. He also made LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three and Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and talks to him about the human story. A director who knows comedy gets the talent he gets and can speak a meaningful and intelligent story that is hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I remember only three specific Bible references and these were the three most fun parts of the whole movie. In my opinion, in the first few drafts of the scenario, there are more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of insulting people. It's too bad because I thought it was a forgotten opportunity. <br /> <br /> My degree: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
