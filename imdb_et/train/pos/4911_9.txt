This film has become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences in the last ten years. The three stories Kazan has given us have their own unique and distinct joy. Homemade chocolate between Bel Geddes and Widmark, moving between rooms, small gestures, such as Barbara's phonebook, are placed under his son so he can reach the table, these small intimate exchanges between man and woman, everything is well-designed and natural. More than anything else, I love their porch, another living room, where it is clear that they spend most of their summer time. Another theme is the professional relationship between many of the film, especially between the characters from Widmark and Douglas. It may not be completely original and does not get a bit gentle, but overall it is so real, respectful and effective. The third thread, Blackie's horror and his dirty little gang, gets us closer to the dark and frightening world of the dwarf.Palance's Blackie is as cold as the ice block. This self-proclaimed business man is obviously a self-made person, which we only touch briefly. For me, this film is still a completely satisfying experience.
