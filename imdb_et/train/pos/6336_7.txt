OK, so FX is not a high budget. But this story is based on real events. Nothing that is put together to make a few rich actors, even richer !! Since most books based on books are something that just doesn't fit. Only a few people have said that this movie is based on real events, not a hit, because most people believe it is !! This movie has nothing to do with TWISTER! Other than both movies are about tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those who have problems with the science of tornado and storm, there are a couple of things to keep in mind ... The real "evening evening" was June 3, 1980. So this movie appeared 16 years after the real events . Try to think how far the storm science has progressed at this time. It happened in a bigger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the country. Although the film still calls the city and says it is a small town.
