It is a rather slow-paced film that keeps out the ex-stripper story, who starts a new family life with complete strangers. The viewer slowly feels that there is something wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie, although it finally leaves a nice bitter taste. It's smart, well-paced, and well-functioning. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deep in their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also very touching. <br /> <br /> A thriller that doesn't seem to be one. A very unusual film, a very special atmosphere throughout the movie, although you can feel a couple of times a couple of scenes uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 8/10!
