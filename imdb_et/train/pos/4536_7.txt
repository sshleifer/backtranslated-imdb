Written by a writer who set out a great series of Murder Rooms that crowned ACD's adventures with Dr. Joseph Bell, I waited for it and I wasn't disappointed. It was a rather slow movement, emphasizing Doyle's disappointment with Sherlock Holmes, which was very accurate and perfectly portrayed. It was an interesting character training and very well shot (on digital video, in an unusual period). Action was great everywhere, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who depicted ACD whose name I don't remember didn't affect me in the end. Great character training with about the same number of turns as every ordinary case of Sherlock Holmes. Do you see this when you get this opportunity
