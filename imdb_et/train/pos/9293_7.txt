Tip number one - read the title of "Dog Time" or maybe a dog. It's a pretty good piece of the ensemble (look at the cast and rent - you know you're already curious) and the first bishop of the band gives them a chance, taking the time to let the characters interact and chew the landscape when they wait - not enthusiastically - for the "big boss" and return of any revenge. <br /> <br /> Some of us have seen Christopher Jones seeing his own exile films; he is still the leading film presence. And yes, Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor participated, this is the "Wild in the Streets" reunion party!
