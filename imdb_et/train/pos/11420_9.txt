This film deals with the subtlety and difficulty in navigating the movements, the race relationship, and the desire for ever-changing boundaries. This is not a movie for everyone. No cars, no buildings exploding or murdering. The drama lies under the tension that gazes, the minimal gestures, the spatial boundaries, the lighting and the things on the left - sometimes very seemingly - without saying. It is identity, memory, community, belonging. The various parts of the film work together to strengthen themselves and others, identity, desire, boundaries and loss were found. It rewards a attentive and sensitive viewer. It does not want those whose tastes require explosive, massive and spicy activities. It's a beautifully filmed human story. That is all.
