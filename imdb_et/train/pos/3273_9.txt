I only give him ten out of 10, because I have to look at it again, in the current image, to have a new perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that blinded my brain and eyes when I looked at it. I would look at it every time he returned to HBO (probably in 1990). I can even record it, but this recording has long gone, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try and get this title, they're not wearing it right now. I hope to find it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it if it is somewhere. It's at least interesting. If you liked movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo or something strange, try it.
