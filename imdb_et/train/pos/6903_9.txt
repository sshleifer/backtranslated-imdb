This little appreciated movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over again. Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! Tongue-in-cheek, a menacingly humorous Gomez Addams, is just the right tone for this telling story of such unfair looting. <br /> <br /> In general, it is unlikely and unreliable that the Moon Parador will allow you to look out for reality and join the fun that is happening on the screen. Two thumbs up!
