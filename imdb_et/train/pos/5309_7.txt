The best thing about this movie is that it is fun. It is full of humorous signs and interesting situations, starting with a brilliant, innocent Pecker (played by Edward Furlong), who likes to photograph almost anything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters are Pecker's friend Matt ("he's a thief, but he's a really nice boy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who finds her space on the Virgin Mary image <br /> > The film gently points out how much wealth is offered in everyday life, and it can do this without it being too difficult. There is always a danger that sending messages of "ordinary citizens" and dignity will slip somehow backwards to "holy as your" - but "Pecker" will avoid these traps, allowing the audience to get enough breathing space for viewers to compare that message with their thoughts on the subject. <br /> <br /> I usually recommend a movie because it's very fun.
