One of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's a bit like looking at the train's crumb in slow motion, but still cute ... Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like family members after the movie's repeated viewing, and are quoted indefinitely: "It's a pretty fucking day, now you just shut up?" the explanation of opening only allows the film to live forever and so is the Big Edie's "world-famous singer" and Little Edie's "world-famous dancer".
