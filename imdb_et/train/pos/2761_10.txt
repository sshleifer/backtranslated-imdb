I first saw this movie in Paris in Newark on Air France in August 1996. The film itself, I believe, is a masterpiece. This is the kind of movie people should do. I still think that Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors. In this French film, he plays with a divorced father and a businessman who has lost his life until he falls down to a Down syndrome in a person living with other Down syndrome patients. Participants, including an actor who actually has Down's syndrome, create an incredible friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and our changes remain forever with Down's syndrome. He realizes that life is not just a job and not a game, but a living and loving life, and it should be life. The end is silly, but I think it's one of my favorite films. Suffice it to bring a tear to your eye.
