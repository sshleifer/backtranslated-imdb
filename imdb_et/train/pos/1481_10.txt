Now that these days some people don't see a movie without a style movie, so much Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, maybe we'll change what we're expecting in the movie, Casomai is not a one-on-one-american-American movie, all movies resources and language to tell us the simple history of love and marriage, but much more .. Fully views, lectures and you think ... and I'm sure you can't fall every second for long 116 minutes. I guess I don't have one scene for more than 3 o 2 1/2 minutes.
