Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (exquisite and plausible force that more trustworthy Kurt Russell) will be destroyed on a distant planet after he is obsolete by the merciless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (Jason Isaac's foolish heroic game) who has Todd and his fellow citizens replaced the new advanced genetically modified fighters. Todd joins the peaceful community of predators, and must protect this community when new soldiers come to practice. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working on the intelligent and provocative scenario of David Webb Peoples, depicts a cool vision of a dark, cold, and harsh potential in the near future, while maintaining a gentle pace and a harsh and brilliant tone everywhere. In addition, Anderson works well with the moving moments of mankind (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is indeed repulsive) and takes action on the scrambling scenes of robbery. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime image of Todd; he expresses many emotions without saying much and does most of his actions through his body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up Supports Jason Scott Lee as a Brutish Rival Soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as Compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as a Kind Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as a mouth of a small boy Nathan, Gary Busey as a harshly experienced veteran captain's church, Michael Chiklis as a cheerful Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as Reasonable Mayor Hawkins. Better still, this film makes a profound and important statement about the spiritual cost of the merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual power to physical power. David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely, boasts an overall orchestral performance and a first-class special effect to further enhance the overall excellence of a scientific fiction / action hybrid.
