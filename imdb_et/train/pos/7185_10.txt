Ted Mapes told Burbank's home that he and Reed Hadley wore clothes of the same size, except the hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the greatest stunt masters, said that every time Zorro put his mask on, he was on the screen. <br /> <br /> It was a bit of an exaggeration: it was time for Zorro to be Reed Hadley, but in tricks we can be happy that it was Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And what tricks! "Zorro Fighting Legion" is one of the biggest series in the comments. It is exciting and generally very well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a good actor, and as someone else commented, he made a very good fop. <br /> <br /> This is the action that makes this movie so big. <br /> <br /> And what else could we expect from this great team, Witney and English, with amazing music from amazingly lucky William Lava (the list here says he was unredeemed, but it's wrong, the others here the composers listed were indeed unredeemed and I don't know if they wrote any music - it sounds like a stage - and among other things evil. Big Charles King and tens of bits of parts? <br /> <br /> Also remarkable was the Tarzan radio, Jim Pierce, son of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I invite you to read your mini-bio.) <br /> <br /> There is one chapter that slows things down slowly, but hell, it's just a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you hit it well, you're back with excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner's classic movies are a great THANK YOU for this great series and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we should thank all the people involved for seeing it as a chapter or serial number, not as a cut-off feature.
