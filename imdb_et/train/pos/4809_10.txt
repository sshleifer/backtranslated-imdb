Are all the recent British monarchy films the right time for another? Answer: YOU! Young Victoria is the second contribution to the British cinema wave, which deals with the royal family. In this case, he is dealing with the princess Victoria's early life and events that lead her to the crowning of the Queen of England as well as her romance and possible wedding to Prince Albert. The film also discusses the keen life and career of Queen and Prince of England, as well as a number of other events (political confusion, etc.). Emily Blunt plays Victoria in her youth while Rupert's friend is her beloved and best friend Prince Albert. The rest is rounded up with Miranda Richardson, like Kent Dutchman, and always welcome on the screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as others who appear on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R. Z.Y., Loser Love) leads the winning scenario of Jullian Fellowese (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I went completely to the visual appearance of the film (operator Hagen Bogdansker), who gave a picturesque look to each film frame (with the help of the product developer Patrice Vermette), as well as some tight changes (Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). In the Fellowese script, I also appreciate using a chess game as a metaphor for the political motivation of some movies (film characters move like chess on the board). It's a smart, well-written, staged, filmed, edited and acted entertainment (and lighting) that makes the cinema a good night out. MPAA-rated PG for some sensuality scenes, some short violence (a little bloody, though not too much), rude language outbreaks and some on-screen smoking
