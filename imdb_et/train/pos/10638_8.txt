When I think about this movie, all the adjectives that I think resemble are related to the physical recognition of the world. Texture, smell, color, that is, I think this film should be appreciated. Watch the rich golden tones or turkish bathrooms surrounding the young relatives sleeping in the fireplace and let it swim with your spice, coarse cloth, smooth skin, scented oils, flashing flames, satin. Don't just look and listen, don't absorb, let the narrator's narrative voice scare you.
