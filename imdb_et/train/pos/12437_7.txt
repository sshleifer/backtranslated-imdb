As a long-time fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creation, I watched this movie on DVD without much hope; really i expected to reach the remote within fifteen minutes. But instead I enjoyed this production thoroughly, and I especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director managed to tell the story of Modesty Blaise. They managed to avoid the trap of the (poor) movie version of the books we all are so familiar with, instead of focusing on the time that Modesty's only lives in novels. <br /> <br /> For product values ​​(and I'm not a cinematic student!): Yes, the film was filmed in a tight financial and time budget, and maybe it shows ... but it breaks the viewer's enjoyment? In that case, I don't think so. Instead, we introduce one of the world's largest literary heroes and taste our abilities. <br /> <br /> As for casting: because in the unknown territory we can be the only people who really are important, modesty and (perhaps) Professor Lob. For me, they were completely reliable. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wood and too thin to be a heroine, brought on Modesty's momentum and coolness; his technique (when martial arts was needed), but most importantly was the personality that is the core of the Modesty Blaise canon. <br /> <br /> OK, so we all know that this movie was brought to Miramax's statement by the character of Modesty Blaise, it was done quickly and cheaply, IF ... I can't wait for those manufacturers to see this series the next production - as long as they follow the basic values ​​and testimonials of the original songs!
