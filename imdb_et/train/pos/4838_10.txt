This movie reminded me that some of the old Black & White movies are definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> Initially, I had some reservations, but from the beginning to the end of the movie I was fascinated. I was very impressed by the mix of drama, temporary and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and I had stitches all the time. <br /> <br /> Be sure to add this movie to a movie night to sometimes frustrate and "too" powerful or too "funny" in today's movies.
