Several films have been made about Zorro, some of them even in Europe, eg. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by prominent actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me, Reed Hadley has always been the best. This series gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western part, where you will only discover the true scraper, Don del Oro. The series also performs well in various films B, such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains such as John Merton and Charles King, and Hadley as Zorro. He was fast, smart, well used his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for every Zorro.
