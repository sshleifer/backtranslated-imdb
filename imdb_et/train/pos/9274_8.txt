Another fantastic film from a country where decades of repression of fundamentalist regimes have no problems with creating a passionate topic. This time, Panahi takes a different approach with ironic comedy and loving, non-professional pain. Although he is still with his message, which is wrong in his homeland, he does so without the need for a difficult story. It is positive for the state, especially for this people, that the Iranian people desperately need it. The biggest loss is that it is not released domestically. The insane, paranoid Iranian government claims that this fine filmmaker is only successful abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy to disgrace them. After the revolution has been growing and academics, artists and educated 'disappearance' have been seen over the last 25 years, he shows great courage to continue his work there. The reality that has been achieved from the actual World Championship really brings you to the event. The fact that he hits 35 mm is amazing because most would try to use this project only in digital form. It looks fantastic. His demand to use only non-professional actors really works in this film. Fine appearances everywhere. After watching many films that show Iran's problems and also the media that report facts, we can tend to demonize both people and the government. This movie does the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things, and that laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of the Sharia law that maybe became better is not too far away. Some call Panah a feminist filmmaker, but I think he just fights for Iran's most oppressed demography. Young independent women.
