First, it's just a more fun movie I've ever seen. It includes a perfectly timed stroke, sexual humor and smart thinking. But it goes deeper. Souler Opposite is an original love story (something that we often don't see), which gave me hope that there is love that two people who love each other can work through their accident; and that such a comedy lifestyle (which I believe we should all have) can be accepted by people who really matter. Chris Meloni gives as convincing results as Barry Singer that he could have won an Oscar. The film is perfectly written and I hope we will see more films from all the future participants.
