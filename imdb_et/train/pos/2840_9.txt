I just saw the press release of this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. Not often, I see all my favorite actors in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden together. I think their chemical camera is a direct consequence of their time with the camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly) Bret Ratner's piece ... Without saying too much, I just say there is a surprise that leaves you hanging ... <br /> <br /> The old couple were really good with and you actually have the impression that they have lived together for a lifetime. Both Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke's segments offered surprises that seemed realistic and similar to those of large apples. The whole movie is a great place to meet ... especially if you already loved the city. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next city of love in cities.
