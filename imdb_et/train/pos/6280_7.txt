If you like cars, love this movie! <br /> <br /> The film has some great actors, especially Vinnie Jones, with their typical nonsense attitude and hard-wearing looks. <br /> <br /> This film has only two slight drawbacks. First, a bad plot, but people don't look at the plot. Secondly, respect for the anti-theft car (car crime). But if people really believe they can steal Ferrari and get away with it, a good look at them, I hope you have a good time in prison. <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage played a major role, I was thinking for the first time "... sweeet." but then I thought "... you wanna suck!" but after watching the movie I finally realized that "... yes, he sucks!". Only jokes he plays a role very well. <br /> <br /> Stop this unusual review by saying, "If premature death of the offender has somehow enlightened the general cinema audience, that the gloomy finish under the shiny plywood of criminal life and inspired them to change their way, this death will bear the innate you should say, "Poor criminal proceedings." I say, "Poor us." <br /> <br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks pretty nice!
