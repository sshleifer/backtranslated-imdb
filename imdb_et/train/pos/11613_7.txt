Distortion is a film that captured me with some surprise. An occasional multi-layered drama that focuses on a person who writes about a game about his life experiences that are happening right now. To be shorter, she feels that her husband is deceiving her, so she hires her biased eyes. His wife has no idea that it will happen. In the meantime, the participants in this game have some sleeves with their sleeves, fooling each other and together, say, shamelessly in the Israeli world. The whole thing culminates in the theater with all the actors present, and the predictable (but not actually) happens. <br /> <br /> The director of the work really keeps things together with the characters of the ensembles and makes what makes you pay attention, is actually a fun movie that I watched to watch and recommend people to watch.
