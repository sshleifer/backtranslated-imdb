I remember that it was very small for this kind of venture when it was first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, hammy actress, and cheesy title in John Hughes formula. You shouldn't have paid me to see it 15 years ago. But I tried to look at it, wiping it off on Sunday afternoon and it hit me on a couple of levels. Fairy tale (part of Pretty Woman, part of upside down Pretty Woman), very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-like show, Kelly Lynch, escapism. First, it gently pulls some very nice strings. It's quite difficult not to get into the story, develop a crush Kelly Lynch, identify James Belushi, dislike the rigid bad boy-boy and laugh at Curley Sue lines. Have all the ups and downs with a happy ending and what message you want to hear. Continue, waste your time with this movie, it's worth it.
