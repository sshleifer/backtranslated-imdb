I didn't expect much, and frankly, this film didn't like it for the first time, but watching it again and realized it was cool. Of course, this is one funny movie, but it's a funny gag. Someone posted it could be better written and it could be. I think this film had the potential to be an overflowing cousin of my cousin Vinny. But a lawyer instead of a horror worker. Unfortunately, this is a wasted opportunity. By writing a little more, it could be classic. Children are underestimated, there is no reason why they should shut down Elvir. Apart from the obvious reasons. It would have been great if their relationship flourished. I know this is a comedy, but it has little difference that separates good movies from great. <br /> <br /> Elvira himself is always fun and interesting. Not to mention dirty. Every time he smiles, you too. It's hard to knock a movie if the main character is so charming. And it's really his charm, don't let him feel like you are deceiving you to think he's some kind of tart. Well, he's. But he's great. The kind of person you let your children take care of. Don't let him eat them, though ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend it. Just don't wait too much. <br /> <br /> She is more than just a big breast. He's also an incredible couple of feet.
