I was a small skepticle if I had to watch it when it was first shown in CBS. I was one of the many people who were in NYC that day, I went to school at Hunter College. I didn't want to see all the abnormalities and carnage again, but like many, I was curious to see what it was all about. This documentary saw tears in front of my eyes. All my memories came back and the intense pictures were incredible. I bought a DVD on the anniversary of one year and watched it a few times. How these men were able to hit this frame was incredible. If you haven't seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and check it out. It's obviously frustrating and eye-catching, but it's an incredible document from this darker hour.
