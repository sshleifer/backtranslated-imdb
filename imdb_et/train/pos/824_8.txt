When it comes to the creation of the universe, George Lucas is the undisputed captain and his final Star Wars movie is very, very good (and more appropriately rated compared to the previous two previous films). Having recently seen Sith's vengeance, it really makes the film perspective. The final battle seems even more expressive, knowing what Anakin Skywalker was going through the emperor's manipulative hands. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader bitter, bearing in mind the love he felt for Padmé and the love he felt for his children. In fact, new movies (especially Episode II) are worse than the original movies, but they are good for just one reason. They make the old movies even better. <br /> <br /> Mark Hamill is doing an extraordinary job in this movie. He really brings Luke's changes into reality. I believe fairly that he should have become a great actor on these films because he really does a good job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you may feel that he has made Raiders and Blade Runner between the last two chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired by Raiders) to a character that works great. In short, Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never a very good actor, but he does a decent job and is certainly satisfactory. Ian McDiarmid appears in this movie and has seen episode III that I can say for sure that he is one of the most accomplished villains. James Earl Jones still offers Vader's voice and he is still very good, very good. <br /> <br /> With regard to how the film looks pretty safe, it can be said that the Star Wars universe looks better than the previous (two) films, but it was always Lucas forté, so it's really expected. The final struggle for Endor is very good in terms of overall impact and tension. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided that the three battles would take place at the same time as the overall tension of the climax. <br /> <br /> The only thing I feel about dragging a movie for the other 9 earned is Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying that they almost destroy every scene where they are. In addition, I find it a bit kiddy if the spokesmen with rolls and arrows can hit the battlefields with a powerful machine attack. br /> <br /> The entire Jedi return is a very good movie, but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less fulfilling director than Irvin Kershner makes the film's overall feeling less than brilliant. Also George Lucas's stupid decision to add Ewoks to the universe makes the film not brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
