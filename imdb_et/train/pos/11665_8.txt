I would not have known of this film, if not its "surprise" for the Oscar nomination for the best animated film. Fortunately, I was able to watch this animated little treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about a child, Brendan, who was a nephew of Kells City Government. Abbot's main occupation is to build a wall to protect Kicks from attacking Vikings. One day, Iiden's well-known illustrator, Aiden, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to illustrating art and attracting the outside world. On the way, Brendan interacted with the white forest sprite Aisling because he tried to restore the old crystal, which was invaluable for a valuable book show. <br /> <br /> "Clock Secret" is unlike most released animation these days. It is modest because the illustrations are made with harsh geometric lines and design, without realism being as careful and symbolic as possible. The movements of these lines resemble a simplified but fluid animation style used in the "Kung Fu Panda" start sequence. However, the main source of admiration for the audience is the excellent use of color. The red blinds used in the Viking invasion are unforgettably haunting. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this silent film layer. This is a welcome atmosphere for all the meaningless bombs of current animated tickets, such as "Monsters vs Aliens" and the like. The rare Celtic musical score is effective to create a sense of fantasy through the film. OK, the story may be a bit low and a little ending. I would have liked to know more about the book Brendan and Aiden worked on. But the clear star of this film is obviously his amazing stylized work of art, based on a genuine Kelll's artwork.
