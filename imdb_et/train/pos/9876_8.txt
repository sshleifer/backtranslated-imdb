Presentation of Lily Mars is a real pleasant little movie that introduces the comedy skills of actress Judy Garland with her usual vocal moments. The plot is made up of Lily Mars's label after John Thornway for his big break. I think comedy is easy and there's nothing too heavy here. I recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
