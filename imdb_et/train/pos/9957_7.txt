This film is shockingly underestimated in the IMDbis. Like many movies, it's not Shawshank. But it is pretty good as a predictable dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to watch an 8-member female dancer for an hour and a half, if I think you like it. <br /> <br /> Based on IMDb ratings, I think this movie was approaching 250 and had "bombarded" with many 1, as happens with so many non-mobile movies, no special effects and no white or non-straightforward characters. <br /> <br /> This is an American film, but it is not a US film. The tips in Toronto are mostly fine, and some audiences may think it is entirely set in the US just because the final race takes place in the border town of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked music. I liked the dance (but not sure it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what I know). The characters were light on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree with the title. I don't remember anyone in the movie saying these words and it should have "s". (No, it's not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There is not much hate about this movie (and let's face it, 1 voice means you hated it), so I can only assume that this is an expression of hatred for people in this situation and is sad.
