Although this exhibition has been out of the air since 1973, I felt compelled to say a little bit after watching the DVD set borrowed in our library. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes it would be a small Sunday afternoon with friends to watch it in NBC on one of the few color TVs. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy history with not so many names and dates, but how it affects us today and how much is so deep that the most important actions of this time are based. Example: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world due to silver, got its name from "Old Virginny", who stumbled out of the sedan in the early years of the city, dropped and broke its whiskey bottle. <br /> <br /> Old Virginny did not want to waste this event, because precious liquid got into the dirt and decided to baptize "Virginia Town". The area became known as Comstock Lode, because the second character, Henry Comstock, was known as anyone wishing to jump all the claims, and the area became known as Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I just looked at an early episode about these two subjects. Other episodes dealt with Mark Twain's literary rise, while a territorial business reporter ... <br /> <br /> It was a healthy (and often educational) family life. As someone else pointed out, every episode is actually considered a movie in its right scripts and characters. One thing he wrote about was the proximity of Virginia City and Ponderosa. Indeed, to travel to Ponderosa (all of Lake North Tahoe), you should ride your horse about 3000 meters from the Spooner Summit to a high desert (3000-4000 feet) to Carson Valley, then to another 30-40 miles to Virginia. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Cartwrights sometimes has painful back ends that do it regularly. But every writer should have some room for maneuver for the truth.
