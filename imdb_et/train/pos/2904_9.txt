This film is Damian Szifrohn's second immersion after she has an excellent character study "El Fondo del Mar". With Tiempo De Valientes, he creates very well-made characters, far from prototypes and unprecedented chemistry between them. I've seen Sifron's talents so that they give every character lightly, but just enough to get us emotionally involved with them. His control over them is great, so he recreates the film with a great and broadly excellent polished script, the characters laughing and crying with a real mood and inviting the viewer to join their emotions and their development. <Br>> <br /> Spain takes over English, Buenos Aires urban landscape at night replaces the Hollywood kit and the assumption is as interesting as any other, so we have a movie that dares to compete against Hollywood machines. <br /> <br /> But I want you to see the movie mainly because I've never dealt with such pleasant characters. The script seems to fit perfectly with the actors and vice versa. I really believe in making a movie like this is in Argentina.
