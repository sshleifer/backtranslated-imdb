This movie is really hard. For this movie to be the same with you, this movie doesn't contain a lot of riveting story, nore does not want to know how it ends ... but I'm telling you something now ... I've never been so tense and jumped in my life! This movie will definitely give you jumps and excitement! To be fair, I looked at it almost at midnight, so I was sleepy anyway, so maybe it explains why I was jumping ... or maybe it's because this film is a success in that respect! Basically, this is a couple who loses their child in a tragic event. They decide to move and rent a cabin in the mountains ... they all look peaceful and peaceful until they have the first visitors (I think it's a sister of the main game and she brings her husband) ... at night she hears the noise ... checks it , and when things really go wrong ... they won't stay for another day and say to the couple that they should leave because nothing is right ... to short the short story in a short time ... they finally know what is this house has happened in recent years, and decides that it must be taken care of. <br /> <br /> That means he has a big budget, but please don't let it down. It's horrible, tense and very nervous! Just try :)
