The first was good and original. I wasn't a bad horror / comedy movie. So I heard about what was done and I had to watch it. <br /> <br /> What really changes the character of this movie's work and sometimes the smart script. A pretty good script for a person who wrote Final Destination movies and direction. Sometimes there are scenes that seem to be filmed with a home video camera with a grainy look. <br /> <br /> Great TV movie. It's worth renting and probably it is worth buying this nice feeling and seeing how Judd Nelson Stanley does what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest newcomers to look first before watching the sequel. You have an idea of ​​what Stanley is and get some history.
