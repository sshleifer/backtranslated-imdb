An excellent early musical film from Rene Clair as fun and witty as his quiet "Italian Straw Hat". Using sound in an expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced early music in America (the opera scene from A Night in Opera is heavily influenced by, for example, Le Million). If all the cinephiles would see (but not) and the Criterion DVD is just as good as you wanted. There are no tons of extras, but most I've seen DVDs are useless fluffy and Clair's interview on the disc is what I've never seen before. Get it when it's still around.
