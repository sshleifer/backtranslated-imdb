First of all, I have to say that I made a mistake when watching the films in order. I say unfortunately, because after the election 2, the election seems a little disappointing. Both films are in the form of a similar gangster epo. And while the election is an enjoyable cinema ... it's not just as good as it's sequel. <br /> <br /> In the first election session, the President will show two competitors; Big D and Lok. After some discussion between the "Uncle" of the scene, who should have the title of the chairman, they (almost unanimously) decide that Lok (Simon Yam) controls the triplets. Suffice it to say that it does not go very well with Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai), and Big D's two uncles are abducted to visit the election council to influence transposition. It has catastrophic consequences and triads are being driven out of war. Lok has decided to become chairman, but will not be official until he can "Dragon Head Baton", an important representative of the president's power. The current chairman, Whistle (Chung Wang), has hidden a baton somewhere in mainland China and racing can see who can get it back first. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is dedicated to Batoni's restoration. . Since both leaders are looking for it, they have to avoid the police and the opposite, leading to one lover's scene, which includes a decline called Jet (Nick Cheung), machetin, and many bad guys. Nick Cheung's presence is to pay attention to say at least ... I don't know if it influenced Director Johhnie in the second election because he passes on Jet's character queue. <br /> <br /> Although Nick Cheung condemns the scene, I must not leave the rest of the film participants. There is an excellent ensemble in the elections with well-thought out performances that are both fine and influential. Simon Yam is his usual glorious self-expression and the film is also useful for heavyweight HK actors such as Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and the undervalued Suet Lam. In fact, there are no weak links in operation and one can easily believe that they are looking at real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things for Johnnie To's eye camera is the choice. The film has some really eye-catching shots and it goes without saying that you know how to design your shots, because the viewer is treated with a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera layouts and corners. All of this makes the election a great-looking movie first and foremost. <br /> <br /> My film questions mainly arise from the size of the characters in the sample. It is a bit difficult to follow, because the film is so full of characters that are not an integral part of the plot. While the queue focuses more on two candidates, the first selection offers an electoral process as a whole, with many daughters, subordinates, and police officers offering outlaws. Perhaps the film would have worked better if it had been a little longer and more devoted to the internal functioning of the Triad, or if Director Johnnie To had eased and explained the necessary elements. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line - All in all, this is a wonderfully brutal film that has a great cast, a great direction and a peaceful punch. It's just a little more complicated than it was needed.
