Soap Opera about a small town wife (Kay Francis), who works in a local newspaper, plays a leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star of Broadway. When he arrives home to a famous actor who is a ham, a windbreaker and a female woman, he visits him in his room, dreaming that he gives tips to stardom - he pretends his lie is his "head", who enjoys him and has everything he needs but "experience" to become a big star. His wife discovers and strikes a guy, resulting in an unexpected death of an actor - leading to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a lifetime prison sentence for hubby. The next thing you know is that he's been on a trip to the Burlesque show one day, making it Broadway and making enough money to get his husband's freedom - all the time when his baby is sleeping in the trunk! <br /> <br /> This movie has a pretty interesting plot, maybe a little bit far, but very melodramatic (with a ton of melodramatic music to make sure it gets) - all * greatly * enhanced by Kay Francis's strong and emotional power - he just does this movie. Here is also a good role for Minna Gombell's "forty" older lady who works in burlesque and makes friends with Kay. It is worth noting, especially for Kay Francis fans.
