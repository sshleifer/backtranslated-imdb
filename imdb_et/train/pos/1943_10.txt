I was able to see this film twice at the Moving Picture Festival in Alabama in Birmingham in 2006. I liked it so much that I looked at it the second time they had self-screening. with a sensitive learning project. Of course, there is nothing wrong with such projects and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes I want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film. "Mainstream" is meant to be a film produced for national liberation - in other words, a movie that you would see in a regular cinema. in this movie everything is completely pro. There is usually nothing independent about this movie. As an aspiring leader, I've always been looking for movies that motivate me to stop and make my career harder. This is one of those movies. When I looked at Big Bad Swim, my level of motivation was incredible. I felt my adrenaline had been beaten. The reason I felt this was because I had the impression of all aspects of its production. I left the theater excited and ready to start writing this long exhibition project. When a movie makes me feel, I know it's really good. This is the first full-length project from Ishai Setton and I found that I wanted it to be my project. For me it is very rare. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It is beautifully nailed and directed and the casting is great. Paget Brewster is a very reliable and pleasant performance. He has his quality, charisma, which really takes you in and keeps you every time he is on the screen. He feels that you are personally a friend. It's a gift. I think the industry has really disappeared if it doesn't use its ability to act more often. Jeff Branson and Jess Weixler also made top jobs. I can't say enough good things about The Big Bad Swim. Looking forward to future projects from all its manufacturers.
