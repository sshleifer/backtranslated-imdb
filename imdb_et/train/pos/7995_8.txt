Here's a dirty, bad boy-revenge story that is relentless and harsh to Denzel Washington. He has three personalities: a lower-and-out-low-key-now drunk-former mercenary, then a loving father-type man with a little girl and then a brutal maniac looking for answers and revenge. <br /> The story tells us that Washington has hired a small American girl living in Mexico, where child abduction takes place on a regular basis (at least according to the film.) She gets to the child she is playing with. our day actor, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes to responsible men and not to anyone. Caution: This movie is not intended to be cunning. <br /> <br /> This is a stylish movie that is good and bad. I liked it, but many people found it too amazing for their taste, because camera work is something that can give you a headache. I thought it was suitable for a tough style and it was interesting to watch, but it is not for all tastes (shaky camera). <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, Christopher Walken is always interesting, which is not a characteristic of a minor role and many other fine players. <br /> <br /> The movie puts the foundation of emotions on everyone, but it works.
