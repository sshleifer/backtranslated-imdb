I've lost a count of how many reviews I've written on Slaughter High. I have read a lot of bad things and I am saying that this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame for his well-known suicide in a short time, and although it was his only film, he made it so big. At first, I didn't know anything about Simon before I read my suicide. Then I learned from www.IMDb.com, he was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1957. Simon may have played the most pathetic character a person knows, but in his real life he certainly had his strengths and weaknesses. He did good action, who can't agree? I always thought about how she felt in a naked movie. Must be at least embarrassing. I saw this movie for the first time in the sixth grade at the age of 12. I agree with some indicators, like a girl would not get a bath after the murder of a murderer and that there is no bath in high schools! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 years old at that time, was the only other star with any dignified actor, and unfortunately, Simon did not die in future films. His suicide is caused by a mystery and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. Making mathematics on your website will tell you that he was 29 when he was killing high. She looked like a teenager. I'll give this movie two thumbs, the best movie. Probably due to their terrible action, others did not make the film business famous. -Jacob Young
