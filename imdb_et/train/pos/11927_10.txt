I have to say that despite the fact that Angels in Outfield was a very good movie. I like that it always teaches children to give up and never give up because yes it can happen. Unlike other baseball films, this one particular film was faced with amazing special effects and a well-organized soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I liked this movie, it had some drawbacks like some irrelevant (ie, to the end when Ray Mitchell hits the homer, he doesn't step on the record and that's why it wouldn't be a score. But it's just nitpicking.) I have to say that I have this movie presence and the moral really impressed: just believe, don't give up.
