In 2002, there was no day when I wasn't scary. I felt that the film was dealing with a serious problem. <br /> <br /> It brought a lot of memories back because it was so realistic. <br /> <br /> Even today, I have nightmares for corn, and I can't even pass my life after fear. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, however, that the movie that I had been too close to this home would turn it off. <br /> <br /> For those who have never been attacked by an anti-sniper, watching this movie could educate them about how it seemed to be victims. <br /> <br /> This film teaches that we do not take life for granted or mix maize, believe me, i have been there and have scars <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, its amazing and educational
