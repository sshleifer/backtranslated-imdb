As everyone knows old enough, South Africa has long suffered from the hostile, racist oppression of apartheid, which was completely subjugated to the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in prison. After the murder, the reporter Donald Woods tried to get Biko's message to the world. <br /> <br /> In Cry Freedom, Woods (Kevin Kline) touches Biko's (Denzel Washington) friends before he is arrested for charges. When Woods tries to spread Biko's word, he and his family start to live in danger of being attacked and are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene that shows the police blaming the protesters. <br /> <br /> Like one of the two films (along with "A World Apart"), which contributed to stimulating the anti-apartheid movement, Cry Freedom appears to be the best work for all participants.
