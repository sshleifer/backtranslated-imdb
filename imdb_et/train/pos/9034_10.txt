This movie was absolutely BRILLIANT !! The performance of each of these films is great, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr Gyllenhaal has a huge film career if it is something. I thought Joe Johnston was a strange choice for the manager, because he's usually involved with big budget (Jumanji, children of Honey I). He pulls every scene with a thin class. My favorite scene was where Homer rides the bridge and looks out of the sky, as all his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these great, acting words and also his great budget, which is also great. WOVEN! involved in all masterpieces!
