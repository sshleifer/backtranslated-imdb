I've purchased certain movies on the disc, although the second level presentation wasn't an option. A certain company that I don't recognize here has posted several pan-scanning DVDs ("Clean and Sober", "Star 80" and this one to name just three!), What I don't think anyone wants to see in this compromised format. Some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others have only a 1.66: 1 ratio of their theatrical release. <br /> <br /> What I have on my chest is that "Deathtrap" was a spooky and strange enough fun picture. My only complaints are the tiny score (which is the f____g tool that is usually pulled out in the 18th century for films set in France?) And Dyan Cannon screams regularly. Wasn't his character asthmatic, who grabbed the inhaler when he was stressed? Small complaints, both. Disc benefits include the ability to go fast to overcome things you do not like. <br /> <br /> I never saw a staged version of "Deathtrap" so that these people play a big role in their career. Before Broadway tickets were paid for by hand and foot, the theater was more affordable for the average person. Now, anyone who pays less than a king of ransom to get live entertainment is unlikely to come up with a big hypothesis. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve were both big, lively specimens early in the 80s and it is an integral part of how we respond to their profession and overall image. They are definitely not men with books, who can't stop or retreat from the obstacle. These two are equally big because their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate deathtrap.
