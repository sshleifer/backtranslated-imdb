I saw it in a fine cinema where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The exhibition I was attending was a scramble for African-Americans, and it made an excellent social comment about the state of the race relationship in that country between the two groups. Basically, white people were laughing or laughing with funny bits - and there's a lot! - because they would be "black" smiling, while the black ones were quite quiet, because many could not laugh in front of the whites. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, being an Asian (and therefore not a member of either group), it was a great time for me to look at this rap culture and its satire of the ego / trappings / values ​​/ pseudophilosophy. The cast is talented and makes the images depicted in a great workplace. Songs are too funny to believe. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best pseudo-documentaries, including "Mighty Wind"
