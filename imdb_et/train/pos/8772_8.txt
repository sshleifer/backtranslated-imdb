Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay in the 40s and years. And I mean it positively, because I'm certainly not cool-angry. His films are just a simple quality entertainment, just as Raoul Walsh's films were on his days. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is a good quality entertainment. In addition to the first-rate director, it also has a first-class performance, with the main part being Errol Flynn, the regular leader of Raoul Walsh. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about how well boxing games came on the screen. They used some very dynamic camera work that really raised the boxing games and the exciting look, with the final game fighting with John L. Sullivan being the ultimate highlight. <br /> <br /> In the 40s and earlier biopsies, there were still very different biographies that have been made today. Modern biographies often respect their main subject and show their lives mainly from birth to death and everything, mostly emotional. The "old" biopsies were just the same as films that were not based on real real people, which also means that filmmakers often use the amount of creative freedom that has the main character of the person and the events that were his / her life. This film is not only a biography of the boxing legend, but also a beautiful image of the time when illegal barefoot struggle entered the modern box office. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn is doing an excellent job of representing the real life of the famous boxer James J. Corbett or Gentleman Jim. Not too many people knew this, but Flynn did some good deeds in the 40s, one of which is this movie. He also sees Fysicaly in top format. He also looks quite different, without having his trademark a small mustache in this film. The film also includes some actors supporting the fine and some fine actions. <br /> <br /> A great and fun movie that is really really real today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
