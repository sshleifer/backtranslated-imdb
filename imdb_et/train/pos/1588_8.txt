* What I like SPOILERS * Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) lives with her older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to prevent her father moving to Japan; but he does not know which side of it is the funny things that are happening to him now, and not only to him, but to his sister, his friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boy Henry (Michael McMillian), to crush Vince ( Nick Zano), Valerie boy Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then fireman, then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and another boss Peter (?) T in his body is a funny bone, skip it; if you only like delightful complex comedy, it's not for you; if you like a funny, sometimes touching show with two hot chicks who can drive (and nothing more than the fabulous "Mary Cherry" popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main pain), what the hell are you waiting for? Welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
