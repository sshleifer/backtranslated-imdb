This is the only full-length feature of the bridge world. I found the first 10 minutes a little slow, but after that the film is a completely professional description of bridge players and how they live. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very funny. I don't think a non-bridge player will get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some dresses are really beautiful, sorry that the movie is black and white - I can only imagine what they see in color. The way the media is portrayed is completely fun. There is no way to be on the bridge. <br /> <br /> See it as soon as possible and tell your friends about it.
