This film appears to be a grinder on the surface of a children's film that parents can regret watching for their mostly entertaining toddlers. The film seems to be mostly directed at children, but it does not end at that level. I was watching this movie for the first time as a small child and found it funny, fun and affectionate and not seen for several years. I looked at it recently at the age of 18 and found it to be almost as funny, but equally hearty and fun. This movie is underestimated and contains many real-life messages. This film is an inspiring search story that is still epic for children. I recommend this movie to every age.
