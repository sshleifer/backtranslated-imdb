girlfight uses a well-known formula as someone pointed out, but I've seen a lot of movies that don't do it well or that's not reliable. I believe that for a woman this is actually easier, and so the film seems to be more touched. and I think the viewer can see it. although it took 5 years to start boxing and sports, this is the film that gave me sparkle. <br /> <br /> So the plot is familiar / normal. participants are good. but the thoughts that it can create are, in my opinion, above average. it made me a big impression and I know I'm not the only one.
