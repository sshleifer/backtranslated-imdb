Before Cujo was fucking dog Lucky. In 1978, for the first time, a film "Devil Dog, Hell of Hell" was released on Halloween night. A story about a family who gets a new puppy (from a farmer who is just staying in the neighborhood where fruit and vegetables are sold) because their dog Skipper was killed. Everyone loves a new dog, but he has something strange. <br /> <br /> It is not long before Father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, the first blood) begins to notice. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, where the boys are, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) is different and her children are Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Hello Larry, Tuff- Turf) has also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He has decided to find out and do whatever he needs to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because Ike and Kim themselves have a darker side than what we saw on these witch mountain films. This is one of the many 70 horror films made from television that was really scary for a TV horror movie. The music was horrible and even the end I didn't say you thought. <br /> <br /> This movie also features Ken Kercheval (Dallas Cliff Barnes) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not stay away from the fucking movies remember "Race with the devil"?) <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
