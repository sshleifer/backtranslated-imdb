I'm not going to watch this show. But I'm glad I did. Its critics just can't get it! This is one of the most funny and fun things in the T.V now! Although the interviews were with ordinary people, they seemed useless; but put them in the mouths of animals and insects, and that is a laugh. I laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes. Pigs and mothers of nursing infants are invaluable. The man and the husband's birds talk about health problems and the male bird who, after the woman said, was constipated, broke me completely! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative example I've seen for a while! Hopefully this will be back next summer when this move is over.
