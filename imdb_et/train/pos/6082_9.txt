I've always enjoyed the classic versions of Kenneth Branaghi's Shakespeare, because he always does a great job, but in this movie, which raises the whole movie, there is nothing but "always-great-actor" Laurence Fishburne. Certainly he has made some bad choices in the film, although he is a great actor, but we have really given the real Othello: passion, intensity of jealousy, because it grows stronger with the well-portrayed paranoia of Fishburne, and finally we've got black Othello! <br /> <br /> I don't think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who could have given him sympathy / reluctance, love / hatred and not forget those hot eyes? Branagh is good, as always, but not at his top, Ir√©ne Jacobi Desdemona is pretty good, but a little bad, while Laurence Fishburne really raises it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Look at it.
