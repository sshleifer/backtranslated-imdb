I just looked at the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the Starz cable TV network. This is undoubtedly one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences! It crowns artists and creative talents in the San Francisco Bay area who are responsible for some of the best films. In addition to well-known artists, there are also segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel, and Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will appear on the DVD - it is necessary for any cinema history and brilliant filmmaking. If you are even against the movies and their creators, you will not be disappointed.
