to communicate in important things in life - like what is life, does it have meaning? - It is absolutely impossible. Of course, the possible answers to these questions are shown for each film (story), but communication requires direct consciousness. This happens when the mind's input transcends the "mind" of our mind, that is, our thoughts. Few leaders know how to communicate important things. Tarkovsky is one. His "Stalker" shows existing images, communicates with life as it shows itself, but comes to mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff are doing the same.
