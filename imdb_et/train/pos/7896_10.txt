This is a great example of the early talents of Bette Davis. Production is above average in 1936. I do not understand why the rights owners of this movie have not added it to the DVD. Owners, PLEASE PLEASE release it. I'd buy it right now. I haven't seen it on television for more than thirty years, but I remember it well.
