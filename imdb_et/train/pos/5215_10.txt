All I can say is the first season that drew my attention this season. I chose it because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story seemed promising ... I just looked at it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, true ... but it makes it more realistic. We should not go away from our reality, these things are happening right now. And there are experts who are trying to change things and do things better and who are laughing for their commitment. In fact, I don't feel like touching "Hollywood" ... and that makes it better. Claire and Richard both played a big role and deserve 10 of me.
