When I saw this movie, I was surprised that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should have been in theaters. I've seen many movies about rape, but it stands out. This film is a kind of realism that is very rare in films today, not to mention TV movies. This tells the story that I am sure it is very realistic for many small-scale rape victims today, and I found it very plausible (which is hard to find on other rape-focused films). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were fantastic in the parts they played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a tough reality. I enjoyed it very much.
