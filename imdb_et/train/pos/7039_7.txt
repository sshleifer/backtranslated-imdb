War Inc is a funny but strange movie. The actors are nice, the movie is nice, but I don't know how to describe the plot. I'll go to the plot later. This is a film with some strange election choices. In addition to John Cusack as a hit that we saw years ago in Grosse Point's blank, which I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff, who plays Russian pop star Yonica Babyya or something like that. His character is odd. There's a scene where he sticks the scorpion pants down. And hit Hauser (Cusack). Finally, there are two characters with a twist. That makes sense. <br /> <br /> This is the only election I go to. Because it's just strange. The whole movie is strange. But at times incredibly funny and I was never bored. Here are some of the best actors. Except Miss Duff. He's not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is a story about a man named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to some Middle Eastern cities to capture Omar Sheriif (not an actor). In an effort to deal with his personal problems, he must help the pop star wedding (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with the news reporter (playing Marisa Tomeii). But there is something about Popstar. Hauser is disgusting by her. There's a scene where she sings her song and after that she throws her up. <br /> <br /> The twist at the end of the movie shows why. The point of turning is that I did see it. But that doesn't matter. This is a strange, funny and fun comedy. I love most of the participants. So really, how would I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc: 3.5 / 5
