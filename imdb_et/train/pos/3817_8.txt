If you have had a drama in your life, whether your own or someone near you, this is a woman (but I think it may just be a man) painfully very real. It's a movie that you can't cope with your pain without knowing what to do to help you get through it. Obviously this is also a movie about not knowing how to help someone get close to their pain. This is a film that makes you realize that everything is alone in your suffering. This is a film that can push anyone over the edge ... that barely sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure I would recommend anyone to go to see this movie, especially someone close to it, but for me ... this is a film that puts things in perspective, showing true pain and is therefore vital to life. It makes you realize that hey, you or a close person has lived through the pain that hey, all the things you are now worried about are so little important
