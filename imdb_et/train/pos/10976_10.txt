That's why I love this website! I saw this movie on British television in the 1980s. Over the years, this is the one I have wanted to know more because it has stayed with me as one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life. There are hardly any key words to memorize here, watching the movie and a lot of information, including the fact that it is becoming Broadway music! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike the previous commentator, I don't remember this movie sad or exploiting. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter was remembered as a testimony of great power, honor, and dignity. Chronic, which can be thought of given their lives. Perhaps it is because I live in the UK, where in the life of an aging peace, the dignity is a definite language, where the scheme is often a good proof of the breed; I saw it as a rare and unique image of a huge spirit, deep and profound humor, whose totally fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it soul and respect. Sometimes I was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult'. Over the years, when I think it was in the plaque, it seemed the lightest, especially other than the one-time glorious and outstanding television experience. It was such a profoundly private revelation, it seems strange to think that it becomes as public as New York music. But maybe somewhere, the result is amused by the daughter. It is he who may have the laugh perhaps. (They made him before Jackie O music).
