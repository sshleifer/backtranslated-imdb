After being sent to jail for at least 10 years and refusing to give up and abandon her drugs, Jackie (Erica Gavin Russ Meyer's "Vixen" and "Beyond the Dolls Valley"), the last role of the film) must get used to living in a big dollhouse or at least try Jonathan Demme at this early stage. in the movie. Due to its natural character and mere traceability, I would also be one of his best films, directly in "The Silence of the Lambs" and "End in Mind", but as far as any of his other films. This juvenile classic class is just comic, buggy and fun enough to be amazingly good at innocent joy and fortunately ever going to the parody of women in prison. This ALMOST washed out the bad taste of "Philidelphia", a preaching preacher from my mouth. But the film is not without its subjugation ("an unpleasant show is a tremendous arrangement to sit through and go too long, Barbera Steele is unfortunately wasted, among other things, small things) But don't let those paws stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> My Class: B- <br /> <br /> DVDs: 5-minute Roger Corman Interview; Cast & crew Bios; Original Trailer; "Candy Stripe Nurses" (Nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (Nudity), & "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold and some others show skin
