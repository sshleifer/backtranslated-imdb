A number of American students and their tutor decide to visit Ireland's toughest part to explore ancient religious practices. Although they have repeatedly warned of the dangers that may deviate from the deserted road (the nasty Irish dude, natch), they do just that and end up with a family of external cannibals (their offspring) with their inner sides. the infamous Sawney Bean clan who, from the stupid plot of the film, took hold of Scotland and moved to Emerald Island). <br /> <br /> If you think porn stars and low budget horrors are automatically equal to tons of nudity and terrible action, think again: Evil Breed is full of adult letters, but in reality there is almost as much nudity that could be expected to be involved " by virtue of talent, and acting, albeit far from the Oscar, is not all bad (except for Ginger Lynn Allen, whom we know we can admire "French", but Irish is bad). <br /> <br /> An evil breed opens up in a brilliant style with pairs of immoral brutal killing: after a short canvas, the silicone-enhanced hottie is pulled out of the tent and torn in half; boy has cut his hands and feet and roasted spit. This is a very spooky start and good for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, things will start to fall seriously. twenty times just begging to become a cannibal czech, and they have a lot of time wasting some form of terrible wrong intimidation, a lot of blarney about murderous druid from local Irish Weirdo Gary (Simon Peacock) and, in the worst case, some sub-Scream, postmodern conversation about horror movie conventions ( how smart!). <br /> <br /> Then, as the film seems to never get better, director Christian Viel decides to get serious: the man gets a knife with a free sex-in-the-shower scene where it's cute blonde Gillian Leigh (NOT a porn star, but I'm sure there will be a career there if she wants it). After that, things quickly get better when the cannibals get into the meat dish, and the film becomes a real blood stream: Gary has a mascot that pulls his ass up (about a while!) And is exhausted in his gut; Ginger Lynn hitting the mutant; Jenna Jameson is open, eviscerated, and silicone breast implant is confused by cannibalism; a man gets decapitated with a hair wire; and Taylor Hayes is seen as a bloody, bruising and naked fetus between the legs (apparently caught and used as breeding). <br /> <br /> All this is so frightening that it sits on less interesting things and earns a final rating of 7/10 in the Evil breed. <br /> <br /> NB! Bringing a very restless production and studio led to the completion of the Christian Viel project. Re-shoots were made and gore was severely cut to release the US. The good news is that although the film does not flow as well as it is, and it is curious with a terrible ending, it seems that the UK DVD (the version under review) has remained relatively untouched as it is (Total only 13s) .
