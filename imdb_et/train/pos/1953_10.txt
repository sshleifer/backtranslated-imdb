Because this movie was based on a real story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off, it was just scary how real it really was! Action is what gave the film a great boost. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton was the main character, Patsy McCartl, who had two sons she adored. His performance is what made a real life story on the TV screen for life. It was very difficult to look at some scenes because they were so real what happens when a person depends on drugs. <br /> <br /> Just looking at this very loving mother, she's not gonna care. , but so true. I've known people who have undergone withdrawal, and it was very similar to what happened in this movie, what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought the director was very dangerous to make the film happen to this woman. But it did so well. I commend the director for making this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who has ever been addicted to drugs or just to learn what happens to you if you become dependent on them.
