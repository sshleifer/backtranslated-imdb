Think about Pierce Brosnan and you think you like, intelligent, intelligent James Bond. In this movie, Brosnan plays against - and has so much fun (just like the audience). It's a movie-hired assassin that interacts with friends ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with very good scenes (riveting, Brosnan's edge and a good, compatible "off" edge. Kinnear has some good features). My only horror is that Hope Davis, playing a oh-tolerant woman ("Can I see my weapon?") Doesn't appear more often: he could have been a wonderful foil for these men. /> This film is like a matador: it plays with the audience, "kills to kill". The end is awesome because of the story (with positive morals!) - this is a frenzied, frenzied and fun movie that deserves a wide audience.
