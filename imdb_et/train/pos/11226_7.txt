Star Trek Hidden Frontier surprises you in many ways. First, it is a series of fans that are only available on the web, and it mainly includes friends and neighbors who have computer programs and home video cameras, and sewing machines like Mickey & Judy once did. This is definitely friends and neighbors. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you have ever seen, or the youngest, or the thinnest? some of them stumble through the lines as they go on marble? some of them are thick or just don't look good at first glance, so it's almost impossible to understand one single word they say. However, you have to admit that all these friends and neighbors have put together, it's really fun to watch. Yes, part of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it is a bit strange (though somewhat cool), looking at two Starfleet men's kisses (although some kissing scenes seem to be on and on.) Yes, you get a little bit when they clearly quote from ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear about Galaxy Quest, which is played at the beginning and end of each show. Okay. We get it through. Why? Graphics are primary. Better than just about everything you've seen. And sometimes a few exhibitions or two examples stand out? some of them are actually tears. <br /> <br /> The hidden border is complete innocent pleasure in every sense? but you must give people the credit where the credit is to be paid. A lot of effort is put on this size of production. People, kits, costumes, graphics? this is a great effort for many people. We look back, and we thank them.
