First of all, I hadn't seen "The Blob" because I was 7 or 8 years old and looking at it as an adult was an incredible experience. Pages could also be written about its impact on horror films even today. Even more could be written on its social subtext with the fear of 50s teenagers. But this simple little story of the interplanetary horror is still a damn good scary movie, if you let it do. But "The Blob" packs in some really frightening moments when a child's band monitors an unstoppable creature if the adults don't believe them. In fact, there are even some funny moments in the candy world. And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the paper-based story that we are really catching up with the viewers for a moment and believe in him. here is much more love than the eye.
