I just came back to preview this great sci-fi movie. Its style is ultimately unique and very well done. It's filmed with real actors, but has become a black and white comic style you've never seen before. It goes a step further than Sin City, and it goes well. It is a successful combination of French comics and film culture. Blade Runner is reminded of the story and mood, and if you liked it, you liked it. The story is smart, never boring and has some nice little twists. This movie is indispensable for any cinephile, except perhaps those who definitely don't like sci-fi or b & w.
