It's almost in the same league as "The Black Cat," although I would give 9 instead of 9. This is a really laudable film that is so badly underestimated that it is amazing! <br /> <br /> "Invisible Ray" is part of horror, part of the drama and certainly part of sci-fi. For a film made in 1936, sci-fi elements were much better than their time. A mixture of fear, drama and sci-fi is the perfect mix, while the participation of Lugos and Karloff cannot be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer captures many elements that James Whale did so often. What I say is that this film is shameful and well photographed. The style, with gargoyles outside Lugosi's space, is a great example of mood. This is a special moment in the movie, which has unfortunately disappeared in today's genre films. <br /> <br /> Like Black Cat and Lost Souls, I don't understand why this movie is not yet published on DVD. If you think some spam that has already been transferred to a DVD is much more confusing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie if you have a chance. Once released on a DVD, grasp it quickly and place it in a respectable place on your DVD library.
