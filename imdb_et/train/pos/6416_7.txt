Men's Glory Stars Gooding Jr., like Carl Brashear, a real-life naval diver, accused a man's navy of becoming the first African-American naval diver. Sometimes there was one man beside him and sometimes his opponent, whom Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). On Sunday, in many ways that were pushed, they got deeper and helped Carl get the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His depiction here is just as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington was in the hurricane. Through each scene we see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dreams. We see the struggle within him when he starts his father's pride. I also loved how the director created and highlighted some of the main scenes of diving. Brashear's contact with a submarine during a rescue mission is a cardiac arrest and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I saw should stand in the back pain. Cuban and DeNiro characters are very complicated and exciting. What makes you a little sad when they hold such two-dimensional support symbols behind the head. Evil leader Cmdr. Hanks, a Sunday spouse (Charlize Theron), an eccentric diving school colonel (Hal Holbrook) and Cuban love interest are the characters I didn't find very deep. What could have made these characters more important and effective was a little more time to develop them. Why was the Colonel always in his tower? How does a Sunday woman get so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is this. What happened to Carl Brashear? I mean, if this film crowns the life of this man, wouldn't his wedding be an important event? Maybe it's me. But men of honor are the perfect example of the triumph and the belief surrounded by the human spirit. This film inspires and feels in the fight of this man. I believe this powerful story was spoken. My hat goes to Carl Brashear. I admire your strength. <br /> <br />
