I saw the movie and really couldn't stop my tears. His tragedy is that India has no such leaders after freedom, who dares to do justice to their children if they do not behave properly. In the present generation, politicians bring their children into politics without measuring their calibration and skills. Gandhi Dialogue "What kind of society do we want to create with such people (Harilali)?" No wonder this is a dream that India has hardly any member of this or next generation. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that â€œin 50 years, it would not have been believed that such a person was a body, soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) had ever lived in that country. I would like to sincerely congratulate Lot's Anil for the capor, Feroze khan and all the actors / actors of the film for this great movie about a big man and his relationship with his son. All fathers and sons should watch this movie once and learn about both roles.
