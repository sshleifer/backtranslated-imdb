This movie is one I highly recommend. It's about a boyfriend, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), who has been wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake. There he is forced to dig 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter. There he meets the other camp's sons (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-ray and Zigzag). They all dig, not "build", but find that Kate Barlow's fortune is forbidden. Throughout the film (and the book), Stanley learns more about the past, about himself and more about digging holes. I give this movie 9.5 because I'm very picky when it comes to movies with movies (I want the movie to follow the book exactly). But still it was really good.
