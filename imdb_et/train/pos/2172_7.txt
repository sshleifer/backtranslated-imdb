"Mad Dog" Earle is back with his sad sack minor Marie and this striking football Velma. So is Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even Landscape Chewing Gum. The only thing missing is the good reason why Raoul Walsh's High Sierra is being rebuilt 14 years later, without thinking through a row or frame, and doing it with talent in a significant step or on two ladders below the original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, Humphrey Bogart, we get Jack Palance, East Lupino for Shelley Winters, etc.). The only change is that this time is Warnercolor instead of black and white; Unfortunately, there are those who would think of this improvement. <br /> <br /> Am I killing thousands of times can be unnecessary? and worse? but at least it is not travesty; the story still works independently. Earle (Palance), a fresh out pencil near Chicago, rides west to guide the great work of masterminded troubled kingpin Lon Chaney, Jr. knock after the mountain area. On the route he hits almost with the Oakies family when he strikes his grandchild; firing takes place even when he discovers that he is flat. Arriving in cabins where the rest of the gang holes, he finds each other's jaws for both amateur and winter, who throws himself at him (like the pooch). The time of Lance, while they call the in-house person, offers Palance (winter sir) to pay for an operation that heals a girl's deformation, a rebound gesture. Then the surgical blow to the resort becomes bruising. On the lamella, Palance moves above Cold Sierra .... <br /> <br /> This is a sufficiently absorbing story that is expertly executed, devoid of any distinctive character from Walsh and his performance, made for him in 1941. this role and Sam Spade's role as Malta Falcon became a star. And one last, heretic remark: These mountains look beautiful. <br /> <br />
