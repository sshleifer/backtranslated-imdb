Caring for Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE. <br /> <br /> Keeping your blood through our veins is a responsible HEMO THE Magnificent. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, AT&T and Bell Science informed Hollywood's famous director Frank Capra to create a series of CBS television science films to educate the public about the universe around them. So far away from the young black and white fodder crops that so often displaced young scientists, Capra's films would have been taught and entertained by live scripts and eye-catching visual images shown in Technicolor. Four Movies - OUR MR. DAY (1956), COSMETIC RAY TREATMENT (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), UNCHAINED GODDESS (1958) - quickly received schoolhouse favorites where they were shown endlessly in 16mm format. <br /> <br The star of the series was dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), a suitable English professor at the University of Southern California. This obvious educator has proved to be a perfect film teacher, sometimes giving the audience complex facts in a way that never made them boring or boring. Dr Baxter, who won the Peabody Award for his achievements, continued to produce high-quality guides after the Capra Quartet. <br /> <br /> The HEMO THE Magnificent, made, written and directed by Capra, is linked to the story of the human heart and circulatory system, using animation and gentle humor. Film star Richard Richard Carlson appears as a fictionist, energetically helping dr. Talk to Baxter about Hemo's story. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers are familiar with Sterling Holloway's part of the television team and Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc's voice, June Foray & Pinto Colvig as a variety of cartoon characters, all unredited. <br /> <br /> A dedicated letter that starts with a movie is completely in line with the production tonal.
