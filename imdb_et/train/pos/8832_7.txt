"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after the famous American film star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Five are dedicated friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything from Americans. <br /> <br /> The very close relationships between teenagers are very bad and eventually sacrificed ready to help one of them fall into unexpected difficulties. After the change of Communist policy, they go their way and reunite in 1985 (a year before the film was made). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. Subtitles in one thing were difficult. There were several dialogues at the beginning, which had no subtitles at all. Maybe I needed this speed of conversation, but I was not always able to read the text or swallow the scene, which did not always allow me to understand what kind of character was involved. I watched a movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood streptomycin getting sick for a relative. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslav age-class film effectively communicated the unknown, idealism and strong and loyal ties of teenagers with each other. It is a major postponement and it was intriguing, keeping me away until the end of those who were cast in 1953, and what really happened. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate it from 7 out of 10 and would like to see other films by director Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
