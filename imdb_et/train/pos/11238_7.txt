Hidden Frontier is a Star Trek world fan that is shown. The story comes after Voyager has returned from the Delta Quadrant. It has some official Star Trek exhibitions, but most of them are original. The exhibition will take place at the star of Deep Space 12 and on many spacecraft, giving him the chance to have no official exhibitions. Characters have the opportunity to rise in a hierarchy that is not just an exhibition of one ship. The exhibition has a good animation of the spacecraft computer, but it works in front of the green screen and it gives the actors a green glow. Not all actors are equally good, but most of them are good. Episodes are characteristic and characters develop during many episodes. It's a bit more like in Babylon 5 than in most of the official Star Trek performances. Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series have diminished from use. All in all, I enjoyed watching it.
