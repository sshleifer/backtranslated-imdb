Probably the best film ever made. Rich color, superb sets, incredible on-site Miklos Rosza's musical result, perfect for every scene and mood. Action is also excellent so that it could have been rigid and violent on the lesser hand, but here the poetic dialogue is insecure, sensitively spoken (humor is also subtle and pleasant). <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, Spielberg and Lucas were amazed. With The Four Feathers (1939), one of the two best films released by Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the best films ever made. <br /> <br /> True, convincing classic!
