A typical melodrama and suitable food for this period (mid-1950s). Rock Hudson, who is always in love, plays his usual role in stereotypes, but while Gamis, made in the same year when his material and co-stars (Taylor & Dean) were above average, he is just not good enough in this movie to raise the caliber beyond how difficult it is to be rich and happy. Self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, who ran through a movie in a drunken stupor and Dorothy Malone, playing a vampish poor little wealthy girl from above) reaches the losers, and Hudson gets Bacall - who is more of a wood in terms of not having enough character or mindset to he goes. Paraphrasing Oscar Wilde, a happy and unhappy accident, is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested in the fact that the film is based on a real stage that confirmed the plot. Like other period films, homosexuality hides in heterosexual conditions. Perhaps the film could be rebuilt: Stack's character would be more real when he was hiding homosexual feelings for Mitch when he married. Far away from heaven, Todd Haynes has greatly improved everything that heaven promises, including Sirk. Maybe Haynes could write to the wind and give us a really memorable movie.
