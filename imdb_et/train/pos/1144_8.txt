In 1955, British comedy called Simon and Laura with Peter Finch and excellent Kay Kendall. To date, this is one of the best examples of British comedy and, more specifically, how television systems become so popular. It was and is also a great example of a self-referencing cinema. <br /> <br /> So Soapdish, a movie I didn't hear a few nights before, got it late on TV. First of all, I was a bit suspicious just because comedy is as hard as you know. <br /> <br /> But I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch very precise satire on American television. In fact, it has been a while since I laughed so heartily. So, if you like satire, I would recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> Key actors? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty? just do a great job, revealing how blunt and low intervention is. When I looked at it, I thought myself: how much does this bitchiness actually live? This means that if the participants ever have a real life? For example, as you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was known to hide his real person behind many characters, so no one really knew the person. So when I looked at Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot, playing Maggie, I was thinking again about this earlier British movie, where Kay Kendall played Laura playing in a TV community that was in conflict with Peter Finch ... <br /> <br /> don't know that some participants have nerve interruptions? And that feeling crystallized when Celeste finally came into contact with her daughter (Lori, Elizabeth Shue), and at an emotional moment she repeats her fictional patterns she used in her earlier episode of her daily soap when she hit her fancy daughter. like that! Are you confused? Well, it's not all that, but dialogue is stunning for originality, comedy, bitchines, anger, misery, doubleism and even ... love. <br /> <br /> Story? Well, there are many stories in this movie that are all intertwined and all come together at the end (of course, but not like Robert Altman's movie, okay!), And not all of them are definitely resolved. Isn't life so that way? The tempo is almost frenetic, and you really need to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight and fine jokes. Spend 97 minutes of your life and see it; you will not regret the use of time. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast works well, though I've never brought much to Whoop Goldberg. Perhaps the most entertaining exchanges between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and for my money the latter steals scenes from others, he gets my voice as an outstanding player. I'm not doing you, he's giving the slut a brand new face ...
