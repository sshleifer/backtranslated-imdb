It's sad that this movie is the top that should be at least 250 best movies. This is still the best action ever done. Today's Action Movies Are Badly Made Participants and CEOs do not do how to fight it and do the tricks correctly. only some do not how to do it mainly from hong kong like Jackie Chan. Stunts are so clever and wild, I don't think we'll see forever. To begin with, where Chan and his team are riding behind a hill town is just amazing. The ultimate martial arts are the best martial arts I've ever put on a movie. The glass end of the Jackie bursting end stunt was very painful.
