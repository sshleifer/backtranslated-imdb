When the US entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to drop propaganda films. The LITTLE American is probably the best because he celebrates Mary Pickford. Late because of war, because both men are coloring. <br /> <br /> When Pickford sails by the Germans (think Lusitania) because it carries ammunition, Pickford is a great place to stand on the lifeboat and punish the German commander. Later, of course, he runs in both Holt and Hatton when he is held in prison. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille offers in this movie Pickford and Holt travels through a bombed village. They pass through a destroyed church, of which there is only one wall. There is a very large cross against the wall. Standing and guarding the walls stand together, but the figure of Jesus stops in the air. This is a very surreal moment on a movie that is otherwise very simple and untrue. <br /> <br /> Pickford is always happy to watch. He was always a very natural actor who prevented many other actors of the day. She is also very beautiful. Holt is very good in the role of a leading person here. Hatton is OK. The names of the "extra" parts are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> Not a great movie, but interesting to see US propaganda at work.
