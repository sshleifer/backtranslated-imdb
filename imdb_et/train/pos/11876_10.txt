Ya know when we look at this Brian DePalma movie today, I'm sure there has been criticism of how it is. Also about violence. When I looked at this movie for VHS when I was 20, I thought it was also violent and sharp. But I didn't get it. <br /> <br /> A couple of decades goes by and man, how do I know how much I didn't get this movie! This is a remake of an excellent movie that was back in the 1930s. How can you become a classic? Ya is not. But you are talking about the story that has been carried out today in the eyes of 'new immigrants' over the decade of most greed, over the 80s. DePalma, Stone and Gang are an ambitious, annoying and terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Yes .... Disco was dying and New Wave / Punk took over, but these Cuban immigrants had to make a new home in Florida couldn't tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted, but how to get it ???? For these immigrants, there was only one way to get it to Florida where they had a lot of money and money to take over the empire of drugs. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was fantastic for me as Tony Montana, the "little train that could". What an amazing way to watch your sign in America: fight, kill, steal. wrong, deceive everyone to get - "money, women and power." <br /> <br /> What Tony saw as an American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted it, he wanted to live, and he didn't see anything wrong in his circle, how he went. Tony Montana's proficiency in English was heavily saturated with "f", but what did you expect Emily Post to finish her school and her co-authors' school? See how they see CAME in America, what they knew they had encountered. So Tony and his team decided to "be everything they can be in America." It was all about power. Tony Montana would and did to achieve it ... all his violent, lying, stealing, curved, stealing glory. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that was personal to the 1980s is money laundering. Tony's team brings money to the bank. Were Tony and his team caregivers? In clubs where he spent and drank? No. Money was money and you get the money. Tony lived high. He and his beautiful blonde American trophy, which he married, played well with Michelle Pfieffer. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montana came to power, he discovered he was really sad. He has been attacked by a suspect, he is a drug addict, he is paranoid, surrounded by those who want to take him with a bloody takeover, his trophy with a 80 American blonde drug addict whom he discovers is clean, he needs to keep his empire because ... he goes down. And he goes into a terrible violent fashion, but I ask again what are you waiting for? <br /> <br /> This is the 1980's main film that tells a closed story about how some American dreams are misunderstood ... obsession. It's violent, bloody, too ... but it drives the point to a disturbing home. Not all of the Cubans thrown out of Cuba who landed in the 80s in Florida were like Tony Montana. Leave me alone. But displaying the 1980s disaster emphasized greed and money as the only measures in the US to be "someone" and have power, this tool was taken by those poor characters and their lives in America. /> Do you wonder - has anything learned since then?
