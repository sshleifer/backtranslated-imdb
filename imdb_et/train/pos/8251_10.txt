And this one is me. And not just me, as I see here when leaving IMDbis or theater. Why did people love it? It's obvious: everyone knows zombies to date (at least Horror's fans from the heart and other "Dawn of the Dead" revival or Resident Evil movies, etc.) <br /> <br /> Or at least they thought they knew all zombies ... this is until this movie came. And you can see the zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror film, although it contains some violent scenes, but is more of a comedy. Satire is accurate. And it never stops steam! That's why I rated it so high. Reasonable is amazing, the actor is great and the script has no (obvious) errors. On the contrary: it is a pearl and if you are just a little interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you don't like them, look at it! Because it's a great (comedy) movie!
