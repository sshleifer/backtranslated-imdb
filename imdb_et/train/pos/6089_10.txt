OK, I appreciated it just a bit to compensate for at least one of these terrible reviews. But I enjoyed it. I didn't laugh out loud, but he kept my interest and pulled me without falling off at some point. The story was built. Yes, you knew it would be a happy ending - this genre always works. In the meantime, it was a visual disorder that you could disappear, so when you look. Stiller and Black once again delivered the expertise. Good team. They should work more together. Don't know it's a cult class, but it was definitely a fun ride. Not as good as what is TP or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, but what is it? You still have to go a bit away to get this movie and watch it.
