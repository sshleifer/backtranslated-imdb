This Columbo episode is probably more mentioned by the director Steven Spielberg as one of his early films. This should be seen as the role of Jack Cassidy as a murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear later in Columbos. After all, Columbo plays Jack Cassidy in his game. He is a mysterious writer who prints for a perfect murder. After the first murder, his next victim would be a disturbing owner / widow of general merchandise, who would blackmail him. Instead of losing more money, he kills him. It is very fun to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk is familiar because Columbo makes him observable after being repeatedly reviewed over the years. What television today forgets about the success of years is that people want to watch these shows over and over if they like. It does not mean who does it, how and why, it is Columbo's acquaintance and its enjoyment, which is highly appreciated like me.
