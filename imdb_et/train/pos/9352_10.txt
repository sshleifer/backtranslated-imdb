Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It looks like a story of disappearing when it is actually a story of being alone. Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. <br /> <br /> The character of Cheadles Johnson reflected the character of Sandler opposite Fineman. When Johnson knew his blessings, Fineman tried to forget his life in the same perspective. The leg is a great addition to the cast and Sandler pulls the tears. Cheadle played a comic role and was Sandler's great supporter. <br /> <br /> I see Oscars somewhere here. Very fine film. If you've ever lost and felt alone, this movie confirms you're not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
