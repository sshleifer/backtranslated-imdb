After a short sight of "Batman Dead End" I didn't know what to expect from the best in the world. Of course, Superman and Batman. In all of the best comic books in my world, they are a team. <br /> <br /> After you have seen this 3 and a half minute trailer, it made me want someone to make the world a fan of the real, if not a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, some Superman things were joyful, but movie houses are always theaters, giving you all aspects of a particular product. It looks like it needs a complete product. <br /> <br /> A relative other than the director, Sandy Collera, who plays the painful poor Perry White, was not known to most of the participants. When the actual film was made, the actors are accused of filming the film, although I believe that Nina Kaczorowski would be a good Lois Lane, especially if a close-to-face dialogue is given. <br /> <br /> It is good to see that Clark Bartram is wearing Dead's Batman costume, but it should be upgraded a little bit and not be with the 80's Batman of the 80s. Her behavior is similar to Batman, but I still don't know if the white contact lenses are valid instead of just letting their eyes show on the mask. I believe that the goal was to get it for comic book and film man. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can't play Superman. He's standing with his face in the face, which just says, "hit me." And the line delivery seems to be a problem with him. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, I would like to see a complete story and movie based on this brilliant work. There was a rumor about the best movie in the world, and that might be the right addition to the script. I hope that more will be done.
