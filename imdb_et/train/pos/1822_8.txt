An unforgettable masterpiece from Nimhi and the creator of Earth's secret before that, it was a very touching bittersweet comic. I remember it very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a bit in the dark, the dog that escaped from the nail and died by the old friend comes to heaven and comes back. But it becomes sweet when she is a friend with an orphan girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were somewhat intimidating, unlike other caricatures, like Charlie's dream, but everything else was okay and the songs were fair. The memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love this man, ahehehe. And by the revenge of Judith Bars jaw, can God rest his soul, a poor girl, he does not deserve to die, but he is now in heaven, all good people go to heaven. In general, this is a very good animated film that is classic enough for Don Bluth to put anime and Disney shame. Recommended for the whole family. And you know, if you have this original video, you will find a very important and special message after the movie, Dom DeLuise, I have to love this guy, ahehehe.
