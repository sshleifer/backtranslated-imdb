Inventive, suspending exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that poses a tough challenge, in two rooms. Not entirely successful, but tense, surprising and well-behaved. Could you find a movie that resembles a little SAW? two guys in the room trapped and against each other? but unlike this movie, he dares to stay with his premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the cinema. It's like watching a laboratory test. Some may find a closed temporary annoying, but this reviewer found it tempting. The sound and images of the film are amazingly well realized. This is definitely a good movie to use to show you a good home video system. Just the right late night film festival, if the person is paranoid. He certainly kept the night awake.
