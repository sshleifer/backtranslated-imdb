This is a pretty OK movie ... yes some parts are flat and exceptionally comfortable, and the movie doesn't justify a big star (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, there was an impressive actor Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he first meets Amitabh character, I thought that a man who can only look at AB will continue to starve and not say the word and is still strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he has once again proved himself worthy of being second to Sarkaris, AB. This guy should get more roles, he's brilliant. a little too easy. And the little love corner he shared "what-his-face" was completely unnecessary. But he's a pretty good actor (as seen in the DCH), Sunjay Dutt is always cool to watch. and AB ... what can I say. I don't know if I'm my biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete on the ground. such as the "Great Escape" and "Bridge on the Kwai River".
