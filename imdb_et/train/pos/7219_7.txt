Unlike the Tinseltown version of HELLO, DOLLY !, Jay Presson could not wait to adjust the screen of the Broadway Thriller hit by Allen Ira Levin until it was in production before putting it on the silver screen, so the manufacturers wisely took advantage of its length on the White Route! Movie opening and closing scenes are shot at New York's intimate Music Box Theater, where DEATHTRAP played for nearly five years. Even in the final fadeout of the movie theater, there is an example of the famous logo. (Although marketeers decided to go for a movie with a Rubik's cube icon.) At the moment, DEATHTRAP looks as fresh and invented as ever with a low-cost DVD. The cast is just right (better than their counterparts) and the scouts of the location should be praised for finding the right spooky house for our "one room, two action thriller" that took place. Opened in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director Sidney Lumet wisely marks every new material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves Levin's evil center alone. <br /> <br /> The last scene in the movie is a big Hollywood departure from the boards and a little undermining Levin's plot points starting with [Helga (about dagger): "Does another woman use the game."]. Like Robert Altman's "PLAYER" player, our new finale again helps to flip the movie and shame the stage, style, screen and (could it be) between real life!
