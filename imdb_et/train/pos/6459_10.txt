Back to the roots "as it is in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes are undermining the message that calls all hearts. We've seen it twice in the last seat-packed cinema: I love pure and joyous choir music that is simple but full of power when everyone finds their inner tone. <br /> <br /> Denmark wants to listen to and listen to their lives that are now empty and ready for their new home when they have collapsed on stage. Simple, warm and harsh people in the North. <br /> <br /> He will win hearts with music and will be able to love and be unconditionally loved. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it if you're normalized to Hollywood. This stuff doesn't contain extras, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
