Samuel Fuller's uprising on the South Street is anomalous: a "Red Fear" film that has no hysteria, in which Communist danger is nothing but McGuffin, which lights up the plot. Pocket money Richard Widmark releases an open woman, Jean Peters, from a purse containing a microfilm; it is not known to any of them that he has important secrets for the Cold War. Peters, as it happens, was under the supervision of FBI agents, who are not used for theft when the man who runs him cries Richard Kiley. For downloading a precious film, both sides use Thelma Ritter, a street assistant who is always bright and wants to sell what he hears. <br /> <br /> Fuller manages a rich pace and tonic story that turns into a race against the rising clock of cruelty. From sub-metal to water, Manhattan at midnight sweats a gloss that is almost sharp. The scenes of love between Peters and Widmark are becoming an unstable confusion in the confusion and offer, and they have become "Again," a song that Ida Lupino introduced at Road House as well as starring Widmark. This pace slows down from Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene - among the most dirty vignettes, and some sentimental film of a helage-oasis. This is the only work of the writer / director Fuller within the strictest limits of the noir cycle; his later American pathological studies (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A.) have never brought about a synthesis that corresponds to Pickup on South Street.
