The film comes between the tension between son and father. <br /> <br /> A great dialogue, a lovely landscape and a great acting is a great way to introduce bulbs that hold the layers back. <Br /> <br /> Basic questions about parents, communication, and masculinity are being studied indirectly. <br /> <br /> In funny form, the curtain retracts, the masks slip away and the truths are open. > <br /> All this takes place in the middle of the road travel format. The background is the early autumn of the state of New York, as the trees change. WOW!
