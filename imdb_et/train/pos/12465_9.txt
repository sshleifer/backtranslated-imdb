I strongly recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Library Award in 1978 and is very engaging (no red). It's not too hard to read for those who don't read often, so don't be afraid! The book seems to capture the passion for relationships more than the meaning of film and film after reading the book. Having grown up in Melbourne, I can really touch this book and the movie. Very few Australian female writers were in the 70s, so very little about the lifestyle of an Australian city town with that age or class. This is a valuable history of Melbourne. It is a shame that it has been documented as 80's soft porn movies. It is far from being, and as the other reviewer has mentioned, do not read the DVD jacket, it does not mean what the film is about. Those who rent a movie based on this description are disappointed. Remember, this movie was made in 1982, so don't wait for Hollywood to dramatize that they seem to be engaging these days. That's what I like. It's also a great vision for Noni Hazlehurst in this role, it's just awesome when Nora is, and it's nice to see how she really works because if you're close to my age, you will remember her best for her playgrounds and better homes and gardens. Who knew he was hiding this talent? This film gives her a whole new impression. Classic Australian Story!
