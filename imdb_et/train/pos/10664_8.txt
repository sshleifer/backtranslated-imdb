Does anyone shout joy when they watch this movie? I love it! One of my top ten films. It just makes me feel. I look at the number of the closing process with all the majority members over and over again! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is a film, IMHO! I didn't see this game, but I get angry when I read comments saying the game was better than a movie. These two are like apples and oranges. The film making process rarely gives the final product that is faithful to the original work. I believe it is only because of the fear of public alienation that many of the well-known screen works will not change any more than they are. It's a very good movie, it's very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
