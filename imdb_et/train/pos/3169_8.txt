I rented it a few years ago, there was only VHS in the video store. Browsing the video hit this step (you know where the box covers use the same successful font and color schemes). I didn't know what to expect besides what was printed. The first thing I watched while watching was "what the wrongs are wrong?" - Probably there was no duplication of dialogue. The words repeated, so I finished munching, which I had to pay more attention to because there is no Shakespeare here! The story is simple enough, the boy meets the girl, etc. What made me humorous and affectionate did not seem to make people in the film seem like caricatures, but rather as non-actors who temporarily include their actual jobs (uniforms). Everywhere, you get to know what the filmmaker is after, then look for cheap humor (people who harm their enemies using vulgarity would not hurt the market. There was something fair. If they had a bigger budget, it would have been better what i'm sure they are weighing every day, but they went on and did it. "Indy" is thrown around as it is in the genre.
