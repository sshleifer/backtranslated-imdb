The only reason I didn't give this 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus, extras, etc. But if you ever dream of doing something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream doesn't let anyone or anything stop. It's one of the most life-long movies I've ever seen. And magical. The action is great, the plot serves the purpose and the opening order is fantastic. This is one of the films the "cult" status used to be. I've recommended this movie to all my friends. Some love it, some can't stop it. When I think or feel something is impossible, I think of Alan Arkin's role in this film. He would certainly like to make more movies.
