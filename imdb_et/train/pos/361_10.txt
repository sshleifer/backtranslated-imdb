As I said at the top, the four stars are not enough. This is one of the best films I've seen in almost 17 years. For people who do not really know or understand it, you should not express your artistic appreciation or be brief. <br /> <br /> Even though I haven't seen all my movies yet, I have to say it's Spielberg at his top. It's pretty sad to see such big films like "The Color Purple" coming too often, because I think we all desperately need first-class movie entertainment in these difficult times. Such films are more than just movies; they are works of art that need to be more appreciated. <br /> <br /> The idea that it was assigned to 11 Oscar (even the best picture of the year) and did not get one trophy is a sign of how sometimes it can be dark and stupid for Hollywood. Spielberg wasn't even the best director! It should have swept the Oscars this year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how unfair life is for some people. <br /> <br /> If only movies were still good.
