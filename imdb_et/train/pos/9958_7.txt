I look at them all. <br /> <br /> It's no better than amazing (_Strictly Ballroom_, _Shall we dance? _ (Japanese version), but it's completely respectable and pleasantly different. <br /> <br /> I am an English teacher and I think some of these reviews have some ignorance about language, for example: "The name should not shout." How it moves. "Because movie titles ignore grammar?" <br /> <br /> No Caribbean English Grammar something inaccurate.It's not just Canada's standard English grammar. Comments on the dialogue seem to me unsuccessful. The speaker, so I just thought I would have difficulty understanding it all, it wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different taste than others the same movies I saw were so American. <br /> <br /> I loved that this movie was set in Toronto and I would like it to be even clearer that the heroine was so atypically cast. I liked the character of a motivated mother. I felt that many of the film-related issues were more specific to dance films. <br /> <br /> To sum up, if you want dance movies, it is decent. If you have a question about the English grammar, then your narrow mind may be to enjoy this movie.
