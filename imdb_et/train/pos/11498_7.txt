The "Kolchak: The Night Stalker" is an enormously entertaining TV series where the resurrected (and sometimes extraterrestrial) power is repeatedly struggling with a deadly struggle, repetitive, sarcastic, forty-something. Based on a very popular Kolchak television film, this series quickly died in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but still retains a strong cult today. But can an average contemporary viewer sue Kolchak and his weekly collision with Undead? <br /> <br /> It's really a difficult question to answer fairly. The detectors of this series claim that it is formally dated and hopelessly dated. On the other hand, fans argue that it is wisely written, well-behaved and sometimes truly spooky. And me? I have a leg in both camps. Recently, I thoroughly enjoyed how the DVD saw all the 20 episodes of Kolchak, although I can clearly see that the series has big drawbacks. <br /> <br /> I am dealing with a bunch of questions, which is the first formula. Now, I think we all agree that most TV shows have formulas - for almost every Columbo episode, like the same pattern. Repetition is not in itself a bad thing; in fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often have recurring entertainment and are actively looking for it. However, Kolchak's problem is that its formula is just TOO rigid - it is too repetitive even with the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates the murder and thinks that it has been committed in any form. He tries to tell the story of this monster, but his editor Vincenzo always blocks him because Kolchak doesn't have enough evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work. And, unfortunately, the police prevent Kolchaki. So, finally, Kolchak does some independent research on the monster, thinks how to kill it ... and then kills it. Without writing a big story about the ceremony or prize or about it. <br /> <br /> You will see where this increasingly stringent formula can be tiring, right? I am particularly mysterious by Vincenzo - when Kolchak is always around monsters, and Vincenzo never believes ... then why does Vincenzo Kolchaki come down or act? That's what every ordinary boss does. However, this series creates such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchaki as comic antagonists. As a result, many of their scenes together are deeply unbelievable - although they are also quite funny. <br /> <br /> Kolchak's best episodes can steal the limitations of this formula, but usually because they contain some sort of unexpected twist. These selected episodes are good enough to think that they are largely immune to the typical criticism of the series. Some of my favorites include: <br /> <br /> Horror in the Heights - an episode that is remarkable to be gloomy, inventive, and socially aware. The Kolchak dialogue has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. Although closely following the Kolchak formula, the script (written by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster) is remarkably literate and deepens deep into the monster. <br /> <br /> Fucking Platform - Possible Inspiration "Omen" Movies, This Episode Shines To Me, because the villain - a very young Tom Skerritt - tempts Kolchaki with a satanic treat that is full of good benefits (and opens up the reporter's character so much). ) <br /> <br /> Firefall - This episode seems to have a bad reputation among fans, but I enjoyed it because it has a big red herring and really horrible, almost unstoppable-seemingly monster. <br /> <br /> Although I have highlighted these three episodes, I would say that most stories are at least entertaining. For my money, there are only two complete turkeys working on a 20-episode: Primal Scream, which is about to be tempted in Chicago and sacrificed by Sentry, which contains the least spotted creature in the history of filmed entertainment. and this rating comes from a lifetime doctoral thesis and a Godzilla fan!) <br /> <br /> Then it's a good series. Slightly repetitive, slightly cheesy, but it has elements of greatness. Even during the weaker episodes, Darren McGavin's wonderful power seems to be like a corrosive, tired, endlessly funny Kolchak. He bears the series effortlessly so that, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar never got Buffy. McGavin was one of the great character actor and this series is worth looking at him alone.
