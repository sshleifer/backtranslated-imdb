The thirtieth horror films that are best remembered are always like Dracula and Frankenstein; and there is a very good reason, but there were many smaller but still great productions, and the invisible Ray is definitely one of them. The plot is not very original and similar plots have been seen many times (even in 1936), but the way to put together is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very small original horror film. Dr. Janos Rukh, with a good heart, is at the heart of the plot; a man who has discovered a way to restore Earth's history. His discovery makes him believe that somewhere in Africa there may be an unknown radioactive element, which is why he will give up his team of esteemed colleagues to find it. But the tragedy strikes during the expedition and the good doctor will come into contact with this element; which makes her glow in the dark and sends her mad ... <br /> <br /> The biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly that it celebrates the two biggest horror stars of its day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugos, and both perform great performances. Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has a lot of meat for Karloff. The role of Bela Lugos is very different from what we are used to seeing him, and it is also his great power; It's nice to see a little bit of versatility from Lugosi. The film does not fall quite slowly; but things will soon pick up. The other side of the film is the best and it really is when the film becomes exciting and Karloff gets the chance to shine (literally). The film does not focus on large special effects and relies largely on central acts to keep things interesting; and it works very well. The film is still interesting all the time and falls to a very decent climax that turns everything up. In general, Invisible Ray may not be the best horror movies of the thirties; but it is very good and recommended.
