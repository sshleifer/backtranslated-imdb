North Africa in the 1930s. For a small Arab city on the edge of the Sahara, there is a beautiful woman who is looking for meaning in her life and a beautiful trapist monk who escapes her crisis of faith. They meet and passions are mixed, but even Sand Diviner does not know if they will find happiness or sadness here in ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure hockey, but the movie is still a fun and beautiful look. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer is a great screen pair. Simply put, she is proud, and Boyer gives the most effective, undervalued performance, giving her sensitive face a lot of her actions. <br /> <br /> Supporting is excellent: Basil Rathbone, who is a sympathetic role as a desert-loving Count; Joseph Schildkraut is a friendly, conversational tutor (all "Arabic" whom he and others speak in the film are pure skinny); Lucile Watson as Delicate Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as a respectable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a Dangerous Dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as a mysterious sailor; and great Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a smart old priest. <br /> <br /> The movie musicians know Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (nuns on shoulders) as monastic girls; Nigel De Brulier as Convent Lecturer; and Ferdinand Gottschalk Hotel Secretary, all unredited. Color films from the 1930s are both rare and beautiful, and this film is no exception - cinematography is as colorful as in the desert. ALLAHI AED was the first Technicolor film to be placed. Yuma, Arizona gave the filmmakers all the sand dunes they wanted, but the contaminated drinking water and 135 degrees of heat were soon a company rebellion. When daytime rushes showed that Boyer's face had burned bright tomato red, David David finally gave Selznick. The rest of the film was filmed at the Hollywood stage.
