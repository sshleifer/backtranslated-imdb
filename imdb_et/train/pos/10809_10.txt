Russell, my fav, is great in this movie. But more than a film involves a huge selection of people's passion and sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is treated and respected. The film makes the viewer aware that the tolerance of other people is an opportunity to save humanity. A great love story between Lachlin and Lili. I'll play my scenes again and again. Anyone who is ever in love feels against these people. All characters are perfectly cast and depicted.
