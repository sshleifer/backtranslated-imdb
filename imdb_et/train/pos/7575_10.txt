Resident Evil: code veronica is a great well-made video game, with great graphics, very comfortable controls, great story and a great fun factor. This story is Claire Redfield, which will be taken to the island in Umbrella areas to overcome and respond to the destruction they main lab while looking for her brother.Code veronica graphics are very good, fire and rain effects are great looks. Controls are comfortable but button pattern is not suitable for Dreamcast control, That's why it's hard to use To.It's still fun going around some worrying places when taking the courage of zombies. Code: veronical is also a bit of "romance" between the two main characters. You can also play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1 Sound in this game is better than ever, even though I hate a new feature when giant spiders climb, they make their feet an annoying sound and weapons are more realistic. story, comfortable controls and reality stic sound makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica is a solid beloved. I'll give 10 out of 10.
