East Lupino was one of the few women who broke through the studio under the Hollywood glass ceiling. Not surprisingly, he also touched on the proto-feminist themes that were touched so harshly that it was rarely quite clear what was said. In the attack, he treats rape and its consequences, and while in the short film it is called a "criminal attack", he once casts doubt on what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (her official debut) plays the secretary-accountant for major industrial companies; he lives with his parents, but he is dealing with an expanding guy (Robert Clarke) who just got up and now makes $ 90 a week. Leaving the plant after working one night, he finds himself robbed. In the next scene? the best movie? he tries to escape from his follower in the maze of forbidding buildings and alleys, but he can't. <br /> <br /> When he returns home, insecure and in shock, the police cannot get much of him; he claims he has never seen his attacker (who manned a canteen outside the factory). In an attempt to pretend that nothing happened, she returns to her job, but breaks down, thinking that everyone is watching her, evaluating her. He goes to the fusion, drives on the bus to Los Angeles, but stops at rest. <br /> <br /> When he wakes up at a strange beach house, he learns that he has rescued Todd Andrews, a young farmer based in California. She lies about her identity and takes oranges from the work package. Two fall vaguely in love, but it is clear to Andrews that Powers keeps terrible secrets. When a company picnic grabs a wrench and breaks Jerry Paris's skull who tried to steal a kiss, the truth about his past appears ... <br /> <br /> It was a bold movie in 1950 that can explain and apologize for some of this shortcomings. Lupino never takes an early attack back into the scene, and the film moves into bucolic and sentimental, speaking and didactic. Yes, Lupine had the important information he gave, but he didn't trust the story to speak for himself. Also, his cast, pleasant, but unpleasant and general, did not help with melodramatic things or rest from home. But the resentment was a breakthrough that created a later discourse on rape crime and what it really means for the victims.
