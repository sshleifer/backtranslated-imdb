A strange erotic score of Gothic horror, loved by Hammer House of Horror fans around the world. It seems interesting to take "Beauty and the Beast". Be sure to look and act surprisingly well when you consider the genre and era. <br /> <br /> Corsets, castles, climbing horses, wild fur monsters in the woods, proof that nobody got Brazilian. 70s and more body fluids than you can shake, what else could you wish for! <br /> <br /> It was definitely my Sunday afternoon!
