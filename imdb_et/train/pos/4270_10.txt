Ko-tamo-peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I saw a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me which one smiles every time you watch it. But the truth is that humor is special in this comedy. It is a carat for Serbia. And all the former Yugoslav republics know it very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (like: Europe) can't enjoy it so much. Because the subtitles break the hole thing. But they should at least try !!!! Yes, it's ironic! It's the best history in Serbian history and the world doesn't understand it! :-) If you have the opportunity to see it, don't blow OK!
