The joint drawing of the films consists of the main characters who leave the city and behind the city and find themselves in the silence of nature. With the power of Kangwon Province, we have shown two stories of people who are doing this, trying to find their way through popular Korean parks in the mountains of the Kangwon Province. But instead of epiphany moments, we have two characters whose nature in nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The pace of this movie is slow, contemplative. Ultimately, we learn what the Kangwon Province really did, and we learn how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood's glam and movie to give them a final answer, this movie doesn't match. But for those who want to think of a film that leaves them thinking, they will affect them years later, this film is more than successful.
