One of these beautifully intense movies that pulls us so far, will end soon! When they looked at the screen like "No, they're not!", Lol. Good productions everywhere! The actors are strange with Emily Blunt, who is just outstanding! I knew he would provide a solid, convincing performance that would try to get Victoria's youth, mood and vulnerability across the film. Production is also excellent: style, content and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse of the remarkable time in British history spoke of a very personal and moving life story from the princess of the school age until her reign was queen, later marrying Prince Albert, ending with the birth of their first nine children. It had a well-written scenario and flawless editing. Rupert Friend as a so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert, who won the attention of a young queen when her love for Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was tempting. The same fascinating relationship was between the teenage Victoria and her mother, who sometimes had rage, like her mother and King William (whom she didn't like). The acting and the scenes were fascinating, very emotional. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the historical and political situation of this era, and indeed to everyone who loves a real romantic story
