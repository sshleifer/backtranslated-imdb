_Waterdance_ is widely studied spinally for injured artificially alive. The tiny embarrassment of defective fluorescent lamps, blinking in the word against sexuality, masculinity, and depression, has the disability experience open. <br /> <br /> Diversity of central characters emphasizes the complexity of the material being researched - Joel, writer Raymond, black man of the past and Bloss, racist biker. At first, these men unite the nature of their injuries but retain their competitive spirit. Over time, both good and bad common experiences bring them together to support each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious change is what Joel, who initially distanced himself from sunglasses companions, experienced. , headphones and curtains. When he comes to the changes he has made to his life, Joel surrenders these props and starts engaging in the struggles of the men with whom he shares guardianship. <br /> <br /> The title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep your head above water; to give up dancing is to deny life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels and I don't hesitate to recommend it.
