In my opinion, this is one of America's greatest films and it has earned every prize it won, and it is on the AFI Top 100 list (although it is disgracefully too low in the IMDB Top 250 list, only # 183 in writing). If you enjoy the highest caliber (Voight and Hoffman is a great game), well-drawn testimonials and inventive direction, editing and cinematography, you will love it as much as I do. Schlesinger paints a vivid, always reliable picture of the New York scene at the end of the 1960s, and many victims struggle to overcome personal demons and the 42nd Street of New York's immorality, poverty and hopelessness. <br /> <br /> The filmmaking techniques used here are well below the New York City underground film movement (and city) and are nothing but dazzling. I've seen a lot of ideas (including quick fire editing, returning voice commands, drug / trip sequences, and the face of comics that were hit by the grief and the terrorist murder at the scene) stolen by other filmmakers. br /> <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is considered to be an unusually strong friendship or homosexual basis. I think the director dealt with it in a subtle way, not to censor the times, but rather to focus his energy on the importance of a strong human relationship in life, be it sexual or not. br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving film size, effect, and importance that has lost nothing of its influence over the years, so if you haven't seen it, you've really lost the American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
