This is a very unusual film, because a star with a top date doesn't literally appear up to half. However, I was connected to the Phantom Lady hook. Curtis, who is competent as a mistakenly accused Scott Henderson, looks a little harsh to be compassionate (maybe he should have shaved his mustache) and his behavior, when he first comes home, would have had to convince the police at least some of his innocence. Although the second commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone like Jack Marlowe, I found that his portrayal is impressive in character. He's not a stockman. Great character actor Elisha Cook Jr. Her drumming on the musical number added eroticism. However, this film is carried by very capable and viable Ella Raines, because the devotee would be Henderson's lover Carol Richmond. He certainly has a talent and the presence of his screen is the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is his first job I've seen, and I'm definitely ready to see my roles. The remaining supporting cast is also more than competent. All in all, the very satisfying secret of movie noise, which nowadays provides the dark and complicated world of the city it is intended to be. Recommended, 8/10.
