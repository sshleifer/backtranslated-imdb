I love Jack's jokes, like "Cliché ..." or "Over the top cliché, black, oily skin, kinda spooky ...". He's just fun! Daniel will catch up with him! Good that Jack is no longer in the team (in some ways) or else it would have been a sarcasm mania !!!! I just love all the parcels (8th season, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are big, the actors are great, I'm gonna take up the facial expressions of Jack, Daniel and Teal'c (and more) ... It's all theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! They're coming again !!! Sorry, I've also started collecting properties from Carter and it all drives my parents to NUTZ !!!!!!! Finally, I think it's good for three more seasons or especially if they keep episodes of all this humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
