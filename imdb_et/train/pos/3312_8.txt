After Emmy losing to Gampsy's television version Mama Rose, Bette won next year for Emmy BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert that was filmed for HBO in Las Vegas. Midler, who has been performing since the 1970s, proves that he is still one of the most electrifying performers in the company. From her opening number, the classic "Friend", where she descends from the wings from a beautiful cloud image, Bette plays a style number called "I Look Good", where she shows she has five jokes like some other performers in this business because she mixes her way through a variety of musical choices. The section of the exhibition, where he welcomes the burlesque, goes a little too long, but he succeeds in adding his old Sophie Tucker joke to this utility (although he forgets one joke in the middle of what he is talking about, but his advertising until he remembers it is hysterical). Bette also treats us with "Rose's Turn" from GYPSY and the title tune of her breaking film ROSE and the shameless plug on her hit "FIRST SHIFT CLUB". He will bring the house to the end, "Stay with me, baby" THE ROSE and his only # 1 hit, "Wind Beneath My Wings" BEACHES. It's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and Midler fans, it's black.
