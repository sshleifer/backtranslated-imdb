This is really a great movie. Some songs have become an immortal classic and Fred and Ginger dancing are their best. But basically all Fred and Ginger movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it is the other characters in the film that make the film. What really disturbs me is that all the negative comments about Randolph Scot? Her romance with Harriet Hilliard and the bottom line of the movie is why I look at it again and again. He adds to this film, he doesn't diminish it. He has a winning personality and a big smile. Randy is on my top ten favorites list. It's nice to see her as a cowboy. OK, so he's not really a big actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. She was very pleasant and could get to the top at certain times. All Fred and Ginger films had sub-plates that were dependent on other actors to fill the space between musical numbers, otherwise the film should be shortened by about half an hour. I just want more people to appreciate Randy and I felt the need to stand for him.
