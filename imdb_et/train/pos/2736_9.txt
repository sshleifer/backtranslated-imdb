A unique movie ... one of the best times. Acting, Scripting, Quincy Jones' Score, Cinematography, Editing etc - just awesome. As most viewers know, this film is based on the Truman Capote book, which deals with a couple of Kansas peasants (Clutters) murdered by a young man during a mistaken robbery. I've never seen a movie that so wonderfully made a true story a riveting film. <br /> <br /> Participants are solid everywhere, but the focus is on killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team that monitors them. Scott Wilson, like Dick Hickock, is amazing. Cocky, twitchy and without compassion he is so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake like Perry Smith is extraordinary - lonely and at the same time empathic and cold-blooded. Who could put these qualities together and buy us? He does it and it's great! The main point of the book is how these two very different sociopathic people came together to create a critical mass to make such a stupid and sad crime, and these two actors make it work perfectly. Both had moments in their later quarries, but these performances are high watermarks that mark the period of action. <br /> <br /> The cops are also wonderful. The leader of the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also big. Unlike modern movies, where manufacturers find it necessary to give the police supernatural assets or fans, they are only real flat feet that make the case decisively and competently. They look so real. I've never seen a police force so powerful that they're authentic. and I've seen most of the criminal classic back. Really one of those kind. <br /> <br /> PARTICULAR SPOILER (this movie is unique in that you already know what happened, but I warn of a record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes of the best crimes and movies are interrogations - intellectual barriers between races and police, Mano a Mano. This film has the best scenes in the film you will ever see on the film. See that Dick and Perry try to unravel their way through the ages and slowly without knowing that the police have the goods on them. But the police have to break their suspects from their alibi and hopefully conquer them. This is one of the best things you will ever see. Think of Glengarry Glen Ross without a showboating. <br /> <br /> This true story of translating sad and terrible corners was filmed from the real confusion of ICB and I've heard that film students played Clutters to give them a real feeling. It works. They seem to be decent and simple. This makes the crime so sensitive and sad. <br /> <br /> I'll stop here. It's not a good movie, but it's one of the best movies ever made and so unique that it's a must-see for every movie.
