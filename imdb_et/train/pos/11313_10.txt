Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and beautiful drifter who arrives at the road bar. He meets with the young, beautiful and dissatisfied wife of Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa). He sells his mechanical skills through food and accommodation and communicates with Giovanni. They both decide to kill Giuseppe by eating a car accident. Their relationship affects the sense of guilt and police investigation. This masterpiece ends tragically. The Luchino Visconti noir and the neo-realistic film are outstanding. This is the first time I always look at this post "twice". I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Langel are one of the hottest sex in cinema history, but that's definitely the best. My voice is ten.
