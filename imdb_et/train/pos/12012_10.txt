I saw it in the Legacy Theater this morning at the Joseph Smith Memorial House in Salt Lake City. I assume that the level of enjoyment of this film is largely based on accepting Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> But this omission was well done, worked well and had a nice score. When you arrive at Salt Lake City, you need to see it in the Legacy Theater. I've never been in a more beautiful theater as much as picture quality, sound quality, and ambiance in all my life ... I don't know if the church would allow me to watch Batman start there! Being LDS and meeting Joseph as a prophet, I was touched in several places and tore it a little ... what I expect is expected because they gave the tissues before the movie started! Anyway, I've said that this movie is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes, check it out, because you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells an exciting story.
