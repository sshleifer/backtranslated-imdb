It was supposed to be a joke around Bonanza about how dead the women were to Cartwright men. After all, Ben Cartwright was a widow and a son three times for each marriage. And every woman who attended Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe died eventually of death because we didn't get the widow and three sons who started this classic TV west. Perhaps, if Bonanza had been made today, writers would have had reversible women who came into and out of Cartwright. People interact, some go well, some are not so good, it's just life. And today we are less heroes of our heroes, so if one of them goes south, we don't have to kill that character to survive the survivors' nobility. But this is where Bonanza was made today. <br /> <br /> But we waited much more for our Western heroes and Bonanz, although it took some time to keep and the NBC viewing time changed for sure, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble Patriarch Ben Cartwright and his pristine sons. Ben Cartwright was the ideal TV father in every genre you want to name. His whole life was spent with hard work that set up a huge Ponderosa for his three children. The children were all different in personality, but all came together with a pinch. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights was and still is an American institution. I dare more people take care of this family than Kennedys. This is the popularity that Bonanza has published in the syndicate, it shows. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts, the eldest son of Adam, was written out of the show. The rumor is that he did not care about the tremendous characters of Cartwright, which he felt finely delimited. Perhaps, if it had been done now, it would have done better than I described. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning of Michael Landon, when many people get three hits on their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House Prarie, where he was under creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, hottest, but most romantic of Cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. the show continued with two younger boys, but when the big Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. There were other signs added to that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright accepting Mitch Vogel. But the big, loyal, but small thickness of Hoss was easily the most loved by Cartwright. His sudden death after the operation remained too great in this family. <br /> <br /> So Ponderosa Cartwright has gone into history. I got a real taste of how America took the heart of Cartwrights when I visited the real city of Virginia. It doesn't see anything you see in Bonanz. Near Lake Tahoe, almost when you see the map under the Ponderosa Open Credit, there is Cartwright's home, open and open as a tourist attraction. Like the 21 Baker Street Sherlock Holmes fans, ranchhouse and Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> And if they weren't real, they should have been.
