Every child has the film he puts on VHS if he has nothing to do or if he is a nanny. It was this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I had to see it at least 100 times, and I can say it's a good child / family film. <Br>> <br /> I still have a tape, I haven't been watching it for 5 years, but maybe I'm getting around this week and I'm a baby for a child. <br /> <br /> Just have to take care of the bear and their messege. <br /> <br />
