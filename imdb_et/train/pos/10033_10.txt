Movie Titanic does much more than just "memorizing at night". He writes an event of tragic history that is always spoken of and never forgotten. Why was this criticized? I have no clue. Could they ever make a movie like Titanic that moves and touches every time you watch it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It's almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director certainly had a big impact on the film. A simple disaster movie (boring look) became an incredible romance. Yes, I am not a type of novel, but it shouldn't bother you because you never see such a romance. Guaranteed! Everything for amazing effects, music, superb behavior. The film creates an amazing visual and wonderful feeling. Everything seems very real and lively. Also the legend itself "TITANIC" is shown perfectly in all classes as well as prospects. Action had a real impact. Dicaprio and Winslet are just the best roles in this game. No one could have done better. These are partly why the film is so big. <br /> <br /> I think it's not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, acting is brilliant, based on a real story, probably more than half of the consumers watching the movies share tears of gratitude and an unimaginable ending that can never be forgotten. Well, if you haven't seen this movie, if you are something about Hesterical and Hollywood's idolizing film. Would it be better? No, not at all. The most mobile film of all time, don't listen to people, see for yourself, then you understand. Landmark. (Don't be surprised if you cry)
