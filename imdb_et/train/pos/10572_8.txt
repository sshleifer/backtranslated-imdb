I feel that Warners Brose's musicals in the depression period will become more relevant in the next few years. Yes, we are in economic times (or have lived under the stone) and times seem dark. But we always have movies to escape our concerns. In the 1930s, cinema was very popular even at the height of economic darkness. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one such film that the audience grew up with. Although this music by Lloyd Bacon does not take time for social problems such as "1933 (1933) gold miners", it is still a great talent for talent. We have to wait for the end of the movie with three key extravagant numbers of Busby Berkely, but for the boy, have they been waiting for me. Yes, the little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her knocking is so, but Busby's magical "By Waterfall" throws her and the one that seems to be a hundred other choir girls into a dashing water area. Of course, Busby's numbers can never be played on the stage (they can't ruin the limits on the one hand), and they are sharply opposed to the realism of harsh, non-musical scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney, one of his little musicals (really, what this man couldn't do). She even gets over the leading man, don sailor garb and fawn over the sexpot of Shanghai Lil (who's really a small Ruby in China-girl wig!). He with the stars Joan Blondell, his divine, adorable secretary, who Cagney somehow forgets to other women (until the final roll, that is). Apparently Blondell was the only other woman who loved Cagney's wife. And you see mutual respect in every scene.
