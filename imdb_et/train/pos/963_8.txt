Takashi Miike is one of my favorite leaders and I was worried that he was making a children's film because I wouldn't want to see him in the movies I love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi killer and Black Socioty trilogy. Recently, he seems to be exploring a new territory and I think he will succeed. But it was the first of his films I saw that he took that direction, so I was nervous. Hardly bought it without seeing it and I was glad I did. <br /> <br /> The Great Yokai War is the perfect children's film and adults like it. The whole movie reminded me of so many kids about loved ones: Endless Story, Labyrinth, Back to Oz, and so on. I liked these movies because they didn't meet the kids like they're stupid and it's not. Dark morals exist, but it is just as foolish as every child's film. Personally, I didn't bother with CGI and dentures. I feel they fit well and do not believe that children are noticing. <br /> <br /> If you're a dying fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like it. But I suggest giving it a hit. This proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspected. He also continues to sign Miike's films outside of those that are very soothing. <br /> <br /> For those people who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light-hearted or dramatic like this, I recommend these other Miike films: 'Zebraman' 'Katakuris' 'Sabu' Happiness and 'Birds in China'. <br /> <br /> Good work for Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
