I found this movie in a fast-paced world of fixed films that are refreshing and refreshing, where we are manipulated to love a "good man" and hate "bad boy". Scott Cohen, a very beautiful television actor, does a good job of showing a black sheep / missing child who wants to get his father's love and respect, as well as his widow-sister with whom he probably has a history. Judd Hirsch plays his usual good pictures of his father, who is a triangle of his sons and now it is what he always rejected. <br /> <br /> When I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was fascinated by the lovely way that sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as the director explained. <br /> <br /> This is the successor of the classic "ordinary people". I just realized that Judd Hirsch was in it!
