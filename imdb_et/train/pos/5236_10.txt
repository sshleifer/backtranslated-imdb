This stylistically sophisticated visual game presents the story in one story. Winner is Bart Klever, a screenwriter who is constantly struggling with his new text? which is the scenario of the movie being viewed at the same time. In Bart, does a scriptwriter write a script? Barta's struggle with the text becomes a narrative subject, as is the apartment environment in which he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate environment offers many opportunities for the illusion of playing space, light, colors and a couple of cats. The externally simple world of space is made even more complicated by the unstable dimensions of the text, which are constantly influenced by the filmmaker's interventions that appear on the computer monitor and counterbalance the similarity to the mutating environment. The ever-changing perspective makes it difficult to answer questions that arise: What is truth and what is an illusion? Which observed world is primary and better than the rest? Can something be the main point in a narrative space?
