Surprisingly complicated and well-drafted study in the USSR "First" serum killer. On the days of Perestroika, this intense piece has come to life with performances by Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> This Cicatillo as a killer investigation is round and hints at some of his behavior while others show a nuance that is convincing without being openly graphic. Because not with a weak heart, because it is often distracting, but necessary for its full development of the main actors based on fact. <br /> <br /> HBO has given us an excellent movie in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this great work. It's in my top 10.
