The first picture of the movie shows the joy of the mountain early in the morning and my idea was, "It's almost too beautiful." And it goes like this: pictures of landscapes and animals that look like romantic paintings, each perfect in every detail. Even a girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It may seem outdated and capricious, but it fits the story itself, a quiet beauty that takes place between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince between life and fairy tale. I liked it every minute. The extreme parsymony of the film, with a simple, slow story, only one actor and hardly any special effects, had a strong magic. I therefore regret that this parsymon is abandoned at the last minute, when two more actresses are suddenly introduced (a girl as an adult woman and her son). Another drawback is music that is often intrusive, Hollywood-like and sometimes inappropriate. I couldn't bring the English pop song with the glory of the French hill. I went to the movie with two little daughters, but I also recommend it to adults because they appreciate this movie. Of course not everything.
