Let's start with the song by Christopher Cros. The song is "When you get caught between the month and New York." This is a great theme and song even after these years, it never gets tiring. It's also a great song about New York. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore CBE stands for a spoiled drunken millionaire who is dealing with the character of Jill Eikenberry. Jill later celebrated LA law. Anyway, he is served by his brilliant British butcher, Mr. John Gielgud OM, who won the Academic Award as the best-performing actor in the film. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnell's character, who is perfect in this film after winning the Oscar winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza can't sing. He plays a canteen reporter. Anyway, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as a family Bach matriarch who chooses family happiness. Anyway, she's amazing and she should have been the best actor for the academic award. Barney Martin, best known as Jerry's father in Seinfeld, plays Liza's father. He's also great. The film was well written, acted and delivered to the audience who wanted it more.
