I was quite surprised with this flick. Although their budget was obviously still incomplete, you have to impress that this film took 7 years and was still good. The action was pretty impressive and the story was really impressive. My only complaint would be that the ending ended up a little suddenly for my taste. But hey, if your audience is no longer needed, this movie has succeeded. <br /> <br /> I would really like to look for someone in Antonia Río who is an excellent Spanish talent in Hollywood (something hard to find today with all the bad short stories). Antonella Ríos is really a star to grow.
