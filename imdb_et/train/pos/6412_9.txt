I'm definitely glad that a film was made about Carl Brashear's amazing biography. As with civil rights, Brashear became an inspiration for all minority groups who did not want to be satisfied with their expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear, as Cuba Gooding played, Jr. the behavior of his chosen life. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who created a baseball and did it because of his character and behavior. Like Brashear, Gooding knows he doesn't want the life his father Carl Lumbly owns, and Lumbly makes it really clear to get more out of life than he's got. After World War II, the Navy still has its limitations. A black man can only be a chef or officer; It is not good enough for Gooding, who is seeking a naval diving diver. <br /> <br /> One time in New York, Bayonne's diving school, Gooding is all thrown at him, mostly Master Chief Petty Officer responsible for Robert DeNiro. DeNirol may have some remaining prejudices, but he is a hero and one who can inspire through the racial divide. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is Chemistry DeNiro and Gooding. They will definitely come from different places, but when they get to know each other, both men will be honored. Other good results are Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as head. A diving school that is a navy wants to retire for the reasons you see. <br /> <br /> Men Of Honor is an inspiring story of people who have the courage to save and change.
