This Oliver production is masterful, showing evil layers in the human soul. What makes this story remarkable is the brilliantly bright Unseen Character, who captures its darkness by carrying the innocent boy safely into the hands of his relative through the most serious threats. Yes, although Oliver walks in the shadow of death, he is not afraid of evil. The rod and staff are there to comfort him. Finally, he is saved from humanity. At the bottom is Fagin, the lot of the worst. Fagin weighs up his paths not once, but twice, but decreases because he doesn't want to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because he raises small handkerchiefs who are murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is not fulfilled, but also untried. Best of all is Nancy. In the absence of a judgment, he ignores the violent character of Bill Sikes about his deep need for love. But unlike Fagin, he improves his own sins against the probable cost of his life, saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not as they seem. In my opinion, this quality makes art valuable - unpredictable. I'd give "10" to this movie, but the soundtrack and atmosphere made on this 70's TV was upset. All in all, there is a good parable and a thorough story for all audiences.
