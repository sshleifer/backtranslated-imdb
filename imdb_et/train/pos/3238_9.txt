The Finnish version of the "Short Slices" of Rome's Altman, located in the small town of Äänekoski. Episodes are the kaleidoscope of eternal events, problems, and emotions of human life: joy and love, deceit and disappointment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first of these is the story of a young speaker who is trying to encourage her colleagues to have romance, she radiates the joy of love and life. The second episode presents and the old man dies in the hospital, and his wife tries to kill him with dignity. Particularly striking is how the old couple must fight against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness, which is contrary to the "routines" of the hospital team (despite random empathy). Compared to the Altman classic, this film is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great work of art.
