Although it was filmed on the Florida National Guard site, Tigerland reminded me entirely of Fort Polk, LA, firing squares, maneuvering areas, waist-deep water and all. The film was relatively authentic and similar to the same characters in my AIT in 1974. The difference between the 1971 Tigerland and the 1974 mine was all the drills and instructors knew they would not go back to Vietnam, as it was pretty much everywhere, so the training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. It was the forerunner of all our concerns in the 1970s and 80s, which I know because I stayed until 2004. I have never heard anyone mentioning "Tigerland", but the army was realistic Vietnamese training guests on various bases all over the US Vietnam Vets tells me that until 1972, Basic & AIT can be quite harsh and tough, because trainers were there and they were had the power to teach the Vietnamese men to do these skills, although this was not always the case. Both in Polk and elsewhere in Vietnam's Vet NCO, having become Fort Bliss's primary training brigade, I said that nothing can be done to make someone ready and people just had to find out and see. This movie price is high.
