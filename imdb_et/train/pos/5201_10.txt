Human Tornado is a campy 70's Blaxploitation starring nightclub comedian Rudy Ray Moore, perhaps his most loving role to date. The film tells the story of the Dolem, the pimp of the bad ass, who gets into the wrong, white racist sheriff, sleeping with his wife. Dolemite escapes hardly and rides to sunny California to visit an old friend, the nightclub owner (and Mrs. Dolemite 'ladies') named Queen Bee. However, it seems that the owner of a rival nightclub with cellular connections is trying to get his racket muscular, so that the Dolemite takes his stuff. Rudy Ray Moore introduces many different talents on this landmark film, including strong dramatic skills, the mastery of Kung Fu, the impressive voice of the song (he gives two vocal songs), touching compassionate ladies, and general persuasive charisma and eager comic timing. This movie has everything, people: deep plot, blisters, laugh-minute comedy, beautiful women in trouble, slam-bang ending ... what more could you ask about the movie?
