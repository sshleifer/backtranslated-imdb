Kiera Evening moved straight from P&P to the action film ... she would hardly have chosen her image more consistently again. Great success in love, and like Lizie Jane in Austen's classical class, she is again "on the go". Just like her bikini-covered soldier woman in King Arthur had more skin than muscles, it is hard to imagine the delicate frame that stands in the life of a generation hunter ... but that's exactly what Domino Harvey (real) did, and I (being one the biggest fans of the night) believe that it will wear when it is turned off. <br /> <br /> Stuff .... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the postcode Beverly Mountains in LA, where all the movies live. * Domino Harvey's father's most famous film was a manchurian candidate (which appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died in a bath during drug overdose before the film appeared in June 2005 after he was arrested for drug trafficking. He had just completed negotiations to make some of his music in the film. * Kiera Knightly refers to Domino Harvey's sexuality in his interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie a bit far, look at Domino Harvey because the facts are more amazing than fiction.
