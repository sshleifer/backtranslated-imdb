I had little trouble with this movie and I've heard a lot of criticism saying it is too long and overpriced. True, it's over three hours long, but I was surprised that it was going so fast. I don't think it's overestimated at all, I think the IMDb rating is absolutely decent. The film looks gorgeous, gorgeous costumes and great effects, and James Cameron's direction rarely slips out of focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best performances as Jack and Kate Winslet are cute as Rose. Great actor David Warner steals any scene he has. The story is very rich, and it is the story of love, obviously a love story that is very mobile when it is needed. the film is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I testify that I was at the edge of my seat during the Titanic sinking. I also say that the last five minutes were very moving. James Horner's piece of music was lovely even though I've never been a big fan of what my heart goes. The 1996 mini-devices were good but suffered under undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. In general, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox.
