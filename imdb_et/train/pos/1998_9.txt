Cinema Retro magazine # 2 revealed that Mark Lester's voice was duplicated by 20-year-old Kathe Green. Although Lestet was considered to be the ideal task, director Carol Reed was not at all satisfied with her singing ability. The UK documentary "Oliver! After them was famous" showed the mystery. Greene was paid 400 pounds for his work, and he had to accept the secret of his participation, like Mark Lester. They kept their word and showed this only in the decades after the release of the film. As a reminder, Mark Lester left aside and is an osteopath practicing in England.
