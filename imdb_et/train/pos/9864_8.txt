I looked at the "Ice Age" and I liked this movie. Despite the fact that "Ice Age" has a lot of mistakes and scientific mistakes, such as people, saber, dinosaurs and mammoths living in the same period, and even the place where the story goes (looks at North America, but has some Icelandic qualities) ) for example) we can have fun. (if you are not very serious!) <br /> <br /> The planet has ICE AGE, and many animals migrate to the south where they are warmer. Sid is a stupid Sloth who has been left behind by his own family and who can no longer hold him. As he passes his way, Manfred meets or man calls "Manny" a mammoth who doesn't care about extinction or immigration and goes north. Concerned that she could be grabbed easily, Sid decided to follow Manfred and found the mother of her mother with her mother in the middle of her trip. Mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to breastfeed and return the child. Diego, one of the Sabbaths, decides to follow and help them go to a shortcut to a human camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego is a Saber who hates people and wants to kill a baby, and pretends to betray both to become a saber. What happens depends on Diego's behavior and conscience ... <br /> <br /> aka "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
