First of all, it is a set of two discs consisting of Wonderland DVD rentals. <br /> <br /> The two films, which include rental, "Wonderland" and Johnny Wadd documentary, completely destroy the myth created by "Boogie Nights". This myth that the characters involved in adult film trade were far more than slippery low, which did something for money, basically denying they were anything but attacking self-centered whores. It is amazingly similar to what Wiseguy and Goodfellas did with The Godfather fable and most of the rest of the gangster's romance. <br /> <br /> Now, what is most irritating to me when watching these films, and probably irk everyone who saw and enjoyed "Boogie Nights" is how stupid and light, allegedly educated and experienced people can be. "Dirk Diggler" "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who, unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no redemption quality. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused someone close to him, had taken full advantage of his self-expression efforts, and was undoubtedly the main actor of the brutal murders of Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. lie that "Boogie Nights" was and strengthens Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic business known as the adult film entertainment industry. This should be demanded by viewing, both features of the "Wonderland" DVD, anyone who had any positive opinions about the story in "Boogie Nights".
