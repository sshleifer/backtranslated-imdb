I turned it in to see the incredible Ethel Waters whose autobiography I read now. I testify that my jaw dropped when the pork and watermelon references started running, but people can't see this movie as a stereotypical or racist work. This is pretty much the case with black movies, black people, when the entertainment industry was quite separated and the stereotypes of the people involved were jokes of their time, old trends exaggerated humor. We see that modern black films do the same, but with new trends (stereotypes), hoists and "hoods" and such. I think if you look back eighty years, you will find that today's movies look like racist. What the audience appreciates about this movie is Waters and pint-sized Sammy Davis Jr. Talent who touches her modern Shirley temple and looks seemingly remarkably the same as an adult. Everyone in this film was obviously having fun. Why not enjoy what it is, instead of what you think it should have been?
