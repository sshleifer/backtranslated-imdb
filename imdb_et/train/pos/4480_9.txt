In the Citadel series of films, "Gene Kelly Films", the anchor is a musical ball. I can't do it better. This is such an important film in the career of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson didn't do it badly. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer had borrowed from Gene Kelly to Columbia, where Harry Cohn was inspired to allow Kelly's choreographer to own numbers and because of this, Cover Girl became a classic. So when Mayer didn't learn the lesson, Joe Pasternak was the producer and promised Kelly's artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh was ready, Fred Astaireil was the rival of the cinema dance monarch. <br /> <br /> The main number everyone talks to Gene Kelly is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally, Kelly wanted to make a number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney didn't give Mickey to anyone. Mickey had to wait until Who framed Roger Rabbi to make a foreign film. Don't worry, because MGM had one animated rodent from Tom and Jerry. <br /> <br /> As a Kelly dancer, he always tried to do something new and different on the screen like Fred Astaire. In the next few decades, they were allowed to do artistic control in two ways, even when their films did not come sniffing themselves. It was like everyone else inspired you to greater and better creativity, Kelly MGM, Astaire MGM and many other studios. Anchors Aweighis got Kelly a little bit to dance to Sinatra. In fact, Frank Sinatra always gave Gene Kelly a testimony to show him how the musicals should be done when he gave recognition to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for helping them when he was an Oscar forever. > When Frank Sinatra had half the contracts MGM bought from RKO, he demanded little artistic creativity. He got friends with Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn's song contest team. In his autobiography, Sammy Cahn talks about how Sinatra insisted that they write their songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave the floor and the team wrote a very good ballad. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Fall in Love too lightly. Frank is singing this piano at an empty Hollywood bowl. That's the best of Sinatra. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn earned a rich title to put Frank Sinatra in the mouth more vocals than any other person. They were lifelong friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with his career as a milestone. <br /> <br /> Styne and Cahn said they could just write a song on a chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson made his soprano work on all of the sudden heartbeats. He also did some classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Here, singing is actually the basis of the plot. Two sailors, who leave on various occasions on vacation, meet Kathryn Grayson and his orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. Kelly says she can listen to her with Jose Iturb. They spend the movie trying to do it. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment at Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays for Brooklyn, never got a number. She had received her presentations like Br Brady Brigadoon in Broadway and it brought her to Hollywood. I have a suspicion that he had a number that was cut and that it can still be anywhere in MGM storage. <br /> <br /> Anchors that are large are a great example of why musicals are no longer ready. All this creative talent was signed with the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract. If you had to pay a market value for it, the costs could be lost from third countries. <br /> <br /> But the film's results would be extraordinary.
