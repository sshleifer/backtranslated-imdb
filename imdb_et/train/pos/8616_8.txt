What if 400 years from the Japanese army were sent to G.I in time for the feudal wars that led to the formation of Tokugawa Shogunate? Great pitch right? The film does exactly what it talks about tin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the writers did not bother that they would usually explain a ridiculous, mumbo jumbo jumbo of sci-fi movies. No, how or why. They just did. However, the time sequence itself is hell and quite beautiful, if not outdated. Not as stupid as you might imagine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie follows T's premise. But even though he loses a little steam with the various sub-blocks that follow the arrival of GIs in medieval Japan, he receives a devastating battle series. Undoubtedly, this is the main order of the day. The whole concept and the wider film itself probably came from this simple square: what if G.I was equipped with the latest modern warfare, would the struggle with the Samurai be? And the boy doesn't offer it. <br /> <br /> The main battle series, which lasts more than half an hour, is probably one of the best in the 70's action / war films. It is not only relentless and tiring in pace and length, but also excellent mish-mash styles and techniques, which are unique spaces like G.I. Samurai can offer. I would like to say where else would you be able to play tanks, ninjas with shuriikens, helicopter and samurai in the same frame? G.I. londonant Iba manages tears literally through hundreds of additions, putting them on machines, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This mish-mash of styles is on one leg that is firmly rooted in sprawling neighbors. The epic of Kurosawa Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki banners, while the other is in western and warfare. There are stylistic touches (such as wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring to mind Sam Peckin or Enzo G. Castellar around Keoma. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by Western and other Hollywood works, and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai makes this East-West-West melting pot effortlessly an exciting film. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers take the whole thing seriously and make the film a tremendous benefit. Not that the language-in-cheek mentality is completely absent, it's just that it doesn't try to pamper as a bad-it-good audience who enjoy laughing at their movies. The budget was probably bouncing because it is evident in hundreds of additions, sophisticated costumes (a very decent production that is not a traditional Jidian-geck) and special effects. Camera work and editing are all the upper limits, almost as good as a film that does not deserve the highest artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> This is not a mistake, of course. There are many "song" scenes where all kinds of 70's Japanese rock, disco, and country songs play over assemblies (there's a binding scene, a love-interest scene, a "war is hell" scene, etc.). The songs themselves are pretty flat and funny and damage the whole thing. Although it's within 140 minutes, it usually flies the ball. A few more scenes, setbacks, and subplots in the first half could have been cut to get a tougher effect. <br /> <br /> It is also worth mentioning with well-known names such as Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf), Tsunehiko Watase (The Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, who all made the right comments.
