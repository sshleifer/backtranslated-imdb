This is, in my opinion, the best emma. Having seen the second version (1996), which is also good, and I read the book, I think I can say with certainty that this is a true interpretation and is the most faithful to Jane Austen's masterpiece. The 1996 film by G. Paltrow is also good, it's just that it's almost like a different story. It's very light and fluffy, you can't see the darker edges of the characters, and if you just want a pleasant movie, it would be good, but the complexity of some plot points, like Churchill / Fairfax, is so much glossed to be practically nonexistent. But if you want the characters to be somewhat more realistic and multi-dimensional, the 1996 TV version is better. Emma is a remarkable person, but she is faulty. Kate Beckinsale has a masterful character in showing small churches. You see, his appearance is terribly disgusting to Harriet Smith's simpler conversation, but he has no regrets for destroying Harris's proposal until his actions lead to his own marriage at the end of happiness. You see his narcissism and reflect Frank Churchill because they would harm others to achieve their goals. For Emma she played a toy expert and had a new friend who had lost marriage after a while. For Frank Churchill, this is his wife's promise, which he loves, keeping him and others terribly secret. In the book, he understands everything by breaking it into all the mistakes made in awakening. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their regrets, but Paltrow is more childish and stagnant, while the awakening of Beckinsale is quite real and serious, and you see a shift from childish, selfish behavior to a kind and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer it.
