In fact, Goldie Hawn from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I land. It's kind of Mr. Smith goes to a Washington-type movie with some variations but the same premise. I recorded this movie cable a year ago because I had a great deal of Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is very unlikely that some cocktail presenters will get a significant job in the government just because they saved a big blow to life. It made me laugh and made me crazy at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she found were so ridiculous, I have to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD). It made me crazy to think that our government is creating a central citizen as it was created. And the speech he made at the end ... beautiful. Too bad that many people do not have such guts in real life.
