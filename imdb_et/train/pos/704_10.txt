This movie, as low a budget as it is, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you agree that it is a low budget from the start, then you can evaluate how good the story is, how well it is written, and how big the filmmaker is to produce something so wonderful with so little money. > <br /> All the great movie elements are here. Visual images, although digital, were sometimes excellent. The bizarre, dreamy feeling of the movie has been captured very well on the scene of the dog being spoken, this scene was simply amazing. This is a trippy job, but it is not done with caution, and so I have a lot of respect for this movie. It is highly recommended for anyone looking for something unique and fascinating and different from many repetitive movies.
