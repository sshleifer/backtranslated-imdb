I sincerely hope that at least one Cosby season will appear on the DVD one day. The classic fun is with Hilton's eccentric genius George (played by late Roscoe Lee Browne). It reflects the classic rivalry of brothers and the love between brothers whose lives have been different, but both were happy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad excelled in the chemistry they shared with the Cosby Show for years and who put them on the middle level, showing the dimensions they can take as an artist. <br /> <br /> Comedic Dynamite List ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... the classic genius!
