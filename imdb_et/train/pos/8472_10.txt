I totally agree. I thought it was a great movie for kids. Like wells on the gilligans island and the promise of barely known dana plato.it, it was disneylike and could not be effortlessly as meaningless fluff. shouldn't have been. I wouldn't finish the end. But it was unusual how it was made. I mean, children's characters were great and I didn't know what to expect. The plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say that these kids were experts in fishermen it is very important that the plot especially initially. also help them out of jam towards end.it is plus plus not too long.I think this clock is less than 95 minutes
