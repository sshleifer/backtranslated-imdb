It was a divine film. A real feeling-good movie when you need it. The story is light (it hasn't disappeared from the wind), but sometimes it needs a plot. Fun and warm characters, fantastic exemplary and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also in TV show ER) has a role to play in this role. He's definitely a new bright star in Hollywood. Everyone should keep an eye on him, he will be great in the future. <br /> <br /> The sound of this movie was also impressive. A nice mix of contemporary and Indian stories. I danced during the movie. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended how fun a movie is.
