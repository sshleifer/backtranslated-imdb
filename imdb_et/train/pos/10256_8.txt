The first installment of this notorious horror rhythm is presented as if it was a film of snuff discovered by the producers, created as a tape for amateur cameras, with a bottom digital timer. It presents a woman who is abducted by a black-clad male gang who tortured her several days before she finally killed her. An unfortunate victim is beaten terribly and with raw meat tongs before his nails are pulled out of the pliers, a hand with a broken hammer, a punctured needle, and so on. <br /> <br /> The scene, the woman's captors are burning it with hot water and the live puss fall into the burn. The series got a lot of publicity when American actress Charlie Sheen, who thought the series had real murders, tried to ban it from spreading in the United States. The FBI investigation showed that the films were just the ones they seemed to be for most viewers - recreating the sick using uncomfortable but obvious special effects. This film has led the third and fourth episodes on the stage of the well-known Japanese comic book artist Hideshi Hino, a sure way to clean all but the most tolerant spaces. But gorehounds probably won't find anything special.
