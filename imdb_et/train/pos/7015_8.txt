Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who practically gives the store a surprise. Which IRS Agent Is It? <br /> <br /> Most of us have heard a line from an IRS agent, "Hello, I'm an IRS. I'm here to help." Then our smile spreads, saying, "Yes, right." <br /> <br /> If you continue this story forward, you can't exclude this man. It goes to easily audited individuals. What is his motive? Is he another planet, an angel, a rich man who wants to do good? It will help as much as we want it to be our auditor if we, of course, audit it. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (jokes, just jokes) <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is perfect and so much that the clues have been ignored, which would have told me what's really happening. Intense, intense repetition, focusing on Ben and staying there. The whole movie only works for Ben because we're trying to figure it out and I didn't see any clues (what are you talking about, Willis?). There was no better way to go here before watching a DVD movie. At the end of the movie I finally put it together. Well, that was obvious. And yes, it's up, but still a great story, mainly because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Did Smith have to apply for the best actor award? The rest was also very good. Yes, it is up and despite excellent action and when you finally get all the answers, you need to understand that the film's message is wrong. What is a message? Believe me, you don't have to get too many clues to figure it out. I didn't. Violence: No. Gender: Yes, but nothing to get excited about. Bland. Nudity: No. Language: No.
