When I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s, I was in the middle of my teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see it because I thought I had grown up and out of "Sesame Street / Muppets". I do not remember honestly whether I liked it or not. But somewhere in the college I watched this movie again and it ended (and stayed) in my personal Best Films Ever collection. <br /> <br /> This movie is LOADED with humor that goes beyond what would have been expected of Muppet. I mean, Muppets has always turned to adults and children because humor is directed to both generations. But come on ... Janice has accidentally heard someone say, "I don't take my clothes to anyone, even if it's artistic ..." Daddy's joking to the son that if the son loves Sermon Frog then Dad doesn't want to hear it. Gonzo rescues the chicken with a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) And then says, "I think we're busy now ..." and many other moments on the film were on me. Add to this very intelligent dialogue a very intelligent New York / Broadway "lips eye" humor, the usual large number of celebrities and some really enjoyable songs that do not limit "child-level cheesy" ... this movie is a masterpiece! I don't throw "10" regularly ... but it deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film is full, perhaps even more. The muppets have never been and never are funny and intelligent and just brilliant when the movie was and is. --- Q
