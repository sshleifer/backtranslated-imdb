I saw the ZP when it was first released and found it to be a great disappointment. Its script seemed forced and arched and too fake. It is too early and ridiculous. And to be honest, I was still under the love spell called BLOWUP. Now, "love" has twisted with any nostalgia that it creates and, well. . . Good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But the time when time and time have been for ZP and time has been a teacher to me. I watch this movie again every ten years and it gets better and better compared to the age. And ZP is his own "experience" and it is really linked to BLOWUP through its creator, the late, great Mr. Antonion. Twelve years ago I had a great fortune to see it completely. Printed, correctly sized, restored by an Italian government cultural institution who knows a good work of art when he sees it, and knows how important it is to keep that beauty in good shape. I still remember the audience when the first blow of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand-volts visual shock that Antonion had deliberately given us a new level of awareness. And what follows from this point is a completely different "place". <br /> <br /> It is surprising to me how this film comes to itself. <br /> <br /> For the second time I saw it --- in the early 1980s, I was beginning to feel attached to the film as a whole, and especially towards Daria and Mark. Considering that before these two seemed to be Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard's (read: Romeo and Julia) smart-alecky shadow version, they were now with me and especially the girl. He took the time. . . To live. Everybody who dies dies around him. <br /> <br /> After the theater escaped, the daylight of reality began to quickly erase its new "pleasure" found. The 80s of the Bent Shoulder Padded Large Hairs Whispered "But That's Hippie Fantasy --- Let It Go" <br /> <br /> The power of Antonion's vision, I had already realized, had already worked inside me FIRST time so I I answered "80s" "Uh-Huh" and watched my "love" secretly, predominantly and jealously. <br /> <br /> But this is what good art lives in you and if you want it to have its own way and "loves" you back: secretly, jealously and peculiarly. And you get "changed". <br /> <br /> It was exciting to see that Turner's classic film had decided to show ZP in its March lineup. Undoubtedly, the ZP must be viewed on a giant screen so that it can truly bring you into the built environment. But hey, sometimes even a photo of a beloved newspaper is no better than a glimpse. <br /> <br /> Today, reality has hit, ZP has been mysteriously removed and replaced with ALICE'S RESTORANI spices. <br /> <br /> So it's too "hard", "too distracting", too "what"? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's like everything in good art lives when everything dies. <br /> <br /> Peace.
