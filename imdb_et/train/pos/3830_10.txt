The first time my best friend and we were sitting to watch this movie, we watched it in Alex Winter's Bill & Ted fame. We didn't know what to expect beyond who and what it was. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, we knew it was love at first sight. This film, though not entirely historically accurate, was and is the best of his genre. I've seen other movies that represent the history of this famous summer, and I don't think anyone can compare. It fixed a bit of detail, but these parts didn't make the story just elegant and romantic. I've seen other movies this summer and I find most of them good, but none of them are as enchanting as this. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has painting features.

Passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era. From the thoughts and discussions of science, religion, and philosophy, the legend "Frankenstein." <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (who is not married at that time, Shelley played beautiful and talented Alice Krige. She is a control factor for all who continue until she gives her experience. But she Standing on his ground and experiencing things under his own conditions, like his mother and father inherited strength, his actors and actors were ideal for the parts they played. Music fits. The direction pulled the nature of summer as I read it. This film was based on Anne Edwards' If you like this movie, read the book. The author takes the story of what he was able to put together from the real magazines of Mary Godwin Shelley and other participants in that story. <br /> <br /> If you are a human, who loves history (even a few inaccuracies) from time to time) and romance and gothic, this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of a monster that teaches us today about the moral of "playing God". <br /> <br /> You must see a movie!
