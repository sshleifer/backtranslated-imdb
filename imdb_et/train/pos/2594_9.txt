This film took Jerry Springer's approach to supreme power. "Wilder Napalm" is such a theme-based film that I love, discussing the idea that American prodigies are defined by their gifts or their attempt. However, the film emphasizes that every prodigy is only a human being, no longer afraid or worshiped as any other person. It was a great comedy, fun and a person with this little satirical edge.
