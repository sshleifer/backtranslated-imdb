Not really a big box, but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie <br /> <br />. James "I did some things for Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> wrote and directed this movie from a regular, average man <br /> <br /> named Larry Burrows, who thinks his life would have been > <br /> is incredibly different when it hits the home baseball game. <br /> <br /> When he was 15. But thanks to the mysterious and magical barman <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry will get his wish, but soon he will realize that his new life is not exactly as he hoped . <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie really impressed me. Critics have confused it and I have to say that the concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> well drawn. Yes, it's a little standard, but packing enough <br /> <br /> funny moments, drama and great action to make it truly <br /> <br />. James Belushi (guess) was worthy of the Oscar for his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo stand out in their roles <br /> <br />. Michael Caine is the perfect bartender. It's just a good film with a good lesson. If you have never seen, I suggest you check
