"Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle" is confirmed by Timothy Spall's excellent result. <br /> <br /> Although we can predict that his close, close teacher has some kind of break or catharsis based on some of his past secrets of how his emotions are discovered, it is surprising. The number of feelings on Spall is quite moving and more than usual as part of Mike Leigh's repertoire. <br /> <br /> Although the expected boring school bus tour is only used as comics such as "Simpsons", this central situation in which Rhidian Brook's Scripture is visited by the Salisbury Cathedral is well-hidden and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost officially divided into acts. <br /> <br /> We introduce British racially and religiously diverse children (with their uniforms I could not say whether it is a "private" or "public" school) as they collect? Black Children, Serious South Asians and Muslims, White Bullying and Girls? but is transmitted quite naturally and individually. Young actors, some of whom I recognized on British television, such as "Shameless", were highly representative of the usual high social pressure of young people. Celia Imrie puts more control over the role of the supervisor than the marinets she usually has to play. <br /> <br /> Breaking a trip will result in some changing crisis, while others will remain fun. We think that, like Ben Miles '' Binding '' teacher, we are feeding the spoon a didactic lesson of religious tolerance, but it is much more of a belief in people and in God, so the BBC showed it in England during Easter and BBC America showed it in the US during Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was so good at 'Summer of Love', is a key to Mr Harvey's redemption that could have played for the week's announcement, but touches them when they unexpectedly arrive at each other (unfortunately I saw the ads because of their intense scene). <br /> <br /> Although it is a bit of a silent movie on many occasions, calling this journey a "pilgrimage", this silent movie was the best "male will" when I've seen most of the holiday TV movies.
