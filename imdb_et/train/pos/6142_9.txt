A delightful Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in fine form as a middle-aged spinster whose interests turn to witchcraft in World War I in England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 years old. part. She is Jessica Fletcher again, but this time it is very useful or very dangerous for children and mother England. <br /> <br /> The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor in sorcery to try to get some information about witchcraft. These 3 small gifts sent to live with Price to escape the London bombings are wonderful from our wonderful film, regardless of their age. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe have done so little work on this pleasant film. <br /> <br /> I really thought of Ben Stiller's movie - "Night in the Museum" at the end of the movie when the relic lives alive to fight the Nazi invasion in a small British coastal town.
