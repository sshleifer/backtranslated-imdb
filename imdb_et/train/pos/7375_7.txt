Not on the same level with a circle (or a circle 2), but still with good Japanese horrors. I want the North American horror makers to take a page out of the Japanese horror and put more "horror" and less cheap shocks on their rails. There are many good examples in it, scenes in which a young white actor wants to mute the face, suddenly showing the pictures of the wall, smiling for a few seconds and more. It's worth seeing if you like the genre.
