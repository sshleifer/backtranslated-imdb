Their perfidy opening is the most creative and pleasurable part of the film, although it takes a modest turn due to violent rape ... When Rob Roy is finally forced to rebel against the English soldiers, this action becomes well understood, ending with a dictated duel of him and his blade. Liam Neeson injects heroism and passion for his character ... He is intelligent, fair and virile ... He carries his height of grace like a small community of Scottish leader ...
