In this film, JUST was made when the product code was enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie and Patsy Kelly is a dirty, male-backed Kitty. The Missouri girl starts with the girls on the train, where Eadie promises to make money when she searches for a millionaire spouse who is healthy in this process. The meeting with Frank Cousins ​​does not take long, (Lewis Stone was a friendly doctor at Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy's "Andy Hardy" films.) But it's not as it seems. Censors must be on LOVED Harlow's line "The girl couldn't accept such an expensive gift as a gentleman if she didn't." Later, someone says, "You know we've never been alone" and Eadie says "Yes, and we're not going to be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, the second rich, top-down crisis that comes to her rescue when Eadie looks for trouble. At one point, Paige says, "You should scratch me off my list - I'm not a ladies man" .... I don't know what that line would have been a few years earlier before Hayes code came to the city. What did he really say? Carol Tevis seems to have a high quality "Baby Talker" listed on IMDb credits. It seems he was only in showbiz 1931-1939, where "Munchkin" Ozz wizard is the last part he played. A fun, clean romp when girls are pursuing men all over the country. Watch Nat Pendleton as a life-saver who was a film star of the 1920 Olympic silver medal (he was in many Dr. Kildares and appeared on four Harlow films).
