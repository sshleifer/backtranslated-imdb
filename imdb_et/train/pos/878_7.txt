Interesting signs, lots of tension. Black and white are black and white. I was turned off when it was accidentally supposed to be a sympathetic mainstream character, a quiet, deaf secretary, to turn to a crime to destroy colleagues, to make people go harder and eventually to participate in the desert, and create someone who is being attacked. as a lure to go your own. I have somewhat overshadowed the tendency that otherwise high-quality films depict criminals sympathetically, without engaging in the harm they have done to others, except for portraying their immediate opponents as twitches. In this film, we never know who the money is actually fleeing, or what happens to an innocent woman who is used by a loyal deaf secretary to create a bar owner to fall for lost looting. Too bad, the film could have been great.
