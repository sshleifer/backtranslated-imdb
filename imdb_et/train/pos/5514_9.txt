I looked at some two days ago and I saw another part today. Of course, these two parts of the world are separate from each other so I am a little shaken by everything I just saw. I felt I learned about the inevitability of Che's death; for me it reflected the whole movie. I think that is exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to know, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. The second part was so modest compared to the inevitable again, but in Cuba it was positive and so negative in Bolivia. Bolivian movement policy was rarely referred to, but usually didactically respond. For me, all the memorable scenes at the end of the film were a confrontation with a prison and a softer conversation with a Bolivian official, where official questions about Che's failure on the part of peasants to support their revolution. I did not regard the national differences that played the same role as the conflict, the Argentines and the Bolivians. I thought Soderbergh inevitably dealt with the inevitable problems of supply in the revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without peasants who are not enough. It struck me how hard it would be to try something like Che's test. I think it's all in timing; whether it is enough for the government to start the anger movement; There was no Bolivia. In a letter sent to her Fidel, Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutions: if not now, in 50 years. Very meaningful provocative and well-made film; do everything to see it.
