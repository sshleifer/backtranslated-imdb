I think the story's context is covered with other posters, so I just want to write about the effect of this movie on me. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I saw this movie year when it was released in 1987. My school organized a cinema to see it for the RU project. We were all excited, of course, because we were in a cinema at school! Little did we know what we were going to experience. To date, I still remember the feelings that it has given me, and I remember crying like most of my friends. I think we were at the time that we found it shocking and silent in our youthful way. It was such an effect on me that I joined Anti Apartheid in the same year. <br /> <br /> I think you have served this goal.
