Great movie. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains on the film belonged to the Hungarian National Railways (M√ÅV) and it is clear that they were used on large trains, not on local railways - the story of Chikatilo rose to its victims by local railway stations. Moreover, the film is great.
