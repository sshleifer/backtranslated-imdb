I love this TV series so much. it contains an animation that is interesting and beautiful. I can't believe they are interrupting this on TV and also that I never knew whether cybersix and data7 would die or not would probably survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the best TV show. I know the delay so I hope they start the series again, so I'm really glad I can watch it. I LUVED IT SOIF <3 <br /> <br /> that women are under cybersix, he is not a human. She goes to Adrian Sieldman, a male teacher. Now, cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she's just a hidden man of the day. Night cybersix patrol visits the city. > <br /> If u never looked at it, then u should download it completely. It was the world's best TV show. Why did they cut it off? some people have problems. but i'm glad to see 13 episodes.
