My scalp is still crying out of the burnt fires that have hit it when I love this movie. Bring Coal; I also walk around them to say once again that I love "Bend it like Beckham". This confession has a lot of "despite". It's a little movie of the week; the scenario is by paint. And most worryingly, the director's comment refers to the fact that in this film, beauty can be found mainly in skin whites. <br /> <br /> The genius of the movie is not Syd-obvious. , themes, construction. It is both on the surface and deep, but not on the layers of artistic soil that are most often scratched by observers. A powerful, sometimes semi-coated female body that is not just a showcase but captures football football, does a better job of female force and agility naturalization than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi ever. These are the real bodies (except Keira Knightley) whose work is not the first to look and hit later. They are the working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self-determination. And in my book, actress actor Parminder Nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on the screen? not only because he can demand that this hackneyed adjective, "luminous", but because his performance has honesty and insecure intelligence, which is absolutely convincing. <br /> <br /> The result is that women can enjoy without a feeling as they make a devil pact to do so. Like Chadha's "Bride and Prejudice", the relationship between women and chemistry shines, which cannot be properly put into the "best friends" or "nurses" of Sweet Valley High. Maybe Chadha is even right in her commentary to lose the flirting of the movie with lesbianism. "Bend it like Beckham" has electricity that cannot be reduced to a simple hetero / homosexual love triangle. The exact nature of this joy is ultimately a bit of a mystery? it's still seductive. <br /> <br /> Yes, and did I mention it's fun?
