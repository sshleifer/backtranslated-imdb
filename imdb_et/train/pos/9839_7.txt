Hmmm, this episode is extremely underestimated. <br /> <br /> Although there are many bad writing and parts running. I think good wins bad. <br /> <br /> I love origami parts and great "twisting" at the end. I love this scene when Michelle is against Tony. It's actually one of my first season's favorite scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated the episodes of reincarnation, but I've always liked them. They are not the best in writing. but the topic really interests me, <br /> <br /> I give him three stars, but if writing would be a little more consistent, I'd give it to four.
