I was just looking at the good parody of this living dead night and I have to say that it was so terrible and so funny that it was great. This film included all the antics and scenery shots that were originally a cemetery, an abandoned house, a basement, and a front lawn. What I especially love about this movie is the comic use of bread and all the usual household enemies are baking. We know that toasters, toasters and zippers have made tens of times the bread, and now we need to call for their help to fight the renewed bread. In addition to cheap action and voice transmissions, this short horror movie is the personal favorite parody of my living dead night, even better than the lively dead night of 1990. <br /> <br /> I think this makes the movie you want to watch is how the writers and directors used the whole dialogue from the original film and turned it around the bread, including how the bread was refreshed and avoiding residues because they are particularly dangerous. Another big reason I love this movie is that there is no exception to what the bread is evil, the bagels are evil, and even communion is evil, as illustrated by a fun scene with a newsletter and a rather monotonous priest. I think the actors are particularly humorous, making the bread slices (ie the car scene) attack visually. I think the end is very worthy to surround it. <br /> <br /> Even if it is short and "Terrorist Revenge Bride Sons Day" Evil Attack, Mutant, Alien, Meat Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: Shocking 2-Ds is arguably the second A great parody, it is still recommended as a great horror parody that seems to be college filmmakers. I recommend this movie to anyone who is able to live a dead night and still stay with filmmakers. I'd also like to recommend this movie to anyone who loves D-movies and horror parodies, it's just a wonderful little short horror movie that is fun to watch and learn.
