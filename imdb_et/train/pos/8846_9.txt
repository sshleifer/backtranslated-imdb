I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Snowman. The best word I can describe is crazy. It throws the viewer for an hour and fifty minutes and won't let you breathe until the credit ends. Trust me, this movie will keep you all the way. <br /> <br /> The story is very well designed and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story. The action is amazing from all the leaders and even from the small parts, excellent cast. I also loved cinematography, it gave him a real sense of being an independent film. It was all great. <br /> <br /> This movie is exciting, exhausting and heartbreaking. It's hard to look, but you're glad you did.
