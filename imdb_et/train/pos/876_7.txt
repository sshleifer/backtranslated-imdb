Super, unusual movie from Audiardist, Read My Lips is a pulpy, lonely heart thriller. It is perfectly suited to Vincent Cassel's harsh charisma and provides a great performance by Emanuelle Devos. Devos has the Audiard's recurring feature in the same way as KArin Viard appears to Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unusually beautiful (everyone who is unlikely in this film), versatile and capable of subordinating to the profile. <br /> <br /> It is almost a definition of his role as Carla, an office dog in office, whose colleagues use deafness. However, he finds that Cassel in the former con Paul is as you want. Everyone uses unconventional talents (theft and lips reading) to fight through their situation and form an unusually romantic approach. Devos / Audiard manages Carla's deafness and the accompanying, twisted inner world to discreet, stylish elegance. <br /> <br /> In this movie (2001), Audiard is already clearly in control of her tension, action, and investment in her frame. with a truly visceral experience that will turn into a big blow - a prophet for nine years. 7/10
