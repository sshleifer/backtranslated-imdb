I remember that before it appeared in 1993, I showed the promo of this exhibition. So I was 8 years old and now, at the age of 22, it seems strange that this cult exhibition has seen the beginning and the end and look back. Suddenly it looks so far away that big decade. Anyway, I always looked at MonsterVision because I'm a fan of horror and horror films. It was like the 90s version of Chiller Theater. When MST3K gets a DVD, why not show Joe Bob, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many of Joe Bob's comments and information about the movies were just fun. Most of the films shown at the exhibitions were in B or C, but it also showed a lot of A-House movies, as well as England's Hammer movies, which are both the top and many with Ray Harryhausen's staging traffic. Many were strange things that you didn't see elsewhere like Japanese Sci-Fi movies, of course Godzilla, which is familiar to almost all independent movies like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade of film retention and more independent thinkers, I think MonsterVision would be a good show for IFC because they already hit the IFC grinding house exhibition. I'm sure this exhibition will be lifted again for a few days for nostalgia reasons, I think you have to wait and see. So far "it's great for television"!
