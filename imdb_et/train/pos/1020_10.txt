"Stargate SG-1" follows intergalactic studies of the SG-1 team through a device called Stargate and all the surprises on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> Having seen this series at random, this is the first few seasons when it first came out, I didn't know how good this series would be, 10 years after I had seen the last episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the best made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever created. And why? Because it works with an amazing assumption. <br /> <br /> The value of this series greatly exceeds the value of the movie it is based on, and I think it is a very good example that television, as a tool, is capable of providing something that does not work within the movie time limit . A long-standing familiarity with the characters, looking at the characters and their situation over time, is stunning and simply adds to the ability to stop disbelief, and that's all due to terrible writing and the entire team's commitment to "Stargate SG-1" offered great adventures in ten years, but was not afraid never challenged the movement of the plot and gave the opportunity to show very different time periods. - <br /> <br /> - First Seasons, Until 4-5. Until then, much more focused on the study of planets and different situations, keeping episodes rather unrelated, if not always threatening Goaul. <br /> <br /> - From the 5th to the 7th, there were more and more episodes focused on fighting Goaul and preventing attacks on Earth. After this season, planetary exploration was almost the only pretext for placing sg-1 over the Goaul / replicator / slave conflict. <br /> <br /> The 8th season is probably the most confusing. It has a stream of episodes that include smaller land issues, where the Stargate is hardly mentioned, but recent episodes have some great copy moments. 9th and 10th trip together because they have the same new enemy and Jack O'Neil. They are both good moves, although the first episodes of the tenth season are a bit weak because they seem to be a little more than SG-1 and the man / Jaffa will lose the battle after fighting Ori. <br /> <br Basically, after the 7th season, the investigation was carried out on a background that was, in many ways, ashamed of the potential and mystery of each planet (episode); on the other hand, it made so many great episodes of ongoing conflicts that the change in the exhibition was still working and showing how big and bold the writers were. <br /> <br /> Even hard I believe that the series has a high quality end that will be nicely rested, feeling like I can go on; the people involved were all great professionals and there was a lot to offer in the series. The previous season, which came back to the beginning of the series, was very feasible and would have been very welcome, but ultimately things are as they are. <br /> <br /> Finally, since I was all pleasant, it's a little hard to find that it ends. The big picture, however, is what pulled the work of hundreds of people over ten years, from the dedication of a team of beauty and true testimony, their outstanding actors and characters, which we always remember as the name of the collective SG-1.
