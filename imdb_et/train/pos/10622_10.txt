"The Hate of Minutes" is a stunningly beautiful film. A psychological thriller that will take you on a journey through a nightmare that is the life of Eric Serial, a serialist. Strong performances and great cinematography make this film a "must-see" for any film student or spooky fan. The story of reality and Eric's human side separate this movie from other psycho-killer films. Some film producer Bruce Campbell and the shouts of The Evil Dead add humor to anyone who knows the genre.
