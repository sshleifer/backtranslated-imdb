Zentropal has a lot in common with the Third Man, the second noir-like film, located in the post-war European crush. Like TTM, the camera has found a lot of work. It is an innocent American who is emotionally connected to a woman whom he does not really understand, and whose naivety is even more striking than the natives. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that the Third Man has a well-designed story. Zentropa is a little open in this respect. Perhaps it is deliberate: it is presented as a dream / nightmare and making it too uniform would ruin its effect. <br /> <br /> This movie is consistently grim - "noir" in more than one sense; never see the sun shine. Grim, but intriguing and scary.
