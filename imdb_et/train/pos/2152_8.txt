There were some great moments of reality that represent today's life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). This shows what culture can be a culture of culture and who want to break out of the form you have created. <br /> <br /> Dancing was just a tool to say "do what you love, even if it is against the norm". Rather than Billy Elliot as I would say. I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Humor was well timed and the touching moments felt so real, you could feel the discomfort between Sugiyama and his wife in the tantric dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and his wig and his dancing floor made me rush! <br /> <br /> All the actors did a great job, the story was well written. I looked at it a second time and tried some of the small nuances that I missed the first time I was watching. Good entertainment!
