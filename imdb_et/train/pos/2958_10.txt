The epic funny proportions of comedy boys who brought you South Park, and most of Orgazmo's boys. This vulgar, hidden film is completely nasty, eggotistic and satirical. It represents an incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals. I LOVE IT!!!!! It's funny stuff. Very funny. Two loser friends create a game on their own driveway, which explodes the national feeling. Corruption and greed and blackmail are changing the acidity of the sport and reducing it upwards. And you laugh along the way. Much. It's all there. Enjoy !!!!
