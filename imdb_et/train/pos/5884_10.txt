Really, I liked it. The assumption was good, the story fit where both of the respective series were left behind and here is my favorite. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a particular series and refuse to talk about or come together (the best example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie had said she would be eager to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I'd be looking for you ... ... but if it doesn't work well, it can be restarted.
