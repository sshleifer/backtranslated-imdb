I felt obliged to look at the adaptation of "Jane Eyre" by Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke in 1983 because I just wrote an article on BBC "Jane Eyre" for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> I looked at how I approached homework. <br /> <br /> I was first upset. The lighting in this version is bad. Everybody / everyone is washed in a light, which in some scenes puts a shadow behind the characters. <br /> <br /> Sound is poorly recorded. I felt I was listening to high school playing. <br /> <br /> Pancake make-up is too hard. <br /> <br /> And the kits don't deliver the full Gothic mood from the novel. They're too harsh Martha Stewart too. I just don't see how Bronte's Rochester follows Martha Stewart's domestic orders. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in a cave-like darkness, which was very suitable for the novel's Gothic mood. <br /> <br /> And more ... with all these objections ... not only is it the best "Jane Eyre" it's seen, it can be any novel I've ever seen is the best. <br /> <br /> This "Jane Eyre", despite her technical mistakes, made me feel like I was reading "Jane Eyre" for the first time. <br /> <br /> The critics of this production say it is too close to the book. For me, who rated this book and did not need less "word" or less "Christian" or more sexual, the loyalty of this version to the "Bronte" novel is actually his best asset. <Br>> Bronte wrote a good book. There's a reason why it has lasted 150 years, while others, slicker, sexier and simpler texts have disappeared. <br /> <br /> As a long fan of Jane Eyre, I was biased against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is probably not beautiful; Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly couple of literature. And Timothy Dalton is nothing, if not amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> But Dalton is giving Rochester outstanding results. He just blew me away. I've never seen anything like his full commitment to role, text, dialogue, and Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton brings the page to Rochester's screen to shake life. <br /> <br /> Rochester is designed to be a little scary. Dalton is scary. Welles also got a scary line, for example, when he shouts "Enough!" after Fontaine plays a short piano. But Dalton is scary more than once. You really can't tell if he's going to hurt Jane or hurt himself. <br /> <br /> Rochester's imperative, his humor, his rage, his vulnerability: Dalton transmits everything, sometimes in seconds. It's stunning. <br /> <br /> And here's an important thing - an actor who performs Rochester has to convey that he has spent more than ten years full of despair, lonely, living an ugly, life-destroying secret No other actor I've seen this part of the black hole of despair, as Timothy Dalton does. The current fan player Toby Stephens doesn't even try. Dalton gets out of the park. When I saw Timothy Dalton presenting Rochester in a single bar, I would say, "This guy is in trouble. Don't even look at him." He's this radioactive, tortured agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is generally not the best Jane I've ever seen, one of the few Janes that manufacturers were ready to pour when the book gives Jane. No, people who only know "Jane Eyre" from the 2006 version, Bronte did not describe the static, robust Jane with finely curved eyebrows and pouti lips. Rather, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is really poor, plain, obscure, and little and NOT quite real. <br /> <br /> Zelah has a small mouth, a close eye and a little nose. He's really "small". She's not a fashion model. And he's the best Jane, the most serious book. <br /> <br /> Some described him as cold or dull. No, he's true to the book. Bronte's Jane is not a red hot mother, she is a protected, deprived teenager whose inner passions come out only at the key moments, as Zelah does here. The book Jane is someone you need to look at slowly, carefully, patiently, attentively if you really want to spend your depth. You have to look at Zelah to find out who he really is. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to have more fire in Zelah in one key position, but this is a scene from five hours otherwise it is very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to text, this version, like any other version I've seen, has completely discovered Christian themes in Jane's Eyre. "Christianity is not a casual subtitle in" Jane Eyre ", it is central. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, counter-cultural way to read and live, she's probably killed, squeezed It is Christianity and a Christian God who persuades the poor, ordinary, obscure Jane of his equal worth, his need to live up to his ideals and the rejection of his main marriage proposal. It is not entirely clear here. <br /> <br /> Igal in the case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, sophisticated, rich novel and customization of everything I've seen, mines and honors, the latest customization I've seen and says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions that don't respect the book If you don't care about what Charlotte Bronte says about the abuse of children or the hypocrisy of a culture based on appearance and money, your great book is handing something that people move fast to reach the kissing scene of Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like the Bronte novel, realizes that all Bronte wrote - Jane's experience in Lowood and her relationship with John is part of what makes Jane's relationship with Rochester as explosive and unforgettable.
