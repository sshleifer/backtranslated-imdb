Two shopkeepers in the leather goods shop are secret because they correspond to the aliases of the box number. As part of this simple idea and everyday life, Lubitsch produces rich intelligence, drama, poignance and irony that never let up. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average pair of real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plot and jokes. Although Stewart's major films 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith) have been wrongly captured, it is easily parametric, and we enjoy a whole range of subtitles that other movies don't see.
