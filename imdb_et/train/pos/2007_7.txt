My personal opinion is that this movie didn't have a real story for the first John carpenter vampires, but I don't care about loved it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. He's really crazy, I believe he was a person you never thought he was famous for ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. Like the story, the film should have been more. It should have been the film's track that followed the story of the film and they should have kept the same basic characters in all three vampire films. I really liked the clothes that people wore and what they chose in Mexico. I liked how it was old Mexico and not new Mexico. clay houses and old fashion collections. I was a little confused with vampires and how they could walk in churches, but it was cool how they did not follow the Dracula vampire rules.
