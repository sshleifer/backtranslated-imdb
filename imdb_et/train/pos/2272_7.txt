Nick Nolte gives an excellent result in the dark story of Kurt Vonnegut. The Notle is played by Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent during propaganda during World War II. After the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions want to dig up their past. As with Vonnegut's great work, it is meditation for the absurdity of war and for people using propaganda. Nolte is fantastic - confident and confident than the younger Campbell, and then broken and haunted as an older man forced to reconcile his past sins. (7 out of 10)
