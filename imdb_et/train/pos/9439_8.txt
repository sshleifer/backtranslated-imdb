Before watching this movie, I had a lot of it and heard some scenes in the movie, but listening didn't do it for me, so I was planning to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds create an interesting group of individuals who are fucking on the Cahulawassee River and a series of unfortunate events that are visible to all of them. Creating a character takes time for the better understanding of every person, but at the end you know them as they were your friend. Functional, dialogue is very real, as close to reality as you become Hollywood actors. Reynolds character "Lewis" was interesting when a man who comes very harsh but under men's plywood is a very soft and broken man (I had the impression of his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the most focused, regrettable circumstances that seem to him indeed, from every corner, painfully, formalize and water it between the other person (the transition of his character was great). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really look like silly lunkheads who just want to go out and don't seem too terrible if they don't, and they did ... I was really surprised by the director Boorman's vision of Dickey's novel, very surprised. Without watching this movie, you can't go all your life. I give him eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
