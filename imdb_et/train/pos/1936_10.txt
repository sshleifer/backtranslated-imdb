this independent film was one of the best films at the high grass film festival I've ever seen there, I loved so many things that were great about the film, besides what I and the team had the opportunity to meet were completely phenomenal. that Avi did a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely true to his role as a Disney actor, who was surprised by his talent to be able to go from cheese teen comedy to an adult role that has no problem if the film's talent was just amazing. you want to see an independent movie, this is one you should see. I think Mr Gruver would have been so proud that he would have performed such a show at his festival, and his parents loved the movie as much as he won the audience's favorite they went and saw it again. it was really a great movie, it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional, it was just fabulous. I'm just so enthusiastic about this movie and I really don't want to see it for anyone because it's really surprised because I think these filmmakers really want to go and I hope to see more work in the future.
