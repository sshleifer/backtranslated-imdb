Rated E (includes violence). <br /> <br /> I had an original spiderman game for a couple of years for the PC. I'm still not beaten because there is one level in Windows XP that I can't win because it is. It must be warned if you have XP.But for those who don't have XP to give this game a try. pure family game action and its great for every spiderman fan.In the game you play spiderman and you take different criminals who commit crimes.Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to some spiderman fans or parents who want their kids a fun and clean game . <br /> <br /> 8/10
