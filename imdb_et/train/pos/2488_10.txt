For me, the last scene where Harris responds to the press is worthy of this intelligent and timeless policy (especially the campaign phase). If only "real life" bolts respond intelligently, formulated, like Mr Harris, then arrogant, self-serving journalists, or twice before unnecessary, contradictory "garbage", have nothing to do with the ability of candidates to deal effectively with the challenges of the agency they deal with.
