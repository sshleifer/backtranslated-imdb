Great, great, great! That's all I can say about this movie, but I want to have at least four lines of text so I'll specify. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is so cute!), The music was great (in the sixties the best music was ever, imho), the historical material was interesting and so it was the 90's actors seem to have actually been in the 60s. And above all, the stories of the main characters have brought tears to my eyes and that is the greatness of any drama. ONE WORD: GREAT!
