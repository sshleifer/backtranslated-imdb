I went to this movie knowing something about it and really ended up enjoying it. It lacked authenticity and credibility - Some of the things the characters said and did were completely odd and a lot of the script seemed to be ad-libbed (maybe it's typical for Woody Allen? Excuse me for ignorance), but the whole audience in the theater was so hard. It wasn't even in the movie jokes, but in the whole movie. The action reminded me of Seinfeld's action, where he tries not to laugh at his jokes - they are horns, but if you don't take the movie too seriously, you can really appreciate ACTORS, not CHARACTERS humor. If you are looking for a casual movie and you like Woody Allen, I definitely recommend it!
