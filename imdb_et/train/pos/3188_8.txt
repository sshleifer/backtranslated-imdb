I had the worst day of my life. Then I stumbled upon this cute movie, watched it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss the street light. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only looked at it for two reasons: VERA-ELLEN LEGS. But that's really so much. The plot is actually pretty smart and creatively knit. It is almost like Shakespeare's comedy, which has all its pleasant misunderstandings. Of course there are ... VERA-ELLEN RIGHTS. The only unfortunate thing about this movie is that the version I bought (the classic collection of Mill Creek Entertainment's 100 collections) is not the best video quality and I've heard about the same Alpha release. Brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so many scenes seem bleached, especially when Vera dances on a white dress. But I think you can compensate for your TV controls. I can only imagine how it '51. Performance sets, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling and cheerfully creepy - a kind of "Caligari Cabinet". <br /> <br /> Romance is just perfect. Not gentle, not infertile, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, you poor schmucks, your unhappy life is never as charming as it is. Har har har. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life sucks as well as your life. Oh fuck. Time to watch this movie again.
