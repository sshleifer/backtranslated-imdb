Crush offers a combination of drama, humor and irony that I think English is very heart related. Mostly known as John McKay, this wonderful scenario has written about forty friends in a small town in England. All three of the male professional women who were happy with the men formed the gathering of ritual ladies' evening with gin, fags, and sweets, which contained endless hatefulness of their mistaken behavior or their libido needs. Andie MacDowell was thrown again by the British neighborhood (that is, where I find that she flees the most) is absolutely charming as the prestigious head of a school who is involved with a younger man. Small town rumors and jealousy (big supporters) are in conflict with his relationship. Solve a series of brutal unfortunate events and show us many difficulties when one is achieving true happiness. Keep in mind that the main prerequisite for this movie is friendship, and the end shows us exactly. This is a movie you love or hate, so I believe that many movie reviews and not the fact that this movie was released was the greatest success. Because I'm sure most have just discovered the movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and suggested to those in movies like "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and Funerals". Not to mention that the soundtrack is exceptionally great to capture these important moments.
