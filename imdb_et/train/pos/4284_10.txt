This film is one of the funniest, sadest and most accurate imaginations of the mentality that seems to be once again in the Balkans over 45 years of time. All ordinary characters and conflicts are combined with anger, sadness and love that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be a more appropriate answer. However, the accuracy of typing and the tedious timing of the types makes it a great movie to understand a bit of what drove to the former Yugoslavia's madness. In fact, no diplomat dealing with this area should do anything before they saw the movie, and his twin, * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Did I mention that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
