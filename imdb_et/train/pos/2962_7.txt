Parker and Stone translate their animated masterpieces into their pacy expledive disobedience humor, usually with good results. Much of the movie is Trey and Matt, who play with their new toy. The plot itself is simplicity: two middle men invent a new sport that is combined with a carriageway with basketball and baseball, which becomes a national craze. Along the way, they experience a number of clich√©s of sports movies and send them along with other popular cultures that come to their sights. It runs like a stretched South Park episode with the usual machine-related dialogue, toilet humor and heartbeat humblers. <br /> <br /> If this film has a weakness, it's a link to our team who gave us the "Lennuk" and "Naked Gun" series. This effect is clearly visible with the heavy use of flat views and the glossy and rather two-dimensional performance of Yasmine Bleeth, usually in the role of Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn plays a bit better company b ** tard, which has been his party "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine, if he can only but must admit that he is perfect for the role of the team owner. /> <br /> For those who haven't noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem more comfortable than rock star wannabes as comics. It manifests itself in highlighting the soundtrack in almost everything they create. As usual, they provide a good choice here, including a mandatory runway with their ultra-non-DVDA DVDA. <br /> <br /> Especially Dian Bachar, who deserves a prize for the difficult task of playing Stanit Parker and Stone's striking couple Cartmans, should be noted. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a fun comedy that is hampered by its full potential, using too much "naked weapon / plane" formula. Parker and Stone could do something really brilliant (or absolutely terrible) when they get full control over the future movie. In America, either lock these guys up or put them in charge.
