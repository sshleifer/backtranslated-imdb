"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially on trailers. Nonetheless, I found a deeper message in it that made me more such a film. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and is given divine authority to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man here as a symbol of God, and although it is not his usual film or one of his best roles, he does a great job with the work he has given. Although the film sometimes has crude oil, Bruce laughs as Bruce divides his soup in half like the Red Sea and customer reactions to him, but also the seemingly retrospective and witty image of God in Freeman. It is sometimes overly exaggerated and some raw humor, but in general it is somewhat funny. There's a good form of help, like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always help. At the end of the film, it turns out to be very romantic and tearful, and the message is clear that we should do what God has called us to do and "be a miracle." The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable and much better than I and many people would have expected, especially when we see the deeper message of the film. <br /> <br /> *** out ** **
