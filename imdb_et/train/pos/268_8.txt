I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (rightly written?) Cybilis. She hasn't seen her for a while and forgotten how much I miss. I thought he did a great job in that. Supportive casting was also pretty good. In some corners, the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The kid was pretty scary and the story was generally good. The young boy was a hottie. I thought the husband had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> Just coming to live movie network and I love these movies. I kept my interest and looked at it again when they restart it. Does anyone want to recommend similar movies? If you want, you can post or send me a personal email. Thanks in advance. Aboutagirly.
