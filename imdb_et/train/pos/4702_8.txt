If this film proves just one thing, that is, Keaton is, was and is always in the comic heart, even when you hear bullets, drive towards an electric chair and reach the wrong end of the prison information line. <br /> But Johnny Dangerously proves even more. In the 1980s, ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were at the top of genre attacks. But there were several bidders on the throne. This time Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High") is trying Heckerling's hand with an amazing number of television writers behind the script (go and check). <br /> <br /> This 1930s police-and-gag-sters movie cunningly throws almost every loop and even adds some clichés that were not back. br /> <br /> And not only is Keaton in the hands of Johnny, but such funny boys and dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and almost all other Hollywood actors, who were in the immediate vicinity. You'd be surprised at how many faces you feel. I know I was. <br /> <br /> And jokes? Well, when they start, they come to you fast and furious like a gun. At first, there is too much to count, Weird Al Yanković's crazy theme song. But you have to look at when they reload. And they need to reload a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everyone is trying, they seem to be fun and I laughed a lot of time. After all, however, there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes might have been more fun - not usually best to think about watching comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night, if there is something good on TV, pop "Johnny" and be ready to "dangerously" seriously laugh. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Check out "Johnny Dangerously" ... don't be "bastidge".
