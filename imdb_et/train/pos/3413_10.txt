Just went out and can't believe what a great documentary. Rarely do you get out of the challenges and challenges. Recently, movies have become so overwhelmed that the excitement of finding something very special and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did this to me when it came out for the first time and this movie is making me now. I didn't know anything about it before I went there and what a surprise. If you hear this concept, you may feel that it is one of those amazing films that talk about the amazing triumph covered with top music and trying to make us completely sure what a great story he is talking about, but then don't let us in. Fortunately, this is not the film. People talk about the story! It does a good job of grabbing every moment of your involvement when we enter our world and feel every second with them. Climbing is so far beyond that it does everything that is so tense. Touching the wobble was also an excellent document on climbing and showing the intensity in an interesting way, but this film is much more of a human story. I saw it today, but I'm going to say it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
