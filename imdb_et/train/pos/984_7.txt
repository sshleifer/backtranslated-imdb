I happened over the "Bait" cable one night as it started and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave her a chance. <br /> <br /> "Feed" is not perfect. It suffers from an unnecessarily flashy direction and accidental foolishness. But in general this film worked. All the elements were just right and they pulled out what would otherwise have been a pretty ugly movie. Most of this, in my opinion, is due to Jamie Foxx. I don't know who marked Foxx's lead but who did it made the movie a big favor. Incredible and amazingly pleasing, Foxx slides through the film, smooth like butter and funny as hell. You can say he works with instinct and instinct does not succeed. <br /> <br /> The plot, though irrelevant, actually binds pretty well, and even has a notch, through which the Foxx symbol grows as a human. Again, they could slip without it, but it just makes things a lot better. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by this low rating. Maybe I just tried this step on the right evening or vice versa, but I would give it 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
