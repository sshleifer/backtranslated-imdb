Heart heart is wonderful. This is an excellent illustration of Gary Gimore, the convicted murderer who applied for death. The heart of the heart shows that Gilmore's family, broken by hatred, went through. This film is an incredible psychological study and is wonderfully frustrating and uplifting. 10/10
