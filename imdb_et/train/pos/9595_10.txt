At the beginning of this movie, one of the commentators says he was told he has two strokes against him: he is black and man. But in addition, he also has a third blow: he is gay. "You must be stronger than you ever imagined," he says. "Paris on Burning" is a documentary about gay black and spanish men who are transgender or transsexual. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris burning" is that director Jennie Livingston takes a theme that could have been very easy to get in a nice exhibition and allows people in her humanity. We learn their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, disappointments, dreams. Some of these dreams are both unattainable and tragic. Many people are seriously denial; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. This nude transsexual movie has shots. If you have a problem with homosexuality, this is not a movie for you. But when you see the movie you understand, "burning Paris" is not really about men wearing women's clothes, it is a group of people that society generally marginalizes and puts down and what they do to get the community feeling in their lives. <br /> <br /> I've been watching this movie four times since 1991 because it says so many things: it's a comment on the materiality of our culture, the gender roles of rich and poor people, the media, and what it stands for about fame and breastfeeding. "Paris is burning" is one of the most humane and saddest films I've ever seen.
