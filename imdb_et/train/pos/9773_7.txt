The plot is really terrible, the atmosphere is really depressive, unusual for low-budget production, and at least for German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, mysterious thriller, and slasher movie were mixed together. The formation of the plot and the characters is great, very close to reality, without the studio atmosphere. It may be perfect, but unfortunately some things were a little disappointing, which inevitably does not have to be for low budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) Sometimes it is no more than average. Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some of them do a good or very good job, but some act like actors in German German exhibitions! But I was very disappointed with Mathieu Carri√®re's behavior! His actions (many of his older films were good on his face) were below average! However, this may be the reason why he is today participating in private channels in dirty German soaps or TV series. <br /> <br /> 2.) Dialogues are sometimes on the soap opera level. <br /> <br /> 3.) Bad sound sometimes made it very difficult to understand what characters are talking about. I saw it on a DVD and I was glad I could restore it and listen to it again. This is due to the set (large halls like hospital or esoteric) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an interesting movie to watch. , far from commercially movies that are often more horrible.
