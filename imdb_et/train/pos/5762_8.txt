I have to admit the enjoyment of bad movies. I love them, I look at them all. Especially horrible. My friends and I all get together after a hard week at school and at work, rent some crazy tapes, order a seal, and get a blast. It had a great box, so I waited less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a residential project built on a nuclear facility that has ground-level layers and another underground layer is simply covered. The inhabitants of this neighbor find a covered space when some children get into the cave. It awakens some zombies. <br /> <br /> From now on, this is a piece of town. Gore effects and action will never end until the end of the credit. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not a great art, but it is with our funny dialogue and overwhelming scary things our favorite evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party birds" I've ever enjoyed. And you could say that it was done without money, a lot of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a kame) and it's just a wild trip.
