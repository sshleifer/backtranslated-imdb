This exhibition is good. I like the actors, the funny bits and its brightness. Participants, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, did great at the shows. The show started off with this funny, illogical basic idea to bring the dead people back to the first series and, frankly, as the people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a little missed, but later had to look good again. And now I really hate to cancel it. Why won't ABC stop working until all episodes have been done? I really want to know how the story begins. I think it should be given the opportunity because there are so many viewers who love it.
