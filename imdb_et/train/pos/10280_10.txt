The House of Games is spell-binding. It is very pleasant to see dozens of films sometimes. There are a few movies I've seen that catch you so fast. Open the scene to get this movie for you. <br /> <br /> I really try not to give them many who haven't seen it yet, but there are few spoilers. READ OUT WHEN YOU ARE NOT KNOWING. <br /> <br /> I would say the House of Games is not just a great movie, but it is the best movie that I have never seen with artists. From the time the movie is over, he starts playing again. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is just perfection, from her creativity to her voice, she immediately enters. Joe Mantegna was also great. The dialogue in this film is almost impossible, and the two people communicate as much as they communicate with their voice. I also liked how the movie was filmed, in such a terrible, surreal way, it was perfect and helped make the movie. <br /> <br /> There were a few movies I've seen and loved to remind me that Grifters and ordinary suspects are involved, but in fact the House of Games is completely different. Margaret and Mike are the two most absorbing characters I've seen on the big screen and not only have the chemistry of the screen that is strong and sensitive from the moment they come in, but the accumulation that begins when they put their eyes on. the other is electric. You know something happens, but you have no idea what. And just when you think you thought it was something, you realize you're not even scratching the surface .... <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of the films that can be a movie a type of genre, but is essentially a film about human nature. Character study is not only the mind of the artist, but also of the victim. As the film moves along and we learn more about the main characters, we do not only know it through what they say, but how they say it. It is an excellent character training and is flawless so it speeds up its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'll do it out of 10 out of 10, call it (though not my absolute favorite movie, pretty high) in the list), definitely more prominent and go so far as to say it's one of the best character studies and contains some of the best "spins" I've seen. While I love all movies and genres when it comes to people's psychic movies, it's really not much better. Watch this movie.
