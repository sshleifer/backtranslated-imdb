"Hollywood North" is the euphemism of the film industry because they went to Canada to make films due to tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case later in Vancouver. Director Peter O'Brian apparently saw many in California intruders that this film seems to be the right way to deal with incoming people trying to exploit the economics provided by Canada. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern," a successful novel by Canadian authors, has become a "Flight to Bogota" that has nothing to do with the original film. Great egoistic - Michael Baytes, who is obsessed with the Iranian case, is offering a leading role that will become a disaster. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have said that too many cooks have broken the broth, which seems to be the case for the end product that its manufacturer, Bobby Myers, is recording. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who has made a documentary about filming in Toronto, part of the film will eventually be transformed into a coherent film. <br /> <br /> The shooting process is fun and generally good.
