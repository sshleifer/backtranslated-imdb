This film was a disaster at the Box Office and is due to the innocence of the film, the story of sweetness. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but it is very good to play, the director tried his best. Abhay is great and impressive, and he repeats his role, doing his best in comedy or in an emotional scene. Never looks so sweet in the movie. The vacation was just fine. Music and all the songs are good, Himesh is impressive here as a singer. Don't miss this movie, its a wonderful movie and a good feeling for us. Abhay's best job until date. I'll give 9/10 Ahista to Ahista.
