Mary Pickford ("Born in Fourth July" as Angela Moore) is a "small American" (French heritage); he falls in love with Jack Holt (Karl Von Austreim) who had moved to America with his German father and American mother. French-American Raymond Hatton (Count Jules de Destin's "Fighting Destins") is in love with Mrs. Pickford. The triple love triangle finally ends in France, where the great war (World War I afterwards) makes their lives much more difficult. <br /> <br /> Cecil B. DeMille's film is mostly entertaining as propagandistly defective. The torpedo and sinking of a ship carrying Pickford is "Titanic". The war intrigue becomes dramatic when Pickford slowly turns to France as a secret spy while the Germans occupy their ancestral home. Of course the German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that they took the time to recognize each other as he moved from rape, but it was dark; and previous events would have believed one another dead. The film goes from WAY-over-the-top. By the way, Pickford was in Canada - although few could deny that he was not a "small American", all intentions and goals. <br /> <br /> FUN will notice the "extras" that later got the big letters Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially, watch that Mr. Novarro show "movie" quality during one of the most memorable sequences of the film: Pickford and the Wounded Soldier who greets each other when he is wearing a stretcher. Novarro can even write a letter to Mary Pickford; apparently he is in the future in pictures. Also involved in the future are Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; he will become a reliable child artist and grow up to become a Jack Dragnet partner. <br /> <br /> ******* Little America (7/12/17) Cecil B.
