The film was in my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actor. I disagree with another post because the plot is not turned. I had no subsequent problems (maybe some people had too much egg cake at night). The film was very sad and touching. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a good new talent (also beautiful) and Tom Everett Scott is also doing a great job. The relationship between mother and daughter may be a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad but enlightening. It would surely beat other exhibitions that were on New Year's Day television
