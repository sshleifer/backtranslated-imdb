"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I don't understand why this film didn't get a better critic, it's funny, harmless and cute. I watched it for the first time when I was 11 years old, and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later, I got this VHS :-P To date, I've shown it to many friends and everyone liked it, but nobody knew this movie before. I think this is a problem, almost no one knows it, so almost no one can like it ... This movie didn't get a real chance, it's sad, "SI" is really a comedy like "Monsters Inc." "Spaceballs". Ok, enough dissatisfaction - what I really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head, look at it! Even if you don't mind it, it's worth a look! -> Prepare to laugh!
