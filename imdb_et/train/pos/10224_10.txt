... and I mean. If not literally (after I have not seen all the films created!), Then at least obviously among those I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The IMDb rule has a rule of thumb: sometimes there are very high-profile films (such as Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korea-Kraap, "Oldboy"), can be really bad. But rarely is watching a movie that is worth watching down to 6. This movie, which is very worth watching, is. Shame. <br /> <br /> Really, I'll give it 10 protests. The film is not perfect. Its true rating should be 8 or 9. This is some functioning bugs (especially Belafonte), sometimes the script moves around. But what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, Czech Jan Kadar, who heads two of the most important actors, a loved one, a bigger life than Zero Mostel and the surprise of East Kaminska / poetic / moral tour. A couple made in the sky! It is true that this film, a few mistakes, does not appeal to the average audience, but to those who are interested in watching an excellent (again not critical) film about an incomparable director who gave us "Main Street Store" (the best film about the Holocaust) it should not be left out just because some silly IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "Angel Levine". <br /> <br /> It's not.
