I wrote comments in IMDb but I don't do it anymore. It happens that IMDb has become massive and thus the subjectivity has destroyed the score. What do I mean? Someone who does not know the movies in particular and does not have specific knowledge on this topic looks at some nonsense (or vice versa), and if he likes it, he gives it to 10 and if he doesn't, 1. It doesn't get anything right to measure. Now for the movie. I really regret that I have given some 10's to some very few movies, because then I do it with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something I don't expect to watch on any other film in my life. It's just amazing and it's not just a speech; it's really. In the last 25 minutes, energy, visual joy and wisdom - the main boys speak words. I don't keep movies, rarely find any sense in that sense, but it's a movie you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times a year. I have nothing to say. This is a real goal for me 10.
