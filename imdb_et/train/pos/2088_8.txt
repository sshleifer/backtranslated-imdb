From the upper shelf of the large classical books, this masterful story is written by Pearl Buck. Such a movie as a book is called "Good Earth". It associates the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) with a simple Chinese farmer who starts his day on a trip to the "Great House" where he has taken the slave named O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her wife. Almost from the beginning, he begins to adapt to his kindness, saving a small peach seed and planting it in his new home. In the coming years, O-Lan will prove its strength by steadfastly sharing its husband's attacks, troubles and changing fortunes. Over the years, they raise the family and watch their simple household both for the party and for the hunger. Indeed, it is the lowest point of their lives, each of which finds the value of loyalty, loyalty and love. In changing times, their growing family is supported and threatened by friends and relatives, like their uncle (Walter Connolly), who is annoying and charlatan, but is compassionate. Wang has his "old father" (Charley Grapewin) to advise him and remind him of the weakness and embarrassment of life. Two remarkable actors in this film impressively are Keye Luke, who plays Wang's older son and Phillip Ani, who plays national soldiers. The film is black and white and is perfectly adapted to the novel. Recommended for all target groups. ****
