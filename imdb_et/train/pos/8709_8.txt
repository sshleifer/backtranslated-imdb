Recently (May 2008) I discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although I have seen many high-quality films since then (in the late 1970s (10 years 1978), this is a three-fold, low-budget affair is still strong. <br /> <br /> What's fun I now looked at my 10-year-old daughter and he experiences the same as I remember at that time: horrible music (he had to hold his hand, although he grew up, watching LotR and Resident Evil), the ever-changing theories of the culprit, and also complaining about theatrical voices from the time Norway discovered the difference between director and film. <br /> <br /> This is the only good science fiction film (or ever made in Norway. And it's still worth it.
