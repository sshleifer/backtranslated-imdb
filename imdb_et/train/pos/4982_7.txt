I love these "Diaper Baby" movies! Such a film could not be done today and is rich in cinematography. It's funny and the film was made to make you laugh what it does. How did they ever get these children to "act" I never know. I think they are valuable and the children are laughing, but also others who made this film, because it shows the naivety that existed in the early 1930s. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, fell on the stock market, global depression started, and these films were made to break a person from the real world. The fact that you see movies for five cents is beyond my understanding, but then there is a 25 cents dinner. It was a different time with a completely different mind.
