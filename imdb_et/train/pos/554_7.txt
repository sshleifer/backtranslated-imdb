(includes a light spoiler) <br /> <br /> It is interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart is remembered by many, like George Bailey Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life", so it's easy to find parallels between two movies. In "It's a wonderful life," Bailey can see the world as if it had never been born. "The Far Country," Stewart's Jeff Webster, who does not participate in helping anyone else (except himself), essentially sees the same thing: a world where he does not exist for all practical issues. /> <br /> Webster is forced to see those he can't help but care to hurt, suppress and even kill when he stops doing nothing. It reminds George Bailey's viewer that he is looking at a world that has been reversed because he has decided not to participate in the never-born. <br /> <br /> Both movies end with the same picture - ringing clock. Stewart, if he does not give up his philosophy, seems to have earned his "wings".
