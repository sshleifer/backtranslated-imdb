His selection of films, the main "conceit" of production (which puts him in a set of commentary films or simulacra) and his delivery is great! But if you want Freud, keep in mind that you are getting a version of Zizek Lacan that shouldn't be confused with Lacan. As usual, Zizek offers complex ideas with joy and conviction. Friction is also quite viable, so its entertainment can be more than actual content. Kinematically, it's a pearl. Psychologically, all persuasive people (Freud, Lacanians, and Jungians) are scratching their heads, but it reaches the popcorn. Zizek is a phenomenon and pop art.
