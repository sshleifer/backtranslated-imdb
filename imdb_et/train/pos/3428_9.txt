I saw this movie today at NYC Landmark Sunshine. I didn't know what to expect, I didn't read much about it because I knew I could see anything. All in all, it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of anti-war statements, which, for me, was left out of politics. The military mainly talked about their awareness of toxicity when they trained in the boot camp, and how difficult it was when they returned to civilian life. It was very good to see that Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia talk about the difficulties not only in the survival of war, but in refusing to go back to the commandment when it was against personal morality. Don't make a mistake - it's not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says it is not, has not seen it or lived with the scars of wars for their souls.
