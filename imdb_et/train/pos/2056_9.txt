I don't think most people would give this movie as much credit as it deserves. I love low budget horror movies and it takes cake, especially originality. Yes, the scarecrow is a Kung-Fu fighter, but why not? No one else wants to go that far. I really haven't seen this fun movie after Candyman. So the city chooses the child who called her a scarecrow, even her mother doesn't care about her. Then he is killed and the spirit infused with a scarecrow who then goes to Killing Spree. His movie shoot is relatively easy to assume when a movie goes. The final results go straight to the leaders of fear, but most of the commitment to Dario Argento was so cool for those people who want to make movies from a newer genre. There are many Arnold attacks across the film, with one lining laughing like a stick and killing the sheriff. I'd say, grab a pizza for some friends to laugh at your A $ $ movie. I love this originality, the most fun.
