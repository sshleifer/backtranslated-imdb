It makes me proud to be British. This is by far the most funny thing on television. The league consists of Jeremy dyson, Steve pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the sweet Reece scissors. Completely underestimated, this horror comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and strange, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone just has to look at. <br /> <br /> The best thing about gentlemen's league is that it is always fresh and always pushing the boundaries. It doesn't have to rely (unlike a small UK) to make it funny. The fact that the league is ready to kill those most famous and iconic characters shows us that they have steel balls.
