In many of his films (Citizen Kane, a confidential report, a touch of evil), Orson Welles gave him an extraordinary role. "The Lady from Shanghai" is the only time I see her as a victim. The role of the culprit, he gave it to Rita Hayworth, I think it is because he was in love with him. That's why it's an interesting movie. But I think the story is great. The direction is genius, as usual with Welles: the two scenes are especially brilliant: one in the aquarium and the last with mirrors. This movie is brilliant (10/10)
