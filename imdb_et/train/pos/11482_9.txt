This film is essentially captured by a hand held camera by its participants. In some way, the video diary of "hidden" murders is filled in some other way because of the "Columbine" attack. While this movie doesn't answer all the big questions, it gives you an overview of how easy it would be to get it. The film shows how the actors illegally shortened firearms, made bombs, and presented an action plan for zero days. The actors (if you can name it) were great, they probably borrowed their lives from there, but at no point did I really detect them (something Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and 911 operator was a genius at the end, but I'm not sure if we needed the last scene. In general, though, a really good movie is a very tough subject.
