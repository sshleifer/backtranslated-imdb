Clint Eastwood returns to Dirty Harry Series 4 in Dirty Harry Calahani. Clint is older, but she's still got it, Harry was told she had a break after some of the problems that had happened due to the robbery (where there is a catchy "Make My Day" ban!) , the woman turned to vigilante after the attack in the amusement park and starts to poke one by one. The last movie that saw Sandra Locket in Clint Eastwood's movie! Improvement after Enforcer, which was a little comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles, best known for the sunglasses that Arnold Shwartzeneger wears in the Terminator. It is worth looking at if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or similar crime.
