This is a very subtle and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Great music score. I've been to Japan twice last year and the film gave me this typical Japanese feeling. Camera movement is great, but also actors. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese people are very sensitive and kind, and all this is very well displayed on the screen. The director plays great colors and shows the audience that it is possible to let them enjoy a fine and fine detail. Once you've seen this movie, you want to see more from the same director. It's a real feeling for a good movie and I can only recommend it to everyone.
