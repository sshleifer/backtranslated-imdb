This movie was a fantastic comedy. It had many comedies like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars' wife and so were all the air lovers. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr. Cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham deceives his work, he gets Akshay Kumars older and Akshay Kumar gets really jealous because his apartment must be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia starts to like John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham, so he finds the apartment and goes through three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
