Farewell Friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor among Thieves is not perfect, but it is a pure and fun thriller that sees unevenly spoiled French Algerian warships Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same basement. Another clean up two million wages while sitting there on Christmas weekend. Of course, things are not so easy even after they have opened the treasury. On the debit side, there is a very strange scene of striptease in the car park, Bronson has a very irritating Fonzie-like catchphrase, which he uses at the most inappropriate moments, Brigitte Fossey, who may have been apparently misunderstood in the 1960s. looks like a bald woman whose wig is wind-blown on the head), is there any responsibility? his "I make spaghetti! I love to love! I read Shakespeare!" is the speech in all the wrong ways hysterical? and this is a disgraceful dreadful last line / blow, but otherwise it's a surprisingly fun and modest number to look at when you find a good print. <br /> <br /> Cinema Club UK DVD only offers English, but because Deloni's own voice and the rest are pretty well dubbed, it's not a big problem, especially since the widescreen is pretty good quality.
