A very memorable, intelligent and tense film from one of the real geniuses of the French film, powerful Henri Verneuil. The plot is the exact parallel of JFK's murder and takes place in a non-descriptive, imaginary country. The film is sharp and visually sharp. Attentive accuracy follows Henry Volnay, a prosecutor who takes the coup. In many ways, this is a very disturbing film, at least not commenting on the so-called contemporary work of the modern state for cold and analytical accuracy. All the atmosphere and characters are completely believable, and Verneuil missed something in his narrow drawing. On the second level, this relatively little-known film was just a 15-year-old start from Oliver Stone, which was recognized as a "JFK" film, which is a inferior film in many areas, of which the least was unreliable ... <br /> <br /> is a masterpiece, every cinema lover should see it, preferably in its original French version.
