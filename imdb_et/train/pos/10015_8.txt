The popular radio storyteller Gabriel Somebody (Robin Williams, tough and talkative, in hypnotic tones) explores and friends with Wisconsin called Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who has written a book describing sexual abuse by his parents. To start, Pete has AIDS and forces Gabriel to go further because his partner, Jess (Bobby Cannava, good), is a survivor of HIV. <br /> <br /> He also visits Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides she wants to meet and talk to these two people and goes to Wisconsin, she discovers some of the secrets she (of course ) was not ready to find. <br /> <br /> Based on the actual events that happened with Armistead Maupin (who wrote with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this film moves much faster (90 mins, maybe a few minutes longer) than one might think that genre movie works. It's good because it keeps the action and story lean and clear. It is bad because it leaves a lot of different holes in the plot and does not sew any openings in the plot or backplane. I'd rather not go into detail except to say that if you don't know Mr.Mupupin's works or his personal story, you will feel a bit out of the loop here. However, Williams' performances (I would have loved to hear more about my story, personally), Collette, Cannava, Culkin, and much of the supportive pains (Waitress's Collete's Donna frequencies will do a great job with a small part of it!) At the cutting edge and the mood created here - Wisconsin and New York's cold, lonely dark exterior surfaces give this story a terrible frame. It may have an end that does not fit well, but it is still a weighty story.
