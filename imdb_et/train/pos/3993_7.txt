"Mother" is a weird low budget film that deals with at least two uncomfortable topics that are not usually studied by cinema: banning mother's love for her son and daughter, and lust and passion at the third age. The characters are terrible: May is a disgusting old lady and I believe it is impossible to feel any compassion or sadness. He admits that he did not love his son and daughter. He deceived his husband twice as intellectual. He steals his daughter's beloved husband, not to protect him from a moral man who does not love him, but simply because he feels horny with him. She tries to organize her life after losing her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter's fraud. His daughter Paula is a fragile loser who accepts her life as it is. His brother, Bobby, is a man who has lost his savings because of his wife, who calls for his shop, a terrible business. Darren is an immoral addicted jerk who doesn't like anyone, even himself. <br /> <br /> Actors and actors are great: actors and actors have outstanding achievements and direction is very accurate. I liked this movie, but I know it is recommended for very specific audiences. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Start again")
