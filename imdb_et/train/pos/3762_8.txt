Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as two San Dimas ropes sent to another lifetime trip, if someone from the future feels exactly the opposite of the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and are both. When they meet Grim Reaper, they can play for a lifetime so that he can come back and stop the two evil robots to destroy the future they were supposed to be. In addition to playing roles, they ... er ... perfect, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales processes) some classic games (I even have a copy of my original Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason why I liked this film better than the original is that it deals with "what it might be" rather than "what was". Without breaking the movie, I can no longer provide information about it (I think you have to look at both of them and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
