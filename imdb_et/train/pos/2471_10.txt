I had never read the Shakespeare Hamlet before viewing it, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and I could follow that dialogue. My view of the movie may be partly biased because I had never read this game before, but I got the grip of this movie. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever lived, and Hamlet's story is definitely one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now to the movie ... <br /> <br /> I found that everyone in the movie had a clear understanding of what they said and so it could be quite well expressed. Leonardo in Romeo and Julia have nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. What I liked was that it worked very well as "MOVIE" and not as a playable game. You don't have to be wealthy with Shakespeare to associate with all Misery Hamlet. I recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> This is my two cents.
