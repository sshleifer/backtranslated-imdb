This movie must be seen in the right sense. First, the father-to-son relationship makes it quite clear that the film was intended for his prequel of Wong Fei Hung's movie "Drunk Master" (the idea of ​​this film is repeated in "Drunken Master II") rather than "Young Master"; that Chan pulled away from this plan and the renaming of the characters showed that he himself was not convinced that the material had come together correctly, and indeed, the film was feeling inadequate, such as a romantic relationship, around which the "Young Master" changes around the plot, also feels unimportant, but at least all of its central yarns are connected at the end. Symbols that try to find their central theme only to abandon the efforts that are due to time and budget. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps the film is just too ambitious, it is a major turning point in Chani's career, as he undertakes to develop a central character against all other worries - this is why the whole film lacks such a kung fu. Chan wants to make a historical romantic comedy that just happens. But both the historical element and the romantic element have come across as little as a plot-twist. <br /> <br /> This leaves us with comedy. Because Chani's concern is the formation of a character, comedy is largely characteristic - like Chani's character and his best friend's conflict - but over the argument with the girl. But there are also many strokes. To be honest, I find comedy fun enough to forgive the plot's inadequacy. <br /> <br /> This film is an effort on the part of Chani to find a viable formula that it can use and develop over time. It does not work very well, and Chan found this formula only after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films, making a modern comedy "Police Story". But when you look back at this movie, it's still very informative about how Chan went through his historical genre and perhaps why he gave up.
