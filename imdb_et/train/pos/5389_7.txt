Like the very primitive episode of a "general hospital" set for a birthday party (and one of the most difficult cases), this fast moving programmer has a satisfying emotional effect - mainly because Eric Linden, as the deliberate young man's main plot, is both palpably wrecked and with such a good reason. His expected wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the church at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence because she has been in prison, which was likely to have come to her; Ms. Young, as always, does nothing to invite the audience's sympathy, and she's a little too good to be true, though understanding and cute, of course. His heavy pregnancy and relationships with other church girls make the heart of the film and the result - not entirely happy - seems right. Aline MacMahon, "one of the cinematographers of a few perfect actors," writes historian David Thomson in the words, warmth and respect for the head, and Glenda Farrell, if any too new mother of the mother is too desirable, gets the crown "Frankie and Johnny" as drunk lullaby. Frank McHugh's figure is in the second subfield and he gets more example when Warners usually promised. It has moderately moderately changed and Linden's expected father's panic will stay with you for days - such a part was often laughed, but he's scared young boy in trouble and very convincing.
