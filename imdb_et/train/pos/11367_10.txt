Caution: May contain spoiler ... <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 3 times and I've always liked it. When you see it again, it is always remembered how good it is. The HBO TV movie, which is very well done, like most of their films, has become an Oscar for its performance if it were distributed to the public, not on television. <br /> <br /> As I am sure someone knows to read other comments here, this is the story of the line-murderer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people for over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and were not found, so he was convicted of 52 of his 52 murders.) The story actually focuses more on forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played perfection by Stephen Rea. A man who has been tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional hurdles that the parties are hacking is certainly his part. At the end of the movie, there is a very untouched scene that mentions how, in America, investigators are being removed after 18 months of successive killings, whether they want mental tension or frustration. According to this, Burakov had been working for more than 5 years before he had his first break. He followed the case until it was concluded 3 years later. In this scene, his commander, General Fetisov, who played Donald Sutherland, actually tells him to admire his commitment and apologizes for not knowing he should have broke him earlier. <br /> <br /> Row performance is so good he doesn't do too much, chew on the terrain, or do something that upsets his portrayal of someone who's fucking to find his killer. He is a passionate man but does not show it in the same way as is usually shown in detective films. He only gives occasional stools after being quietly put on more than most of these circumstances. The row does so much to the face, with the eyes that it doesn't have to overdo it. He just * is * - His character, so disappointed for so long, at one point, because of disappointment, he actually says he should rather find 3 times than any year. Of course, what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants clues to catch that person. The row makes us for this man. He makes us understand, but a glimpse of what to live with such horror and nonsense. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the mutant, Chikatilo's childhood, was one that produces such "monsters". Chikatilo's character is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. He somehow (though impossible, though it may seem) creates some compassion for himself. Maybe he's the worst when we've gone terribly wrong? In both cases, his performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to the public) is doing a good job. He is a seemingly cynical reputation officer who does not seem to be more interested in supporting the investigation than anyone else who blocks Burakov. But he finally gets more than just an assistant, he actually takes part in helping Burakov. Max Von Sydow is also a very nice move when the psychiatrist highlighted the profile and what kind of deviation they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this film deals with a sick, grotesque and violent story, it is really more about what the killer takes to kill than the killer himself. Around a very well-made movie with great performances and a great scenario. The scenario will do what is best for this movie: do factual events and place them in a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know people * behind the facts. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
