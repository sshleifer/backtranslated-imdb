I borrowed this movie last weekend, turning the surrounding sound system up and having a special effect on the special effects. This movie is a great movie rental, with a special effect if it is enough to intimidate my groom, but I noticed that some saw the computer surprisingly. I didn't go to the movies and didn't see it, but the frightening late night doesn't recognize the movie. I recommend it!
