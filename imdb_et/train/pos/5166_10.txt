India Summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, affectionate and loved it! Anyone who went to the camp as a child and would like them to go to a "good Ole" day ago, really needs to see it! It starts 20 years later when the old campers return to "reunification". I no longer comment on the plot because you have to see it yourself. The actors were great, and it contains all the stars. Everyone played a big role in it. You felt you were part of the movie that was watching it. Alan Arkin was especially good as his uncle Lou. He plays a man who everyone wants in his life. It's also a good family movie mostly. I would recommend someone in the heartbeat! Highly recommended!
