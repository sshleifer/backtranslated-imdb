Daniel Dareus, the famous orchestra conductor, suffers from a heart attack when he finished the concert. Suddenly we look at her when she arrives in a small town she has left for years. As he left so young and his name changed, he gives him a new person. He has bought an old school building where he plans to stay. The building needs a lot of work. It can be assumed that a man who is in his position to be able to fit his new dwelling into all the comforts of his world, but no, Daniel puts his harsh winter in his own way. <br /> <br /> Local pastor Stig, whose church has a small choir, calls to see if he can interest Daniel, but the conductor doesn't want to go back to music. Daniel is starting to explore his new universe. City people leave it alone. He gives Lena the impression that he works in a local shop where he goes to get his food supplies. Gradually he comes around and decides to get involved with the choir. Lena will finally fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> At first, the relationship between Daniel and Choral is not what he expected. When they get to know him better, they come to him and make him one. Her new position does not suffer her from a woman who was previously responsible. The members of the choir are a silly team, but they realize that the changes Daniel has made in interpreting different songs. The new work created for Gabriella, a disappointed woman, has a major impact on her life and the lives of her singers. <br /> <br /> Daniel's ideas about the repertoire are in conflict with Stigi's own. Vikar suddenly starts to see Daniel in a new light; he is a tortured man who likes to read pornographic magazines before he loves his wife Siv. His ideas contradict dogma, as Siv refers to him. Stig decides to try to stop Daniel's unhealthy impact when he fires as a choir leader. <br /> <br /> The choir who is invited to participate in the competition will travel to Austria. Daniel, who has now completely fallen asleep for Lena, has the opportunity to show his feelings for the first time in his life when he doubts his relationship. Daniel, who is late for his concert, hears them listening to extraordinary music, though he is not among them. <br /> <br /> Kay Pollak, the leader of this very tempting movie, shows that he was the man to direct it. The story involves the viewer from the beginning. Much of the film's success goes to the ensemble's cast composition. William Nykvist, who plays a leading role, is the best excuse to watch the film. Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk, Ylva Loof, is doing an excellent job for Mr Pollak. <br /> <br /> Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most beautiful music. The art of Harald Gunnar Paalgard makes the film better by keeping the viewer in different seasons of beauty.
