I liked this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's experiment "The Dawn". There was a big look at how outsiders try to enter to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story was well organized and organized in an interesting way that changed the film well. Definitely worth a look. My only complaint is that they didn't think it was closing. Maybe it's part of this point. We are waiting for this, but in fact it has not happened (or usually happens). <br /> <br /> Film is also a great way to see the personality of Kenny and Spencer outside their TV show. You see a little bit of what's coming. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing the Pope's chase.
