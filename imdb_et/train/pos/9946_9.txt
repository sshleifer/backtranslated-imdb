Dream Quest was a surprisingly good film. There were some noticeable horses, but this can be expected in such a short time made in such a movie. I didn't feel any desire to move fast during the movie and I found it quite fun. Sometimes it becomes stupid, but I generally recommend it. Apparently, they all used shine in nearby stores and some costumes were pretty good.
