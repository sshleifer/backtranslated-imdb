When it comes to erotic genres, I'm happy to get the plot in the first 20 minutes without having to look at anything else. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I don't love you touch me) led two very strong actors Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this very thrilling thriller. Kira is convincing as "Kim" a sweet innocent romance novelist who gets hold of Doug Jeffery's "Man" nice foreign network. Kira loses control over her attacks and actor, giving what could have been just another T and A depth and credibility. I believe this is his best result. And the direction of Julie Davis is an excellent gift for eroticism.
