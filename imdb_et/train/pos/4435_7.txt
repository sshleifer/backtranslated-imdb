It is a clean little criminal drama that packs a lot of its 65-minute driving time. It has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a tired middle-aged cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his novice sidekick Tobin (John Miles), a shady killer for an open and even loving interest for the Tobin shape. female botanist Mary (Patricia Wright), who helps to resolve the crime. There's also a terrible finale of fun going on in the stone cutters yard. <br /> <br /> Look at the horrible fun at the beginning of the movie, where Lord Corrigan refers to a dead woman as "Tatooed Tilly" BEFORE the coroner finds out she had a tattoo (confused)? Later, when Tobin kidnaps the backyard over the killer, he suddenly shows one point in the wrong direction - no wonder he didn't hit him!
