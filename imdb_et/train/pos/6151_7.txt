I always have a soft spot for this Disney flick, another part of the live-action / part of the animated characters that tried to restore the success of "Mary Poppins" and never did it. When I was in class, every time we had a movie day, where the whole school pulled the crowd into the cafe, and the film would be projected in old fashion, many rolls and everything. At that time, the day when the day came, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" are one of the movies I see in this way. . Angela Lansbury never puts her name on something that was not at least competent, and she wins here as a magic bed (a boy who could be misunderstood, isn't it?) Who can do her and a couple of young children far from magical adventures. Come on, what baby doesn't want such a bed? <br /> <br /> Rating: A
