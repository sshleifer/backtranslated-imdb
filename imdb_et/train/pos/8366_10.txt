From the very beginning I knew I would have the experience of watching the best movie in my life. The idea of ​​two giant robots who were men who fight each other over the world was the most intense and well thought out thoughts I've ever experienced. I can't even describe a brilliant and well-written script. Let's just say it's comparable to the Lord of both Rings. The Academy had a serious watch to not celebrate the joy that is ..... ROBOT JOX.
