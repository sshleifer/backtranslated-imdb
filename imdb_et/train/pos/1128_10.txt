Although the recent repetition of the "Troy" episode of Homer's epic with Brad Pitt was fun, the glowing Irene Pappas of "Iphigenia" is breathtaking. This is the authenticity of the Greek actors who speak their language in a natural environment. A possible meeting with this movie from many DirecTV movie channels kept me interesting despite my concentration problems. In this film, there is no shine or "bling", but a unique rich story that the actors say so genuinely that they feel they have been caught in a real family where confusion arises. I think even if Homer really does exist, he would be proud of this message. <br /> <br /> JLH
