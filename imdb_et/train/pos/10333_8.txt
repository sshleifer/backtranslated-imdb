It was a great little American propaganda film that is both creative and openly discussing Nazi atrocities before the entire death camp was revealed. Although at the end of 1944 and in 1945, the evil and terrible were revealed, this film, unlike other Hollywood films, is the most brutal film of the era I have seen in Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the courtroom in the future - after the end of the war (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictitious world court, the Nazi leader has been charged with war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is totally uneven and one of the witnesses is invited to show Grim's life since 1919 in several setbacks. First of all, it seems that the film gets sympathetic or explains how Grimmit was forced to join the Nazis. But after some time it turns out that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes have been amazingly well done and it is definitely your interest and also that the film seems less propaganda, but a legitimate drama. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film makes the film a great work for the second level. There are many convincing scenes and performances - especially at the very end of the Jewish destruction scene that can't help but bring you tears. It was also interesting how some of the super-creative scenes around the same point of the film were used that crosses in a way that you may not notice first. In general, it is a must-see for lovers of history and everyone who wants to see a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - This is not considered a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler was called "this paper lock." This is a reference to the myth that Hitler was ever killing money, in fact NOT true - previously he was a "hungry artist" , homeless and well served in WWI, a terrible person, yes, but never a paper lock!
