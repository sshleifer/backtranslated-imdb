I looked at McCoys' reunion and was happy to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez! To see them now wonderful, because I always looked at the example to grow up so that the TV said it would be reunion I was so excited !!!! The only thing I couldn't understand was why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan was dead. So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site, so if anyone is there who can say what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke who would be grateful!)! I've been looking for everyone and happiness. The only thing I could learn about Michael Winkelman is that he was born in 1946. This exhibition had the value and morality that each performance had learned. The whole cast was incredible, the only thing that was better than finding an obout for them to fill them. So because it's impossible if there is someone who will help, please! Thank you Glenda
