This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think about all the choices I made and how my life would change if my choices were different. It plays correctly in the "multi-universe" theory. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is not true is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) is so hard to understand what is happening, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
