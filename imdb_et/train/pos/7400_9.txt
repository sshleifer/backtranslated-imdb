This is a great story about family loyalty, which, fortunately, does not use the usual tricks (or at least those I've used to see in American and European films) with super-sentimentality or great dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> It is very observable and very pleasant. It has beautiful cinema, but it doesn't trust it alone.
