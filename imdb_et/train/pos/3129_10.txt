This is one of the best special reunions ever before when Adam West and Burt Ward parody themselves and have fun while doing it. It's amazing how much effort went into detail, especially the 1960s sensation, Batcave set, Wayne mansion, costumes and actors selected for West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, younger versions. and Frank Gorshin! This 90-minute time is well worth your while and is a pleasure for all fans of the classic 1960s Batman TV series. I note that "Batman" clips were from the movie and not from the series, probably due to legal constraints. We hope that the three seasons of the show will arrive on DVD.
