I cannot agree with the above comment - it has many interesting and truly amazing movie images, it has an unusual structure and moves towards a terrible climate that is remarkable for the effective use of silence. What's more, it examines the strange impulse of suicide very honestly, not pulling any strokes it shows, but not sensationalizing the dwelling and the subject. it has documentary tips as well as a cinema of horror and artistic buildings, and it deserves a place for "different" horror films such as the Blair witch project and the original circle (both that have been and could have been unconfirmed in the past). Be sure to see if you are interested in the edges of the horror cinema.
