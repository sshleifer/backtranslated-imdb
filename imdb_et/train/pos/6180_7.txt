On Vantaa's opening night, a woman's body is found above the stage. As the show continues, the police are trying to put together who killed who and why before the final curtain. <br /> <br /> I had always heard it was a great classic comedy secret so I was glad to get a copy of myself. Unfortunately, no one told me about a musical number that continues and continues. Although the numbers are definitely the type that Hollywood made during its glorious days, they become intrusive because they stop the movie dead, even though they are trying to knit around them. It wouldn't be so bad if the music was half-decent, but not. There is only one good song. Worse, the studio knew they had one song, cocktails for two, and we were forced to endure four versions: a duet, a big product number, a Vanities finale and a background of random music. I don't think Spike Jones and his city contestants ever played it. The rest of the movie is great when Victor McLaglen plays nicely with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny at his scene as a wardrobe keeper in love with an actor. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances can I recommend this if you think you can go through musical numbers or want to scan through them. It's a fun movie they're no longer doing.
