Stupid, stupid, stupid. I think Angelina Jolie is probably one of the most talented actors today, but such a movie is not just worth her time. He deserves a better one, and all others in this film are doing it. Talent is simply wasted. I'm sorry, but I don't know it in writing. <br /> <br /> I am not given ****.
