I don't know why critics throw this film. Anyway, I never agree with them. <br /> <br /> The film could have been a bit more scary - I usually don't go to Horror's movies! I was even psychological to see it during the day. I didn't need it! ;) (Cinema was full of kids, heh !;) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) <br /> <br /> The house was a very gothic and beautiful spooky way. The special and sound effects were fantastic. I also loved the music score, especially Eleanor's delicate stories and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her standing routine and life, and finally won her power, peace and freedom.
