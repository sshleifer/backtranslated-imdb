What first seemed like a second introverted French flick, which offered more than balanced feelings, became a truly insightful and quite satisfying presentation for me at the second look. <br /> <br /> Spoiler is like that. <br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; apparently he didn't know what hit him. Bad audience; we were originally captured, which seemed a really beautiful and romantic story to guide it back and forth to the reality of darkness. These two men just did not belong to their first ambiguous meeting. As Mathieu and Cedric had sexually attracted each other, the lack of a deeper emotional bond made it impossible for Mathieu to find life with people whose feelings were more related to carnival celebrations and romps. beach. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical note, I loved the action of this movie camera. Subtitles were completely unnecessary, although my French is "presque rien". I can watch it again without annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. It was a polished, very professionally made film. Although many scenes seem superfluous, I appreciate it out of ten.
