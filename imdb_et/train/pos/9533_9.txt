It wouldn't have been better. The strong limitations of Mike Sullivan's phrases could not have been imagined in any other way. Tom Hanks delivers the best result of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin controls the emotional wheel; playing the story. And veteran Paul Newman is giving one of his best character performances for a long time. <br /> <br /> This film is based on the courage of Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner on a graphic novel. This is the story of a father / son, who mainly works with two candidates who do not fit the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child, so John Rooney took him in. Although he was a generous man, Mr. Rooney participated in organized crime. Therefore, the debt of Sullivan had to be paid only with business involvement. Sullivan now has a wife and two children and tries to keep her children safe but at the same time pay her boss. The following events test the loyalty of Sullivan and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> Great adaptation to David Self is rarely, but still very powerful. The story occurs in the beautiful 1930s (the direction of Richard L. Johnson & Nancy Haigh's brilliant artwork) covered with dark rain (on earth). In the story, Thomas Newman is an excellent Irish score that only lives when it is needed. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element of the film is the beautiful photography of Conrad L. Hall. This is one of the best cinematographs I've seen; and I watch a lot of movies. The scene where Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago, is quite impressive. Shooting starts in front of the car, exposing Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. Later it slides towards the car to see Michael (Hoechlin) wake up and out of his side window. Continuing to lift the truck to the side and dolly back, completely around the car and opens up a magnificent scenic 1930s Chicago. <br /> <br /> With more casting and teamwork, a person creates an amazingly amazing movie. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his feature film debut with American Beauty in 1999. (won several awards for him) Before working for American Beauty, Mendes worked in a British theater as a gaming company, but decided that he wanted to move on, saying there was nothing new in theater. For only two films, Sam Mendes has celebrated in his book as one of the great directors (with about twenty-five lists). <br /> <br /> The film illuminates the harsh genres, which have their own shocks and shortcomings, and perfectly represent the real theme. Photography, acting and story are phenomenal. I'm still waiting for Scorcesee's New York gang, but now I'm absolutely sure it's the best film of the year. Given this competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report), this is a strong statement.
