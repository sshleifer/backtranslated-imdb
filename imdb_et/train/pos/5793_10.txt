Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a real adventure movie for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before we start the actual story of the movie, we will be performing on the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror) and it will start with a great movie. After that, we get a Michael carrier collage, as it was until Moonwalker came out in 1988. Apart from some music videos (Speed ​​Demon, leave me alone, etc.), the story begins. <br /> <br The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) are chasing the story of Mr. Big because they discovered their evil plans to get children from all over the world. While driving, we see fantastic segments, fx. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with his dance series, etc. But then one Big Big gets kidnapped and Michael saves him before he gets the drug addict. <br /> <br /> During the film, we see special effects not only for these days' standards, but also today for impressive results. For example, see how Michael turns on his robot / spacecraft to protect his friends! It's so cool! <br /> <br /> The film ends with Come Together (later published in Michaels double album HIStory) and you leave the film with a magical feeling. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend this to every family who wants to spend a nice evening with a candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can get up and say, "But Michael Jackson is an alleged child abuser!" Yeah, he's really, but come on, we all know it's not true! Wait and see ..
