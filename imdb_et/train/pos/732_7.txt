Well, I have finally arrived at "Rock 'N' Roll High School," almost 30 years after he first became a midnight movie in 1979. (Latecomer, I am, I can see this summer's new documentary "Patti Smith: A Dream of Life" sometime around 2040!) And no, the film doesn't feel once and so, it was worth it. It is a very powerful comedy with lots of music and some amazing moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, beautifully played by P.J. Soles and the battle he and his fellow students Vince Lombard made against their new repressive principal Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cultural Films", quite accurately describes Mary Woronov's "Evil Eve Ardenina.") A typical story of teenagers and founding here is somewhat absurd humor (these exploding mice, this giant mouse, Hansel and Gretel halls monitors) and some really rushing stories. The reef is, of course, the first fan of this original punk band The Ramones, and this band feeds dozens of its biggest songs, including five concerts that are a complete blow. Indeed, the funniest moment in the picture may be the riff dancing of "Reef" for "Teenage Lobotomy". And the first appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky on their Ramonesmobile and later sliding down the street song "I just want to do something" is quite exhilarating. The movie ends with an explosive confrontation, which is, I imagine, a wet dream for every high school child. Have fun really. On the side, The Ramones has been one of the soundproofed ensembles I've ever seen at the concert, so I was very happy to note that this movie's DVD contains subtitles for people with hearing impairments. How many aging gowns there are, these subtitles are necessary.
