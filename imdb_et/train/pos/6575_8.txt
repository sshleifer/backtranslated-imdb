"Weapons and Man" is one of Shaw's most fun games when handled correctly, and this production does a good job. Pre-stardom movie Helena Bonham-Carter is a daughter of Raina, a military family with a groom's strap (Patrick Ryecart) and who overshadows an enemy soldier (Pip Torrens) while driving in the city <br /> <br /> This color and energy is very good , and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as the maid are otherwise overwhelmed, they still hold the ground. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are wonderful and the whole game is generally happy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
