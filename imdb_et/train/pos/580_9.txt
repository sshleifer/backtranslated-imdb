When I first saw this movie, I was with my father. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, it immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> River Running This is about two brothers, each of whom takes a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is a senior of two brothers and is in education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is a rebellious younger brother who rides the road full of obstacles. The film follows these symbols when everyone follows their path. You will be entertained all the way. Functional, guiding and scripting are all perfect. Two things that are exceptional are cinematography and score. Both of you, who are taking you into the world, will create Robert Redford for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie designed to be a classic. This is certain in my book. If you haven't seen this movie, watch it as soon as possible because it will stay with you forever.
