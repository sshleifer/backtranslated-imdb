The film sounds incredibly boring on paper. The idea that a 75-year-old man rides a rider on a mower is certainly not very pleasing to it, but the true power behind the film is its charm and intelligence. Writers can't find a better study of what makes a movie work than "The Straight Story." <br /> <br /> Its perfect example is the scene where Alvin meets a kidnapped teenage girl. She is pregnant and fears what her parents would do if they knew. Alvin has been telling his story about his children for a long time. He held them all and broke what they could easily do. Then he had assembled these bundles and tried to break them. "This bundle," he said, "is a family." So many other films would feel compelled to continue and make sure we know that the individual may break, but together the members were stronger. "Straight Story" understands that we are smart enough to understand it and just leave us to think and think. <br /> <br /> Alvin's trip to Iowa is full of such refreshing and Hollywood interactions. Every interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute to ride his mower that we can't help but smile when he leads to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the actual story here is not a destination, but a journey. It's a journey where Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets - for their benefit and for us. It's a slow, easy and relaxing ride to remind us of what we have lost in American urbanization. <br /> <br /> "Straight Story" is a rare live-action-G movie you really shouldn't miss. Rating: A
