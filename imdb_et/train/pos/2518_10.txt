It's the best movie I've ever seen by all categories. Forget Hollywood - their movies are always sucked - that's art! The month child's story begins with the Japanese vampire Kei, who is hoping for what he has received and lives in denial. His desire for death brings him to Mallepa, where several Asian refugees live. Here she meets Shoga, a living orphan on the street. <br /> <br /> The film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional aspect of the film. He has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never touched the movie how this movie works. And the actors are amazing - they have never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without being strange. Great praise to this editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> The last comment about this brilliant movie is that it celebrates Gackt (former Malice Mizer vowel) and Hyde (L'Arc's singer) that great roles like Sho and Kei. I'm surprised at how Gackt can change its way of speaking and acting depending on what age it does. <br /> <br /> It's black. If you never see movies, see Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. Of course, they are all in their original languages!
