The original title means "Octopus birth". I have to admit that I don't understand this title. The English title is "Water Lilies". But after writing it, I read the comment from another user: "In French, the title is also a hint:" pine tree "or octopus suggest that an individual must be exposed to many pressures simultaneously." Thanks for the explanation. <br /> <br /> The main theme is girls' first sexual emotions, if it is not clear whether they are targeting the same or the other sex. It's not different for boys. I think both Floriane and Marie will end up with heterosexual feelings without any additions. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is water ballet. Sometimes the girls have a head down and something above the water, except their feet, and lower their feet to the air they fly and hit. For people like me, who had never seen such things before, it was exciting. - Floriane is the leader of one "flowers" team. <br /> <br /> Marie tells her she wants to see Floriane training. This seems to be their first contact, which is not just normal. Soon they will go together. Floriane takes Marie's garage, where the boy is waiting for her, and then goes with him for an hour, while Marie is waiting for her back. I took it for granted that the couple slept with each other. But later we learn from the film that they are doing less. <br /> <br /> I can provide information that some other users find elsewhere. There's a scene where Marie hides the Floriane trash secretly. In it he finds an apple, mostly eat. And Marie continues to eat the rest. ? Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980) is a parallel scene in the second film "Kazetachi no gogo" (Afternoon Breezes). It affects adult young women and clearly the lesbian woman is in love with a heterosexual woman. He also steals a beloved garbage bag and finds more or less eaten apple and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Later, Floriane Marie tells her she wants her first orgasm. Marie says she can't do it. But later, Marie says she's really ready to do it. And she masturbates with Florianele. There is no nudity in this scene. Probably only a female director would have received such a fine psychological exhibition or study? I would like to quote Baudelairet, "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Floriane is playing Ad√®le Haenel, who made excellent performance as an autistic girl by Christophe Ruggia's "The Little Devils" (2002)? ? very underrated movie.
