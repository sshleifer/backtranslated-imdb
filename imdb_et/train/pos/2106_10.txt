Would this more romantic comedy be as beautiful to perform? I didn't think of anything so everyday when the simple sale of a music box could catch me with excitement. Margaret Sullavan is a wonderful salesman, and she and James Stewart always bring each other the best. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning show and his belt is "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" which says a lot. The way he found a Christmas dinner partner continued with me. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought his favorite was "Paradise trouble", but he must definitely win. Some of the most common dialogues are the 30's American movies.
