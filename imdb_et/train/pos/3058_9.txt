I bought this year or more back for $ 2 (yep, $ 2), I left it on the shelf at age, now watching DVDs when they're cold. <br /> <br /> This is a haunting movie. Great performances by all actors, especially the 6yo boy (only for the smile you get with this movie). <br /> <br /> Plot never reminds me of my favorite movie, Grosse Pointe Blank, but it's probably easy, it <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, a clinical and forensic psychologist, I got trembled with my back when the new contract identity came . Scary stuff! Great work is round. <br /> <br /> Pete
