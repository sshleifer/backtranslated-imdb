Pleasant gentle comedy pearl in the last five minutes that degenerated into a British TV farce. In the last five minutes, this was my rating of 2 points. Despite this large plot and style mistake, it is worth looking at the character and the unique Cornwall device. Many fine little bits, like tight eternity, all of us are going to wait for the bank's approval after the secretary has dragged the credit card ... made it more spicy if we are not - real - sure the card is not maximum.
