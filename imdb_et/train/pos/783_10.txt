The first word that I see after this movie is "beauty". Beauty is around, in the actors' play (Andie is great as always), in well-designed shots and in the red line of the authors - love. <br /> <br /> I think Kenny's character is the only white in those three women 's otherwise boring and predictable lives. His communication makes Andie's character as fun as possible. When he has gone, it became clear that we cannot really appreciate and keep our inner faith and sacred desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing wrong but shows that life is in any form, even in this small British village, which is shown perfectly. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this movie is that it is so British in every sense - all that houses and "phages" and accents :))). And Andie is doing a great job again! It is a shame that this movie got such low marks. 10 out of 10!
