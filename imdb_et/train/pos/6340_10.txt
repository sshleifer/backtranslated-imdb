First, an explanation of what makes me a great movie. The excitement of not knowing what is coming will make me a movie the first time I watch it (en point: Twister). There are other things that go into the first view like good humor (John Candy's Uncle in Buck and Great Outdoors), a good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative storytelling (all Star Wars episodes - George Lucas is MAN) and good music (again, all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Music of Music). What makes me watch the movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. That's what I said about Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Great Performance by Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest were very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But each single scene with Cindy and Grinch is great and very funny and / or warm-hearted. Cindy Lou is my favorite game in this movie and the most important reason why the film is better than a comic. Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can't start because I don't want to break it). Jim Carrey was as funny as Grinch - especially when he interacted with Cindy. And music! Wow! Great music by James Horner. I loved her choice of instruments and compositions. Very good work Jim Carrey-I didn't know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Where! Your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once. Your solo - Where are you Christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds? Looks like F #? This is a hidden range with a seven-year age limit (inevitably nervous meant it in the best possible way). Great work. This is the best performance I have ever heard in the film (Taylor beat the little feat of Von Trapp's kids!). And now for the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny and surprisingly very sensitive (it really showed up with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's unspeakable expressions (one of the good exhibitions) are very strong - he really gets Cindy Lou Who. And when he does, he's even stronger. <br /> <br /> ****************************** Danger: Spoiler announcement ********* ************ *************************** *** ********************************* <br /> <br Examples: Expression when he first sees The Grinch . This is a classic quote ("You're it" and then Grinch's line "da da da GRINCH - after which it sorts and then saves The Grinch"). I "quoted and Grinch's further response was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy calls Grinchit Holiday Cheermeister. Little Taylor Momsen holds her place with Jim Carrey at this place, I sincerely hope that we see Taylor Momsen in many future films.
