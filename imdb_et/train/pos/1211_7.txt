I grew up on this film and I remember when my brother and I were playing in the backyard and pretending we were in the Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years, I can watch the movie with her daughter and see how she can enjoy it. If you are a parent and you have not watched this film with your children, you should simply keep them in your hand and see how they are happy with the care carts and care! Songs, especially "Forever Young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I recommend this movie to all children so they can learn how enjoyable it is to care for others! When you reach all the trash bin on your TV, you can raise your children to have a live movie like them.
