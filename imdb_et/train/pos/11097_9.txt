Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw the local film critic, I left this movie at 10:00 in the news overview in the trash. I don't remember who it was or what the local Omaha news was reviewing, but the critic was very demanding that this film be too passionate with a medium church for Nebraska. They showed the scene from the scene where John Glover plans to attack Ann-Margret in the swimming pool. Glover's character gives him the recognition of how nice his body is and so on, using the many words that the local station considered necessary. I was hooked. However, there was one problem. I was only 13 years old then and I had to wait a year until it came out with a cable. Let's just say it's worth waiting for! <br /> <br /> If ever there was a joy, it's a movie. Naming this movie would be a huge underestimation. At the heart of the film is a successful businessman who is blackmailed with three small moments after a young woman interacts. Roy Scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays a poor man who just wanted a bit of fasting and now finds himself in the dread of three terrible villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable of all time. She is funny, from time to time, funny and always something crazy. Then Robert Trebor (nice name, by the way!) Is the character of Leo, who is clearly over his head with this blackmail scheme. She's amazing, sweating, a coward who drives a live naked model peep show-place. Then you have Clarence Williams III, who is Bobby Shy, who is a terrifying sociopoly who fears reasonably. Who could forget the wake-up call he gives Vanity for a giant teddy bear? situation, ie until Glover goes to his wife! The conflict is played brutally, practically with all the cast off, raped or blown up. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I love this movie so much. It should hit me, but it is not. Perhaps it is because these characters are all interesting, and the story takes many opportunities to make most of today's movies never catch. It is scary to think that the adult film industry is likely to have more than a few characters, like Glover's L.A. Just thinking about my voice to make me stupid. "Hey sport, enjoy a nice day!" Lots of fireworks with real life characters. See how Ron Jeremy waves around in a jacuzzi with two chicks in the Glover section. Another thing I have to add: How hot are the women in this movie ??? Wow! Travolta was doing the right thing to get married to Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see that Vanity gets naked before she became a born again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could he talk about except that he is the main American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> That's what the hell says.
