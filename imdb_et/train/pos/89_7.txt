Frankly, I had no idea what that movie was like when I started it. So I watch movies as much as possible. No idea. I thought it was a movie in the forest or something. I was wrong, kinda. <br /> <br /> It was boring from the start, but when he started, he pulled me off. I know it feels like sucking something dangerous when you feel helpless, but do things you don't want. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how this movie was stupid and unlikely, but I ask differently. Such things DO happen. I am sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing can go wrong and mad situations are "unbelievable". Really sorry, but the reality of the WORLD is that they do. The creator and actors of this film did a great job to imagine how things could just go wrong and how people can make very bad choices. Sometimes things turn out to be good, sometimes they turn out to be bad and that is life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
