74. Oscar was very good. The work of Whoop as EmCee was very funny and easy. I personally loved his last perception of a coarse overview of coarse language and mysterious jokes, but that's fine. The audience seemed pleasant. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier remembered this Oscar TV show. <br /> <br />
