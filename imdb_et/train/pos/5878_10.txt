Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is a great woman who works with 3 girls and works at the same time. John Abraham is at times fun and it is still one of his best works. Paresh Rawail is great as usual in most of his films. Director Priyadarshan has made great films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are some of the best. Garam Masala is his more fun film he has made. The three newcomers are medium. Rimi does not have much in this film. I was impressed by how Priyadarshan made the film with a simple story of a man with 3 girls at a time. All three girls have a day off on the same day and end in the same house. It's full of Laughs loads, it's one Non-stop Entertainer.
