Those who love the book Jane Eyre like me (this is my favorite of all time and I read it at least once a year) loves this version. Timothy Dalton is just surprising to be Mr. Rochester, but not just that he does an amazing job of depicting a Thornfield craftsmanship. Zelah Clarke might have been too old to play 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I don't think about the age of the characters. The film's dialogue takes place almost literally from a book that was very clever. Of course, this movie may seem a bit long, but it is the only version I've seen that includes the story of Part 3. <br /> <br /> I wish those who made this movie to participate in the newer Zeferelli version, because it would have helped this movie's confusion. <br /> <br /> For the last time I realized this video that Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed"! He's so versatile that I didn't know him. He plays Daisy in holding up the show and also played Mrs Musgrove in persuasion in 1995 (another wonderful adaptation). There are many more at the beginning (Young Jane in Gateshead and Lowood.) And finally, they have restored a lot of things (I always wondered why St. John had a paper strip when he discovers he knows who Jane is-- because part of where he owns tears for painting, edited from the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver is in it ... he was completely cut out of VHS. As far as I could say, they hadn't released any of the parts of Timothy Dalton, so there's nothing new, but it's good to see all the miniseries as a whole after all these years of enjoying VHS. Thank you, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... maybe some interviews with letters ... or making an exhibition)
