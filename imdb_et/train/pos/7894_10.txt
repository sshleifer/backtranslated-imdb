This is a great show and it makes you cry, this group of people really loved each other in real life and it shows time and again. Send me an email and chat. I have been to Australia and they are dealing as they speak. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I've been collecting over the last 5 years. Watch my Five Mile Creek tribute at www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to music on the extended theme. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
