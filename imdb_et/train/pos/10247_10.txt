This movie is forbidden in almost every foreign country I mean. The Japanese people (?) Who play it must be very hopeless for the job or we are just friends. Here is a scoop: <br /> <br /> Three traps torture a helpless woman to hell, they use all sorts of things to finally kill her, burn her, hit her, spin around the chair (over 200 times!), They use sound torture (forcing him to listen to the static sound for over 20 hours! It doesn't sound bad at all, but it can get you in the nuts). They throw the guts (probably from the animal) at him while the shes knocked and he wakes up when he wakes up. And who can forget the finals, the biggest outstanding whore I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you haven't heard of these movies and watch it, without knowing it is a simulated sniff movie, you think it is! (Ask Charlie Sheen) It's guaranteed that people will die and get sick! Like I said clean land. Check if you are an underground horror or alien gore fan. If not, I recommend reading the series before viewing! From a gore, shock, and creativity perspective, it gets 10, but it's style and all things are 1. Underground classic ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is 8/10 >
