You can survive Santa Claus. I thought the TV version was a little edited. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family with fewer adults who are willing to pay for a stranger. Valcos, starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents, and Christina Applegate as daughter Lisa Valco. Drew is lonely during the holidays because he doesn't have his own family, so he rents four million million dollars on the outskirts of the Chicago family. Bill Macy, whom I remember most well for playing Maude's husband, Arthur, has been hired to play Grandpa Duda. If the whole situation falls, the truth may be painful. Valcose's housekeeping crumbles after Drew's situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You don't get what you want to buy! Functioning and writing are mediocre, but first-rate casting pulls this final scene.
