I'm grateful to Cesar Montana and his team for revitalizing the underworld of the Visayan movie. "Panaghoy" is hopefully the forerunner of the revival of this crowd (it requires more speakers than Tagalog). The details of the dialect and lifestyle are exactly the same in the Philippines. The downside is the weak and prone operation of the American antagonist. The second point I did not think was the lack of authenticity of "period" costumes of the same nature and, above all, his bright red car kit that was supposed to go through the 1930s. Without these small but outstanding details, "Panaghoy" would, in my opinion, have been at least 9 out of ten - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Lisa: This movie definitely captures Peque Galla's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which saw the Visayas differently during World War II. Alos, there are some parts where cinematography will return to Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and the style will resemble "Noli Me Tangere".
