Suck. One of the best musicals ever. The three Busby Berkely numbers that finish the movie are remarkable, but what makes this movie so wonderful is the incredible non-stop patter and the natural behavior of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also cute though he may not be a big actor). The film has a freshness that is nowhere to be seen, much less in traditional 30's movies, although the plot of prologue creation is quite dated.
