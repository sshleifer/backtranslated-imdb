MGM was not sure how to market Garbo when he first arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had much faith in him and his appearance in "Torrent" justified it. He didn't speak English so he would have to work hard, nor did Ricardo Cortez make it very easy for him. <br /> <br /> The torrent of the title is the River Juscar, which passes through a sleepy little village in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes her voice brings great wealth and happiness to her distressed parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but he is under his mother's thumb and cannot accept her marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) Leonora's parents have lifted her home and they are sending Leonora to Paris, hoping to give her the opportunity to further develop her vocal weight. Leonora sends a message to Rafael, reminding him to recall his promise and come with him. His mother is angry and forbids him to go - so, of course, he cave to his wish. <br /> <br /> Years pass by. Leonor has a new identity - he has got La Brunna toast in Paris. Rafael has come out just as her mother wanted - she works in the office and meets a "safe" young girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead), who is the "hog" heir. Mack Swain plays his father. Leonora decides to visit her old home and I agree - why she hasn't helped her. His mother is still living in family life, working in the wig and washing. Leonora and Rafael meet, but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so enchantingly beautiful that it is hard to believe he could be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> Oak is bursting and the torrent is flooded with the city. The house of Leonora is located on the road of a raging river, but when Rafael tries to save her, she finds she is quite safe. Then they blame their romance. In this movie, there is a "horizontal" love scene that is very similar to "meat and fucking". <br /> <br /> Dona Brull is spreading rumors about how Leonora really got her assets and Leonora's mother believes in her and says to Leonora. Rafael will meet Leonora shortly before traveling to America. He's going to go with him again, but he'll let him down again. He spends so much time listening to other people who destroy his reputation - "what he does for you, but drags you". The irony is that he has just received the work of the supreme government with him. They meet again, years later - he is as fresh and viable as ever - he sees parents as his years that have been mediocre bowed. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a good movie with a positive message to track your heart. <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield does a good job like Cupid, hairdresser and Leonora's old and faithful friend. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
