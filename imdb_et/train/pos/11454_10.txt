As a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art, and having some of his books, I had some expectations about what I see. What I got was something completely rewarding and quite a bit more than I expected. Being an artist (I work under the clay), it is imperative to find inspiration around us to make good art. After a year, the director directs spontaneous energy, skill and dedication to the artists with a dramatic inspirational elegance. The music set for the film includes and drunk. If you are an artist who needs inspiration or someone else who needs an uplifting experience, look at this movie. I'm glad to know that Andy is somewhere. Creation, dancing, wrestling of the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
