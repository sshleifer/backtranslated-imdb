... that the Bette Davis version of this movie was better than the version of Kim Novaki. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the other comments here, I would really like Bette Davis, although the Novak version is a more consistent story. <br /> <br /> But Davis Mildred's raw emotion seems to me to be more suited to a slutish girl who seems easy to become a prostitute. <br /> <br /> And this is the raw emotions that make up * a part of what a poor doctor falls in love with. He knows despair, failure, "different" - the strong emotions he represses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, shows his emotions immediately and without pretext. He has no despair or failure or "different" feelings; rather, he lived in a poor Cockney woman's Victorian era. <br /> <br /> Novak's depiction was more vulnerable to Mildred than Davis, almost through the film. Davis' Mildred was ** ever ** vulnerable until he had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he turns her - the method of keeping her body and soul and her love constantly - she undoubtedly triggers the persecution of the most passionate smell as your attitude to the screen: "I wipe my mouth! I wiped my mouth !!" Novak's vulnerability was great. Davis realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb Votes Accept!
