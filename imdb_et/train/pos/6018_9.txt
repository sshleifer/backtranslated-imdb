I saw it in the early 1970s (when I was 16) and despite the long slow structure, meetings, riots, etc., the desert section began to start in the context and I loved it. (Still, it is very old.) Then I was what seemed like a small minority. All critics seemed to focus on the lack of action and narrative. Fortunately, I am no longer in this minority. <br /> <br /> It shows a skilful (somewhat prophetic) political split, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization, and fraud that has come. I grew up and I'm glad about it.
