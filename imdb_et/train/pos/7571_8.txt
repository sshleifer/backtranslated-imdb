This game is by far the most important. I was honored to play mine on PS2 to make the graphics really good. Voice was over standard. The difficulty is right. In my opinion, Wesker must be the best characters in the RE series. The story surprised me and took many different twists that I didn't expect. The only rating that this game deserves is excellent.
