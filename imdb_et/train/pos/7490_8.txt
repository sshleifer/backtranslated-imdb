Until now, this movie has never been seen. It was filmed in old blind houses and Frankenstein sets and touches a small Bavarian village where allegedly giant bats are sucking the villagers' blood. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this is a damn good movie with a free atmosphere Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas, playing Brettschnieder, is my interesting interest because it was my grandmother's maiden name . <br /> <br /> This is a carefully modulated film that has an alternating and witty one lining that slowly builds its short working time, but goes astray when it was about ten minutes before the end they realized they had all the time pack. From that moment to the end, it is a straightforward finish with very little fun that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb show 71-minute driving time and warn against shorter prints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in that case I think they are from a source that I trust more that the entire working time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia) I know it's crazy in my opinion, but since most publications are available to tend to run for about 60-63 minutes, and the amount of missing material is much less than just 67 minutes in length. Personally, I think it is not as important as it is at most five minutes, and I doubt it will make or break the film. <br /> <br /> Whatever your working hours, if you like old movies, watch this movie, its a big blind and a storm movie.
