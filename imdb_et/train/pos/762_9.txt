I like to watch breakdance people, especially when they do, as well as the best scenes in the movie that will take you to the disco club "Roxy". Especially during Christmas, because there is also "MC Santa Claus". <br /> <br /> Even though it is an old movie and even when I recorded a video on a TV when the Finnish film archive showed it on the big screen in summer 2004, I went there to check it. It's much more enjoyable on a big screen than on television. <br /> <br /> Even though many people here think that watching the big screen is a waste of money for the ticket, I don't agree with it and I think if I paid my ticket, I was worth the money I saw it on the big screen, especially sitting in the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than just on the video.
