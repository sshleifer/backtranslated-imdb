Some of those who watch movies and complain about living for them forget something: the DVD menu system. I tell you, people, I watched the main screen repeat it about 35 times. It was fantastic. The cascading shine of cinematic art with me, where it was, what was the beginning. How many times the sum and Bam! I was hooked. More and more. And over. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo". And it's just a soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I will be put aside in bed, curled up with my wolf. The rain is on a flat roof and soft tonight. The cat is comfortable and my ankle, which crosses me, has already rested. I jumped on a DVD. I was mesmerized. Night out. "doot de doot de doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> Blob. Look at this. Steve Queen, two police and one girl dress. Two thumbs up!
