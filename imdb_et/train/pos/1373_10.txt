This film should be required to view all librarians or potential librarians. All the best lines are directly related to librarianship. The National Library vs. Academic Library argument is a classic argument among librarians and library students. It also violates many of the librarian's stereotypes. Librarians can even be fun - even if they don't * usually * have sex in the Romance section! (Best film librarian? Desk Set, of course Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.)
