I was blown away by the imagined Battlestar Galactica, a play that always thought of me and brought tears more than once. A hard-won sci-fi fan, I like to think I can pick out good things from the BS and it was a good thing. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about the prequel outlook a few months ago, I got a sick feeling in my gut. I was afraid that a formula that made Battlestar so successful would be reused in Capricas, which doesn't work at all. The BSG story, a grieving band of abducted survivors, trapped on decomposed star ships, led by a prophetic vision and a pseudo-miracle series, was a great music and actor enlightenment. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. When the BSG occurs after the fall of the great civilization, Caprica depicts this civilization during its cold and decadent flowering. The general vibe from Caprica was similar to that of minority reports, subtracting excessive and opposite theatricality. In the actual BSG form, Caprica has already been engaged in programming for the first few hours of freedom of religion, racism, moral playing with God, and human soul. <br /> <br /> Caprica's casting is also great. Each character is unique and deep, starting with an entrepreneur from an obsessive and distant scientist, his hard and deliberate daughter, every actor and actor throwing themselves into their roles. <br /> <br /> The music used in both BSG strongly plays an important role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful reels and grieving hoods offered his subjects very well. Caprica uses more orchestral sound, which gives the exhibition its own feelings, which is quite different from its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely a show that pulls the Battlestar franchise as much as needed. Looking forward to a full series.
