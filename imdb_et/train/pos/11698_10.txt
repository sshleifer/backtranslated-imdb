I'd say it's time, this movie was awesome ... and yes, if you don't want to become a Christian, why bother to watch it. I saw this movie after I was already saved and found it to be very moving. I see now that they have taken these films to a different level and created the left-hand series ... they make a close comparison and are certainly more modern to reach people. I think that in order to really understand this movie, you should see it ,,, there are 3 or 4 of them if I'm not mistaken ... don't use our comments as a judge, watch the movie yourself! ! God bless you if that's why you look at them.
