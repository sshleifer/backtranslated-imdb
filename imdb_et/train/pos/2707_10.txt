Cor blimey. This film surprised me because it is a masterpiece of comedy. Billy Zane is the central character of stunning and everyone can play it straightforward to make comedy natural and simple. <br /> <br /> The music is really good and the set pieces are a pleasure to see. I recommend that you watch this movie with your peers, with a few bottles of your choice and prepare for the surprised and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> It works great on kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9, the outer "B" movie tradition. But what makes it more than the caliber of the people involved in the film. For example, Ron Pearlman. I still find myself on my stand, where Zane takes a step without a good reason, almost in a ballet style. It's a little crazy, and the better.
