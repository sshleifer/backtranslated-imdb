I went to see this movie twice, my friend went to see it at the liberation party, and he told me it was so big that I expected a lot about the movie, I couldn't enjoy it because I didn't watch it in the inner position . The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time I felt that there was a party in the house. I loved music that's just great. <br /> <br /> When Tom Barman improves his leading talent, he is the director where everyone speaks. If you can leave this movie first, then you have to be talented. <br /> <br /> The actors make some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a number of surprising talents like Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
