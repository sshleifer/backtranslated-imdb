It's amazing that actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star in "Rock 'n' Roll High School" with Riff Randall, Ramones' # 1 fan. The soles are so exaggerated that you don't mind being probably too old to still be in high school (this is balanced when all children are looking for 24). Film is a fast paced pace that does not disappear; everything gets blown to the end and it is the same as it should. Mary Woronov, who is essentially a kinky and funny presence of a Nazi-like principle, gets a big one-bit bit, where Frisbees drives dangerously near her (how much does it take, or was it a fluke?) And Dey Young is very attractive as Soles' best, Kate Rambeau. The weakest link ironically is in this "high school" chain of Ramones. They can't act, they're not funny, and their concert segment goes too long. One Ramones' song "I Want You Around" is considered a fantasy and is well-caught; other random songs are good, especially rarely Paul McCartney's ballads that heard at first ("Did we meet somewhere before?"). Fun! *** from ****
