Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller, which offers its share of action, chaos, murder and terrible bleeding. The principles are the search and destruction of the bodyguard, as his accusation, young Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school, which is exactly what Washington was recruited to prevent. Mexican locations are as chaotic as the story moves towards its predictable, violent summary, with plot moves on the way. Washington, a former CIA who was acting with a drink problem, gets a good reference from a former co-author who is launching a plot contour. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a hard start, the bodyguard and his reward will be the best friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke are made up of two stars.
