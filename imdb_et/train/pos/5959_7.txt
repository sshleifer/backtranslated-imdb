Although this movie does not go under the big cinema newspapers, it's a fun way to spend one hour with your family. Finally, a movie appears where it should have debuted first. <br /> <br /> The film is about an eclectic group of friends gathered for the dinner they've called "The Hungry Bachelors Club". Jorja Fox plays a woman who is a substitute to get paid for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays Cadillac's loving secret, who becomes his lover. Fox delivers undervalued and touching performance, and the Nunn is reliably talented as always. Micheal des Barres is a senior lawyer. The ensemble chooses - composed of familiar faces - well together to bring this funny group of characters to life. It's a good rental and one of the few that you can see with your whole family.
