The secret of watches is one of the most unique, beautiful and outstanding animated films I've ever seen. Before watching this movie, I was convinced that nothing could be given away for my money and that it was a winner in this category, but I found a serious candidate at Kells. <br /> <br /> The Kell's secret talks about a young slave, Brendan, who lives with his uncle, Kell's abot. Abbot is a loving guardian, but maybe a bit too strict and much more concerned about strengthening the city around the Vikings attacking the wall when he is raising the boy's imagination. When legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) appears and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes in the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named Aisling who likes him (and saves his life more than once). With the help of Aisling, he tries to save the city and help his brother Aidan to perform a mystical book that may be in the dark light of the legend. <br /> <br /> See my complete review of Kell's secret: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of- Kells.html
