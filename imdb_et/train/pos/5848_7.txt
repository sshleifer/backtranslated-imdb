And I gave it a high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it's bloody well-talked. At a time when there were so many other plays related to toys / games, this exhibition was unique because it had overlapping tracks. As others have said here, it was before his time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was a demise of the show. So far, they have released four DVDs with 16 series. I hope more will come out. <br /> <br /> How it compares it 20 years after its first appearance. I don't know that it still likes it despite sometimes striking animation and that IMHO is just a mistake. Writing was almost top-notch and doing before the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope more DVDs or even all the episodes in the right order ... DVDs are good but I does not believe the stories are in their correct order, but despite that, the shouts showed.
