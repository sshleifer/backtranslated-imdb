I found this movie on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> The piece revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father is dead. Ryan and Theo first say who did it. But later, Theo explains that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but is dying to end. So, Ryan and Theo are spending time to sort out their differences. <br /> <br /> This is such an incredible movie. I've seen Colm Feore only in the 24th season, but he was phenomenal in that. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard before, did a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to those who are interested in gay and lesbian genres. This is one movie you don't want to miss. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 10 stars 10. Great movie!
