this movie was one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. great for the whole family to watch. ideas can be a bit far away, but it is a feeling-good comedy and the actor is great. i love a little boy, j.p. and the Academy Award Winner adrien brody section can be very short but very memorable. highly recommended.
