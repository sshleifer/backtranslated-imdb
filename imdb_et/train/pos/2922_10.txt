This movie is a great example of a movie that divides people into two groups. Those who get fun and those who don't. People usually attack what they don't understand. This movie has a comic style and charm that is so far incomparable. It's a great comedy .. and a great romance. This is the perfect date for the movie. The perfect film for someone who wants a good white laugh. And if your perspective is too tense, this movie may not be for you and may need advice. It is unfair that Paramount has kept this movie on the shelf at the beginning of the 80s, having ever seen the daylight on the DVD. But they feel that "Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it strange that my two favorite romantic comedies have never been published on DVD. The second is Gene Wilder's "The World's Greatest Lover", which Fox has been sitting in the early 80's ... But "Justin Kelly's" is in almost every country. There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who took the time to do it enjoy "Justin Kelly", I'm sure one is soldered enough to get them. Sometimes people lose their sense of humor ... Or sometimes it just gets hidden and they find comic satisfaction in "Full House" runts.
