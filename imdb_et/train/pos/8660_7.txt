It's a racist film that is worth learning and enjoyment. The first time through this is the natural tendency to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a relaxed, peaceful thing that is still at home with him to finish high school, and he retired and recovered to wait for inspiration to do something. For the second time, you understand how horribly the sister's wife has left her blues bar in front of her friends. It takes it, it's a thing to do these days, and the critical moment goes as if they were talking about the weather. In the same scene, the sister's blues song is a real tear-jerker when you're the least sensitive and like the music. His performance seems to be a climax; blues story where good guys are "color people" in their elements, SC. Meanwhile, all the film's white folk, which seems to be low, is a meaningless life that is suitable only for infants. It's cool when you feel it as a fiction.
