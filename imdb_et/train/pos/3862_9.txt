Since I'm always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it was just another "B" movie, but I was surprised by the two main characters. All the actors in this film were very capable and well-managed. The plot was wonderful and unique, as well as a story of great morality. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not someone looking for sex noise, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and guts. This is a wonderfully strange film that shows some gloomy realities with the kindness of the human heart and just enough eloquence to make it interesting. <br /> <br /> I prefer this movie to many A-priced movies I have seen even a high number of high office revenue. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
