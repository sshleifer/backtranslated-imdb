Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason why it was so fantastic was The Ramones! You couldn't have made the same movie and put something like Sex Pistols, or The Ramones instead of The Clash, it just wouldn't have been the same. Dey young, clint howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the gray monters just added the movie. The whole movie is about The Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed Rock 'n' Role High School as your true PUNK fan. Not a sibling new mess ... but loud and fast. Only Ramones could do that. R.I.P (Rest In Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
