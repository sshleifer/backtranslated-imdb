Must see anyone who loves photography. stunning and breathtaking, will leave you ore. saw it twice in the cinema and now on DVD. it can withstand DVDs well, but on the big screen it was something else. <br /> <br /> My two daughters took to see it and they loved it, my oldest shouted at the end. to see it again tonight when he saw it in a video store. its simple saying about the child's love for nature and especially the fox is well known. in some ways, it reminded me that he is talking about a story that is not a documentary format. which works very well for kids. it has not been announced that it is very important, you make your thoughts up. <br /> <br /> But the star of this movie is cinematographers, how they did what they did. amazing just amazing.
