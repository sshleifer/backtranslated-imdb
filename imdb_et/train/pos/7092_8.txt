At the beginning of the twelve monkeys, Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam have a story (maybe apocryphal). Gilliam (supposedly) compiled a long list (think about the fifth element of the plane) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was titled "Things Bruce Willis Dos When He Works". It ended with a simple message saying "Please do not do any of the above in your movie". <br /> <br /> This movie is true (certainly true). Gilliam had no hand in writing. <br /> <br /> I argue that these two factors played a big role in creating extraordinary (if not commercial) success, the twelve monkeys. Visually, the Twelve Monkeys are all that we rightly expect from Gilliam's film. It is also full of Gilliamesque's surrealism and general (but excellent) strangeness. Gilliam rejoices her audience wrong. Though the end of the twelve monkeys does not exceed someone who has first sat, Gilliam strongly bids Kafka for clock movements, bureaucratic reluctant movements toward their fate. It is this journey and the characteristic developments they soothe. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam movies (especially Brazil). But they all tend to suffer under the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost always get confused (especially Brazil). I still claim that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there is no denying that the twelve monkeys are breathing fresh air in a tight drawing department. Style, content and form seem to merge in a way they don't usually see in the former Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the aforementioned rumor is true, Gilliam will also be able to get first-rate (and very atypical) performance from bald. Bruce is great in this movie, as well as everything cast, especially snails - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> This movie has been around for over ten years. When I looked at it again, I realized it wasn't really outdated. I was, of course, changed. And it made me look at the film with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a respect for a film that, at least in part, reflects mirrors, changed perspectives and an absurd unilateral journey through the time we all do. First-rate film. 8/10
