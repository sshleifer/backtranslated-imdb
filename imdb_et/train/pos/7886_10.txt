Okay, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says it's the worst! But it is NOT !!! Have you seen Freddy's revenge? WTF! It was the worst !!! Now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to Freddy's story and it's cool that she had a daughter and so on. <br /> <br /> And then I found out it was 3-D !!! I was so excited I remember when I saw it in the DVD box, I missed the 3-D sequences right away. Quite a lot of 3-D, though like Lisa Zanes's hand, Dream Demons, Freddy Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean, who had a knife, Lisa Zane with Baseball Bat, Doc's hand, Freddy's head exploded. I really loved this movie because it was in 3-D, but I want the whole movie to be in 3-D not just in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the way, it is 15 minutes NO TOWN !!!
