Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunite to play all their songs 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream". These were the psychedelic days of England and America, and these guys watched: all skinny, very long hair, natural clothes and loud music. They played a combination of stone and blues and it was largely good. <br /> <br /> Well, these boys are now 60 years old and can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert shows us. Of course, I was very familiar with Clapton, who had never been out of light, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, whom I hadn't seen for decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker saw the soul that he looked like death. Now she sees her healthy, playing shape and drum. Bruce seemed a little haggard, but his voice was great, as good as ever and a joy to hear those old songs. It's just great material and performers from boys who know what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this exhibition with a low key. I don't agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song "Spoonful" was remarkable for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
