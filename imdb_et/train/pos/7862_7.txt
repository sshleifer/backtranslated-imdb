Here is evidence of why Mary Pickford was "American sweetheart". In this rather complicated drama, Mary plays a young daughter who dares to dream of a single "mountain" son. Scenes where they can kiss and otherwise fall in love are just pleasing. She's even ready to go to the bathroom. The fact that Mary can pull this role out at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat thanks to her tiny growth (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess has to face many physical and emotional challenges. He does it with a sparkle that has not been seen by the heroine of many ages. Tess wraps the wall and is not shy to fight with someone. Why does he agree with the help of a "mountain top" daughter outside of me, but he sacrifices his happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's close businessmen are great. <br /> <br /> Danish born Jean Hersholt is just as wonderful as a villain. The scene in which she handles a little baby is enough to throw vegetables (or whatever) on the screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) had carried beard, would he have been in line with the model used in World War I to recruit Uncle Sam posters? Wishes you! <br /> <br /> Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow at first, it's worth investing your time to see a piece or a clean Americana. The film highlights the choices available to all of us, which include someone else happy and a true Christian. Recommended.
