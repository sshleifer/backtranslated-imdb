"The Lion King" is undoubtedly my favorite Disney movie all the time, so I thought I should give offspring a chance and I did. Lion King 1/2 was pretty good and Timon and Pumble had a good laugh and fun. The only problem I sometimes feel is that there is no need for explanations because they can create plot holes and just feel you want your explanation. Well, I would recommend this movie to Lion King fans or just at night with family. It's a fun flick of the same laughs and lovable characters as the first one. So hopefully I will get the same for Lion King's third installment. Sit back and just think of Hakuna Matata! That means concern! <br /> <br /> 8/10
