This movie is always classic. Music, camera shots and acting are great. Showing the film in black and white gave her a much better look and perfect music than Psycho. It's surprising how few people have commented on this movie. I think it's a hard movie. I gave the film 9. Watch the movie and find out what I'm talking about.
