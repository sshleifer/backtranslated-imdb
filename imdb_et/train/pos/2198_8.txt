The third Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard movie is a bit more serious than hands over the table and the princess is over. This is another adaptation of the game Burlesque, which was probably already popular in the day. <br /> <br /> The original game, Burlesque, ran for 372 shows on Broadway in 1927-1928, and the role Carole Lombard plays in Barbara Stanwyck comes from Broadway, which led her to Hollywood. The version marked with Nancy Carroll in the early days of the talks and later on by Betty Grable and Dan Dailey still made this version when my baby smiles at me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl album version of Radio that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler made for Lux Radio Theater. It's an interesting job, believe me. <br /> <br /> In any case, MacMurray and Lombard are fine by old chestnuts, the story is now in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpet. Notice Dorothy Lamour's beautiful performance as a Latin vixen who gets between Fred and Carole. Anthony Quinn is also one of his first films as a wolf in Lombard. <br /> <br /> Fast high, Swing Low is really nice today and I wouldn't be surprised to see another version of Burlesk in the twenty-first century.
