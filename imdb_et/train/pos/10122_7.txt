I found it a bit hard to follow to such an extent that it seemed to be in the middle when I tried to make a head or tail who fought, who and why. One problem is cultural / linguistic. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem that we know little about, and since we just read English subtitles, some of the nuances will inevitably be lost. Another problem is that only half of the explanations and coincidences appear to be too much. However, it seems unlikely that there is a totally bad Miik movie and that is definitely not the case. Lots of stylish and bone-breaking violence, less windows than orthodox sexual events and a family aspect. All in all, a decent ride can be, but maybe you can watch it before you watch it.
