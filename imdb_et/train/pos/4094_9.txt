Anyone who has seen only the beautiful animated version of 'Beauty & The Beast' by Disney Productions, or even the surreal fairy tale of Jean Cocteau, is quite astonished by the French in 1975 (but with the Polish director). The plot is a French family that has lost the aristocracy that is married to a well-functioning English family. The main catch is that the groom carries an ancient curse to the family. The film also contains many sequences (potentially) that explain this curse of the family. From the beginning to the end, it is an almost insecure erotic amusement house with some very clear and graphical sexual material (hence the movie's X rating in the US for its first launch, which is now unrated). The somewhat despicable feeling of the film for the ruling class is likely to remind Bunuel's flights to a similar territory. If you have a really strange taste and no "taboo" material, this film may worsen your skin.
