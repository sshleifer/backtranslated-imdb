It's an entertaining movie; I didn't think the world made social comments on a small movie. Personally, I find this movie funny, cruel and memorable. This is a fantasy that is no different from the fact that the girl becomes a princess. This film was very well done, I can add the best film experiments in the 1970s to mention human sexuality. This film does not mean that a person is homosexual or not, but it is about love, all its strange forms. This movie shows some realities that are homosexual in the 70s in Hollywood or California. Pretty boys are taken care of by parents, not so beautiful men. Women who had to stay in an emotional closet or not to pursue a career. Saunas were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then fantasy begins! Mix up lesbian and gay and add some drinks and what do we have? Well this movie, which was in any way better than what was clumsy redo "The Next Big Thing". Perhaps someone should have asked the whole team to watch this movie and then try to do it better. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70s, and it still brings a smile to my lips. I heartily recommend to anyone who wants a funny, delicate film - to strain and have fun with some popcorns. Some people have to relieve !!! And this is the movie you should do! <br /> <br />
