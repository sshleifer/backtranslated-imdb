Surprisingly renting a local video store, I was happy to find a media satire that was worth enough to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers". And almost as disturbing. I think it went well with my viewing at the end of 2004, looking at the Republican machine making the most of American television watching magical. This raises the question: "Are we really such manipulative?" <br /> <br /> It certainly twisted my view. There was also a greater theological issue - the story of Christ. Does word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something exploiting than television cause messiah? Was the story of Christ exaggerated? Would it be fully manufactured? This is something the film puts on very sensitive light.
