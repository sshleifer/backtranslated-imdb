The film is made for a modern audience. The masses can see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course sensual scenes. This is not exactly the kind of movie that would be comfortable with the whole family. It is not in the eyes of children. I had to move a lot of scenes quickly. The songs are memorable. Excellent production, you need to add. <br /> <br /> But the film's message is not universal. This emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. This means that if you do good, you will get good. And if you do evil, you will get evil. The fruits of good works are good, while the evil tree is evil. <br /> <br /> In real life, it's not always true. It is well known that most people do not get justice in this world. While it is true that some evil people meet the evil end, there are many who are fleeing. And then there are many people who do good, but on the contrary they meet with regret. This movie is entertaining.
