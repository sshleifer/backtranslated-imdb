Josef Von Sternberg directs this wonderful silent film from the quiet Hollywood and the former Imperial General to the Russian Tsar who has found it. Emil Jannings won the state's well-earned Oscar for his role as a generalist who ironically casts a bit of silence as a Russian general. The film flashes back to its days in Russia, which led to the fall of the revolutionary countries. William Powell debuts as a Hollywood director who puts Jannings on the film. The film is an interesting look at Russia's autumn and imitation of scenes at the beginning of Tinseltown. Von Sternberg offers another classics full of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
