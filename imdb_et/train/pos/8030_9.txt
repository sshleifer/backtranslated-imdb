This was another great Tom Berenger movie .. But some people are right, as was the other character of SGT BARNES, but it was still awsome. Billy Zane was just like Cpl Upham Saving Private Ryan, but finally he got a bit more aggressive! Sniper was awsome and action buffs should look at it .. i remind you that it wouldn't be as much action as reg action flick .. i got this one dvd too and it's great!
