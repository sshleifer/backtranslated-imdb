It is not the same as other dancing movies. Some normal people danced. Unlike the Hollywood dance films, the characters in this film are neither beautiful nor hot. They are someone you see in your offices everyday. They are some depressions in their lives and eventually find themselves dancing and dreaming. It touches me very deeply.
