I like this movie because it's a good cinema that is done by people who care enough to make it an art and not just a home video. It's a full-featured super-surfer Greg Noll's home video and a camera-video amateur who fits their 50-year-old passion. However, it has been expanded to approach aesthetic glory. It's full of artistic talent and athletic talent, but trivial to think about surfing is athletic. Surfer is not astronauts or pilot pilots. Neither are they surgeons (maybe) or Ph.d's (maybe). He believes in finding a surfer. He believes in the beauty of the human horse. He believes in the great gift of peace that comes from the end of the war. Surfers mark the end of the war on the north coast of Hawaii, which was attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. It marks the country that fought against the Cold War, the Russian socialists instead of the warm war. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only a little historical. I suspect Alexander Alexander was not his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the good press he had achieved. This film has no military heroes. He has no weapons. Only the conquerors of the coasters have a brewer and a surf shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. This is the joy of exhaling.
