I'm a fan of animal films. If you can take the plot and put the animals into the main players, you can usually win me. Homeward Bound did just that. They took a plot that was old and old and put a new spin on it. It was a complete success. This is a very archetypal film. You have a clever and logical group (shadow) obi-wan, you have a lovable, but lively and unreliable opportunity and prissy princess who thinks she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities collide very well with each other. I also like the way they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic signs and they were not late. Most people say it can't be good because it's too much of a children's film. But what they forget is that it should be a children's film, and it still doesn't take an acoustic film. It's good to watch a movie if you're bored and just want to watch a movie. This is a Disney movie without cartoons, with a better plot balloon. No doubt I would like to see you.
