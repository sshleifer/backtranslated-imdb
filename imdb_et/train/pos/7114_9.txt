Certainly, the best John Garfield films are proud of the navy. This is the real story of Marine's private Al Schmid, who, on his own vision, keeps the wounded Guadalcanal from a Japanese rebellion. <br /> <br /> The story is well divided into three parts, Al Schmid's home life, where he is a simple rigid who is just serious about a woman and doesn't like anything better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombarded and it is in war because millions of others were. <br /> <br /> The second part is in Guadalcanal and we see some of the activities where he is isolated on a machine gun, preventing Japanese troops. His actions prevented the crossing of sea positions, but the grenade does not see in his vision. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part of her painful adaptation to civilian life and convincing herself that people don't care only she was unfortunate, most of all the girl she saw at Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This movie was sent to TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary about Garfield hosted by his daughter. One of the interviewed people said Garfield was an actor most likely to be in the role of working groups in owning and holding a union card. <br /> <br /> In this respect, he was lucky to land at Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he kept the gangsters in the tradition of this studio, Garfield was terrible because of these parts because of the life he had with Al Schmid, except for Garfield's Jewish background. <br /> In this respect, he was perfect to play part of a working class hero, such as Al Schmid, who took responsibility for defending his country. There is no superhero here, just a man who would have come back to Philadelphia, but doing the work that had to be done. <br /> <br /> It's a big part of Garfield. This is a movie that shouldn't be left out. I don't know what happened to Al Schmid.
