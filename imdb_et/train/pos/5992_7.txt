I admit I had no idea what to expect before I look at this highly stylized piece. It could have been the treatment of a zombie virus or rhinitis that I knew. It started with amazing visual images, small fragments to grab your attention and cause your imagination to go wild. While continuing, I quickly learned through voice commands that took place. A nice little neo noir story I felt was not a few minutes of my time. A few clues given to the audience through visuality give them the feeling that they are gathering the plot. With a nice turn at the end, this cool package is in general. The result, though not bad, gave the film almost a music video. It just seemed a bit dated, not adding anything closer. Some of the performances felt too dramatic, but they were perfectly suited to the feeling of practice. I am very pleased with this. I was given a lot of information in a short period of time, but it didn't seem to hurry or push through the big editing and the voice task. Great work!
