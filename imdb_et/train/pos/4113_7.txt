The title is the sound that one character does when he drives his imaginary trolley over the dump where the characters live. The film is based on Shugoro Yamamoto's tales and talks about a group of people who actually live in homes near the dump. It is a mixture of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first Akria Kurasowa color film has been something I've seen for a long time. In either case, it was often referred to as a shorter version of an original of three or four hours, as some advertising material had a mistake in time. I was waiting for the full version, waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted to see, to find out recently published by Criterion that the 140-minute version is a full version. <br /> <br /> Finally, sitting down to watch a movie last night, I'm mixed with emotions about the movie. First of all, it is visually related to each subsequent film. You can see all the other six Kurasowals films that are featured in this movie until painted at sunset. Using this color is a striking film and you understand why it took a movie that it would be happy with for so long (of course there are also failed projects). Film is a visual work of art. (Although it is warned when you see it on your widescreen TV, it was shot to 1.33 so it appears on a normal TV.) The rest of the movie is a mixed bag. The problem is that the lives of all these people are not quite the same. They are all working well as separate stories, but in the movie as a whole they do not hang together. I do not blame Kurasowa for not always getting things out of the box, especially if someone like Robert Altman, who specializes in movies of this kind, bombed himself. <br /> <br /> Don't say you can't see the movie. Like all Kurasowa movies, there is always a reason to see your movies, whether they are working or not. The first trip to "Troll" is one of the best things Kurasowa has ever done and what is worth the rental price. This is one of the most magical moments in film history, since the cart is checked and taken out. The father and son living in the car (though ultimately very sad) and there are other bits and pieces that seem (like cast, which are all over the table) and at least the film should try something other than the man we associate with samurai films or criminal dramas. <br /> <br /> Its intriguing failure from the master filmmaker, which in this case means better than most other filmmakers. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> and 7 as a whole, much larger in pieces.
