The 60s is a great film (I saw it one night) about the hippie movement of the 1960s. Although the title suggests otherwise, the first 5 years of the 60s are not really important in this film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is Michael, a political activist who goes to Vietnam on the way to the US. There he meets his girlfriend Sarah.Michael's brother Brian is going to fight in Vietnam (what a surprise!) He comes back from the war and the changes "Tom Cruise Born in Fourth of July" look and then his father is a Vietnam war-type man (which is a surprise!). Michael's sister Kate gets pregnant from Rock & Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to love in San Francisco in the summer. The end is very bad (the father becomes liberal and everyone is happy), but I'll let this vote off (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant. All the main events of the sixties are in the movie, such as the murders with JFK and Martin Luther King, as well as the big hippie protests, the summer of love and Woodstock! Watch the Wave of Woodstock Speaker Gravy (Remember, breakfast is 400,000 in bed!) As a first-aid worker at the Woodstock Festival! <br /> <br /> Finally, the 60's is a beautiful movie from a beautiful decade! 10/10
