It is not "open", but a precise, faithful remake of the 1958 Monicelli classic "I Soliti Ignoti" with Toto, Mastroian, Gassman, Cardinale and so on. And that's a good thing, it copies all the funny characters and the plot even in details (like a scene where a photographer steals a camera from a local market). <br /> <br /> I looked at the old version perfectly many times and I knew heartily all the gang and the end, but I still liked "Welcome to Collinwood" with its freshness and ambience. It is interesting to see how the life and ways of small Italian thieves of the 1950s were adapted to the 2002 US. Things haven't changed much. 8/10
