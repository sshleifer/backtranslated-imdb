In this case, the election is a Chinese mobile film or trio. Every two years, a new leader is chosen to decide, and at first it seems that Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or I know him, "Tony Leung") and Loki (Simon Yam, between) who was in full contact with the judge!). Although once wins Lok, the Big D refuses to accept the selection and goes to any length he can recognize for a new leader. Unlike other Asian films I look at with gangsters, it's not a movie. If necessary, it has bloody moments like Goodfellas, but it is basically just a truly effective drama. There are many signs that are really hard to follow, but I think it plays a bit of this madness. The 100-year-old grandfather, a symbol of power mentioned earlier, turns his hand several times before things are. And while it may seem that the movie ends with a 65 or 70 minute mark, a few more surprises await. Simon Yam was my favorite character and anchor for pictures. <br /> <br /> The election was the winner of last year's Hong Kong Film Awards, winner of the Best Actor (Tony Leung), Best Picture, Best Director. (Johnny To, who made the heroic trio!) And the best scenario. It also had candidates for cinematography, editing, film scores (which I loved) and three more actors (including Yami).
