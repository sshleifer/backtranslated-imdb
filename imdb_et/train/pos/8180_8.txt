this is a fun movie. in fact, it can make you uncomfortable because it is not an undead psychopath or sociopath, his daily doctor. how terrible it is. I got some good actors and actors in this movie, though some of them didn't like Virginya Keehne like Sarah. Ken Foree, whom you would know about Rob Zombie Hell, and Halloween (2007) are celebrated by our detective schizoid Dr Alan Feinstone (Corbin Benson). A brief summary: Dr. Alan Feinstone, a man with a sexy woman, a nice house, and it's a great dentist who loves everyone. Until he catches his wife with a fraudulent pool cleaner. Then he starts hallucinations that his patients teeth are all rotted and that female patients are his wife when he starts going nuts in this thriller. But before that, a nice guy.
