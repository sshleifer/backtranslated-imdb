Forget the depth of thought, leave your logic on the door and have fun with this manic funny, completely absurd, ultra-campy live-action comic. MYSTERY MEN is the sending of any superhero flick you have ever seen, but this unlikely super-wannabes is so interesting, versatile and good that they are unique characters. Dark humor, stupidity, goodness, and even a touching moment or two combine this comic fantasy into a true loser. Mystery Meni - including one of the Mystery Woman actors - comedy talents is the perfect foil for Wes Stud, because it can only be described as a favorable basement Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most uneven wall (and bizarre charming) villains who once walked the Dark Horse comic book pages and big screen. Get ready to laugh, rejoice and say "ah?" more than once .... enjoy!
