Let me first say that I have a brain palsy and I went to this movie, assuming I have to take the lead. I left the theater halfway convinced that they had put on an actor who had a brain injury, although I knew it wasn't. The performances were generally excellent, with a special note to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I believe this is her name) as young Christy Brown. Christy is a talented, filthy, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant, in other words a human being. This movie with Gaby: True Story and Documentary King Gimp is great for life with CP. In no case is a complete portrait, but only fine examples of people with disabilities. Most recommended.
