Citizen X talks about a real drama "Rostov Ripper" called Serial Effect Search. This great movie shows a long journey to kill the killer. The film shows how politics can help a buddy, that the killer continued his rage for over 12 years. (Possibly over 50 victims, mostly women and children) Stephen Rea's performances as a leading detective and Donald Sutherland as a general investigator were excellent. Jeffrey DeMunn as Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of film that amazes you and you have been studying the real case right now on the internet. This movie must not be missed. It debuted as I believe in HBO and never got a theater for my theater. Great movie
