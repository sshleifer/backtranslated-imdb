Go back to the ten pages of this review and make your way back. Go ahead; I'm waiting. <br /> <br /> Ready? Well, you've probably noticed the same trend I have. You could joke all day long with fun, timed timing, and probably derivatives and forced "Bogus", but this movie seems to be one of those "hate me now, love me later" flicks. The biggest problem with Bill and Ted was that the original filed a complaint with the 80s children who followed the tendencies and held the fashion for excellence, which worked well for the original, but was clearly bombarded in 1991 if any self-assured shooter was caught dead , wearing something other than a flannel, or admitting that she liked something about the 80s. As Ted says, "Dude, this is a deep hole. You want to play 20 questions?" <br /> <br /> They say nostalgia is going on in 20-year cycles, and that seems to be the case here. In 2010, users who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth will begin to look back to understand those central films that (like this or not) made us into the situation. If you are one of those who look "out-of-the-way" as if they were outdated ("Fa gs!"), There is a lack of a point and probably spent six years growing face hair wearing a flannel and looking for how you just climbed out of bed. <br /> <br /> With their own origins (Star Trek episode) and time traveling with a telephone booth, B&T does not strive to hide the respect of its creators. Quentin Tarantino, anyone? I am not saying "Bogus" is "True Love", but I think it has to be appreciated for what it is: the fun of our society at the moment before children's psychology, Ritalini, anti-smoking ads, terrorism paranoia and the spread of media fear. <br /> <br /> So, for all of your B & T angry ... turn off your Screaming Trees CD, get your hair out of your face, go to the beach and lighten it. Narcissistic depression and intellectual predictions are SO corporative.
