This film was one of my childhood favorites and I have to say that unlike some of the other films that I liked during this period, Baghdad's thief has set its quality when I grew up. It's not just a fun movie for kids, it can be viewed and enjoyed by adults. The only drawback is that one cannot see the past of the bad effects (compared to today's influence), as one would have been if the child had been. I didn't remember anything about these effects, of course it was about ten years after I saw this movie when I was about 11 years old. Who then monitors the effects? One is just looking for good stories and entertainment, and that's exactly what this movie offers. In my opinion, this film is one of the first major adventure films of the 20th century. I'll think about it that I feel that Indiana Jones movies are pretty kind of movies. Together, it is a comedy, romance and adventure that creates an excellent blend that captures you from start to finish and although the film is old and the music and style of the movies is not obviously modern, it manages not to be dusty and old. All of this is mainly due to the great story, good leadership and good exhibitions of the actors. In this part, Sabu (Abu) and Conrad Veidt (Jaffarina) stand out by offering the comic and cool elements of the film mostly. Great movie and though "old", definitely "goldie". I hope someone has the brain and the courage to release it once on a DVD. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
