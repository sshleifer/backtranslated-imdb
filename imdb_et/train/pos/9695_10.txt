Some people may call "Paulie" a children's film, but I want to confirm that this is more. This film is probably going to be more than anything else to show the difficult situation of immigrants in the United States - in recent discussions it is topical. By depicting a parrot telling a Russian immigrant housekeeper (Tony Shalhoub) about how he was looking for his original owners in America, the film tells a lot of stories. There's an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom she interacts with her friends, the Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very well done movie. I usually don't expect a lot of such movies, but it's petting. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
