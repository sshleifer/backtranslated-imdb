I want to weigh some weights and say I enjoyed it. But the copy is really only for those who are very absurd. This is certainly something that most people do not, as well as the nature of absurdity. <br /> <br /> Animation is terrible, but yes, that's the thing. The main character is unpleasant mouth, violent and stupid. no redemption features. Her husband shrieks and rabbit, probably just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of those in the northwest are not entirely point. <br /> <br /> But again, this is the point;) <br /> <br /> If you are not a descendant, an unpleasant language and a complete and complete randomness, your thing is really short, so I probably I'd like to rent instead.
