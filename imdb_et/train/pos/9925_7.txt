When I rented Domino, it was supposed to be very stupid. I hate movies with really flashy editing and cinematography, and Domino also got very bad comments. The only reason I watched it was that I liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott. I also enjoy the adventure stories of facts. Yes, editing and cinematography were frantic, the story was weak and the actor was mediocre, but I loved this film for a somewhat odd reason. Domino was very, very fun and often very funny. It was terribly underestimated when it appeared, because everyone wanted a more emotional journey like Scott's latest film Man on Fire, and instead became just a wonderful entertainment. I really understand why everyone hated Domino so much, even though I loved it and suggested it.
