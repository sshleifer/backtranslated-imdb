Brando plays an ace-pilot pilot that was just after the MiGs were taken down in the Korean War. On holiday, she discovers her Madame Butterfly, falls in love. Lovers see both the stupidity of racism and the cruelty that conservative cultural norms bring to human relationships. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful romance with a nice twist that rejects racist, conservative standards that dominate "Sayonara" makes you laugh and cry. Beware, sometimes the musical background wants it not to be there, even though Irving's Berlin title sings your memory for a very long time after your theater lights come in again.
