As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a fertile man. Hes made hundreds of movies, many of which are crap. At the same time, he sometimes managed to use quality work on all conveyor lines. "Succubus" is not his best job (that is, "Diabolical Dr Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but he has many brands that make it a big catalog for people interested in diving. He combines erotic (alternating with the continuation of full frontal expression and departure with imagination) and surrealism. It is a very dreamy movie, full of atmosphere. I especially liked the constant face-to-face recruitment. Despite being incredibly pretentious, it is fun to hear all of Franco's effects. Its a calm pace, but I can handle it. The problem is inconsistency. The script here was clearly rushed, and after five minutes, I had no idea what was happening (and it never came out of that moment). Those who want a substance of their own style are looking elsewhere. Also, if it is a horror film, it never becomes intimidating or even tense. I was still amused by all the psychedelic stupidity that I didn't know about these big mistakes too much. (7/10)
