I was able to download it from my satellite, but I would like to have the original version in the form that we can use in these countries. Eddie is truly proud of this performance in San Francisco. I don't remember laughing as much as the routine. My husband and I enjoyed this tape and his work with Glorious, I just wish I could buy and buy Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more of our exhibitions.
