Finally I got to see the notorious "ice age". In addition, maybe it's not so dead when I was hoping to see a brilliant teaser, not the bad word I can say about it. Of course, this is not as glamorous as Disney's production (besides, Fox's first attempt in full length CG movie), but it has got a huge heart and in some cases (like Manfred's eyes after seeing a sad glimpse of his past)) I found myself on the edge of tears. But when they reunited the child with their father, I couldn't keep them. A film that has no difficulty in captivating and a thin line of cliche and is able to bring it more than the best; the end result is one of the most seen animated creations. The big funny characters that quickly grow on you (and also the great talents of votes) and many funny memorable scenes, especially on Scrati, make the movie a more than enough reason. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my 2002 personal favorite funny scene. <br /> <br /> I don't get it honestly, but for some reason, CG animation seems to take the upper hand in the future. But if that just means that there are more such films (and who can forget about Pixar's creations), I don't want to, at least for now. 9/10
