This is a great American martial film. The fighting scenes were quite impressive for the American film made in the 1990s. Of course, fighting scenes are not as good as Honk Kong movies, but there are only a few American films that are fighting scenes that are as good as Honk Kong movies, even today. When you watch the American martial arts movie, you expect to see less impressive martial arts, but still some nice moves that can sometimes be surprisingly good or at least what I'm expecting from these films. I was impressed by this movie. Some struggle scenes were really impressive, exemplary, direction and plot were good enough so it's really worth watching a movie if you like 90's American martial arts movies.
