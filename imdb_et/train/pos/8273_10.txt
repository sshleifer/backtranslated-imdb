If you want Scream or something like the great studio horror product that we force us, it won't bother you. This well-written film had to think of what he had to say. The importance of myths in our lives to make it sensible, how children interpret the world (and violence), our environmental protection and the ignorance of its history and legends .. all here, but not on the surface. You could call it technically a "monster movie", although Wendigo doesn't take the physical form to the end, and then it's up to you and your beliefs about the legendary spirit / beast. Some standard thriller elements for those who are just looking for the basics and the film is never boring, though in fact the less you see the creature, the better. Fessenden successfully continues the tradition of George Romero to use the genre as a parable and discussion forum, keeping us still.
