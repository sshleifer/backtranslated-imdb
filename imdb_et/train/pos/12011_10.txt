I am stunned by the negative comments I read, and I can only assume that the people who made such comments were less honest. This is Joseph Smith's most moving and real imagination I've ever seen. It worked so well that sometimes I forgot that I was watching a movie. It made Joseph's life difficult, benevolent optimism, faith in people and God, and the ultimate sacrifice to life in a way that, frankly, left me a word and silence. If anyone who is of any Christian religion can look at this film without positively influencing it, then I must say that it is a reflection of the individual and not a film. I'll give the movie "10" and encourage honest souls to watch it. It is the least affectionate person who gave everything he had, what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film is a permanent reminder to the people we expect to be regardless of what religious beliefs we hold . - Ann Pruitt-
