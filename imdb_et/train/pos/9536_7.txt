Deranged and graphically gory Japanese film about small creatures take people over and making them necroborg-zombie like machines-beat and hack each other, so the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of it, a couple of lovers are infected. <br /> <br /> Technically excellent horror comedy (?) Designed exclusively for those with strong stomachs such as blood and body parts flying. A good taste prevents me from describing what is happening here, but lets just say it is pretty tough. If you like such a thing that forms several steps above, the slender content of all means is to see this movie. Personally, I am usually not like enjoying movies, being sick and twisted. Here I was interesting enough to suggest to people I know who really like gory movies. It is also a movie that has enough details that I want to see it again, because I know what is happening now, I want to go back and see what it was, what I wasn't. These films have a rare internal logic. <br /> <br /> A 7-member ten to those who like blood and broken limbs, its zero or more accurate triggering and hiding disorder for everyone else.
