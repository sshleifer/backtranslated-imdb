Very atmospheric cheap, showing great ingenuity when using props, kits and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create a terrible and moody texture. The story is far away, functioning is just functional, but it shows how imaginative influences can develop the entire visual narrative. This movie is recommended for this mood and texture, not the story.
