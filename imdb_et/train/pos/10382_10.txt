As with all other reviewers, I think this movie has been continuous for 30 years. I remember going to a library where I study everything I can do about this story. For more information, I even wrote to the PBS station. Nevertheless, I found out that it was a story that was printed in the newspaper in the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Faster until 2002, after years of searching for ebay a week and having a copy of VHS. There was another bidder, but I decided to win this movie. The lost provider wrote to me a copy of the prayer I gave him. Despite having a copy, I was still looking for and looking for a page that sold the DVD copy of the movie. You can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
