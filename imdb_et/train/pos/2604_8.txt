"Amazing Grace" feels very striking as it speaks of a modern story about different life in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but drama can take place in any modern city. He monitors family values, romantic relationships, and age group characteristics with an equal aplomb. It does not understand the characters, but rather puts them forward because they try to develop their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the operation is very good and the observations about the characters are sharp and sharp. I really appreciate this flowing movie.
