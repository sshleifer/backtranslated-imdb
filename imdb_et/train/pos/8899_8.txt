What a film from the 1960s really represents (to those of us who at that time were in the belly of the American belly) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated, stereotypical characters, the reality of the questions remains clear. <br /> <br /> Not only these radical times of change, but also very confusing times. Two major things changed our world then: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the overwhelming influence of the media. These two new freedoms began to become social changes that soon became institutionalized. But remember that most Americans were not involved in it ... they worked, they played, they watched the news ... and they were slowly started by minority efforts and struggles ... civil rights politicians, political activists, anti-war efforts, war against poverty. ... <br /> <br /> Especially the representation of press and television power was reflected, although the conflict in public attitudes and those who wanted to change things were at best ignored ... and at worst misled. Middle-class Americans were not all alongside baseball bats or banning their extraneous daughters. They were also confused. Let us not forget how folk artists suddenly became protest singers and how The Beatles began an attack that killed the protest movement for the people. There is no Beatle song or even a mention of it in the film. <br /> <br /> I think if you did not live for a decade, you may not have the idea of ​​a movie, the overall picture is a bit dim. At one point, I kept working hard when my sister lived in the Hog Farm and went to Woodstock. In another place, I was in Haight in Asbury and Detroit in Riga when she was working and playing housewife in Maine and Connecticut. Roles have constantly changed. <br /> <br /> The film has three middle-class family members. They represent a hippie child, a political activist and an active military. The Father represents typical attitudes and the mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance and sometimes compromise in the interests of peace. <br /> <br /> A black family consists of a minister and his son ... disproportionately, I mean. I assume that the producers knew all the variables and had to limit, or else the film would have become a long, boring documentary. The Father's message was that anger causes bitterness and bitterness causes chaos. It was clearly a message directed at today's youth. <br /> <br /> We look at a unique solution to social problems, and also how the problems divide us ... The 60s were unusual in this way and only the comparison of Roaring's 20s. In other words, this film is moral. Finally, our collective individualism will survive. Put it on your oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a God, a guru, or a free spiritual genius in the 1960s. It was a time of magic and madness. Nobody ever reaches the 60s to the right ... it was too diverse (this movie is close by). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of the fact that we learned and grew from it and that once, the generation shaped and changed America ... for the better.
