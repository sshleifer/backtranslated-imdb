Okay, we have extremely violent Verhoeven violence (though not as extreme as other Verhoeven breads), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but nothing is missing ... Oh, yeah, that's the lack of intelligence Paul Verhoeven knows about his sci in movies. I admire how Verhoeven introduces characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most of Verhoeven's films, there is not enough humor in the film to make it comedy. The overall performance was above average for most films. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not a story, not a cast or a character, but an amazing special effect that would otherwise make the movie impossible. The team has indeed made an invisible person without using things such as a floating hat suspended on piano citrate and other practical consequences (the effects of the kit). The most amazing scenes are not to be seen when Kevin Bacon is invisible when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this invisible male story deserves imagination. This is mostly done in the lab here. I would have seen the invisible Kevin Bacon kidnap the bank and get away with it, or say we steal something from people's wallets or something like that. But what's shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man an entertaining movie. Rating: B
