National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80s that combines unique characters, lots of laughs and some good music with Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor has absolutely downgraded his classmates with his classmates, he grabs the opportunity to retaliate at his class meeting. He steals one of his classmates one by one, including an innocent blind girl, a horny fat boy, a high school beauty, a king of all rehearsals, and even a ugly old lunch that served all children during high school. This film has a frightening element and it has little scenes of sexuality so I wouldn't recommend it to small children, but it's a great movie for teenagers. If you are looking for a movie with a nice score, sophisticated characters or special effects of a murderer, you may not love the class meeting. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have big laughs and fun (and who doesn't), this movie should show you the list. ++
