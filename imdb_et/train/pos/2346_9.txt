Very sweet pilot. The exhibition speaks of Tim Burton's best films ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & Chocolate Factory. Cinematography, storytelling, music, external kits call Tim Burton. There must be a connection or a strong impact, I just haven't studied enough to find out where it is. <br /> <br /> As I have seen in the forums, Anna Friel plays Zooey Deschanel, a poor man. Every time I see him, I see Zooey. Don't do it wrong, Anna Friel does a good job. Her character is very cute and lovable and you can easily confirm her. It's more annoying that I mean "Why they didn't get Zooey Deschanel." <br /> <br /> Lee Pace is doing a good job. I kept trying to remember where I knew him and just looked at it. Wonderfalls !!! A good, short-lived series since 2004. When you enjoy Pushing Daisies, you have to rent out, which is another work by Brian Fuller. Hmmmm <br /> <br /> Loved to see Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene (Small Horrors Shop). Two undervalued characters who are never able to bring their performances.
