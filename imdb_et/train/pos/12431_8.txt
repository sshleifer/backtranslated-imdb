Okay, really, I saw the previews of this movie and thought to myself what the manufacturers think? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY? How could the monotonous actor compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, they had two types of chemistry that showed a great kiss without care. Even David's humor was a match for Jolie's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he played psycho very well, as opposed to David's peaceful life-threatening situations. Overall, I was very impressed with writing and character development. I gave him 8 stars.
