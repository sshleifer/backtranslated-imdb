This is a great movie. If this is a reference, then if Hong Sang-Soo is really the "best kept secret of the Asian cinema". It is very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Lian and Hou Hsiao and covers the same areas as thematic, but I think I really enjoy it more than any of their films. Public minimalism is a little less pronounced here than in your work, although it still fits this style (the camera never moves ever) and somehow found the film less self-consciously "slowly" than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao, which I think is part of it why i enjoyed it more. In addition, it does not keep its topics as open as Hou. I felt that the film was somehow more "complete" and less open (barely) than some of their work, although this does not mean that it had much to resemble a moving plot. It would be hard for me to believe that this film did not directly affect "Lost in Translation" by Sophia Coppolat (scenes from a young woman who travels around herself, and punk panties that wear punk panties cannot seem familiar).
