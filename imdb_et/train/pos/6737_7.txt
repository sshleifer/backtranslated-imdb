The LAURA Director and the two stars (1944) were reused for this particular police: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to reduce all ties with the past, but cannot keep his inherited violent ways during questioning of suspects; one night he goes too far; Gene Tierney is an alienated woman of her victim, a hero of war, who is involved in the city's leading racket and Andrews No. 1, with Gary Merrill (who had been Andrews Snri's defender). As usual with Preminger, this is a well-designed film that has a remarkable opening-up process that is livened up by good pain, including Karl Malden (as Andrew's parent), Tom Tully (like Tierney's taxi driver father) and Neville Brand (Merrill's main toy), remarkable. with the support of Craig Stevens (like a butterfly, a beating victim), Bert Freed (Andrews's sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (Andrews Stern's outgoing boss). The latter has already warned her to improve her roads, or puts Andrews a few hours after the murder of her murder and puts the police on the wrong track of Merrill; But after Tully becomes the main suspect (by which time Andrews and Tierney are involved in romance), the policeman goes to the Merrill table, who is going to get it completely and the "frame" for the murderer's own murder! It is clear that the protagonist is a complex character, and Andrews is facing a challenge with first-rate characterization, usually complemented by Fox Noir style.
