This slippery and sharp film constantly offers. This is one of Frankenheimer's best and undervalued films, and it's just the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you have to scratch your main thinking, but I loved GET SHORTY), you have to see. In my opinion, no one can let Leonard's characters feel better than John Glover's 52 PICK-UP. Relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) tells the story of the factor of hope to amazing heights. Be a man, have some beer and watch this movie. For these purposes, my favorite Leonard books are Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer movies are SECONDS and MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place for my cold, heart-close heart DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
