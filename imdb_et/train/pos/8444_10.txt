After about 7 years of stone path in NBC, it was decided to make only one last Super Reserve. The series had been on the bubble several times because they didn't have numbers that would qualify for blocking this TV lesson. It was always great, hard core hard followers. <br /> <br /> It was almost the same as the series "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99), a sort of "Mr. In-Between" series. It was too big to simply cancel, but too small to get over Rabid Ratings Ravings. <br /> <br /> During Friday's insecure term, they had presented some of the best and bold Art Journalists. There I said it was artistic, artistic !! But please, remember that we mean artistic, but not just counterfeiting, intentional, pedantic, politically correct preaching. <br /> <br /> When finally it was certain that it was the end of the "HOMICIDE" line. ; this super-episode was prepared when it was made within 2 hours for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> Looking at all the events of the past seasons and the parade of traditional characters, the production team went out and gave us what has proven to be super-broadcast. <br /> <br /> OUR NATURE? ????? When we talk about the story, we find that the senior officer of the Baltimore slaughter unit, Mrs Al Giardello, has "pulled on", hence her job, ie. But G is not yet ready to retire. So we find that, instead of a whirlpool bean, Al works with the mayor of Charm City. <br /> <br /> While in the city, doing some campaign stops and calls, the former detective character takes an assassin ball. In life, but in a coma country, he is taken to hospital. <br /> <br /> The news is spreading quickly and, as it is officially called, we find all the Baltimore unit detectives we've seen at the show to provide our services and help. The meeting of all these former and current rubber boys is great when they collide and follow all the lead and control options. <br /> <br /> The manufacturer found a way to deal with those who had died earlier of their memory story. They managed to answer some long-standing questions and not to introduce some of them here. The whole story breaks the series in the most satisfactory and original way. But at least for now we leave it "classified". <br /> <br /> When everything is packed into a clean and small package, this TV movie will definitely be our confirmation. As for the classification of "HOMICIDE MOVIE", we have to give it A or A +. But no matter what class here, it didn't get as high as a regular weekly episode.
