I admit that I've only seen about three Shakespeare plays (Romeo and Julia, Macbeth, and of course Hamlet), I liked it, I found both so (Macbeth) and Hamlet I just found in the masterpiece. I'm glad to tell you that this adaptation is as good as an intense and dramatic game. Action is extremely strong (with Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and Billy Crystal, how are you losing?) And the change in time period (seems to be somewhere between 17 and 1800s) plays nicely when characters move and tell their notorious lines directly from the script, that all Shakespeare player fans get chills. If you are in this popular drama, I invite you to look at this powerful 1996 Shakespeare admirer Kenneth Branag.
