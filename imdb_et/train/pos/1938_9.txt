A big bad swim is a small budget, indie feeling it. So many times I start watching independent movies that have had a very good overview just to find out that they are a pretender who has voted for the people who have the idea of ​​the film and its potential to be provocative, that they will forget the movie first and especially the way of entertainment . <br /> <br /> I don't know if a big bad swimming has any message or a greater meaning or metaphor if it doesn't. <br /> <br /> BBS was right, light and warm, and human, with no great dramas or meaningful insights, I just merged characters. And when all the good films came to an end, I felt sad about the loss of this connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big or fast or insightful elsewhere, look for a movie that will try to offer you more than you can. The BBS offers a strong, enjoyable, real experience, and I felt I was rewarded and rewarded.
