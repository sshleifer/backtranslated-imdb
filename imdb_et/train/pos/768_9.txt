Kinematically, this film smells like. So many actors do. But I don't care. If in the 80s there was a strong representation, such as <br /> <br /> (a lot inside us) and what hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> people and break dancing was really nice. Great <br /> <br /> Dancing! It seems almost to be a past-time documentary <br /> <br /> when hip-hop was a lifestyle. It is also interesting to see New York, who sees a nuclear attack close to zero. Some viewers <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that it was poor in the 70's and 80's. This is the best of all hip-hop / break <br /> <br /> dance movies that appeared during this period. Of course, the 80's are now joking about all the bad TV shows and <br /> <br /> movies, but those of us who lived through are always fond of the time when music, dance and graffiti were fresh , yo!
