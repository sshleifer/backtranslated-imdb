Wow ... what ... whirl. The 30s is a tenth with many kinds of movies that I imagine, especially when talking early. There were films that were painfully static and dull, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those who just didn't give her a break, sometimes in good and other times. It's one of the movies that won't stop for a minute and it's both a miracle and a loss. Lloyd Bacon, who also led the "42nd Street", must be the king of the era of depression, and he was probably excited about the opportunities brought to the cinema world because he filled that picture. Not to mention music or anyone else, one minute or two. It's totally crazy! I thought the film deserved 5 (or 6, cups) because the pace was very bad because it was extremely fast and sometimes I didn't know what was going on and what to think about. The characters seemed to be in place and forward, talking about things that didn't interest me and probably no one else. I thought I just had a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also put the woman's lead on "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler and "42nd Street" was the film whose end was the best part. And you know what? The same happened with "Footlight Parade"! The end is absolutely incredible! It's changed, hands down, the most impressive music I've ever seen. The final part gives us some musical numbers and they are, believe me, something that makes the other movie's worth. The numbers are flawless! There are three big bits and the most impressive is definitely the second. Suddenly, the screen was full of proud and ingenious camera work, beautiful people and ordinary entertainment that made me forget about my little headache.
