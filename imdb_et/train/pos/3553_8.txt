Boys and dolls are itching in the movie to do it. It was done forty-eight years ago. Its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Though the big version of the new version would be a success for the box-office, he would not have succeeded in capturing this version of magic. Its unlimited energy cannot be restored, nor can you get the pure joy you get when you look at something like this: a huge widescreen, a great entertainment movie. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (who was last 409 pounds). the last time I heard) is Sky Masterson, one of New York's biggest gamblers. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose so-often-possible-find-talking-for-it-crap game is famous throughout the city. But if one place he has left is $ 1,000, Detroit needs money quickly. He puts $ 1,000 in Masterson to bet that he can't send the missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana the next day. <br /> <br /> Boys and dolls are basically nothing but uneven songs and dances, usually like here, add fun. It is obvious to see how it was Broadway's musical: there were not so many sets and scenes were long. If I had to complain about one thing, it would be if the songs were uneven. At times there were two songs on the scene; at other times thirty minutes without one. Boys and dolls are never boring but a great time. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated.
