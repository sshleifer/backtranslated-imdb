The emotional impact of this film breaks words. It is elegant, exquisite, beautiful and tragic, all rolled for two hours. This is Will Smith, when he matures to become operational, its full range. Who knew? I saw happiness and thinking that it must be a scary, a surprising actor, Smith. His performances in both films represent Smith's second dimension, the improvement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm not sure, but I look at him differently. Seven pounds is one of those films that you need to stop your convictions to enjoy your fullness. Don't look at it for the plot, look at it from the heart as well as the metaphorically fragile human heart. This is the story of people's guilt, reconciliation, love and sacrifice.
