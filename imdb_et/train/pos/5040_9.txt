For the first time, I saw Frailty's trailer on Yahoo Movies, after Stephen King heard it in the high sky. Not really a fan of either star, I still wanted to see it because I'm a big thriller fan. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed. Action was great, especially with two young boys. Usually read by child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were great. Bill Paxton really did a good job of managing it. It was beautifully photographed. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that the plots have been turned. Ultimately, the three turns hit hard and fast, and I didn't see them coming. The last twist of the movie with just the degree of difficulty that has been revealed gives me chills to this day, even though I've been watching the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> Real Pearl.
