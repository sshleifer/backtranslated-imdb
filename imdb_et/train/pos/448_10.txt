I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I don't just refer to the breathtaking landscape. It is about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to break their not so happy home life. Finally, a total of four women are rented, all with different persons and for various reasons to stay there. In this magically beautiful place, they find all the peace they desire and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions, more than without. I think it is also wonderful because of the relationships that have emerged from goodness and understanding. Exhibition is a pleasure to look at yourself. I especially like the characters from Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
