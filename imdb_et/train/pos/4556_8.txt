I was watching this movie with joy. <br /> <br /> It's probably one of the best movies ever. It has a timeless value, so you get so much that it's amazing. There are parts that move, funny and just great. <br /> <br /> All aspects are on the ground, the story is perfect, every detail is 100% real, small Irish nuances are covered. Using low and high footage gives Cristyle two great views (see it). <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible. I've never seen this actor. It's really amazing. <br /> <br /> And it's so big to see, it flows so well, it's probably the closest thing you can experience in real life. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, you should see it. There's no doubt there is something there.
