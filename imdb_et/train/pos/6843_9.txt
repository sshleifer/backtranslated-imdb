Writer-director Brian De Palma is known for his film type, which is somewhat unfairly called "Hitchcock Imitations". Contrary to popular belief, De Palma Hitchcock is not hanging; he lends a story or character elements that may be seen on Hitchcock's film and then extends to them more violently, more modernly. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known to be blended with blood-wetted death as a nervous humor. <br /> <br /> "Back in 1980", perhaps De Palma is the most well-known Hitchcockian movie, and it's probably his best. The track includes serum killers robbing both the burnt housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and the street-wise whore (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, it reminds you clearly of "Psycho", but De Palma's flick is just as technically brilliant and darkly creative. The sequence of the museum is particularly well-appreciated and edited; Also, the lift's puncture site is one of the most unique bugs ever put on film. "Dressed to kill" may not be a complete original, but I'd say it's definitely worth your time. Rated 105 minutes. 9 out of 10
