This movie does not contradict the first, as far as Care Bears origin and Care Bear Cousins ​​goes. I don't deny that. But if you look at "Part II" as a separate film, this is a very good movie. I remember it in the early 80s (and then I got into a targeted demographic audience) and I love it much more than the first movie (not that I didn't like it, but it seemed to be a little extra). Of course it is darker than the first one, but maybe it is so good. And it's also darker in the deeper way (that kids may not fully understand, but may still be a little scared about the atmosphere it gives, and adults will certainly look faster than watching this movie again in the mid-twenties now), where you have a basically young girl who deals with the evil spirit / demon in return for something else. Take a picture? But just looking at it as a baby, be sure, as I said, that it can be a little scary, but nothing traumatic. In fact, if something gave me another fantasy game, I can play this age playing. I can't tell you how many times I pretended that the dark heart wanted to imprison me, whether I have to help him hit Care Bears, I tried to turn to the blind and other things like that. the film was also good for my imagination. It is also a very emotional depth. I watched it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Also, Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for Dark Heart's voice (I always thought it always). <br /> <br /> It's just too bad now that they never made a soundtrack available. Sometimes I just want to hear a movie, despite growing up, as good as it is. <br /> <br /> "What is love and caring if he doesn't save him?"
