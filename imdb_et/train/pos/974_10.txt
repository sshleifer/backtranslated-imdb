One director Miike Takashi is the best. It's so good that words are hard to put. Almost fifteen years older than the target group, he fascinated me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> She resembles similar children's movies from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) these films were not intimidating - there are many unpleasant details that I found in the jarring from the start, but soon realized that it was not different from what I grew up with. The film is a collection of 80's children's film conventions. You call it, it's there: a young boy hero who pulls his unhappy / insecure world into another where mythical and mystical goblins live; an attempt to save both worlds from evil force; a beautiful heroine she loves; sadistic henchwoman (Go-Go Yubari, Kill Bill Vol. 1); The leading villain who pulls his evil power from what everyone in the world can associate with. But all these genre conventions get a fresh spin and add depth. <br /> <br /> One of the IMDb reviews starts with "Where was this movie when I was a kid?" and it is the feeling that I wholeheartedly agree with. Even when I was watching, I regretted that I hadn't grown up; that it was not part of my childhood, like a labyrinth, universe masters, and, to a much lesser extent, an endless story. These films and others, like The Goonies, are remembered but never copied - Miike desperately offers new things. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is the main, sometimes budget constraint, of many of its films. so often an artistic choice - the desire to introduce things to the extreme. Here, on average, CGIs are only on average due to budget constraints, but despite that, it does a fantastic job. CG effects combine with traditional dolls, animation, and a truly extraordinary make-up to create a world full of rich characters (and testimonials) that are often confined to the seer. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest films ever made by children. Not for younger and more sensitive children. <br /> <br /> Just jaw-weird. See it for yourself and if you think your kids can rate it, rate it to them. Let them grow up for the Great Yokai War as a small reward you couldn't.
