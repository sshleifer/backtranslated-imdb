It was my favorite movie as a child and I've been on the stage a few times, so it's always my favorite, and I doubt anyone could ever make Oliver Twist's screen again. <br /> <br /> My all-time favorite '' bad boy '' must be Oliver Reed like Bill Sikes. Not only did he intimidate my life when I looked at it at the age of 6, but now, as a woman, I can get Nancys-like empathy, a bar lady / prostitute who helps Oliver earn her life. > <br /> Jack Wilde as an artistic dodger was fantastic, and I don't think anyone could ever make him like a street picker voter and Fagin's best friend. The music is fantastic, especially Fagin's numbers, I'm also very grateful if they didn't give Bill Sike a musical number, it wouldn't have worked with him to be such a sinful character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did a great job at Nancy's sticky end, holding it as a G-movie, beating his beating, but giving it enough to show Bill's violence against him. <br /> <br /> This film is both charming and charismatic as a musical song, and it is a moving drama that follows a young son when he tries to find out where he belongs.
