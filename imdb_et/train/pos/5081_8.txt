This movie was terrible and even less than a convincing end, it's still worth it. The film begins when Claudette Colbert marries Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, the man jumps and says Colbert can't get married because he's already married! Colbert emphasizes that this is not true, but when they study, they find peace justice and many others remember their wedding and even have a signed wedding license! Slowly it turns out that Claudette's mind is sliding and people around her seriously question her peace of mind. When the supposed first wife is murdered, all evidence and doubts fall on Colbert. <br /> <br /> Film is an exciting mystery film because what I've described so far is only the first part of the movie. . The following is amazingly smart and exciting. Unfortunately, however, the conclusion is a bit devastating because the whole force behind it comes "left out" and is puzzled because it was so unexpected and impossible to guess. information provided to the viewer. Nevertheless, the film was so good that I even apologize for the end of the hips. In particular, Robert Ryan did an excellent job as he was a groom from "sleeping", although other performances were excellent as well.
