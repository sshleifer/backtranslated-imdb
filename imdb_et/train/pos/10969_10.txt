I knew, but had never seen Gray Gardens before I saw Broadway music of the same name. Friends warned me that if I hadn't seen the movie, the music wouldn't make sense. It did, but it also prompted me to rent a movie. First I thought it was a train wreck, full of strange, burning signs, and it was extremely difficult to see. But if you can stop it, dig it and go back, I realized why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their lack of complete self-awareness is worth seeing. Both remain apparent despite aging. They have a relationship that cools the woman (and undoubtedly some men) and makes you communicate with your mother again. At a time when reality television and cinema are common, it is exciting to see Maylesese's work three decades ago and understand what impact the film must have. <br /> <br /> I repeat what other posters have said: How were they allowed to slip into this cube by their family? But beyond that, two people living in the 1970s can get out of reality in this way? Or were they just too crazy? I would recommend viewing this with a comment line that gave me an additional insight into the movie.
