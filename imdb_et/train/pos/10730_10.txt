Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came about at the same time as Challenger Explosion. What really set when to bring it out or even when they should. I'm glad they did. I first looked at SpaceCamp in the movie. That really brought a lot of viewing. <br /> <br /> When I heard about Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I've never heard of others in the movie. So there was a big shock for me to find all the young people who were acting and acting really good! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also very good. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes where these kids were shown how to act. The scenes of the children who are ready for the trip received only hope. Of course, the actual launch of a spacecraft is old news for us. However, it was different. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my most valuable films. Escapist maybe, but it was awesome for me a space like a nut. After it is probably 30 - 40 times rented. Finally, I found it available in a particular store and bought it. Now when it only appears on DVD. I probably have it forever. This movie is from 9 out of 10 in me.
