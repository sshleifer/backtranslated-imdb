Let me be the first non-Australian who commented on it :) I got a movie for Hugo Weaving and watched it to the end. This is one of those "life books" because my mother called a film that depicts a real story without extraordinary events and is mostly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I liked light and girls. The rest were not too much to blame, but not too big. I missed something like this Interview or at least some of the matrix control elements here and there, but something ordinary. The story teaches one in front of his destiny and frees himself from the environment that others create for you, but this happens when the peach factory in the area closes soon, so there is not much effort to change things. <br /> <br /> "Smart" The song of American beauty in the background of a song could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but the fact that one plays over and over again was annoying after a 100-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think he did his job in performing a part of Australian life, but it didn't seem like Australia (it could have been placed everywhere) and it didn't seem like an attractive story. <br /> <br /> I think the movie must be in a certain mood.
