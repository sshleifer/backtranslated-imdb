Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements to the first person's tired genre. This is about Patrick Galloway, an expert on occult and fearsome fighters, whom his friend called his property in Ireland to investigate some strange phenomenon. The game is in Ireland after World War I, so don't wait to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers. All game weapons can be considered antique, but the real fun game is its spells and the system they work on. Our hero is ambidexterous, so he can use both hands at once: he casts his spells with his right hand and uses his arms on the left. this game is also unique! The graphics are great and can work with a medium-capacity P.C..Wide design is also cool and atmospheric. In most cases, the game revolves around the mansion and the manor, but there are many other places you expect during the discovery. Thanks to Clyve Barker's talent, the game has a great story and plot (something very rare for the first person shooters) and I said before the big and very horrible atmosphere that voice action is good, but not great. But the game has two main drawbacks. First of all, it is quite linear, so if your mission says, for example, to go into this room, all the doors of the house will be locked apart from those that lead to your mission space, which can save you time, but it will limit your freedom of investigation. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antiques is not the case for most fps players who are accustomed to high-tech weapons. As for the difficulty, the game is very balanced. Most of them are of medium severity, but sometimes it gets harder but not complicated. Overall, it is surprising to have a great game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
