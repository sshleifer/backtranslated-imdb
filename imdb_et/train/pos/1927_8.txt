With the death of GEORGE NADER on 4 February 2002, I thought of this most interesting program, which, although it was only short-lived, had a huge idea with good storylines. In general, it is not invisible for more than 40 years, but it is worth looking at again. Opening credits showed many different images, one of which was the COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP look, belonging to his famous rocket rap at the place he was often called "The Fastest Person".
