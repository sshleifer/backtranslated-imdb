This exhibition is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother is killed by a drunk driver, so their father, Danny, calls his brother (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about alive. Girls go through life and live lessons. They develop breakages, friends and more. The whole exhibition goes basically to the stream. You don't have to scare what you just let it go. I think this exhibition is very good and fun to watch. I grew up looking at this example and still look at it today. I'm glad they still show television. I look at it almost every day. I rate it 10/10.
