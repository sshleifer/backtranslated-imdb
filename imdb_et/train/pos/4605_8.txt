Not only is it one of the biggest Jackie Chan movies, but also the biggest kung-fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We have been waiting for crazy tricks and fast creative action in Chan's movies, and it sets a benchmark for others to follow. It is two hours of pure entertainment that impressive. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent action, we have a viable story and credible characters, Chan takes what seems to be a western approach to writing, blending Eastern resolution methods (ie kicking ass). <br /> <br /> Generally it is funny, serious, fun and groundbreaking. Need for every kung-fu fan, while it remains accessible to the wider community of the film community.
