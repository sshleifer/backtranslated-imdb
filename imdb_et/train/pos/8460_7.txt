Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate it for getting Gundam and anime at all. But after looking at your predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even G Gundam, I find Wing to be Gundam Lite. <br /> <br /> Characters: Gundam's long-term aspect is to get into the characters of these characters and grow into maturity. It doesn't happen in Wing. Heero is a dog at the beginning and he is a dog at the end. Personalities will not change, growth will never be achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is a hero with all intentions and goals in the series. But suddenly, this series condemns him and makes him an obvious cause for the villain. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has great designs. Gundams is really cool because Epyon is my favorite. I think some of the designs of the OZ suit are equal to some classic Zeon suits. But the sweet suit shapes will not save the series with bold characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Finally, Wing has cool fighting scenes, even though they are full of recycled animation, but with low lines and character development. Pleasant but not moving like previous Gundam tours.
