I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, but it's not new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is grouping it with other war films, this movie is wrongly classified! He's not a war movie that is more than one "crap over the cuckoo nest" is a shelter movie or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. It is a film that deals with individuality, non-compliance, self-confidence and the cost of this type of personality. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "One Flying Over the Cuckoo Slot" and "Cool Hand Luke" in its HEA company and has its own. For these films, it should be kept and compared, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
