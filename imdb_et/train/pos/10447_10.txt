There are many people in our lives that we only meet once in our lives, but for some reason or another, we remember these people for the rest of their lives. These times in life-long friendships are people who have long distances, and there are always natural reasons why we no longer respond to these people. We don't always know their names because we have never been introduced to each other and sometimes we even forget to ask their names. It's funny when ordinary mankind makes random friends and we want to keep it like that because reunification can ruin memorable memories or we don't know if they do it. We're too afraid to check it out. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" I just looked at it. I had never intended to review it, but since a couple of discussions seemed interesting, I was looking for the rest of the movie. I didn't know what to expect, but also a young couple. They had time to discuss each other until sunrise and something could happen before they had to divorce. I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that all the inhabitants of this planet have lived at least once or twice. It makes us all think of all the people we've only met once in our lives.
