I thought Mukhsin was wonderfully written. This is not just about entertainment. There are tons of fine messages that I think Yasmin tried to overcome. And yes, it can cause some confusion for you (especially if you weren't looking at Sepet and / or Gubrat 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet I noticed how they use the two movie characters before? It's really ironic how the characters are involved. Like his superior, this prostitute is Gubral. And in the future, the chick snooker pad is a religious and a woman of a godly person. <br /> <br /> And I totally love voice transmissions. Its crude oil was awake fresh. As they took Rumah Tumpangan's Gamini target, Mukchin's voice came suddenly, saying "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .." (scene when he climbed to the tree). <br /> <br /> He hit Malaysia's attitude (and somewhat light when they are pathetic, characterized by. For example, even children can be really sharp tongues (with exciting annoying voices) and just a bad mouth ppl all the movie long And how can you be such a dude and talk about ppl if your life is not solved. <br /> <br /> All I can say is this film has fully achieved my expectation if it wasn't over. /> <br /> It kept me glued to the screen, I couldn't even remove the eyes from it.
