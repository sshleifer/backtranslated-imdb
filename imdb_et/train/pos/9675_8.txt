Most people can say that if you watch a movie on a Saturday night, you really have to be bored. In fact, I had just come back home and turned on the TV and it was "Paulie". <br /> <br /> I hadn't opened a credit so I didn't know its name, but I saw it was Cheech Marin, so I thought I was tuned to "Born In East L.A". When I saw her talking to a parrot, I was ready for it as a flop film they were showing late at night. <br /> <br /> Luckily, it was better. As you know, if you have not lost Paulie and are trying to return to your original owner. It would take years to find her. What should be Paulie's advantage is actually an advantage. People experience an illiterate parrot and everything they see is an opportunity to make money or benefit themselves. <br /> <br /> Although the character of Cheech Marin is "earning him" money, he doesn't mean him. Dancing sets with parrots is something kids find cute, I found them fun. Especially the owner of the animal test laboratory. The man lies to him, saying he helps him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communication research. Paulie is now stuck, but decides to fool him for Paulie's vocal competition. <br /> <br /> The entire film, Paulie, tells the story of the buildings that eventually release her, finding a number of other animals and Paulie's owner. This is a meeting. <br /> <br /> Of the 8 out of 10, the wings cutting scene should be expected and not shown. This part can disturb younger children. Otherwise, this is a great movie for older children and adults who are a heart child. (END)
