The life of the error is a very good animated feature. This film is for younger children, but it is also a great film for my age. The story is about an antique called Flik. He destroyed his colony when he destroyed food that was meant for high grasslands. She goes out and she has to find bigger mistakes. This movie is classic because it's a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. Animation is brilliant especially in the late 90s. The story is good, but it would be a bit more detailed. Voice action is good as with most animation films. Music is great to listen to. Nothing special, but he served as a candidate for one music category. Overall, this movie hit me amazingly. This is a good movie for all families. I appreciate this movie 10/10.
