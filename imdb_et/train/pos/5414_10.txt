This happy lucky 1939 military career based on a rather relaxed Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem and his novel "Soldiers Three" qualifies for first-rate entertainment for the British Imperial Army in the 1880s. Cary Grant offers more hits with her knocked fist than she put together in all her films. This six-fisted yarn is located far away in India, home to the three harsh British Sergeant and their native carrier Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), who are fighting for the bloody cult of the murdered Indians, called Thugge. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant, "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen "The Informer") and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, "The Dawn Patrol" Jr.) Is a competitive trio with hard drinking, running and the history of the lovingly loving Alpha men who have been dirty for years, as Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the road company. Of course, Cutter and MacChesney roll out different schemes on the lines of Ballentine's plans. If their bosses order them back with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote, "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so he can't get them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the amusements look at how the principals try to cross each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens marks the spirit of adventure in great style and scope when our heroes obey the Thuggeese army. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for outstanding black and white cinematography.
