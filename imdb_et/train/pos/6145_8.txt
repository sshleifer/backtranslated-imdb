Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but it is still a lovely movie. Angela Lansbury is excellently dotty like Engletine Price and David Tomlinson is very fun when Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was also great. But the children did not have the same shine, although Paul is very funny and cute. The songs were not as bad as some people say "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact, all the songs are outstanding. Special effects were marvelous, with a lot of magic, and the story was original enough. Highlights, like Mary Poppins, were animated sequences. The underwater order was beautiful, but my favorite was a football match that was completely fun. The only other criticism was that I didn't get to the end when I first saw it. All in all, it's a lovely movie that is hardly ever. 8/10 Bethany Cox
