I guess I never understand Renny Harlin's hatred. "Die Hard 2" was cool and he gave the world "Cliffhanger", one of the most awesome movies. That's right, you little pants, "Cliffhanger rules, and we all know that." <br /> <br /> Sly plays the former rescue tower, Gabe Walker, who "just visits" her old town when asked to help former friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) help save the mountain area. Walker was obviously back in a pleasant time because stranded people are actually a team of experienced thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. they have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really want it back ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Cliffhanger is another Die Die clone. Just trading within the Nakatomi Plaza is the Rocky Mountains open mountainous areas with scenes that point to our hero's weaknesses and keep him mortal. Of course, this structure is ripping fast enough, because Stallone's character avoids a large amount of bullet and slams on the first stone surface without any visible side effects. After all, isn't that what movies do? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting movies. Presentation of large scenes and tricks. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in the movie, and while the rest of the movie doesn't improve from the start, it keeps its amazement. John Lithgow's leading villain is fun and one bad guy. Probably one of the coolest leading crooks. <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is just one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely Renny Harlin's best efforts and very exciting action movie - 9/10
