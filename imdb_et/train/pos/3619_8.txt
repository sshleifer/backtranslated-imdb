Despite Disney's best efforts, it's a fun movie about watching your dreams. I was surprised that it did not hit me to the maximum; this movie played fair. Dennis Quaid was very good in the role, saying something for a sports movie. I don't remember how many sports movies are disappointed to annoy me; here, everyone sees the part. This movie is surprisingly good, and I predict it will make a surprising business because it is a G-rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert, on the contrary, this film is a success.
