Not that many movies have really used the fear that many people can go to the dentist. Professionals have some really scary search tools. Give writers Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon and Charles Finch a value in their room for maximum make-you-squirm-in-your-seat shock. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen, a beautifully nuanced performance, is Alan Feinstone, a dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the track early. Unbalanced obsessive compulsive, he begins to live with the ideas of decay, even depicting it where it is not, and also equating disintegration with public corruption in general. After seeing his incredible wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) with her pool boy, she decided to punish her. At the same time he is under pressure smarmy I.R.S. agent (Earl Boen, best known as Dr. Silberman, from the "Terminator" franchise) to make an agent in charge of Feinstone's financial matters. Feinstone begins to perceive all the people around him as they have broken down in one way or another, and he continues the murder as the police detective Gibbs (always welcome by Ken Foree) rises his path. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna is clearly fun with the script. This allows for some truly nasty and remarkably entertaining scenes that make both compassion for the victims and the excitement of the audience. The script gives some fine dialogs to Feinstone's character and is generally quite clever and amusing, with large doses of black and black humor (like Feinstone commissioning the victim to "get his tongue out!"). Brooke and I.R.S. agent indicator in particularly effective torture scenes. Makeup effects are usually pretty good. And the film does a fine job of maintaining its momentum of progress, as Feinstone, with his relentless ride for perfection, turns into a record-breaking professional unhinged killer. <br /> <br /> Foree, always cool and fun to play, is rather wasted in the role of a regular detective, but Boen has some pleasure in looking at his slick ball. Hoffman and Christa Sauls offer a very attractive eye candy. And before the fame Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. But it is very much Bernese's exhibition, when his teeth (giving grace to me for using this expression) are in the leading part of my plum with full conviction. <br /> <br /> "Dentist" is one of the original and interesting horror movies coming out of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
