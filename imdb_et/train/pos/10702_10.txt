What critics and audiences were shown, BIRTHDAY GIRL was supposed to be a big fat clinker. However, since I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. It was quite worth watching. Of course, this is not your basic American comedy, and it doesn't understand the genius that it's a British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all other films, the breath of fresh air. Of course there were some holes in the plot, but generally it worked. First of all, Kidman was again very different, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy. He just proves that he is one of Hollywood's greatest talents. His Russian accent not only speaks English-speaking languages, but also when he is in Russian for a long time and if you did not know that it was Nicole Kidman, he would never doubt his authenticity. Harrison Ford should have marked "K-19." Generally a light little movie that works despite the terrible buzz.
