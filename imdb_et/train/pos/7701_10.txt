It has always been one of my favorite films and is always there. In recent years, I have become a 50-ies Sci-fi freak of the 1960s, trying to gather all the better that was made. I love them a lot about how they could be, how some of them were technically correct. Also big colors and kits go to me. It is a pity when they make some of these good old movies again; they almost always put it up - just look at the day the Earth was standing, it's a complete rubbish! The forbidden planet is one of the benchmarks of all-time space films, and now they are trying to do it again and I despise what's new! In my opinion, some things, such as fantastic classic movies, should be left alone to be the ones they are, a classic example of a great effort to talk about simple stories and give people the thrill of this process. If they've added all the carts we have now, it looks like the movie is more of a dog-meat from the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special. By the way, I notice that astronaut uniforms in the Forbidden Planet were also used for the "Space Space Queen"! It just tells you that the budgets were then a little lower, didn't you? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Great performances in this movie by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been my favorite actor), Earl Holiman and of course Robby Robot! <br /> <br /> Special effects are fantastic and the story is not drawn too far. This is a great sci-fi experience!
