Now here is the film that has come from my childhood, my family was made before; but it got lost and disappeared over the years. Now I was happy to watch the whole movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful movie when I looked at it as a child, and after watching again (online), I still do today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I always remember this sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at open credits (for whom animation, who), that some animators come from the 1930s (WOW! It's like 47 years).
