It was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. I wanted to stay with VHS forever. Is it never again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember it was once a week incited, and waiting for the next episode was scary. I want to see it again. I want to buy it. I want what I can't. Not even in EBAY. So it was big enough that it was by far one of the 80's best series. It should be considered classic but disappear in space. At least this website and Wikipedia mention it. Fit. <br /> <br /> It was alluring, funny, flirtatious and original. Perhaps not like Sherlock Holmes's original, I think Quintin is much more attractive and has better chances with his leading lady than the rigid and critical Holmes.
