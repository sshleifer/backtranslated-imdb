A good movie about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think about the little things in life that can have a significant impact on someone else's life without you ever knowing. It's a small world and this little movie shows us. <br /> <br /> Bad thing: there are too many characters and it's hard to say who is the main character, but it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> His wonderful film and many people compare it to Magnolia, which I haven't seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated --- I would appreciate it with PG -13 for short violence, some language and sexual situation.
