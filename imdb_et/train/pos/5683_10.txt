Simply saying that you have a movie with John Holmes, there is a guarantee that I can get some people on the screen, but the writer / director James Cox offers a lot more. Slicky Hollywood's "Rashamon", movie cleavers The July 1981 Wonderland murders through various angles (and movie stocks), but mostly through the John Holmes rodent brain filter. In the bad guys full movie, Holmes is whistle, most pathetic or both. Several versions of the story appear and merge, as Cox flashes the effect and emotion by turning the jumps and title cards. Dialogue is fast and natural and never speaks wrong. When the film takes place two years after Holmes had fallen out of pornography and the really bad drug misery, Kilmer relentlessly expresses sexuality so that it can be measured in customs. This sexuality on its edges creates a mindset that hangs almost as strongly as the middle of the film. These murders are persecuted throughout the film, although they have never been clearly shown, even at the peak, although their violence relentlessly creates the whole picture and much blood is sprayed across walls and crimes. Once again, Val Kilmer as Holmes shows that he can do better than anyone else. The kilmer is constantly characterized and the character is a constantly exciting car wreck. Separate the performances next to Kilmer, which definitely include Ted Levine as a leading cop in the study and Lisa Kudrow as a Holmes alienated woman. The criminals' Holmes fall with scary high energy Josh Lucas, which is always interesting for Timothy Blake Nelson and absolutely recognizable Dylan McDermott, who is at the center of the second version of the murders. Cox suggests that no matter how much we know about Wonderland, there is always a worse version, but looking at the inconvenience surrounding it is much more exciting than understanding the truth.
