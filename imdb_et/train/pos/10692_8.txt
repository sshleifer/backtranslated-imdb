Good, funny, simple story, great Nicole Kidman (I'm almost always like movies). It was a good "vehicle" for someone who is in comedy and drama because both have elements. Romantic comedy surrounded by two crimes, large closure lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good in another but unpopular romantic comedy ("The Truth About Cats and Dogs"). Maybe they're too unlikely. Ebert didn't even post an overview of it. Apparently, the big "scooter" comedies were completely unlikely ("Baby Bringing", etc.). If you've seen one incredible comedy, have you seen them all? Or maybe people are moving forward from the 1930s. Weird. Birthday Girl is a movie I've enjoyed many times. Nicole Kidman may be a home video "killer application".
