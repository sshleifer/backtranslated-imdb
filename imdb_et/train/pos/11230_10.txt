Several news agencies have spoken about the hidden border and have declared that they are committed to creating the best Star Trek stories and examples of Gene Roddenberry's mission. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and the acceptance of different races is equal to that of other Trek and movies. The production value began to be smaller and dirty, but during the seven production seasons the actor has improved, stories are more complex and visual graphics are smoother and more impressive. The 6th season episode 1, the countermeasures, is one of the biggest room battles in Trek's history. The ships are well covered and space battles are impressive and exciting. Frontier's real introduction is not ships or backgrounds, but people and the interaction and growth of characters. Also, all the other Trek series and movies we all know. I recommend any Trek fans to check for countermeasures and you're hooked!
