Jammin 'Blues is nominated by the Oscar in 1944, which is basically a 10-minute improvisational jazz, played with a long jam. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" at one point to highlight the movie, then jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring this most fun "jam" to her exciting end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer and this experience shows the double exposure of some musicians, making it one of the most innovative in the 40s. According to some remarks, I read that one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette, reflecting the social attitudes of time. What a shame. However, this is the most unusual time movie available on YouTube, so if you love jazz, I suggest you look for it.
