The only explanation why I can distribute this film widely is because it hits a home too close. This movie was a real happy surprise, satire is a genius. This film turns the lights in the dark, which is organized religion and great media, and the sparks disappear. Rent a DVD and watch it yourself if you haven't done it yet, this movie will succeed when many have failed (Dogma comes to mind) to hit his nose under the tent, using both humor and very smart analogies with backgrounds and locations. . Uncovering some of the important spoilers can not be commented in depth, with some surprises in this movie, even captured by experienced movie buffers.
