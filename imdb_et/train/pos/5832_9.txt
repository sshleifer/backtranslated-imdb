After seeing this movie as a child over 30 years ago, I have never seen it. From the scenes from the horn factory to the rear of the car to the rear of the car to answer Ollie's phone and pull out Stan's accidental window, I think it was probably their last day. After that, they moved to the 20th century Fox, and although these films were not terrible, they lacked the comic timing of this film. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long-lasting foil, with the last look of the boy, showing the doctor is super! Quote: "I told goat milk" his response to Stan, asking him how you milk milk! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin! I'd say all in one of my favorite L&H comedy.
