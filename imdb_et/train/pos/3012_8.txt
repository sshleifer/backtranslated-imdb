It's one of those movies you haven't seen before - so you can see it again for the first time. Van Dine's books still bring joy - but many have called them too flowers. This film is the best film of his creation. William Powell is William Powell - no more. The plot is complex. The story moves too fast because you want it to last. Enjoy.
