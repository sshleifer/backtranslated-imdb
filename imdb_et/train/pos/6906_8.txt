I enjoyed this movie. It was funny, cute, silly and fun. There was a subtle cast and some critics really got caught up for reasons I really don't understand. No, it was not "anger anger" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> Julia played great psychotic "man behind". The story is a bit stupid to be sure, but it's not a big drama, people. I saw a review of the film, probably the only good thing he got, and then found it one night when looking for a movie. I've never heard that it should smell until I saw it, and I'm glad I saw it. Finally, the VHS tape was bought on discount packaging and I look at it a few times a year.
