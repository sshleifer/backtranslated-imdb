It's refreshing to see a movie that you think ends happily like almost every other American film and then surprised if it doesn't happen. I like the happy ending as much as the next man, but sometimes it is better to imagine things more realistically and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. <br /> <br /> The end, sacrificing one of your friends for the second, thus redeeming your previous bad behavior that got them in the first situation was very touching. I would almost have done without the last line, which proved that he did not actually do the act he admitted because it would have changed the friendship between the two girls and less about the crime. Whether or not he did it was not so important. <br /> <br /> The story itself limited the clich√©s, but the actors kept my attention with great performances. Very realistic, very enchanting. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
