I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a black-and-white movie for people who love nature movies. The film shows the different climates and the animals associated with them, starting from the North Pole and moving south as the film progresses. The film material of this film is often breathtakingly beautiful, and I thought several times how they could have taken off the earth from water or heaven. But the beautiful, big part of the footage I had already seen in the "Planet Earth" TV series, described by David Attenborough. I found that Attenborough has told the Earth planet much better than the Earth's narration. "Earth" is a simpler film. It leaves much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in its Planeed Earth series. For example, Earth tells you that the tropical sea is ideal for young coupons because there are few predators. Planeed Earth tells you that the tropical sea is a good kindergarten because the water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support very large animals like big sharks, etc. For me, this is an important difference. This, along with much higher Attanborough voice, makes Planet Earth a much better documentary than Earth. However, I think the Earth is worth looking at beautiful material and the fact that it is easier to understand is also interesting for children.
