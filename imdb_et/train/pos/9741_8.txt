I was pleasantly surprised to find that losing friends and alienation was not a "comedy" comedy because the trailer was waiting for me. I quickly absorbed the narrative in the opening and stayed there. I thought more visual humor content seemed. (I mean, I have the impression that I saw Pegg's attempts to restore the lost control very much in real time), so at other moments it was time to share the main protagonists (ie Pegg and Dunst) in how the events influenced them and which led them to where they found themselves now. All the characters were well cast, somewhat interesting and in themselves, and generally quite pleasant. (Every obvious ruthless ambition that was shown tended to relieve the corresponding goodwill.) An entertaining, intelligently-written, brilliantly targeted, and well-acted film that I would recommend thoroughly.
