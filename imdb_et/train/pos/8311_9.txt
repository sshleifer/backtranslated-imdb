I liked this movie, it was good and the actors were great! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classical singers, is very good at seeing him in a musical movie, you know it's going to be good! I suggest people watch this heart warming, sadness and special movie if they want to know more about Richard! Outstanding! Fresh!
