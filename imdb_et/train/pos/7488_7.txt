Someone (or something.) Leaves the dots on their blood to the jugular and drain victims. The police detective Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas, before the B-film slides out of the horrors of horrors) has tended to be against who .. or what is behind their notorious crime. The village crosses hysteria, and Karl depends on his trusted medical genius, dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill, in yet another effective mad scientist role) to give feedback on what could cause innocent deaths. He is also afraid of his beloved Ruth (lovely Fay Wray, who celebrates for the third time with Atwill after the "doctor X" and "wax museum mystery") who is Niemann's assistant. <br /> <br /> Dwight Frye steals the movie as a idiot of a natural village that collects bats and carries demented behavior wherever he goes ... it's easy to see why he's a suspect because local paranoia is a fever. Maude Eburne gives the film's humor a very naive (..and easily influenced) patient, von Niemann, who believes he has ailments he reads near the books he is working on. He is impressive and often von Niemann just humores him and the constant fictional illnesses he feels afflicted. Lionel Belmore returns as a terrifying, superstitious Burgermeister. <br /> <br /> Creaky, static but rather entertaining thanks to the majority. The film is probably as low a budget as they come, but it does not harm the film too much, as it is pretty well put together by the director Frank R Strayer and his team. I'm sure the film's print has seen better days. It is a B-horror object packed with 50 other random cheese and poverty line programmers. The film's villain ... and his motives to feed the biologically-made creature. Many might be disappointed with the end results because the film is not a real supernatural story of a real vampire murder that causes murders.
