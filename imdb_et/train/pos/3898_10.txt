The funny start describes this unique real tour-de-Star-Wars power (Luke: how strong? Vader: the strength of a small pony) where he is not even the master to break the sweat, brilliantly saving himself from mascara leakage .. - and it's almost 2 hours turning your way through history, its birthplace, Europe, and more. <br /> <br /> Heimlich's Night, "I've invented the maneuver!" British Empire "... Do You Have a Flag ..?" and the ancient dead gods, "Jeff! God of cookies!" And much more, it's a fish-flop-on-the-floor-to-jumpstart-your-lungs funny. <br /> <br /> And I testify that I've been broadcasting this video ten times over the years, seeing the British transvestite stent on the chair as one long lease for rent, especially one that has been back for ten years. And yet, this material is not only timeless, but almost oracular, transforming today into more than an amplified, funny / sad version of where we were ten years ago, although we came to think about it, which may just be a coincidence.
