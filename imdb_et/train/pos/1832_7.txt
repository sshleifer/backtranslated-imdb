I saw two movies at the weekend, one was "weight" and the other was "Waqt". Both films are made in "Bollywood", but they are worlds apart. The main difference is story and director. The lingering Shaw made his indelible mark "Ankhen", one of the best comedy in Hindi films. Casting his Castechers is perfect. The story, apparently taken from Gujerat's game, is fantastic, with some exceptions, the treatment is great. In Bollywood, when the movie is put together, the first thing Bollywood director has to do is register with the music director and this guy (mediocre Malik in this case) is required to put up six songs for his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah must use them to reassure Finacier and grandmother who just can't get these numbers enough. No music director can hardly get rid of the good songs that are clearly seen in this movie. No song has any melody, and these are clearly the story of narration, except for background music and the western version of Bharat-Natyam. Bachachan and Akshay Kumari show that Father and Son play a duel and role. His stun scenes are clearly outstanding. The good director is surrounded by good actors and is ready to wait for this super movie to get a good story. Then we have a cheap, classy, ​​tasteless producer like Sharukh Khan, who tends to be low to shamelessly blend and promote the trash like "Weight" to enrich himself at the cost of improving art, and they surround themselves in border areas and return to investment before moving around. These are Bollywood popes who robbing spectators to collect Bollywood Chamcha's "Film Farce" awards and most of them in the media.
