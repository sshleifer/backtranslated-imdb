Ever seen the original Dirty Harry, I appreciated this movie on a clean slate. And I have to say I enjoyed it. Of course, some of Sondre Locke's activities made me a little squeemish - but hey, it was in the 80's. But even if you can't miss him (and I almost couldn't) or kill his revenge (which seemed a little .. superfluous; P), it's just worth Dirty Harry. Or, at least, a bull dog he loves to call "lionheart": P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
