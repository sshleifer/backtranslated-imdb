The last chapter in the trilogy of the Hanzo razor provides a suitable closure for this entertainment series. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (dark beast, red angel, Manji) under the direction of the director, but the style is pretty much the same, maybe because of Shintaro Katsu, who acts as a producer, except for the title antihero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo will discover a female ghost who watches the treasure hidden at the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo is Hanzo, he doesn't push it down because he's a ghost, so he continues rape ... ahem, listen to him now using a familiar rotating network device. The plot passes through a series of blind monks, who also double with loans, corrupt officials, confusion and the necessary hacking and slash. The high-level officer of Hanzo, Onishi, and his two servants give typical comedy notes and are generally normal. <br /> <br /> Significantly less complicated and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place) and a bit confused), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the other (supposedly the best in the Hanzo series) but still interesting and valuable on their own. With trademark training sequences, mandatory rape, sword fighting, and mystery, Hanzo is invited to investigate, eventually satisfying the fans.
