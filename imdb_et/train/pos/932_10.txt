********* Ten stars out of ten ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that it was made for television. The phrase that is made from "TV" makes me tremble. The value of production for TV films is almost always significantly lower than the production value of professional film studios. However, this "Christmas song" version had to be released in theaters because it is so good. This is the personal favorite of my "Christmas Carol" movies, because all aspects of its production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are some small bugs on the screen that are related to the strange ghosts visiting Scrooge, but there is no movie with at least a couple of bugs. <br /> <br /> Scott turns on the meaning of Scrooge, he has the pleasure of watching. In fact, I can't think of one performance in a movie that shouldn't be praised. Costumes, positioning and wintering are mesmerizing. Musical score is loving and heart warming. Add solid leadership, flawless cinematography and faithful scripting; we have one day here, which is considered a holiday class. It hasn't really been long enough to be classic but to mark my words one day soon. This film has become my annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning of Christmas: love, self-sensitivity and giving. Both the selfish, greedy world and my family and we can lose ourselves in "Christmas Song" by playing George C. Scott.
