This movie is amazing. The plot was just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by Gackt's and Hyde's performance, having grown up in American actors who can't sing and singers who can't act. <br /> <br /> In this movie, young Sho (Gackt) comes up over the vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an improbable friendship. Kei suffers from the way she is forced to live from other vampire half-lives. <br /> <br /> It's a sad film, but not gentle. The plot was very unique and in contrast to the usual vampire strike. The story was complicated and complicated and very tempting. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I would say is that the movie was, despite being unlucky - though peaceful? I had an indisputable version (I'm glad I realized it was all Cantonese), so I would suggest something with subtitles.
