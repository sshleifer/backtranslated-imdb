This movie is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy about how a child would be an adult. The idea that a child's drawings become a place where he can physically visit and influence is wonderful. At the same time, you can get the child's psychologist about it and say that he's really studying his subconscious, as we all are dreaming as we sleep. A little bit that gives me goose-pimples is when his father is a paper house, and he's being pursued. The only thing I can't stand for is that it was marketed as a horror movie ... it really isn't. If you want to see something British that has a lot of story that keeps you away from the usual cheap excitement, most movies have to be used, then check out Paperhouse.
