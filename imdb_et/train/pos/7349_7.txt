Of course, if you read my review, you've already seen this movie. Raja Babu is one of my favorite characters. I just love the broken brat concept with 24 * 7 servants at his motorcycle. Watch movies and emit signs etc etc. I love the scene when Kader khans are able to eat rock cracks. Even when Shakti Kapoor talks about Raja Babu's dinner table and Govinda, who carries the "dharam-veer" form, makes sentimental notes. This is my favorite scene. The "Achcha Pitaji to Chalta Hoon" scene is just a chemistry between two great Indians who make comics without dialogues. Its great. This is a cat mouse movie. Just look at the participants who help each other and take the scene off one another. Its all entertainment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry, it must be. I think RB is on my list for David Dhawan 6th. "Deewana Mastana", "Ankhein", "Shola or Shabnam", "Swarg", Coolie no 1 "prefers this film pearl. 7/10
