My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to see this movie and we were absolutely happy with the senseless fun of the movie. There is an additional opportunity for boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film and especially the refusal of Hallie Kate Eisenberg, "The boys are so weird." It's refreshing to see a movie that shows that boys and girls are really different in their emotional and social makeup. The boys really do such strange things and usually live to tell the story and scare their mothers foolishly! We enjoyed the movie so much that my son and 11-year-old friend, myself and my daughters, went to watch the movie the next day for boys. We had a lot more fun for the second time and everyone started doing it. It is a pure and joyful adolescent who remembers the classic "Freaks and Geeks" of TV. We all feel it becomes a sleeping bag, not the "Freaks & Geeks", which could not survive its first season, but sold out its DVD outlet. See this especially if you have boys and you find that it stimulates the conversation about fun and safety! Girls love it because she has the chance to say, "The boys are so weird!" Don't miss this ...
