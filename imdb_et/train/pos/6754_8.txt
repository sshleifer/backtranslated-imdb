Director Otto Preminger connects Laura with Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this harsh and ready-to-rob movie: Where the pavement ends. This movie is a well-written criminal story with interesting characters, unexpected turns and clever dialogue, and a striking image with superb camera movements and dark and sharp movies. Dana Andrews stands for Mark Dixon, a detective, who is part of a mobster and a sub-councilor whose reputation is too physically tough with criminals. After one incident sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers, he is much more involved than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is terrible in her role - harsh and nervous, Andrews' Dixon is ready to hit all and all down her heels when they get to her bad side. He's the perfect movie noir anti-hero - he's not always nice at all, but we're still at him. Gene Tierney does his job as much as he is, being Dixon's sweet shoulder. There may not be too much to Tierney's role, but it certainly goes beyond what others could do with this role by tapping each member of the audience with their friendly smile, gently and in the eye. The supportive majority is not too bad - Karl Malden is the most memorable stepping in and giving good support to Lieutenant Thomas. Where the pavement ends, Laura is not, but it's a big movie full of great characters, story and picture.
