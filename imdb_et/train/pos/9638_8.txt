This film was a passage of one male gay man and how he had to deal with everyone. Her mother is depressed, her younger sister is in pain, her older sister is somewhat agreeing. The relationship looks good with her boyfriend / exhooker and she leaves her family to try this first man. Unfortunately, the new man screws around him and says it doesn't mean anything. Our young homosexual man goes to the generation and comes to the looney bin and finally leaves, his new mistress strikes and starts. We have left with him to start and watch without happiness. So maybe it will be better for him in the future. The end was a bit down, but the whole movie was completely realistic and I let it end with a high rating of the real end.
