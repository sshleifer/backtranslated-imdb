Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a definite hit rate on their TV work. But their film work has been much more squaring (for example, the 2008 Bank's work was good, last year's overall universe is certainly weak). <br /> <br /> Still crazy, luckily it's a great success. It has a great story, great performances, lots of humor, fabulous music and everything else, a real heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the "moments" and this movie is one of them - just when everything is festive at the festival ... <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable.
