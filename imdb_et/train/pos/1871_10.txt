I was accepted at birth and was no doubt in the movie of an Antwone fisherman, but I still share some emotions and this movie really helped bring them out and compel me to deal with them. It even made me realize that I have a "lost piece" and I'm now looking for my birthright. <br /> <br /> I shouted almost a day after I first saw it. Antwone's confrontation with her childbirth associated with the reaction of her father's family to her unexpected appearance is powerful for us who don't know what happens when we find our parents. And his confidence and self-confidence for his mother and his past abusers were so powerful. I can really find out about it, and my need to tell people "Yes, my parents left me as I was born. But another set of parents chose me and loved me. Now I have success!" <Br / It also helped my spouse understand me and our adoptive parents who were going through tragic experiences before we got home. And it helped me to understand how our social system is confused. If you remember the story of reading a child from a child from Florida who was "lost" and then "Miranda & Ashley" in Oregon, where SCF ignored a number of complaints about sexual abuse on a person who finally killed this movie and this movie of this week appeared another story In New Jersey, three children were ignored by the system. One died. Apparently the state thought they were at home because the guardian was hired (as a stripper) and "only occasionally" used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are so many questions in this movie - and they are so well handled by the script and working that Antwone Fisher should definitely be the best candidate. Whether you are accepted or not, this is the heartbeat that cannot be ignored by someone who worries about the children of our society.
