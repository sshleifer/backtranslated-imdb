Very likely one of the world's most fun movies. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are fun and before you see it, I suggest that you see the South Park, one of the funniest cartoons. Buy it, you laugh every time you see it. The genius is pure. If you don't think it's funny, then you don't have a soul or a sense of humor. 10 out of 10
