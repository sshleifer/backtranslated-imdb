Nina Foch offers surprisingly strong performance in the name of this fun little Gothic nail. He accepts the position of London social secretary (by Dame May Witty imperatively) and his horrible son (effet and annoying George Macready). Before he knows it, he wakes up in a seaside mansion that he has never seen before, where Witty and Macready call him Marian and try to convince servants and nearby townspeople that he is Macready's crazy woman. Of course, this pair can only be designed for dirty acts, and although we know that Julia must finally flee her trap, Director Joseph Lewis builds a tension to answer the question of how he leads it. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross" does not give it stylistically the number of movies coming out of the same time, but I was surprised how well it kept up with the shoe string budget and B movie genre . There are quite a few moments that you may have on the edge of your seat, and I found myself rooting for Julia when she fell under the scheme and started to move her prisoners. In some other Gothic-style thrillers, the heroine would scream, shout and stab, waiting for his hero to save him and save him. So I can't tell you how refreshing the hero in this movie was to use your brain and explain how to save yourself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
