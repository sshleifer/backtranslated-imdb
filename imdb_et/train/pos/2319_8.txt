<br /> <br /> This is a general age history - think of "Wedding Member", "42 Years of Summer", "Summer Place", even "Small Women" - and there are moments where Mulligan could have left soupy music, not to use slow motion or play with the golden light. Otherwise, it will be done with a rare emotional perfection. Nothing is forced, every line is feeling and it's just right. Even selecting the A list below will help: larger movie stars with more recognizable personalities would be overloaded with the material. Particularly Witherspoon is great: Her line shows are fresh and original, and her body language is just feminine on the right 14-year-old woman. Waterston is also very good, even if he has to spend a large part of the film climbing inside and out of the family vehicle. <br /> <br /> One feeling that filmmakers were aware of their surprising commercial prospects - no big stars, big car accidents, special effects - and knowingly decided to make the best movie possible. It's intimate and honest, and it sticks to the ribs. If you find yourself at the end, you don't have to feel like you're disappointed.
