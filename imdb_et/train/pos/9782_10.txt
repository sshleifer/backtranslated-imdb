Peaches are a truly wonderful film. I am writing this to refute the review reviewed by Auscrit on this site. First of all, the idea that Monana's first film "Interview" is somehow on TV is an extraordinary statement. Here is a film that has been praised world wide as it is just one of the best Australian films. It deserved the best picture. Peaches are bold, courageous and bold. For me it works on every level and I've seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker with great skill and incredible sensitivity. For "Auscrit" to comment that this is another TV movie etc. and that Hugo Weaving is not good, just can't get a movie. Or don't really want to get it. Frankly, this is a comment that is expected from either the jealous or the bitter or both. Or, within the industry, either distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. For your average punter, I found just not writing such reviews. I've noticed other site comments and a reference to Sommersault. One has to ask what people think. Unfortunately, when the SS was released, there was a thrust in Australia, if you didn't like it, you didn't have anything wrong with it, not a movie. This media manipulation is quite common. Reality is the only similarity between the two films that they are the rights of passage films. Unfortunately, I'm a SS movie that's not something that could have been said in 15 minutes. I see it as a dimensional film of anxiety. Compared to peaches is a masterpiece. Personally, I can't wait for what Monahan follows, because she is clearly in front of the suburbs for the cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all of the AFI and IF awards this year, it is a rotten game. As for Auscrit, find something more constructive with your time
