This is one of the few films out there that are very erotic without pornography, even though there is only a very primitive plot. There is not much vivid sound or dialogue; Instead, participants make voice transmissions that describe their experiences, why they participated, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's a document. > I fully understand why no one else has ever done anything like that. There's something like that already. That's it. :-) <br /> <br /> NB! The manufacturer has no right to distribute the DVD version. I've never sold it; You can email Boerner and order a copy of VHS.
