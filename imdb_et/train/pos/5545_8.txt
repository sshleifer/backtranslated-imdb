**** Including spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of horror for years. Just when I think I've seen all the big ones, it will surprise me. I've never seen this movie before. It was also a healing, beaten road ... not just a ferry. There was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different. A beautiful girl is fearless for change and rescues monster men, including her beloved man! How does it twist. This girl was the opposite of most women in the films of that time, she wasn't screaming in her shade, she didn't fade, she didn't go over when she ran. This gal was not afraid to live alone in the experience of the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was a foggy swamp that was declared to haunt. Heck, he even takes a sun block outdoors in a lawn like Ripley's usual 1940 version. No snake, gator or haunted stranger would dare it. Books from an early feminist movie should definitely include this neglected work. <br /> <br /> See if you are a fan, like me, of the classic B / W horror movies that they have just had in the 30s and 40s. Be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection.
