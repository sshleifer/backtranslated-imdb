I don't know how and why this movie on IMDb is little. This movie, accompanied by "I am curious: blue", is a masterpiece. like psychology or if you were waiting for hardcore pornographic ramming. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to relax; this is the movie you want to see from time, attention and care as every other masterpiece. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARY, USE A SPOILER OR TWO ******* <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie is that it mixes the whole movie inside the movie but do it so that sometimes you forget that fiction is not real. <br /> <br /> Kile is like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. Political documentary about the social system in Sweden. What is still relevant in many ways today. Interviews have been done by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. The writer, the filmmaker Vilgot Sjoman, about making a movie ... is dealing with the film with his star and how he should never have been involved with the people he should work for. <br /> <br /> 3. The movie Vilgot does. It's about a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2) who is young and very politically active, making a documentary (IE. 1). She is also age and her sexuality and its freedom. <br /> <br /> "I'm curious: yellow / blue" is a wonderful and brilliant way to cut these three elements. In a moment you look at the interview policy, and next you look at what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but do it so well that sometimes you forget it is a narrative. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamics of the "yellow" and "blue" you see when you see another. "Blue" is not at all a sequel. I will try to explain it best because, to my knowledge, no other film has done it, although it is a great technique. scenes. Complete story. <br /> <br /> Think of the "blue" as all things that are out of the 14 "yellow" scenes that you didn't see, it's a complete story about yourself. <br /> <br /> In essence, these parallel films are the same story that is spoken in two different ways. Yellow "<br /> <br /> I hope it was useful for people who are affected by various influences because this film changed the way they watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
