Certain DVDs have me until I have to go and buy. It was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember seeing it as a baby and loved it. I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers cut, so I was interested to see what they could be. I agree that "Portabellow Road" is now a long-term (like a football game), but besides that, I found the rest of the scenes that had been restored in their honorable place. Perhaps Disney should have had the original version (which has been restored) on one side of the restored version, so people could choose what they would like to see. All in all, there is still an entertaining film that can still restore some of my childhood memories.
