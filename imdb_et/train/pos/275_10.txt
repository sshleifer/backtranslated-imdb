This film begins with a family who all went in different directions and their teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very in love with Joe MacLeod, (Zack). Mother plays Mitzi Kapture (Jill Dunne), who unexpectedly walks her daughter and Zack, and then all the problems seem. Jill Dunne has a man who often travels or is away from home. There are also big problems that arise when the family decides to go on a camping trip that their daughter Olivia does not like and just can't get to bed and demands that the tent be left out of all the mistakes. Olivia makes outstanding results in many ways, as teenagers and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) play an excellent supporting role as a hotel owner. This movie will keep you away from how it ends and you enjoy a movie full of horror and fear. enjoy
