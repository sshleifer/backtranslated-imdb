It was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no brothers or nephews as mentioned elsewhere in IMDb), but he did an excellent congratulatory. He brought together two very good people, played by two of the best actors. Supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) clicked on the screen and made it a great viewing experience. The fact that he was driving a car seems to be in contradiction with all of his pictures and his posters on a bicycle. And whether he wore socks in one scene ... the professor never knew socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb-goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and contradictions were left out, this was a great movie to watch with great pain. I'll give her 8!
