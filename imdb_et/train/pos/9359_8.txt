The feeling of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. As he played a very raped and fragile character, he took his ability to the very edge and really worked. His character was very interesting. I see myself reading this script of the movie and not half the interesting part that Sandler did to me. Someone who primarily plays comedy roles has drawn a serious role that seemed to be his own spices and contribution. Especially I loved this scene where Adam and Don's characters traveled around the city with a motorized scooter. I met for a moment, because it seemed that Don was witnessing one thing Adam could get away from. With his video games, music, and many other things he keeps thinking about his past, driving his headphones with his scooter seemed like a flight of his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth a look.
