I find this creative team behind their "American Pie" films. "Direct DVD" is usually a cheap and incompetent movie. But last year I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the DVD "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers seized the opportunity to offer a terrible but funny little movie. This year they offer "Beta House". This is an honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first few "American Pie" films like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> It's not obstructed, tasteless, ridiculous loud fun. Of course, this story is a bit thin, but it's the beauty of the whole thing. During the first 10 minutes, we introduce all the main characters, new supportive characters, we get a handful of dirty gags, we meet the villains and create a general line. Everything that passes the road becomes an unlimited journey of the film. There are many gags and they are NOT in this area. I'm talking about male sperm, urine, dildos, chicks, sex sheep, maternal sprays, and more. Not to mention that not a minute goes without a breast or a sex event. <br /> <br /> Returning from "Naked Mile" is John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (similar to the supportive role of recent films). The whole majority is doing a good job. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) has a particularly high energy and screen presence. I predict good things for him. The film also has excellent movie references for those who keep their eyes open. For me, the biggest laughter of the film was the "The Deerhunter" parody. Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, if you are a fan of the series, you will feel at home with the "Beta House". It really pushes the limits of good taste, but finally it's pretty funny.
