I just watched the movie for the third time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the lie as much as before. It just gets better and better. You just have to admire a meticulously measured way of thinking, slow deliberate action, everything that is in place. <br /> <br /> Really one of the biggest and definitely my all time favorite !!!
