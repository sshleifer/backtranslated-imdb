It was accidentally, it was behind the box, which I thought I rented, couldn't find it until I got home, I looked at it anyway. Absolutely FANTASTIC! a great movie and one of my three best favorites, recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is enjoyable and easy to follow, it could have been confusing, but the actors and director work great to keep it together. <br /> <br /> The participants themselves are fantastic, have a wonderful character and do a terrible job. <br /> <br /> Must find a copy somewhere ...........
