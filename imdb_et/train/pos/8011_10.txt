It was the best Muppet movie I've seen! I happen to know that Miss Piggy's wonder fantasy was the reason for Muppet Babies. The songs will remain in my head forever. Just saying, because this stupid Nickelodeon exhibition Hey Dude's song is still in my head. Sorry, there are few topics. But anyway, what I like is Animal after Credit, saying "Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Hast Luego!" It made me so laugh. My absolute favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the weddings were characters from Sesame Street. I'm just glad this movie was a lot of fun. I borrowed it from the library and now I bought it because I can't keep a copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I declare it to be the best movie I've ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
