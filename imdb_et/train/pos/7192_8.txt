If you are a Zorro, a fan of Indiana Jones or in general it is a vision. The directors are William Witney and John English's lead group, and Reed Hadley starring Don Diego / Zorro. I didn't carry you on the ground (who cares? Less talks, fights); What matters is that Hadley has perfectly interpreted the character and stunt of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutti. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see the effect of the movie on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro gets the trash in one chapter from the original version of Star Wars; on the kitchen bridge a'la Doom temple, whether it goes between Rider's horses and buses, and even flees through the tunnel, while the baddies are knocking on a huge water tank and flooding the tunnel behind him just as Mola Ram does to Indy at the Doom Temple. In addition, whipping is excellent, because Zorro interrupts feces, threatens security, and so on. Most of the sword work is flat with the exception of the first chapter, which contains a nice sword with a sword / stunt legend Ralph Faulkner choreographed in a canton, who rarely makes the look of the screen as evil Rodriguez. It was the first series I ever saw in Matin√©e Bijou when I was a kid and I've been since then. <br /> <br /> Zorro Fighting Legion offers "Z" items!
