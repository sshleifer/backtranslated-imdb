Of course, he quickly became uneven after this movie, but from "Knife In the Water" to "The Tenant", Roman Polanski can always hope to offer something exciting and unique. In spite of many current issues (alienation, paranoia), two of his films are not quite similar. Its story is somewhat similar to his own "Repulsion" ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. "Tenant" succeeds in balancing darker than dark absurdity (I have hesitantly called humor, although the main characters are odd behavior and the dialogue was sometimes funny) with somewhat tense paranoia. Polanski was always a champion of mood disorders and moments of this film are almost intolerable. The overall strangeness of the film is also a plus. <br /> <br /> In addition to Polanski's subtle routine, the rest and team will offer a great contribution. Polanski, an actor often overshadowed by director Polanski, but his performance here truly captures the discomfort and mindset of his characters. The issues of social discrimination make this film more strange in order to make this movie strange. The rest of the cast also offers strong performances, especially Isabelle Adjani's sympathetic move and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters' suitable annoying. The "tenant" is often underestimated because people are willing to praise both "Repuls" and "Rosemary Baby", but as perfect as either classic. (9/10)
