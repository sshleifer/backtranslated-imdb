Blood Castle is a good example of quality work in the Horror genre that has developed in the 60s in Italy. The movie has all the right elements - an old dark house, an atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes the most of the movies that are worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a haunting castle. People have visited but none have returned. Our hero bet he can spend the night in the castle and get back to his winnings. But the night he is visiting is a special night. It's a night every year when the dead returns to his death again. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I see in the movie is working time. It seems almost cushioned. The first act is a big part, where it doesn't literally happen. Our hero stumbles in the dark, finding something interesting. But when he finds something, the film rises and becomes quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a definite dirt for Steele fans and Italian Gothic horror.
