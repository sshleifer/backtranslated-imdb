Home Room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you looking more to see. I wonder what the secret of Alicia is. I think I watched this movie 6 times in a row and I didn't lose interest. Plus I usually don't shout over movies, but it made me cry every time. I wish I could find more of these movies. All in all, I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at it, the more you get it. The end result is the part that really got me when he called his diploma because he had his daughter's name. My heart felt like it was broken. And how his new friend came to comfort him when he didn't. I loved it so much.
