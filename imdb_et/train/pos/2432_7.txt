I remember Casper's comic books but don't remember any cartoons. Maybe they were not memorable; I don't know, but in my old age, I'm looking at a very short animation here today. Later I was shocked to read the user comments here. Did people miss the end? <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like other ghosts who want to go out every night and scare everyone c-p. "He doesn't see the future," says the narrator here. Instead, one night goes to the countryside, unintentionally scaring some animals and not finding friends. It brings him to tears until a small fox listens to him and interacts with his friends. Two of them will be friends, but soon the fox will work with a fox wolf during his life. <br /> <br /> Other reviews have all mentioned what's happening, so I'm touching it. The child kills the yachts (not shown) and Casper is a tear to lose "the only friend I had ever had." But no one mentions the happy ending of this story. "Ferdie" fox turns into a mental image, like Casper, jumps on her lap, licking her face and the narrator commenting, "they lived happily ever after." Both characters look joyful. <br /> <br /> What's so sad? It's a nice story with a nice and happy ending.
