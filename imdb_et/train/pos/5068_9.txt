This film is an excellent film based on the life of the Canadian Gray Owl of the 1930s. I found it to be like riveting and affectionate as "Rudy" and "Awakenings". Instead, it picks up the life of Gray Owl and follows him through his most striking and influential period. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Chinese Canadian trapper who finds himself trapped in promoting Beaver. He also predicts a decline in natural land and excessive use of land resources. It is a terrible concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He is a renowned speaker and the masses are ready to listen. <br /> <br /> Pouring Pierce Brosnan seems rather strange but not outrageous. Anyone who wants to claim that this point must first understand the film. Brosnan offers great results like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actor whose place alongside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the companion pairs of the latest Bond films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery or environmental reasons. It's also a family movie, but children under the age of 10 (depending on maturity) have problems after the plot.
