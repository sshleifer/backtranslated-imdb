This movie is a real masterpiece, it really is. It's rare that you see a heartbeat that is full of fun, laughter, heartache and a little drama that keeps you in the toes. The real family film, Homeward Bound, talks about three cruel pets trying to cross the Rocky Mountains, trying to find their owners, following the changes and obstacles they encounter on the road. One of the really stunning things in this movie is its ability to give the animals personalities - the voice works so well. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, smart and bold, and looking at her when she tries to save Sassy by the river, it was a very vigorous moving moment. Opportunity - Who doesn't love a dog like Chance? He must be the most naughty and lovable son ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very funny for the cat - she had to sew me when she was hiding; "Here kitty kitty kitty ... not in your life, chubby." <br /> <br /> There were also many well-made emotional scenes like Sassy who went over the waterfall (I was really scared of him), Shadow fell into a trench (almost tear) and then a fantastic end when all three pet back home ... including good old shadow! <br /> <br /> Favorite all the time - anyone who doesn't like this movie just doesn't like animals. Rent it or buy it now and it will leave you with pleasant memories that last a lifetime.
