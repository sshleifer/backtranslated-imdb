I love this movie. As a child, it was one of the first films I saw that made me burn. Of course, it is now easy, but the day was fantastic. Dentists are one thing many people are afraid of, so why not make a killer dentist movie? It's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's awesome. And I've always had love for fear. And Corbin Bernsen plays dr. Feinstone perfectly, no one could have done better. And for a low budget horror movie, these effects are pretty good. And I also love theme music, it goes well with the film. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also one who plays a nervous policeman and does a good job. There's a fair amount of blood and some very cool torture / death scenes. Check it out!
