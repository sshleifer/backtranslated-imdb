When you went to this movie to see some great presentation of the academic award ... oh ... but if you want to see a funny delightful customization with the old classic, then you love it. Jim Carey was incredible as usual. The story was great, some parts, like Grinch's history, made it even better. Ron Howard never misses it. But while there were still some adult comments and splits, it was added to a child or family activity. Try not to forget that .. if you really don't know the movie ... and like comments on Ron Howard, try to direct a big movie and see how you don't do it ...
