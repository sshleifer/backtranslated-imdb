This is the favorite of my parents' Tom & Jerry cartoons since the early 40s. The original version of Mammy Two Shoes comes with Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, one plate and presents the amazing detailed animation of early cartoons. Its single pictures are not in the Avery style, but thinner and targeted at anyone who has ever been caught in frightening movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to the horrible radio program and Jerry decides to play several tricks to bless him. The nine life gags are well done here, and I don't know how many times I tried to make the vacuum and the page when I was a boy. When Tom's owner woke up, Mammy wasn't a maid, it was his house - he got one surprise, a big laugh. Get your pause button ready, it's worth it!
