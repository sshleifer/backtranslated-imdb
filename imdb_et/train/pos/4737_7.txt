Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to say at night and with explosions. Of course, the plot has been tried and heard in the past (a biologically-engineered soldier who is part of a superman's elite fighting force who decides that killing and forceful force is not the way to solve every thing and become a pacifist, and when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get the antidote that keeps them alive by taking the police - this best friend is a policeman who will become a black mask. The style that the movie goes very visual, works and at least fun for me. I love martial arts movies that are remarkable. People who fly more easily from the air and restore the impact after a second collision will keep the pace and action uninterrupted. But this is the movie that is right anyway, the Jet Li presentation that does what it does best, and this is a remarkable way of presenting its skills, the least of which is top-notch. Like most fast-acting martial arts area. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who have been showcasing countries for the first time now, are small and amazing physical competitions on the plot. But I have to say, even if there are big holes in the plot (for example, how do we see him in his apartment as safe as only one scene before he had 20 men who are no more than 15 meters from his escape sign? Who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment ....... ohh well stop believing i guess), the movie i find interesting. Only until the last 20 minutes does the film seem to have been a bit shorter. But still around a high-paced movie.
