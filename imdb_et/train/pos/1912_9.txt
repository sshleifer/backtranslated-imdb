I keep it brief and brief, the people who write the story of this show are genius, the actors are just perfect for the roles they play (the CJ character is legendary) and they have so many chemistry on the screen that makes it a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I first saw new episodes that apparently go back over 6/7 months, I thought what happened to Paul. I was gutted to find out he was dead while browsing Google. She was so funny and played her character perfectly, a defensive father who likes to keep her daughters away and keep away from boys. <br /> <br /> Comedy, which I believe has been a force, even without Paul. <br /> <br /> Plus, I think most people would enjoy watching it.
