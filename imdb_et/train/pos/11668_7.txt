By 1945 and after a certain piece of WWII propaganda, Errol Flynn began to shrink the US boxing show, although despite the increased look of his appearance, he began a number of films that had previously made his name: swashbuckler. The first one was really good - DON JUAN'S CHALLENGES (1948) - but it was also his last big budget Hollywood chief. The rest of his sword competitions were spent all over Europe: KIM in England (1950), BALLANTRAE MASTER (1953) and DARK AVENGER (1955) in CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) in France, and WILLIAM TELLI LUGU (1953) aborted by Italy and little seen in CROSSED SWORDS (1954). But Hollywood invited him for the last time to his old sailors - albeit with a modestly budgeted universal picture, not to Warner Brothers' A-production he was used to when he was top ... <br /> <br /> Still, the brilliant Technicolor cinematography jumps out of here, and when parent and flabbier Flynn looks like his former self-pale shadow, his red-headed lady, Maureen O'Hara, is the tomb artist's leader in deep desires of romance and wants to be treated like a woman. Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his major life-bearing vehicles, so here he is usually seen as a merciful - pirate captain Roc Brasiliano, who attacks the role. Like BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954), which was preceded by viewing it - TAKE ALL THE STORY, it takes me back to my precious childhood day of constant TV viewing, when vintage Hollywood movies were both local and neighboring Italians. Be the first pirated film I've ever seen, and I mean thinking of today's youth generation, which probably believes that the great trilogy of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is what is buccaneing! As I said earlier, ALL FLAGS may not be the best pirate threads ever introduced, but it is the same example of this fruitful genre. Nowadays, the gracious persistence of a child-like Indian princess (Alice Kelley) can strike her pirate captain Flynn as terribly stupid, but the rest - despite the height of SEA HAWK (1940) and BLACK. SWAN (1942), mentioning its stars in the best practices of seafarers, is quick and reasonably interesting. By the way, this movie will later be rebuilt as THE KING'S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure! <br /> <br /> What is worth is the success of this unprecedented modern franchise of a sophisticated modern franchise that is likely to cause dusty film studios to dust off their catalog headlines and release them on DVD and, in fact, ALL of the HIGH POSSIBILITIES was a universal universe , which was a universally poorly thought-out "Pirates' Golden Age Film Collection", which also consisted of dazzling, such as BUCCANEER GIRL (1950; with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951; with Donald O'Connor) and YANKEE BUCCANEER ( 1952 with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, maybe, but so far I have only acquired Errol Flynn's flick from other sources; even when the mood strikes me in the future, I would like to put my hands on similar sea adventures, such as Edward Dmytyki MUTINY (1952), the aforementioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and TORTUGA PIRATES (1961).
