Looking at Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic in the early 90s, when almost every new feature film can be described as "Die Hard a / on a." Cliffhanger is "Die Hard on the Mountain" and it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> Unlike the Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which are decent Die Hard clones under their own conditions, Cliffhanger gives up a closed feeling of many movies and includes breathtaking landscapes that threaten enormously to perish and trivialize conflicts between people that fight and die between the peaks. <br /> <br /> Years before other movies, such as a simple plan and Fargo dramatized crimes and murders in snow, Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin admitted that the visual impact of brutal violence and grim fighting is a cold and indifferent natural environment. <br /> <br /> The opening order has already received great praise, all that it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget about camera and actor objects and just believe what we see is actually happening. Even Harlin's dropping stuff, which is highly effective, but threatens to get too much fun (and what he repeated in Deep Blue Sea), or a ridiculous expression in the form of Ralph Waite, is unable to degrade power. <br /> <br /> The next impressive kit is firearms and emissions. The audience, written by Stallone and Michael France and led by Harlin, is in the audience without knowing which agents are involved in the theft and what is not: bloody double-twists are completely unexpected. As Roger Ebert has observed, the stuntman who made the air exchange between the aircraft deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during the avalanche sequence, it seems that one of the terrorists / thieves is actually falling on the wall of the snow. As far as I know, no one killed in making this film (a small miracle, taking into account the extremes of some tricks), so apparently a dummy was used on the camera. But it is also impressive because we do not know how Harlin (or more likely one of the leaders of another unit) knew exactly where to place the camera. <br /> <br /> I take Sly Stallone's action as a hero on any day of the week because she is one of the few movie stars I've ever seen who is completely persuasive as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feel this pain. The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone's strengths: it plays older, more vulnerable types of heroes, giving impressively low-key performance as a mountain guide who must redeem himself. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many of today's Matrix, comic book inspired heroes, Stallone's Walker is a normal person who becomes heroic without paranormal or computer-based capabilities. In the heroine of the hero, the hero almost dies and his clothes begin to show great tears if he barely gets to one dangerous situation. He wins when he hits and bleeds when he is cut, especially in the cavity when he takes a rocky-style banging from one mad dog's wool. It should be noted that completely despicable villains really help the effectiveness of the film: when I first saw this movie as a teenager, I was rooted in good boys every step of the way and waiting for another bad boy to bite dust (or rather ice); At one point, I was delighted that one of the most cold-blooded characters in the film had suffered a violent death. <br /> <br /> Lithgow's British accent is just as convincing as a casual model aircraft or helicopter, but he is basically a good actor and one of the few who can imagine a foolish dialogue: in one scene, looking at his hostages at Stallone and Rooker, trying to decide what tasks to give them, he says, "You, stay!" Even a better actor, such as Anthony Hopkins, could have caused problems with this line. <br /> <br /> Even though Cliffhanger occasionally strikes aside credibility, it will only do so for an interesting exhibition. <Br / For example, at the beginning of the film Lithgow publicly says to one of his men: "Retire [Stallone] when he comes down." No real criminal champion would have even made this mistake unconsciously: his negligence allows Rooker to warn Slyle on a rocky hill, and this causes a towing rope between Stallone and the bad guys, tied to his leg. <br /> <br /> Lithgow could have made his order with more subtle means, but the sequence may not be so fun to look at if he hadn't given Rooker the chance to publicly threaten his captain's arrogance. <br /> <br /> Made in a very satin-like matte series or (sometimes) western style, Cliffhanger is built on such a strong foundation that it survives some of the weak elements that, in addition to successful aircraft models, have a couple of scenes alongside weak moments, photographed with cheap indoor suites. wolves that seem unnecessarily already in the package of narrative. Finally, Harlin's decision to shoot some scenes of death seems slow because the technique does not give the scenes anything. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that Stallone is too old for movies now, because his character in this film seems so plausible that I inevitably mean what he would be years later. But perhaps it is best if Cliffhanger stands alone all the time, without a sequel: there are already enough tired and outdated movie franchises. There was an informal sequel that called itself a vertical border: compared to this clinker, Cliffhanger's IMDb Top 250 list. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (Very good, especially considering most of Stallone's other movies.)
