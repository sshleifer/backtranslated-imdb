I'm disappointed by the lack of posts in this surprising and effective little movie. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role in Diego Ted Demme's Blow. Writes, directs and marks. <br /> <br /> I didn't give any plot points if the movie (at least for me) was very exciting because it didn't know anything about it. If you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that will wear it ... I highly recommend it. It's crazy, fun, and sometimes very meaningful provocation. <br /> <br /> The Mollà direction is * pretty * impressive and shows many promises. <br /> <br /> An unprecedented, amazing image, and a great lead, spoken in the beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie", is an amazing movie that you can show to your friends. <br /> <br /> REVIEW.
