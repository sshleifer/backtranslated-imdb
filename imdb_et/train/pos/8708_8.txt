I looked at it as a subtitle, as it was in Russian, but I really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was born as a cursed, deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and anger put him into doing deadly things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love for a young woman named Katya, they tried to take her away to a deadly battle. For a weak abdominal area, there was a fair amount, but not too much. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like an ordinary old Hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent movies. Kinda felt Asian fantasy film.
