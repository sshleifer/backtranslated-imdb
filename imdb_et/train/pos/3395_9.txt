This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange how men and women both watch the same movie. I've talked to many people about the movie and almost every man loved it and said it was great - although most women thought it was just nasty and stupid! This is the only movie I know that such polarized views have sex. Perhaps many women have lower tolerance for reluctant or depressing plots - but regardless of the reason I have found that this difference is always exciting. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and a subsequent study led by Charlton Heston. It's set in the near future and the leader of a huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated. As the movie appears, you will quickly realize that it is a terrible and unfair future American society. Rich living in gorgeous apartments with security and all the money they can buy (including "furniture" - euphemism for paid mistresses with an apartment). At the same time, the masses are black, unemployed and in many cases live in abandoned cars or apartment corridors. Overcrowding and smoke have taken a serious toll and the future really looks awful! <br /> <br /> Why a rich man died and the terrible truth he could not live should not really be discussed - it can destroy the film for you. But the film has a great plot and action, and it's very exciting to look at. In addition, it includes Edward G. Robinson in his final screen presentation as a terrifying clutch for Heston. Although not easily depressing or worshiping, it is a great sci-fi movie that is allegorical and deep.
