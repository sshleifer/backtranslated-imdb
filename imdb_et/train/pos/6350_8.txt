I waited and waited for this movie to come out, the trailers seemed for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of movie movies over and over again, but I can't wait to buy it all out! Not a big Jim fan, but it was great for him, so much to see and a "good self" is out of scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron was doing his work as a movie, if you haven't seen it, then do it if you have it, watch it again, I know you want it!
