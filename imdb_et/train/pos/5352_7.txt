This is Arnold's film. Now that you know, I've saved a lot of time reading this review. If you don't like Arnold, you like this movie. If the case is different then you will probably like it. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> Now that you are reading, I look forward to seeing you as Arnold. Good for you! He's pretty good, isn't it. Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature. It has the usual retro future we know so well from the 80's B-Sci Fi, it's a bunch of frightening, a lot of violence and explosions, and a good looking heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In this case, the evil government is the ruling government in 1984, using television as an effective crowd control using gladiator-type games. Arnold, of course, comes to one of these examples and turns it all up and down, with the help of his two confederations and handsome Amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget movie, but it managed to create a pretty good future with some nice matte paintings and kits. It is hopelessly 80 years old, but I find it charming. In action, it's different, Arnold doing his usual looting and screaming. Heroine Amber is, slightly, a bit stereotyped, and finely named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man. <br /> <br /> Despite all the errors, the film has a very clear message; Television is a mass opiate, a good way to control people. It also includes some time with futuristic digital video editing that allows bad guys to change the face of the video to fool their audience. It does not seem futuristic today, which is a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold's movies before, you know when to watch it. Enjoy.
