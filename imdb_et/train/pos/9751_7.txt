There are different types of films in the time of the year. These different films existed even when each of them had something else to offer .... <br /> <br /> It seems obvious at first glance, but I thought I'd draw attention during this review because a few people might seem forgotten. It's just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. It's all that. It doesn't claim to be anything else or something bigger. People who drag it as promises don't see the whole picture - literally. After all, Hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameful for people (bodyguard or teacher husband, Whitney Houston have two examples that they like.) <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to discuss a movie for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. Singing is fabulous and the choice of arias is fun. The film starts with Schubert Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo Matinata. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular music such as "I left San Francisco" and the song that was assigned to Oscar & Golden Globe "When We Was in Love" by Alan & Marilyn Bergman John Williams & lyrics music - all three previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. It was built for Pavarotti so it's not, of course, something deep or universal for the average movie viewer. This is the story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at night in opera. If he is asked to sing again in the same place, "MET" in NYC, he loses the sound of fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY's in Italian), played by Kathryn Harrold, gives him a psychosomatic response to treatment. He offers him the chance to escape with him and he takes reluctantly. <br /> <br /> They start the thing, he knows he's married and lets not fall in love with him and he thinks he's just another woman. Despite the fact that they fall in love (hence the song "IF WE WAS LOVE") and with its help, it transcends its fear and goes back to market economy treatment where it wins. I'm not saying how it ends, but it's quite predictable. What is not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Performances in this are not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you expect Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks to perform, then you're misleading, not Pavarotti. She knows she's not her. She is cute, charming and charismatic. He will entertain himself, and if you just let yourself be entertained, it is not so bad. One funny line is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is "thirsty, she can spend you!" and of course he says, "I don't want Fin to water!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a good job of a half-strong woman who learns to live a little bit about this extravagant man. One of my favorite lines in the film is: "Life must not be the size of life." And there is Eddie Albert, who does his usual good job as Head of Fin. Actual conductors, singers, etc. are several "ones" that are filmed at the Lincoln Center Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> If you like an opera for Pavarotti, or if you just let yourself go and enjoy the "little fly" he wants in the movie, you can enjoy this movie. I know I - every time. :) <br /> <br />
