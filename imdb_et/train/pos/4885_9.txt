Possible Spoilers: Late Spots <br /> <br /> One vision sees as many fine and memorable characters (almost exact actors) in one movie. Even if there are only a few couples, each has a pearl. The Britons do this comedy and real life sin combination better than anyone in the IMO, so it's no surprise that most of the actors are British. <br /> <br /> Music is great; No doubt there was a lot of duplication (did Leslie Caron * play the bass so well? Maybe - who knew?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her warm visceral sound changed my crank like some other jazz singers. <br / As an aging musician himself, not quite so old and certainly not in this class, it was also a joyous movie - a great movie for anyone I thought was going to their profession or whatever it was. And of course, there is a great celebration of the life of the production. <br /> <br /> I missed a little opening, but initially at 9/10 - and that certainly makes us want to see the whole thing.
