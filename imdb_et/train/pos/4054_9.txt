The first time I saw this movie back in the 1980s, I was a child. My father saved it from the TV. I have to watch it over 20 times before a relatively recent DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course, I bought a DVD and watched it, and it was surprising how much dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have about VHS, the film's mood was really dark because of the dialogue. But the new version, which includes Van Der Beek et al., Is more comic. <br /> <br /> In other words, it's like watching the original US Akira spread by duplicating it before you look at the remastered version of the Japanese translation. <br /> <br /> I do not complain in any way, the story and quality of animation do not harm, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki is meant for a lighter or darker narrative and the subject of his movie .....
