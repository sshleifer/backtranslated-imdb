During Kurt Weill's celebration in Brooklyn, where are we going from here? finally discovered for screening. It is amazing that any timeless film that has a collaboration with Weill-Gershwin may be missing from the screen. The result is a long and material CD with Gershwin and Weill only emphasizes its benefits, which are significant. Yes, the film has problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not the director of his musical fantasy and Fred MacMurray cannot understand this material quite well. The "modern" segment is also weakly written. IF the fantasy elements carry the film high, as well as the work of two great leading women - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that such work desperately needs. During World War II, the history of our country - although never "in the past" is welcomed by the film - has a place in Hollywood's musical history and should be visible to everyone and have achieved remarkable achievements.
