I've seen this movie twice among my teenagers who love it. It should be a cult story! Best line, "Your dress is deeply cool!" says Prince Cinderella. Kathleen Turner looks like a stepmother. I also like cars and motorcycles of the 1950s. Melancholic Prince is a great deviation from the usual female box. She's trying to stay cool, but she can't hide her love for fairy tales. His butterfly is not a glass (better than the original story), but Cinderella loses, but gets back from the heir of the throne. My only complaint is that it is not shown more and seems almost impossible to get. Hopefully, Blockbuster or Amazon will soon be stocking it.
