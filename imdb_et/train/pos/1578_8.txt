Rosenstrasse is a telling story of courage in accidents. The Reichdeutch women find their Jewish husband is locked up until expulsion. One of the aristocrats admitted by his family, Lena Fischer, finds himself among the people, as is General Gudarar's sister. However, there is no need to pay special attention to rank and privilege. <br /> <br /> Neither does Reich learn as a female prisoner whose husband is in Ostfront. In one of the most terrible scenes of the film, the guards take the wedding given by their soldier's husband. <br /> <br /> If you think this is a typical German brutality, then in America today, Lady Bush is consistently ordered to arrest Gold Star mothers (mothers of killed US service mates) because their presence is offensive. Unfortunately, 60 years have passed since Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. <br /> <br /> Eight-year-old daughter Ruth flees luckily. <br /> <br /> Waiting for the cold Rosenstrasse Lenal Fischer first responded reluctantly to Ruth so that we would usually take German. Even Lena Fisher's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who is aware of and against the Holocost, warns Lena. but Lena decides to embrace the idea of ​​American rebellion, even called Ruth, the more Arian's sounding Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> Limitation ends favorably with Rosenstrasse, but Lena is mourning: What happened to Rut after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter Hannah makes a search for her mother's past and meets 90-year-old Len, writing a personal history of war. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that Hannah wanted to look at the family so much, but she never checked her grandfather's fate recently served in Ostfront.
