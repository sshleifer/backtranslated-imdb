I've just managed to get hold of Heavenly Region 3 DVD and what he's done. A fantastic digitally remastered transmission and almost any Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is fairly straightforward and has already been mentioned so I won't go back in. Needless to say, this is a fight scenes that many buy for a movie and they don't disappoint. The only problem is that they are a bit small and far and seem to be practicing. Bruce Lee could take these batches while drinking a cup of tea! All punches and shocks are equipped with all the important "writer" clicks and "whooshes" air, which is a cool effect! <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie B +. Good, but not great. It seems to me that it could have been a little better. Gold swallowing by the same director ten years earlier was such a good story and better action.
