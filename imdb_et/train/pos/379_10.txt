1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but what went out of the gong went a long way to convince fans that "Oscar is a little more than a hood for beautiful party members. <br /> <br /> 11 candidates and not one title: this was the contempt of the Academy for one of its greatest leaders; and one who had to wait another 8 years before any prejudices that prevented them from giving their shape before they gave it, gave them 7 Schindler lists, which is arguably not so good (and I'm half-Polish) . br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, Schindler was classic. And I didn't knock "Africa out" (which won this year); but in my opinion it was a class behind it: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big cry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was music (great) or cinematography (proud), but more likely to be just acting: Whoop, who proved to us all that he was much more than just comedy; Danny Glover I have never heard of before; and of course Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; but at that time: who knew?
