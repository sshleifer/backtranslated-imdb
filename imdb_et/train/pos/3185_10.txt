endearing story ........ voted against ten of all their age and sex average figures ... not all so much comedy (compared to almost wet film), though funny enough. not a musical fan at all so likely to be too much for me, but they will give you time to grab a drink or soda without something important being lost. maybe the fifties version, when Harry met with slings? Ahab is not really, but if it's your tenth as it is, I like this movie. Really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling, reminding you what romance could and should be like, something to shoot. in my summary it is described in very few words ..... quite charming
