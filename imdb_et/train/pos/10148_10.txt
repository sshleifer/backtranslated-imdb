I would have given a couple of stars for this movie, just because it was a "lifetime" presentation that was actually filmed in a story - here in New York. Most on this channel, whether they are there, in rural areas of Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, LA, etc., have been filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other local area in Canada. <br /> <br /> But if it has ever been this movie that deserves excellence - 10 * on this site. Certainly not for originality, because this story has been done many times, in many different ways, many are very similar to this particular. It has also been done on a big screen with the capital letters past and present, Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and others, and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan and more. I can think of at least 10-12 more, the same prominent past, so that I can present my head, who could now add, and there are probably many more that could be remembered. <br /> <br /> Not to drone, but my point is that I think it's one of the best genres I've seen. I caught it randomly at noon on Friday, when I only had a TV when I took a few hours after a particularly harsh week. I would never drive with this flick for 8 years after doing it. And while both leaders have done the most, they were completely unknown to me. The only two participants I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother), whom I saw in some cases from the younger days, and Michael Rispol (Henry, Charlie's best friend) who was outstanding as "Gramma", a threatening juice loan, a tough, street party "Rounders". <br /> <br /> Possible meeting and tying between the best friends of both leaders, if the subgroup romance, which correlates with the fact that Anna and Charlie only appear later, is often done in the genre to draw, but here is not important here ( actually it increases it). <br /> <br /> When I review some of the other comments, I fully agree with the most positive ones. The primary word describing this movie is ENGAGING. This adjective describes performers; characters; chemistry between all the characters and between them, regardless of the combination presented, and all supporting and even small roles. <br /> <br /> I love movies with a "heavier edge": "Rounders"; imprisonment for the Schwarzenegger / Stallone fare; "Goodfellows;" even classics like "Casablanca", "Gone With Wind", "Citizen Kane". But it was great for pure and simple enjoyment. If their budget is empty, it was equal to the results achieved by "You have received a letter" and "Sleepless in Seattle." And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan didn't get better here than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan; also the stars and support staff here were equivalent to those mega-films.
