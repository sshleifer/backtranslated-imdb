And my kids love it now! Allow me to watch it now and realize that the animation wasn't that big and that the plot was fine. Hey, when every wool introduced himself, saying, "I am DAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT", then I think they will smile, but for young children this is a moral story with pleasant music. <br /> <br /> Music is so pleasant to remember that I still remembered the words after I didn't see this movie for twenty years. I definitely recommend this to younger children.
