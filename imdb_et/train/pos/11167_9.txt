My favorite, this film is about two new "characters" from New York, Steve Brodie ("Raft") and "Chuck" from Connor (Beery), both of whom are trying to be Bowery's "chief" at the end of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although it is a very fixed account for these games (based on the game) .Brodie legendary (did he do that? - this is still the reason for the argument!), here to jump from Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, is shown here at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). great affection for this period, so beautifully rebuilt, and it contains the number of wild robber dirty from the cabin singer Trixie Odbray (young Pert Kelton). , big cordial and sometimes quite touching Connors. Pretty Fay Wray is the love of both boys. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "The Bowery" is moving at a fast pace (unlike many early speakers), it's not easy to find a movie, but it's worth looking for.
