This Hong Kong movie potboiler packs more melodrama than a week worth "The Young & The Restless". It is rather a setback for the original "Emmanuelle" trilogy (especially for "Goodbye Emmanuelle") than for D'Amato's sleazefest. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) gently passes the stunning-to-trot on the streetwalker. The future Italian porn star / politician Illona Staller, who later calls Ciccolina's name (and has sex with HIV-positive John Holmes), is playing Emy. Exotic places and some decent soft core scenes around it. Recommended for the original "Emmanuelle" fans, of which I am one!
