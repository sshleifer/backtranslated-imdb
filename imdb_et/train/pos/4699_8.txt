It happened for a crime that "Not Another Teen Movie" did at school. I was laughing all the time, because two intuitive gangs were holding each other and together. An unknown comedy that uses openable jokes and gags that kept me running. I think the biggest gag of the film was that time didn't seem to move forward, leaving characters between the 1930s.
