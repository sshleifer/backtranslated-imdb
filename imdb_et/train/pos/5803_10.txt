Oh, I forgot how big this movie was until I put it in the garage. It's a kind of strange combination of Michael Jackson, a musical vignette collection, and a story of a super hero struggling to save some babies. Vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment where Michael Jackson turns into a car, robot and finally a spacecraft (and it's as strange as it sounds). Joe Pesci is fun, and there are plenty of cool shapes and good music to keep you entertained! <br /> <br /> The real pearl, however, is an incredible Smooth Criminal video that makes the movie alone worth it!
