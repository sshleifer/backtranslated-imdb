It's one of the funniest and great movies ever made! Although I've only seen it forty, and I have to say it's a good movie. The plot, if it's funny, and because there is sex in every corner of this movie. It's really funny and I don't see anyone like that movie. I really really want to watch the rest of the movie. There's a bit of a sick scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant), but besides, it's a great movie. I appreciate this movie for 7/8 comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for plot. Please, if you are a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where buying a movie is pretty much. It's nice to you. <br /> <br /> 10/10
