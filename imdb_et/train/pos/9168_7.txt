it was Jane Eyre's fabulous customization. the only problem was that I didn't like Zelah Clarke. I thought he was too old and made a lot of fear for Jane. Jane seemed to have a much stronger character in the book. I was really annoyed by his imagination. the part where Rochester asks her to marry in the morning and she runs to her and always hugs her. I think they made a bad choice in his election. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he's worth this Jane Eyre version. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was movie quality. I know it was done on TVs in the eighties. if it had been a feature film and better quality, it would have been perfect. But my main complaint is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
