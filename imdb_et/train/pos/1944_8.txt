It's a great movie about adult swimming class characters, their problems, relationships, and relationships. This should have led to a wider spread, as it is much better than similar large studios of similar films. <br /> <br /> A swimmer is almost an olympicist who has been taught to teach adult basic lessons and is often a horndogging target for female students. He tries to repel them more or less, with different results. <br /> <br /> Student characters are the mainstream of the US; teachers, police officers, college students, and seniors who have not swam for any reason. The film includes their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests, when they pass through the class. Several sites offer amusing feed, including a divorce teacher, some students who make a documentary, and a girl who is only in the classroom to meet the guys. <br /> <br /> This is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama that has the ultimate in reality.
