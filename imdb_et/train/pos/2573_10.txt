When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends gather for a movie night, there's one movie they're watching over and over again: you guessed it, K-911, the third installment of the very successful K-9 franchise that plays all the favorite TV-dad, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> People, I knew it was possible to wear a VHS tape, but a DVD?! It has been played so often that it will skip; without joking! But of course you have that if you have such a charming, so brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must thank one and only Tom Hanks for introducing us to the Cop Dog genre that we like with Turner and Hooch; However, even this film does not measure the thin excellence in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some of the said-tellers say that Belushi ran out of steam with this third movie. Poppycock, I say. While you may suspect that the third installment - direct video - may not look worth watching, you will prove yourself after watching this high quality movie. <br /> <br /> Give up the plot, but I'll tell you that Belushi and his glowing partner will give you the best result - what you like with a laugh! It is a shame that John Belushi is not alive to see what great progress has been made in his brother's world. <br /> <br /> I suggest that your teenage girl introduce this film to her BFF at her next party. Don't forget your puppy!
