My observations: The end of the equipment is fun and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well and even got naive with Nelson. The boat falling on his balcony gave him the right. Her female mafia costume designs were surprisingly well designed, especially in today's standards. In 1942, the costume designer did a good job. The headline theme just cute. <br /> <br /> Beware of negative posters: 1942 was World War II; Pearl Harbor happened a year earlier. The US, which simply comes out of a major depression; it is necessary to get out and spend that hard earned money on singing, dancing and yes, for fantastic fantasy relocation. Despotic dictators tried to exclude RL from liberating freedoms there. I appreciate the goodness that the public had these fantastic plot films. Film driving was a priority treatment in these depressing times. If you, the negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have to speak and criticize the space. Jeanette's and Nelson's films are a test of time. <br /> <br /> Angel's wings are a wonderful, real angel. The RL wings at the costume party are not so hot, but good for Jeanette, considering SL. Jeanette's dancing was pure joy. <br /> <br /> 15/10
