I was surprised at the low rating of the film's viewers. I saw it on television one late night and it hit the spot - I think it was already in 1989 when it first appeared. But I remember it pretty well, with nice twists or two and an interesting atmosphere in the windmill. Michael Pollard sees his role as being quite a summing up of his early career promises, the most perfect, and everyone else is playing it straight forward. I definitely recommend renting it, although some of the items that may have seemed a bit modest in 1989 may seem tedious, which is a disgrace, given that today's "edginess" is often used as a necessary marketing tool, just like a tick just to notice.
