I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep it brief. World of War is the best WWII documentary I've seen. I've seen various WWII documentaries (not just English / North American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete WWII documentary I've seen. I think it could be a bit more talk about big depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but it does a great job of covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective / fair to everyone. It does not exaggerate nor diminish the roles of different peoples. It has many original materials, including color material and many eye witnesses (many in the 70s, alive). He has great music and narrator. All-in-All I gave this one is 10/10 because it is so good. (There are no special offers in the DVD version so I can't comment on them)
