this is my first review of IMDb, I did not want to write it, but since there are only 2 for this great movie, I have to add my perspective ... and no, I'm not involved with filmmakers somehow (yes yes how often you here before that ;-)) FYI I'm in my late 20s <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to admit that I like animated movies because what you see is limited by the imagination of the creators and they were quite creative for it . Not a story, but a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good, but far from real, and it works well for the film, it's a fairy-tale world. But the backgrounds and the world in general are full of fantastic visions that my jaw has fallen several times while watching it. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon shows the show and has some funny moments in the movie, it's a classic for a moment, like Scrat in the ice. The story is not too surprising (a lot of anti-heroes have to go out and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but who cares about whether the movie looks and sounds good ;-) 1 thing I have to remember . the film is not suitable for very young children because it has some darker scenes and maybe scary children under the age of 6-8. Anyway, I was looking at this time and can't wait to get to the high-definition shops to watch it again and again for that beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
