Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe has shaken the haunted childhood. He has strong trust and hatred because of his traumatic baptism. He finishes his work with a dishwasher and becomes a hustler for wealthy people. He will meet a spam called Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and two relationships. They go out and work together to help each other. They get thieves. Two grow very close and can't live together soon. However, something very important is that Ratso has not told Joe, and it can destroy any hope they have in living together in the city. This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a heartbreaking and bursting portrait of very few men who have nothing to lose, but each other. Their story is devastating for viewing, but ultimately it is important for people. This is one of those movies where characters are pretty much like the seemingly crazy people sometimes found on the street. The difference is that this movie is from their perspective. Their lives have been shown to us and it is devastating to see the pedestrians of this film treat them as dirt, especially when we were one of those people at one time. But the film is not trying to blame you. Instead, it shows the harsh side of the lifestyle of temptation. It's not a pleasant and gentle lifestyle, as many Hollywood films depict it, such as the MILF and PRETTY WOMAN. The men's hustler lifestyle is dirty, filthy, and ugly life, and it is sad that people have disdained themselves like Joe's character in this movie. What seems to me the most about this film was that it appeared in 1969 and has been experimenting over time. For today's audience, this film still has a great meaning, and it loves it and caresses it as much as critics and audiences in 1969. The film was rated X, but for this movie I noticed that sexuality is much more honest, realistic and more effective. Anyone who has previously had sex knows how humorous, uncomfortable and frightening as hell can be, and this film does not abandon it. The sex of this movie may not be as graphic as ever. Movies that were rated X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LAST TANGO in Paris and FRITZ THE CAT, seem very shocking compared to the shocking things people get today with R rating. MIDNIGHT COWBOY's sexual scenes seem pretty strong, but they're definitely not sexy. They are not graphic, but they are realistic and should be remembered by people when watching a movie. The course language used in the film, especially the word "fag", is used effectively and is not free. Violence is very shocking to look at today, but again it is necessary for the plot to become the hustler world. I am really pleased to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and still as influential as it was in 1969, if not more. I can't recommend this class, and I hope it will continue to find the audience because it is a really special and unforgettable experience that will soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> -Jo Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both harassing and amazing. They have never played such a role before and after, and they are completely different than usual. Forget who plays them in minutes! <br /> <br /> -Beautiful Score <br /> <br /> -No dated or campy as many movies of this decade come out like <br /> <br /> -Fantastic and fast editing > <br /> - Only for mature audiences <br /> <br /> - Scenes that are open are well done, but they may be just a little stronger.
