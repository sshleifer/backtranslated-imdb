this is a great movie, changing the beautiful style of the 1950s. Kim Novak is intriguing and weighty as today's witch, one leg in Manhattan and the other in infinity. All supportive performances are terrible for Jack Lemmon, who harms him from Nicky to Ernie Kovacs, who is Magic's champion in Mexico, working with Magic at Manghattan, for Elsa Lanchester as well as for Queenie, a light and witch aunt. And then there is a cat - I have no idea how many witches (other than myself) have named Pyewacket, but recommend zillion. Jmes Stewart looks in place, but only as much as his character is missing; it is a weird world of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And this is the perfect romantic happy ending that we believe, because the films of this decade are happy. Gillian and Shepil certainly have so many ways to be happy when Rose and Charlie Allnut are the Queen of Africa (second big movie)
