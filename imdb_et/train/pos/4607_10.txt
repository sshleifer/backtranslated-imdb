My favorite Jackie Chan movie is always "Drunk Master" (1978), followed by the 1985 film "Police Story". It is played by Chan's Hong Kong super-policeman who captures the notorious master of the crime and his gang and is then assigned to defend a man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that he can change the country's evidence. When the story goes on, the gangster sends his gons to send Lin, but Chan takes things to his own feet, keeping his girlfriend in the Maggie Cheung Bay. Like the "Drunk Master", "Police Story" has a lot of signing games and a general choreography of martial arts / activities that Chan has become famous in a martial arts crowded mall. As a leader, Chan performs excellence by giving charismatic and fun action that emphasizes action. Although the "Drunken Master" light of "Police Story" with heart-close humor is just the police story, a sharp police thriller that has been copied for many years. <br /> <br /> 10/10
