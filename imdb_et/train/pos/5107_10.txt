What's forgotten about the 80's soundtrack. I imagine that John Travolta sang some songs, but when watching the movie, it seemed to personalize everything that was the cheese of the 80s. It is clear that films based on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were stylish. Best of all was his terrible Texas accent. Compare it to Friday night lights. I recommend watching Cocktail and Stir Crazy to really start making a movie. Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is a shamefully bad film. I was so shocked that I realized I had never watched it. Another strange movie about this genre should include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams. Remember that all these BIG stars played a big role in these CHEESY films. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
