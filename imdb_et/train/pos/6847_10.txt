I just finished watching the Dressed to Kill, written and directed by Brian De Palma. The DVD had both an "R" rated version and an unrated version. version, I can not be absolutely sure that the differences are very graphic female nudity, which also includes an explicit expression of self-expression in this version. thing can offend you, i would advise you to check the "R" rated version. but i digress.Any comment here refers to an unrated version. queue set.the killing itself is quite graphic. Although the blood itself does not look real.it recalls how 70 slasher film would look. more violence, or rather the possibility of such an opportunity. The film is very well paced. So far as I can say, every scene had a goal that I find very much in comparison to today's movies. anyway, I also thought it was a good thing, especially Angie Dickinson. And Micheal Cane's role is quietly undervalued, which works great in this case. the film also has one big twist in my mind, although some people may find it predictable. The only complaint (and it is really more of an observation) I have is that I thought that the character played by Nancy Allen could have been supplemented, especially considering that she has a fair amount of screen time. I think he does a good job with what he has given. And it doesn't really take the quality of the movie. the film also has a strong moral that is even more important today. i also liked the musical score, which was made by Pino Dinaggio, felt that it was very similar to the original Psycho.to music, this music really raised the film. I thought this movie was brilliant. For me it is dressed to kill (1980) 10/10
