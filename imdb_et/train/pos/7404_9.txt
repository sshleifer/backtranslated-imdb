Having just seen a show of the Xizhao Australian premiere at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes that it was - perfect joy - harshly made, touching, amusing, dramatic and sharply meaningful. I could no longer agree. I hope the rest of the festival's films will reach this entertainment standard and look forward to seeing more Chinese movies in Sydney in the coming months.
