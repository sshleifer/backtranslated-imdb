I loved this series when it was in WB, I didn't think Batman spin off when the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all, I loved Robin's idea of ​​leaving Batman to solve the crime himself. Their relationship was interesting. I also liked adding Tim Drake to the series and again, as it was the predecessor, this show was a great story, a great animation (better than the original), fantastic vocal work and of course brilliant writing. The only thing I didn't like was when it was in the US, where it often takes episodes with a 15-minute storyline. I just want some episodes to be longer. The favorite episode of my series's favorite movies is in this series and is called "over the edge", I think so good, if not better, "Ice of Ice" and "Robin's Account". Overall, beautiful tracking with Superman has shown my childhood to be very happy.
