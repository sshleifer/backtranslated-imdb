I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is the same niche genre as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List" but deals with the whole issue of aging with incredible authenticity. It is really very difficult to have the main character as unlikely as Hagar. The director does the masterful work with challenges. Hagar is hard to understand. His world has hard edges and is not a warm loving woman at all. <br /> <br /> The first scene gets it without compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to her home and her daughter's care home. He thinks it's on the route and freaks. His edges are really hard. He's a sister. He's outrageous and selfish. He's a stone. I didn't like him - not even a little bit. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie we get an overview. We know why he doesn't like petunias, why he favors one son over another, how his losses have shaped his character ... I started seeing an angel ... and I started to like him. I especially liked it when she poured out her secrets. Ellen Burnstyn, you're a great actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "good feeling" movie, but it is definitely a movie that brings viewer empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are protected, they are there for the reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother-in-law or neighbor ... but some of her life is in many women (and men) in my life. These parts make more sense to me now that I looked at Stone Angel.
