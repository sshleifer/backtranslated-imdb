This movie is a real and historical film. This is very useful for those studying the LDS Church because it is 100% true. This is a great movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is very factual, exciting and motivating. There are some who think this is not factual, but it is. <br /> <br /> This is the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Prophet Joseph Smith who restored it. It has events in her life such as the illness she had when she was a little boy, her judgment Emma Smith, Emma, ​​her wife, giving birth and so on. But most importantly, it shows the restoration of the church.
