This is a peculiar film that the British do so well. Low budget, camel roles, well executed. The story is a bit weak, recently widows Judi Dench decides to round up "blonde bombs" all (well nearly all) girls' bands who performed during the London War, a compulsory son / daughter who thinks she's gone potty. I wanted the film to allow young people to see that they have no feelings, no love and no lust for monopoly! "Old wrinkles" can also be a laugh. Judi Dench was great as always, the damage we didn't do You don't see other "blonde bombs" anymore, I finally thought. I was wondering if I watched David Jason have done a better Patrick than Ian Holm, though he was a "transvestite" drummer. All in all, a cheerful movie is worth a night out for girls. :)
