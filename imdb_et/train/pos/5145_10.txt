<br /> <br /> An old man works as a mental hospital nurse to be close to his wife who is a patient there and try to get him out. <br /> <br /> It is definitely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the quiet era and the history of Japanese cinema. Losing a long thought, a print found in the 70s, and music music attached to it, perfect for pictures. This could have been influenced by the doctor's Caligary cabinet (director Kinugasa claimed that he never saw a German film). But it goes beyond the inner mental state of the prisoners in a stylish and more convincing (and cooler) shelter. To achieve this, the film is used for each individual film method available at that time: multiple exposures and uneven subjective perspectives, inclination angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting and superstructure among others. It's also a very complicated movie because it's not intercepted. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with an installation of rainbows that hit hospital windows, windbreaks and thunderstorms. Amazing weather metaphorical patient mental state and introduces one of them: a former dancer. The combination of rain, wind and thunder sounds is a music that encourages dancers to get crazy, almost hypnotic. In the second order, which includes the same patient who deals with another crazy dance, he is followed by other inmates. The dancer's several expositions represent the patient's perspective and their confusion about "views" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this amazing movie that is trying to represent the patient's subconscious and the views of the "Sane" world. <br /> <br /> There must be three words.
