A has a female friend who is currently in a relationship with a SOB who has a longtime girlfriend. Of course SOB is very beautiful, charming, etc. and my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching the nature of Jean Pierre Leaud at work is exactly the same as looking at what is happening in real life when such guys as our women destroy the lives of their friends. It's tragic and you know he'll end up hurt, but nothing can be done. Leaud is great. Totally empty. Empty all the time, he pulls the face and talks about what he thinks he wants a reaction. <br /> <br /> Scene two hours after Leaud and Lebrun are in love, and next morning he will record and be very cute and charming, singing with amusement is great. "What the hell am I here with an idiot" that flashes his face back and forth, has been in my memory for a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a long film, but watch it in one hand, preferably in the cinema. Take the time to get in but the time just disappears.
