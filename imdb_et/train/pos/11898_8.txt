This film is the perfect Nutcracker; dancing is wonderful, the background was great, and I loved this comforting bedroom. <br /> <br /> Oh, and costumes ... I especially loved marzipan, the tutu was divine. Special effects were very well done (eg tree, bed, etc.), and I enjoyed the rats quite well. I love how they didn't make them scary, but cute and creaky. I think the king, except the king. <br /> <br /> If you are a totally masculine person, you will not enjoy it, but this is a very good movie that is good for all ages - just not on all levels <br /> <br /> But I have some complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why did they have to put the Fairy partner of the sugar plum in these terrible tights? It would barely make a difference if he was naked naked! And secondly, why did they have to make Culkin clothes PINK for EARTH?
