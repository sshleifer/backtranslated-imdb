If you delete this movie for the first twenty minutes, you will be left with a fantastic comedy. As it is, I still found it to be a pretty good film, not small, given the coma that the scenes opened. To put it mildly, this film is a tough start that wasn't even far away or even optimistic. When things come into contact, you will have a comedy that is still going on for over three decades. It is definitely worth a look, especially if you are a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see his previous work.
