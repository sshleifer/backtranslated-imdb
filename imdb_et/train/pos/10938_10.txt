I look forward to ever experiencing such a perfect movie that I have to talk about it right away. This movie is definitely one of the best entertainment options and it is very authentic. I happened to see a duplicated version, but I'm right now to grab the DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. However, duplication did not get along the way and sometimes gave some funny humor: "Poison Clan tends to the world !!!" <br /> <br /> The story is about Chinese methods of intrigue, arrests, and interpersonal relationships. You can expect turns when five poisonous identities and pace of experts appear. <br /> <br /> Martial arts choreography is in its class and must be considered plausible. It's like watching real animals fighting against each other, but interpreting their own cute forms of martial arts. The skill level that is cast is not insurmountable in today's cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination offers a serious dose of old Chinese culture, and I recommend it only on the basis of the true intention of the film to tell the art of martial arts and the mastery of its performance. ... Of course, if you just want to see each other pumping, with the old forms of torture in China, be my guest!
