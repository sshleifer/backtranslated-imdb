I saw this movie in 1984, we first started watching "It's a Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to sleep. So we went to see this movie. If you have your head about conspiracy theory, you will want to look at it. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie is: Do you think the government is capable of doing this? (I think there is no doubt they could) <br /> <br /> But I don't want to give too much information because it would be a spoiler and I think you should watch the movie yourself. But just to let you know, we'll talk about this movie 20 years later and try to explain it to people, not the easiest thing in the world.
