2000 was a bad year for Indian films, as filmmakers lacked quality and imagination. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai was nothing different. CCCC had a lot of controversy about film funding, and it is not really aware of what the film is about, and has created good advertising and improved ticket sales for a movie in India and abroad. The only information provided was that it was a temporary thriller. The film has now appeared in 2001 and the film was surprisingly good. The main plot is associated with surrogate and is well handled. Salman and Preiti give a good result, where Salman doesn't take off at all .. be special effects !! Rani plays Salman's wife, but this is a slightly less demanding role compared to Preiti, a prostitute who will eventually be replaced by a mother. The three main leaders confirm that after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega they have solid and screen chemistry (probably) solid. Excellent Salman Khan plays a serious role as a successful business man in the film and is a pity he uses in his films as a wannabe comedian because he is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry. Rani's character does not know that Preiti is a prostitute until the end ... it is kept with her and the rest of the family ... the rest should be known because it destroys the film when I told you. The songs are all well captured, especially the dekhne walon and the title song. Other supporting parties make minimal, but subtle efforts as the loving family of Salman. Abbas Mastan has created a stroke and treated the film object tactically. I say go and watch it or rent what you prefer!
