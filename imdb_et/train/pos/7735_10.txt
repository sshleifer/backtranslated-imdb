With an excellent interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements - an exclusive ex-boxer turned into a descendant, an alcoholic widow with bad wishes, an ex-policeman turned to a small-time cramp and a robbery posed as a punishment. But the film never moves to a clich√© country, but remains fresh and intriguing. The performances are all excellent, especially Bruce Dern as an evil sleazeball, Uncle Bud. The motion of the film is subject to intense uncertainty, which deliberately or not adds to the gloomy procedures. Highly recommended.
