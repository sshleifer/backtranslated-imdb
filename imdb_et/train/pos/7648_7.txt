I admit that I have stories of weak replacement history, from its magnificent life to the day of the earth until 12:01. Among them is this little pearl. It's hard to get through MR. ATTENTION, without giving any cast member recognition, ranging from the famous James Belush to murderous Courtney Cox. This film has no difficulty and scale to make this great movie, but it's a joy to rain in the afternoon. It is also a great rental for a cheap date.
