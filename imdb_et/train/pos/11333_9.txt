Just joking about weight loss things; Well, you can lose weight you never know. Anyway, what I can say is love this movie. It has the same sense of youth and innocence found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we forget them. The film reminds us of what is seen in the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. In his sympathy, Jake's Closet presents a uniquely human story that anyone who was in childhood can both be and fall in love. Look at it with friends; see it with your loved ones; to build a fort - wine optional.
