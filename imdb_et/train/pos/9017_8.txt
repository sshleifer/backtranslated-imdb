This film is an excellent work of depicting the suffering of the victim of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). The theme is done with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is as convincing as ALS that I had a hard time believing she was acting only. The great actor Kenneth Branagh lives on expectations as an exotic artist who misleads and is forced to offer Helena's character as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison time. Monitoring the development of the relationship between the two is a tutorial from beginning to end. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not diminish fabulous performances. One must take care of these two.
