This movie is a few things that are quite amazing. First, it should be based on a real story. This in itself is amazing that many tornadoes hit the same city at night in the fall of Nebraska. I don't know if the real city name was near "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the movie). There is Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that starts with Blains. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest moving tornadoes that can be seen when boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene where the TV is blurred is actually based. Before Doppler radar and radio radio were taught that when you turn on the TV for a particular channel (not cable) and set the brightness right, you can tell if there are towers coming. The problem was that you could hear it by then. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about the mid-western tornadoes, it made this movie fun for me. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, let me break it - you can't do it anyway and F5 chain yourself to the well.
