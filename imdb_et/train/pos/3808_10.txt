I voted from 10 out of 10 just because it is the best animated story I've been able to see for some time. Animation is stunning. Every art behind the landscape was beautiful. From colors to lighting up to the usual price of art. I was surprised. By moving the screen beauty beyond that, you are immersed in a set up that is instantly timeless and at the same time fresh. The formation of characters is short, but these critical moments are exactly what is needed to steer the viewer, what and why and how the character is where they stand. The whole thing is impressed and I think it's necessary for the whole family.
