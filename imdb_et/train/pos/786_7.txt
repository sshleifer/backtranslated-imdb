Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are great in this movie again. If you enter 40 and have been alone for some time (or all of your life), you may feel that you are wasting. The film is a sweet reminder that love can be found everywhere when your antennas are active. I liked a quick sexual encounter, which must be a non-existent school teacher (MacDowell). His former student is lovely enough to still shatter his teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I thought were rather unrealistic or impractical. For example, in a scene where the other jealousy of women is canceled and the scene was created to allow Andie MacDowell to sue a young man, would a mature police officer (MacDowell's second friend) allow his friend to do such a sin? Can anyone stop in front of the car? Of course accidents happen all the time, but I was hoping to see that the heroine will be happily married to the first man with whom he is affiliated (it was the hardest to believe! Maybe filmmakers are aware that many romance between an older woman and a younger man doesn't last long In addition, they know that the happy ending does not turn to the public, especially for the jealousy of 40-year-old women who are waiting for some miracles. The sad ending with the eyes of hope for a sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if the man continues to live, will it No one knows, however, this is the film you want to look at again ... later in the year.
