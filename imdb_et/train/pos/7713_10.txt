Today's sci-fi thrillers are more like the Rambo outdoor space, which has monster special effects (often ridiculous, such as explosions in room vacuum). Although, according to today's standards, the special effects of Forbidden Planet are quite striking for their time. Even today, they are still plausible. However, the best part of the movie is probably why radio thrillers still have a complaint. Much of what is happening was left to the audience's imagination. (What did the Krell beings see?) If the story is a lot, then the tensions and tensions in the whole movie were not published or published. The end was also very thoughtful and satisfactory. In my opinion, it is still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi movies ever made.
