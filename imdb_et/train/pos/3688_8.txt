Nowadays, some of the industry's best leaders are. There are also some great actors of our time, not only from France, but everywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale) From Paris, Paris arrives to learn French and understand his life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: Apparently, it was no better way to start this movie than this segment in romantic Paris. br /> <br /> I read du 16ème: A picture of Paris from which we are better aware of quotes. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time looking after someone else's child (she is a nanny) than her own. <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: Have fun seeing Gérard Depardieut as "tenancier de bar" Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discuss their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Don't tell me you didn't like those people! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Treatment to see Steve Buscem as a tourist who makes great contact with a (no-no) subway girl. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier, too. <br /> <br /> I've spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me go back! <br /> <br /> Barcelona (Second Great City), Verdi, March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
