Michelle Rodriguez is a decisive actor who could be the focus of other actors. He has very rarely seen (and pulled out) the heavy role of girls at the beginning of his career, which is recognition. Though his later films led him to the same role, this film was made for its durability. <br /> <br /> His character is a romantic student / fighter / lover who tries to overcome his embarrassing existence in projects that are a bit redundant ... but not a girl. This aspect of this movie is not very original, but the story goes deep, as the hot relationships that this girl is doing start to boil and her main rage takes over. <br /> <br /> t saw that the actress is still so aggressive in making the film, and I'm glad she gets that original twist there in Hollywood. This movie got me from 7 ghetto-young middle stories, but it has such a great actor who rarely plays a visible role with a minimal budget movie. Great work.
