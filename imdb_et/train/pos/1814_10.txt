All dogs that go to heaven are, in my opinion, the best animation ever made. I'm not really a big fan of an animated film, but something that makes it better than any other movie you have seen. The music is great, such as Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluis and especially Ken Page performances by King Gator. "Let's Make Music Together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs of any movie music I've seen. This is definitely necessary for people of all ages.
