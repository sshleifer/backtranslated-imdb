the only word that takes this movie together is peculiar. it is a frivolous romp through an existential concept. bouncy (more than one) and a little nutty. I wouldn't call it a big and unforgettable movie, and it doesn't look as memorable as the director's first movie "Cube", but it's good to fluff to watch Sunday morning. they function rolled from venerable to annoying times, but I believe it was as it was written. as a serious film that could have been great or could have come to the fore very well. slightly like "matrix" corresponds to "onto" corresponds to "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
