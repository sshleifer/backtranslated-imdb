In fact, I never bought metal, was satanic and stuff, but this movie's idea was playing. While this is certainly not a serious film or a really high evaluation, it serves its purpose in playing it. The story is a metal band burnt to death in their hotel, one of their fans is a dream to do so and said the band will go to kill the son outside the grave. So yes, a little "Nightmare on Elm Street" plot takes place here. Freddy never gave a girl a car. There was another movie with a heavy metal band, but it was very different from how he played because he had a band that took over the city and made them crazy. It's just a fan of the band that helps the killer's spirit first try to stop him. Nothing terrible, as I do not remember what many brothers are killing. To be honest, the scene I usually remember is a girl wearing headphones, and then the band is murdered by some of the band's incarnations. Nothing is great, but a nice time filler.
