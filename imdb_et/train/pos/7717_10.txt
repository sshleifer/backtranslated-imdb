I loved this movie all my life. It is also a smart story with many classic tips. e.g. The ship that had been lost for decades was called Bellerophon. In classical mythology, the man who killed chimera, a legendary beast that consists of two or more other beings. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly a chimney and his Id-monster. <br /> <br /> I like movies, where writers have clearly shown intelligence to their audience, unlike the most advanced blockers that spend $ 150 million on special effects, but about $ 1.50 in the scenario. <br /> <br /> Greetings
