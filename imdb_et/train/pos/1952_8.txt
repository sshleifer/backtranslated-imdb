I saw the movie "On Thin Ice" on TV in India. I have to say that the movie was really well done and really sent chill down my back. The main story makes me ponder what makes some addicts decide to move where others are still addicted ... <br /> <br /> but I felt that Diane Keaton was his best ... scene where he has eaten and starts his home with cocaine ... was the best ... two boys are good and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actor ... Script is well done, as is cinematography and direction .. and pouring <br /> <br /> Black must watch the movie ..... everyone
