I loved the sky from October. What I loved most was to be music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the movie, it gives the viewer a schedule. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. The second hour takes over the instrumental score. The music fits perfectly with the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't just enjoy music, but I liked it very much. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a great surprise for me. He gave a first-class presentation, such as Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie to get alive twice before, and I enjoyed both times.
