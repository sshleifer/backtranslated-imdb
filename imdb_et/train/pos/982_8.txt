It is one of those westerners who are virtually alone in the quality of their dialogue. Very few can keep it long. That means the rest is pretty bad. Nonetheless, I will give him eight, because there is no other westernly consistent dialogue, perhaps apart from The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and maybe some more. <br /> <br /> John Drew is the most prominent Barrimore. But it has one truly memorable scene. Nothing like this. Right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff and goes to Jack Elams, trying to fight him. Wonderful things. Best of any Western world.
