"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that whispers to the point of humorous self-limitation of pop culture. The characters are so interesting and fun that they laugh. What brings me an introduction to the characters I liked best ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s / early 40s who is creating a pop culture-led magazine called The Big Big Thing. the fact that this magazine does not really exist, and it is just an excuse that Simon would come close to the participants by interviewing them, but fooling them foolishly, offending his way of buying pop culture. His lively female friend Darla also writes a magazine (which is real) is mainly related to him and Simon, as well as to him and his father. Darla is a truly lovable (or loose) character, depending on how you look at his silenced neurotic behavior. Magda is the prostitute that he liked best. Also, Tedra, a music video queen for B-class rock bands. However, these characters sound very interesting on the web. And this film questions all the motivations that people is what they do and why they do it. This is a great movie and I suggest you see it when you're an indie / art house crowd. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
