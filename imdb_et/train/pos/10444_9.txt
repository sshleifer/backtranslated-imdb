Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less, but meaningful, "before sunrise" (1995), Richard Linklater's third film, is dedicated to anyone who has ever fallen in love, has fallen in love or has never fallen in love but still dreams about it and hopes it find. This is one of the very rare movies that should / should be equally interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems like a very simple little movie that has no outstanding visual effects, cars, longer and steaming sex. Two youngsters in the early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke, who returns after summer in Europe and French student Julie Delpy, who goes to Paris to attend Sorbonne classes) meet on the train. They attract each other immediately before they start talking, they stop at a train in Vienna, where they walk around, exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, it's a movie. It could have been boring and stupid, but it is a beautiful, plausible, clever and touching romance that improves every viewing (at least for this viewer). With great praise and sincere thanks, I give the director and the writers two charming characters, excellent writing, always interesting and spiritual dialogue, two fantastic performances and an atmosphere of love. Julie Delpy, who looks like Botticelli's angel, is great, depicting an intelligent, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
