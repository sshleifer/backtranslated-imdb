I argue that anyone who is ultimately responsible for the creation / approval of a trailer for this film has completely threatened. Not one I know I wanted to see from the movie preview and everyone who actually saw it (what I know) absolutely loved it. # 4 Behind ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour I've never seen, the average IMDb score is 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I have seen, is a fantastic movie, but the third week out, the average IMDb score of 8.7 (I should say). IMDb score 8.1 (a bit higher in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, the average IMDb score is 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but it's been 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> Was it a bad timetable or a bad ad I think the powers behind this movie have fallen for a long time! It should have been promoted as an amazing movie, what happens to be a fantasy / fairy tale and not just advertised as another fairy tale? Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have a very pointless ranting-on-on ... Awesome movie, go see it!
