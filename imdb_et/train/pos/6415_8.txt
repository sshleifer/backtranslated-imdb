TIllman Jr.'s drama is the first African-American naval masters diver (Gooding Jr.) who runs counter to all odds and achieves his goals, despite a rigorous coach. The scenario is not bad, sometimes sometimes extreme, but direction and action are first-rate, and this film is inspiring and achieves what you should do. I liked DeNiro's lead, although it is not equal to his masterpieces (taxi driver, godfather and all others), as good as his other good performances, such as comedy or angelic heart. DeNiro is always a convincing and credible, very good result, Gooding Jr. not bad, definitely one of his best performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, My Rating: 9/10
