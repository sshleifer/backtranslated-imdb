Teachers will be released on March 24th in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in Gothenburg with a retrospective dedicated to the festival director Kim Longinotto. He gave a very prestigious master class, talking about his methodology as a documentary filmmaker and telling the audience about the special circumstances that led him to shoot at his sisters twice: the first version was good, so the second shooting was organized and the film finally turned out to be different. In this case, there was a rather terrible problem to create a very strong movie opportunity.
