I was waiting for the age before I saw it, because all the reviews on it said it was terrible! I rented it the worst, and although it is hardly the sandstone, it is much worse! Sandler often speaks with the camera and the film does not take itself seriously, but it's all a fun part! A great way to waste an afternoon and you can even laugh twice once! Good movie to rent!
