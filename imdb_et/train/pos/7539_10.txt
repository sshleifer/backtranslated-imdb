I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who watched it. I wasn't sure I got. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and has made many funny movies; that means it wasn't really a comedy. it is a drama with comedic moments. So if you are looking for a smiling rebellion, this movie is about a black family moving from a city to a nice neighborhood in a higher middle class neighborhood. I'd say more, but I think it would break the movie. this film not only deals with race relationships between white and black, but also with the black community. I think it deserves a chance. if you are not really interested in other movies about race, this movie is not for you
