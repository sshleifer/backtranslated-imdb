This noir may not be the most memorable film in the era, but it has a large mystery plot, a common noir atmosphere, and some good performances from its lesser known well-known members. Robert Siodmak, a talented director behind the mystery / horror classic Spiral Staircase, directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film, and shows a real exciting dark and nursing atmosphere and creates a plot that both the intrigues and the fascinating spectator create. Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson; a man who is married to a woman, he doesn't like it. He chooses one night in the bar with one big hat and two agree that no night is added to the fun night. He then returns home to find an apartment infected by his police officers, and soon finds out that his wife is exhausted with one of her towns! He is outraged not to find that someone he saw with a mysterious woman does not remember him, and of course the jury sends him his murder. But she succeeds in her beautiful female employee's case ... <br /> <br /> The plot moves nicely all the time and, unlike many better-known guys, has some murder that makes the procedure more interesting. In fact, I swear that Phantom Lady was Italian Giallo! Central characters are interesting enough because Alan Curtis represents a good unhappy victim and Ella Raines is an effective female impromptu detective. But the real state of the movie is Franchot Tone, who gives a memorable crazy madness. The film also has the role of actor Elisha Cook Jr, who plays the drum movie in the most memorable segment. If I would like to criticize this film, I would say that the murderer's identity appears a little too early - although Phantom Lady deserves credit in this respect in an original way. The conclusion is satisfactory and everything is meaningful (which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line) and, in general, the Phantom Lady is definitely one of the biggest and most prominent promotional items!
