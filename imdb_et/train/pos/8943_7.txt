The 1960s Bewitched TV series owes its idea to the film. This is a film that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did right after Alfred Hitchcock was in Vertigo. It's not as obsessive as it is, but Novak is just as enchanting. <br /> <br /> It was Jack Lemmons' 10th film and he is well supported here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this film, almost the same as in the music world. The cast is very strong. <br /> <br /> This movie is a feeling of a New York at the end of the 1950s and a cat that is as nice as any cat in any movie. It's worth a look because it is a love story that has all the emotional emotions, and little magic to boot. <br /> <br /> This is not Vertigo, but I think that as it followed this movie, viewers will not appreciate it as it deserves - I'm sure William Asher saw it in the 1960s The series of the 1950s was created. I'm not as happy as Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is much better.
