Very strong film. Bruce is good and Brad too. <br /> <br /> As I think from the Bruce Reminder List, the Reception Officers list remained two cities. <br /> <br /> That means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job. <br /> <br /> Well, Novikov's property seems to me working in this movie. But I believe in the future theory of the diversity of worlds. <br /> <br /> So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. <br /> <br /> In the theory of parallel worlds a man can meet himself. <br /> <br /> And I think there's no problem with that. Here I disagree with Dr Brown ... <br /> <br /> But the story of pf 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. Despite all one world or several or consistent theories, one might believe that he is really crazy and a doctor - his girlfriend was just gone. <br /> <br /> A series of events that may make him believe he is the future. Moon - it can be a mistake, a forgery. <br /> <br /> I like this movie - you have to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best of all.
