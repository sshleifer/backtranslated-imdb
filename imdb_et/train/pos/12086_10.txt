Wonderful family drama / comedy starring MacClaine and Garr, who attracts and warms the heart every time I see it. Recommended for grandmothers of all ages from 9 years of age. 1962 is a lovely periodic piece. The story includes Garry in distress, his two children, and Aunt Zena (MacClaine), who are trying to make ends meet without a man as a household leader. "The Family" leads the West to take a pretty old forgotten relative who has left Garr, a tea cafe that fell out of the late 1933s. Permanent Garr, like a sweet but decisive mother, gets the whole family back to the caf√©'s restoration and opening. But wait ...... Aunt Zena is an old circus artist who has card tricks, magical powders and jesters with a sense of humor ...... she loves to have kids and her funny and sometimes dangerous games ... ..What happens next is a wonderful combination of "Miracle at Lords" thrown with Cuba's missile crisis (authentic news from a real event) and a "ghost" that is completely out of hand. This film attracts, philosopher, casts doubt on religiosity and gives an awe-inspiring look at the terrible intimidation of the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. Finally, one of the miracles of faith, family, and rediscovered love remains. Oh, and the music of the early 60s is just great!
