This movie is actually FUNNY! If you want to rest your brain for one hour, go ahead and look at it. It's called blonde and blind, so don't wait for deep and meaningful jokes. With this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes with about two blondes. It's just funny to watch a movie on a date or with a friends' club (especially if you're not too lazy. Lol) Pamela and Denise are still pretty hot chicks. It's a mistake to rate this movie as a work of art. C'mon, this movie is about BLONDES! It should be light, funny and superficial. One more thing I don't think girls appreciate and like this movie, but a man for sure.
