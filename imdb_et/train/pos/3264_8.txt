What a Loss of Director Emile Ardolino was! He could take a light script and put it in the right casting and editing to shine and shine like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky like a great romance, but it is definitely the one that will keep you in the end. You really want to know how things work. <br /> <br /> The script fits perfectly with Cybill Shepherd, who for the time he needed for his "Moonlighting" success for a new generation who was (fortunately). for him) is not obviously aware of how much he was on the big screen after a very promising start. In this film, she is back every day, living through her daughter, still living as a widow living in a butterfly (Mary Stuart Masterson at the top of a stardom that hits "Fried Green Tomatoes" two years later). Perhaps he was too young for this role, but it works well as the story develops. It's his movie, but he doesn't cross his limits as a leader. <br /> <br /> Shepherd allows Robert Downeyl Jr to carry a large part of the movie and show more mature comic elegance than his previous films. And there's enough support from Ryan O'Neal (his best role in years) and Christopher MacDonald. Masterson's natural charm is quite a lot on the coast, either so he has the opportunity to make his character every word for a fresh breath of air. </p> <p> </p> Just like "Dirty Dancing", but this movie is not so bright that you could still watch it with your parents if they were in the room. (Use your best decision, they're all your parents.) I'll give this film a higher mark because it's very user-friendly, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it overwhelming, and those who just look at them should find a lot of humor to enjoy as well. <br /> <br /> Again, credit goes to Emile Ardolino to take advantage of Randy and Perry Howze's charming script. (Where are they now?) The next film by Ardolino would be a phone caller "Three Men and a Baby", but his latest theater release (sister law) would eventually give him a nine-shot blow he earned. Mr. Ardolino, your cinematic touch is gone!
