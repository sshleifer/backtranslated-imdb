it is practically impossible to describe this film. the alternative title "Don't look up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese cinemas, the story is not as linear as American. The story revolves around the director who is filming the story of the ww2 desert. The set is haunted by a (?) Actress who died (?) Filming a TV show in the 60s. director is ONLY this exhibition. if you've seen Ring (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and liked it, you like the ghost actor. I loved the ghost actor much more than the ring. a really scary and disturbing movie. 10!
