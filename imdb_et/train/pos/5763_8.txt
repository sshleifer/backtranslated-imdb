<br /> <br /> I have to admit the enjoyment of bad movies. I love them, I look at them all. Especially horrible. My friends and I all get together after a hard week at school and at work, rent some crazy tapes, order a seal, and get a blast. One of the things we got in Hollywood Video was, Zombie Bloodbath. It had a great box, so I waited less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a residential project built on a nuclear facility that has ground-level layers and another underground layer is simply covered. Residents of this neighborhood will find a covered space when some kids get into the cave. It awakens some zombies. <br /> <br /> From now on, this is a piece of town. Gore effects and action will never end until the end of the credit. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not a great art, but it's a dialogue that is funny and an overwhelming scary thing was our favorite night. In fact, it was one of the best "party birds" I've ever enjoyed. And you could say that it was done without money, a lot of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a kame) and it's just a wild trip.
