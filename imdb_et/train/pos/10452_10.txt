I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I would like to tell them that they are prepared for each other so that we want a lot of time in the film to die for each other. Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us didn't. It is about love, but not stupid things like noticing the mountains or such a movie. It's life and I believed them, I believed they were falling ... It was so smart and touching. I've just finished this for a few minutes and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them again as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I became a misanthistist now and I felt that when love was just a fake, it was a concept, but I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and in some cases, if something could really happen. <br /> <br /> I am French and did not know very well about Delpy in July despite Kieslowski's "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see her work because she looks like an angel and got perfect action. <br /> <br /> I saw a few days before "sunset" (a sequel to Paris) before I saw "sunrise" and their thing is not important. They are both masterpieces. evidence that you do not need to know the technology to get clean feelings. I'm sorry for my English, which I will try best. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
