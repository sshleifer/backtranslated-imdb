I love this anime! I smiled with all the jokes and violence (mostly Akane Ranma reluctantly, but the short-tempered "groom") is so dirty, but Ranma deserves it, but she tries her best to change ... terribly. The main character, Ranma, goes to China to train only to fall into the damn Jusenkkyo spring and become a girl sprayed with cold water. Since then, it is pure chaos one after the other. Among the most prominent are Kuno and Kodach's sexual shampoo, perverted Happosai, all of which cause our hero / hero problems. But it is Ranma's selfish father, Genma, who shatters most of the time. If anyone wants an anime that is funny, this one is. It's amazing and better with Japanese dub.
