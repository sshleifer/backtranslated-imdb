This movie was a great concept. It was original, intelligently written and extremely pleasing to those who are not really "conformist" filmmakers. Don't Do Me Wrong - There are some great movies that have a wide-ranging appeal, but when you go to watch a movie based on "everyone else watching it" - you know you're either a co-author or not. It was a lovely, subtle humor - despite the fact that most people probably only seem obvious. The actors depicted their characters with the aplomb, and I thought that there was much more "personal" personality in this film. It is attractive to both children and adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that is not full of sexual references and drugs! A big movie that shouldn't be publicly used. It's mandatory to buy.
