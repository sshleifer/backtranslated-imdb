<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange mixture of sensuality and numbness. The film is slow, very slow but takes a rhythm to talk about murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (man gives a real result) and Rachel Ward is all but sexy. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension, pshycological heat, traces of the past ... rebound scenes, the strange character of Patric, become a sexy secret. I suggest this one reason is the sexier dull film I've ever seen. Check the love scene, this is especially sexy.
