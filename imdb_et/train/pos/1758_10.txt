I was really surprised by this film. Going to the introductory preview without knowing anything about the movie except one trailer I saw, I thought it would be a guy with my car. I had been waiting for bad sex jokes and foolishness and a miserable moment of leadership, which finally ends up as it is just how the films work. Instead, I got a smart, surprisingly original film of a decent and average man who just didn't get sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is full of sex jokes and vulgarity and occasionally amazing -nipple! All the characters are the people you probably know in real life, the redeemable friends who are just trying to pull the brother and live his life. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a complete mess and I was very surprised. Yes, it's quite up (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40-year-old virgin!), But it's very wisely done. <br /> <br /> In the end, you really pull this guy to get a stick that says a lot about the movie, to be honest, do you really care about whether or not Ashton Kutcher found his car?
