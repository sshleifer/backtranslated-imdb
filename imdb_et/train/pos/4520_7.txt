This comedy is a little too long and above that comedy is absolutely joyful, never uneven or ridiculous to explore the "power" problems that love women with clothes. <br /> Julie Walters is as beautiful as ever, but Adrian Pasdar is completely believable and steals the movie. She's absolutely gorgeous high heels and silk stockings.
