This 70th exhibition is the best TV show that is a time period. In my book is Andy Griffen's exhibition, Saturday night live and the Simpsons. This 70's exhibition continued for 8 seasons, all focused on a group of young or young adults who interact with relationships, separating their parents and their future. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers living next to each other. They have lived alongside each other for most of their lives and are getting to know each other more at the beginning of the first season. A large number of exhibitions revolve around their relationship. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in service, so he really puts Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Although he drinks heavily, he treats Eric and his friends very carefully. Bob, their neighbor, is probably Donna's father. Bob captures the whole story through several different women. Bob also irritates Redi completely. <br /> <br /> The rest of the character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play an important role in the story of the exhibition. <br /> <br /> The first season is great. This is when the characters start to feel new things to each other. The first season is original, funny and pleasant. The second season is good, though it's not as good as the first. This is the continuation of the first. Eric and Donna are together and everything works great. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. He went back and hit the first season and humor. I also think that the character chemistry improved the bunch, making the show more fun. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not so good. Eric and Donna are not together, so the exhibition is a little less pleasant. It's still funny though I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the last season I enjoyed all the time. It's a gang's older year, so this story really helps. The fifth season was also the best season for all seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is usually good. It is extremely funny, although it does not reflect what other seasons did. Gang is out of high school so I believe it didn't hit the teenager that the previous seasons did. I also didn't like the last three or four episodes, considering they had a big drama for them. <br /> <br /> The seventh season is the same feeling that the fifth season had some way, though it wasn't. I enjoyed the seventh season when I did everything else, and the end is great. <br /> <br /> The last season is wonderful. Eric was not what destroyed it. Kelso wasn't usually the one that didn't help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good and the series ended. <br /> <br /> So if you enjoy comedy, give it a try in the 70s. They stopped making new episodes, but it's still on TV. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It is up to you to decide if you want to buy the 8th season.
