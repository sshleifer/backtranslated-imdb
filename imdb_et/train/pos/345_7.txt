The first hour of the movie or so it was the least boring. But it improved later when Valentine Party started. After the collapse of the killer's identity, the scene of the murder of hot water was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of the film. The garden in Kate Garden was well shot and so was the last twist. There were some real tensions and excitement on these scenes, and the hot bath murder scene was nasty (as it should be slashers). The earlier murders are frustratingly pure.
