Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> Best Star Wars. the first movie I ever had was Sean was bad guys and its a very good ending. It was really for me to wait for the soul of the next next war because so the game stuff comes along with this movie so you just got to know more about the last. With enough movies I can always feel it can be a doner, but not it. and I will never forget that the part that Luke is in is his father. also love bob feat figure do hes back to the land player. if you have never seen a star-war movie, then this one goes to him. That's the best. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Lucas
