Does anyone know where or how do I get a copy of this movie?! I've been looking for too long, someone helps! In 1997, I was my girlfriends and I was on a Long Island based film and we could never see it. : (<br /> <br /> I was hoping I could find a copy somehow so I could finally review it and share it with the girls! Is there anyone who knows where to get a copy of it so I can't get crazy (also doesn't matter if it's in VHS format, I'm still in ice age.) If you or someone you know is a copy of this movie, I'd be willing to pay for this good copy!
