I just came back from the Zero Day Montreal premiere ... and I'm surprised to find a negative comment on the movie. In principle, Coccio is guilty of making a simple and superseded social message ... well, Mr-ma-a-reviewer, this is a simple and overwhelming critic of social films. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to reveal my life here, but I come from a small town with a similar school when these men go. Deny & ignorance from the menu. The thing is ... I understand how young children can make such a horror. High schools have become a battlefield of requirements. This is a real ugly phenomenon. You have to fight your way to be like others. It is difficult to explain, a little bit of people do not realize that secondary schools are becoming cemeteries of human information. Meanwhile, parents close their eyes and laugh at how their life on their comfortable suburbs is perfect. <br /> <br /> The real motif of the movie is not to control it. It is about a peaceful suburb just like death and all who are closing their eyes and trying to create the atmosphere of this perfect city. Cal did well. This is awakening. Drama is everywhere and it can take shape. In this case, little drama (as Andrei is called to laugh at J.C Penny's shirt) is the worst horror of the whole city. Andre and Cal took the most extreme way to express their pain. The contradiction of failure in the era where you need more than ever before, to receive them. <br /> <br /> I especially like the latest scenes where some boys burning Andre & Cali crossed, as Cal & Andre has reported to his community his blind rage for his reported pain, refusing to think about some of the causes. <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive as a movie, but Coccio contemplates more than whining or pronunciation. What Andre and Cal live is a reality ... and scary that can come to other children. <br /> <br /> Disturbing film ... Making a home and a strong feeling made Ben Coccio a very disturbing movie.
