Finally, an indie movie that actually gives some great fears! I see the most horror films coming out ... theatrical, straight DVD, cable, etc. And most of them suck ... some are traceable ... even less are really good ... Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I was screened for this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! I don't know that the budget for this movie was pretty low, but you don't know it ... the movie looks awesome ... works perfectly for the movie ... the story is good ... and the fears are great! While most filmmakers focus only on fears, they often forget the story and character development, which are two things that help make fear more effective. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that nature and story are important. It develops to a point where you care about the characters when you know the characters, and are therefore more dangerous than they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Watching horror films that cost $ 80-500 to make I think "Dark Remains" is one of those gems. Check out this movie!
