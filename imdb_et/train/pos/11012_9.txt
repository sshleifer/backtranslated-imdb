First of all, I was not sure if I was looking at a documentary, propaganda or dramatic presentation. I think that given the time of production, it was a mixture of all three. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had the feeling that there would be interesting scenes to keep the movie going. We can recognize what seemed like a realistic training regime and equipment. <br /> <br /> When this movie came to me, it was closer to the end. The scenes had realism (at least as I perceived it) that I had never been before. You can put yourself in action and imagine the thoughts of the young fighters. It was mixed with the usual problems associated with depicting Japanese soldiers at the same time, when one might think that the actual Japanese actors would be somewhat small. <br /> <br /> The film is a great source of American thinking in 1943 as a war with Japan. Also interesting was the Japanese digging in with the help the US provided to Japan in recent years.
