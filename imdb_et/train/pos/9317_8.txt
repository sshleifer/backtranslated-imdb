I've seen this film, which was criticized by the statement: "If you get past morality ..." it will miss that point. Moralization is the viewer's conscience, as it was. This is a decent film with a normal mystery of murder, but with different switches in the middle of the surface. The resolution leaves the viewer thinking, "What would I have done in this position?" And I have to believe it's just a filmmaker. For this purpose and at the end of the audience's entertainment, the film will succeed. I also like the fact that violence is never on stage, but just on the camera. We know what just happened; It's not just in front of us, then rub our face as if it were a modern blood and gore dressing. Moreover, there is no idea of ​​violence. This is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, which has been resolved accurately, albeit annoyingly.
