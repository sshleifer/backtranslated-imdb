Nowadays Spielberg's "The Color Purple" is mostly remembered for eleven nominations for Oscar and for winning zilch. What is even more worrying is that Spielberg himself was not the best director. Needless to say, filmmakers deserved more recognition than they were given. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman who dominated her incidents first. father and then his abusive husband. The film lasts for several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with female women. This is definitely spoken from a female perspective, but you do not have to fear that it is a "chick flick" of saccharin. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, animated with humor, although the fight of the central characters is extremely important. Some may not understand the change in the end of the film, but I did not like it, although the same content on a smaller film would probably be in my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film received three Oscar nominations: Whoopi Goldberg (best actor), Oprah Winfrey (best supporting actor) and Margaret Avery (best supporting actor). I think Goldberg and Winfrey were definitely worthy, and Danny Glover was exorbitantly rigid. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Spielberg did not become the best director for his efforts. Such inaction creates faith because Spielberg's direction here is top-notch. I'm not particularly crazy about the Quincy Jones score, but it's in no way below average. <br /> <br /> Finally, this story is satisfactory, well-known by Pulitzer's Award-winning material maker. Try it and you will probably be as confused as I am about to treat this Oscar so badly at night.
