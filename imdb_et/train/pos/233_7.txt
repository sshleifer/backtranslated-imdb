I found this movie "interesting"; in the end it is worth my time to watch and rent. It is true that some scenes were at the top of emotionism, shouting, etc., but what film does not emphasize its agenda, genre, or "ax grind"? Almost missing! What surprised me was that I read elsewhere in the review carried out by S.Frani reviewer, but I found a negative overview of the more detailed description of his own film review; not movie at all. Anyone who watches this movie realizes that it's nice to recommend it to family and friends; no cars, yes! Being myself in the Italian family, I can fully associate with the environment on the screen. The film also features tear-pulling parts. It is in this real life that it can be in such an environment. Nice movie.
