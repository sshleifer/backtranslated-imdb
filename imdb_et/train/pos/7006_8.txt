With a ghost of secrecy, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks redemption, radically changing the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is set, nothing can stop him. At least that's his opinion. But Ben hadn't planned to fall in love with one of these people, and he was the one who eventually transformed him. Will Smith is back with director Gabriele Muccino, a life-inspiring "Blessing" movie. "Seven Pounds" is another life-changing movie experience that not only loves you with their previous collaboration, tears, but ultimately inspires you. Will Smith also has some other manufacturers. These films are very realistic, representing a common life of a person and his life. Seven pounds could take time to get this real boost, but just after half an hour of the movie, it's all set to dominate your heart. This film also revolves around twisting twists that allow viewers to guess. Director Gabriele Muccino is again the winner with all her emotional and inspirational message. He makes all the characters in the movie very real, so people can really find themselves out of the movie. With the director, Will Smith is another winner with great actors. The duo of the director and the actor works again with charm. There are other talented actors in the film who did their part quite well. Rosario Dawson, with the brains of beauty, can invite him. She looks beautiful and does her part very well. Barry Pepper gives great support to the film and Woody Harrelson does the same, though Woody didn't have much screen timing (it would have been good if he had more). You won't forget this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. Classic Cinema!
