"GI Samurai" is seen by Sonny Chiba and some other boys are being transported back to the civil war that has fallen into feudal Japan, without any special reason and many carnivores. This is a sword vs. machine gun top essay, which ultimately gives some interesting results. <br /> <br /> The matrix moves essentially along the rails that you can expect from the title; the original fish-out-the-water antics ("what is this flying metal box?" etc etc), "are we not better here" discussions and ultimately a big battle. The latter is proof that the film does not take anything seriously, carnivores take most of the second half of the Samurai army battles in the Chiba group; the face is waiting for the face, but it still manages to overcome its inventiveness and extravagance. This is definitely one of the most unique combat systems of that time and will not pull despite the length. <br /> <br /> Chiba first gives Iba, a good leader, but somebody who ultimately interrogates his morale, as the situation slowly affects him. This is definitely one of his best vehicles in his terrible CV. With the final act, the two worlds have had such an effect on each other, you have to think about whether it was a bit nihilistic to the writers because they seem to be asking "are we better then?" But maybe a little bit of reading can be considered as undoubtedly fun for two hours (almost) of non-stop activity.
