This move brought me out of my chair, waiting for what the actors did! Action was the best, Farrah should have done the Oscar for that, that he was fabulous. James Russo was so good that I hated him, he was a villain and played it wonderful. There are not many films that have been irrigated to me. The great Alfie was cast in shock with those big eyes that Farrah looked like a victim, and you lived your horror when he went through it. Farrah made you feel like you were there and you felt the same anger he felt he wanted him to hurt, but you knew it was the wrong thing. In the film, you had a skateboarder and you went up and down with each scene.
