"Shore Leave" is usually the average Star Trek adventure. There is nothing wrong with the episode. I just think it's not the best example of what the exhibition was for fans. It's easy fun, nothing more. But I am pleased to see that this type of TV show had a good idea to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his team some time off and the landing partner is beamed down to a planet that looks like a perfect place to rest. As usual, the planet is not as calm as it seems. There are some activities and tense moments, but most of the story is played with a laugh. Good but unusual.
