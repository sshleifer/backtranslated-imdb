Not the most successful television project John Cleese ever did, "Strange Case" is the first draft feeling that attacked production before making any improvements. Some and even some smart ideas have some foolish ideas, but the whole story is unfortunately not much improved. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a hoop like Dr. Watson, bionic and all. "Holy God."
