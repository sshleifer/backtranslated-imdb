Unfortunately, the ignorance, the remaining "ignorance" of "Krell" left "the gear" and "cumbersome father", how to access and do this technology to avoid losing her daughter to another. An ancient plot, beautifully rendered. <br /> <br /> And, given its age, it will remain a stunning stopover, an action, a human-emotional classic - and visually very modern --- it won't go over-- - all the prerequisites for all modern sci-fi and its psychological content raises it beyond the genre - timeless work --- <br /> <br /> and soundtract! you will not see / hear the pure "synthesis" and completely exposed Moog's background --- "don't miss" ---
