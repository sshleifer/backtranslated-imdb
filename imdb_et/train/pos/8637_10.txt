"California" is a great film that makes us look at ourselves. The film has a big cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, the river runs through and the autumn legends) as early gray, David Duchovny (X-files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: next generation, killing life on the street and escaping LA that is, like Carrie Loughlin, Brian's girlfriend and Juliette Lewis (wild born killers, Cape Fear and eating Gilbert Grape) like Adele Corners, an early girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a writer who is a Liberal, preparing to write a book about serial numbers. Brian and his girlfriend Carrie decide they want to move to California Brian is advertising in the college for someone who wants to go to California to share their travel expenses. <br /> <br /> Early gray is unfair and sociopathic, who recently lost his job in a mirror factory in the city, is in debt, owes his landlord money. An early password officer stops to visit him and tells him about the job. Lege and sees the ad, later he tells Adele, his girlfriend, that he is leaving to go to California. Earlier and Adele meet at the bus stop with Brian and Carrie and leave the city.Brian and Carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed Brian and Carrie thinking for a while early and Adele but knew them and got friends, Carrie and Adele became true good friends. <br /> <br /> Their journey is very learning. Although Brain and Carrie do not know early, the film is a later killer. The question Brian asks about the killers in this movie and the difference between us is a very good question. Earlier, Grayce is a sociope who doesn't see the mistake of his way, falls down the hill later and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I'll give it the 10/10 star and 2 thumbs. I love the movie songs, especially at the end of the movie the Indian song "Look Up To The Sky".
