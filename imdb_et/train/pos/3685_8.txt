It is just such a pleasure that you have followed this intriguing project. So refreshing and educational. Not only for a filmmaker who can learn what can be achieved within 5 minutes of the screen, but also as an audience that may not make so much love in such a short time. The movies about love in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought the segment of Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) was the best, even though mime made me smile just the same. read is enough spoiler. Look at it. Don't read what I write but watch the movie instead. <br /> <br /> And smile.
