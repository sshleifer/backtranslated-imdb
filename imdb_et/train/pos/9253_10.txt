Well, the movie isn't exactly "funny." <br /> <br /> Okay, I testify that there are some HUMOROUS lines, but there's certainly nothing ridiculous funny. For example: Just before the steamer sex scene between Eleniaki and one of her husband's costumes, including the bed post, she can't remove her shirt. Before leaving the key, he says to him, "Okay, don't go anywhere." <br /> <br /> Look humorous, but not funny. <br /> <br /> Plot and action are pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She's hot and sexy, and she's really a steamy scene that can't be helped but rolled back and looked again. <br /> <br /> There are other very sexy scenes with him and he has very provocative lines. <br /> <br /> Generally 5 stars. I would only give him three if not Erika Eleniak.
