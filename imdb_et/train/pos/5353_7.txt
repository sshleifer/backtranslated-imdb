In 2017 (although this may easily be a mistake in 1987, evaluating hair and clothes), Running Man sees Ben Goodards (Schwarzeneggar), a good man for whom he has not committed, everywhere. After a brutal jail break, he has been captured and entered as a competitor in the brutal television show The Running Man with some companions and a real-name wife, Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso). <br /> <br /> Uses totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses, mining cartoons against many colorful (and often quite camp) opponents, all with their own unique killing style: Dynamo burns electricity from a special suit, Buzzsaw uses a chainsaw, Sub Zero is a hockey stick with a razor and a firewall prefers a flame burner to stop the rivals. But these killers are not suitable for Ben Richards, who sends each one in an awful way (followed by mandatory witticism). <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the Ben group freedom fighters will join the authorities and get exactly the vengeance of the show, Killian. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzeneggar decided to act in the universe of the film, and he could not do it wrong for the legion of his fans. Austria's beefcake had a successful formula that made it almost a success for its movies: the violence of comics plus a logic-free plot plus a pretty female sidekick plus a clever single-liner, minus the ability to make a huge profit. The current person closely followed the blocking recipe T and Arnie (mostly male teenagers) in the gateway (including). <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later, and having just reviewed the film for the first time in years, this strange film is one of utterly technical value, decent action and convincing effects, but somehow fun. Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (known as Det. Dave Starsky's cult at the 70's Contest Exhibition, Starsky and Hutch) and Stephen King's Short Story (Writing by the so-called de Plume, Richard Bachman), Running Man is Cheese. In the 80s, which see both incredibly cheap and very dated, but in spite of (or perhaps) the shame of the film, it has a special charm that is hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Without trying to create a realistic proximity -future device, the film provides many involuntary giggles. Explore the scene where Ben discovers cartridges (!) Banned in Amber's secret range; admire the graphics of "futuristic" graphics used on advertising boards and Running Man's board game (as a graphic designer I found them especially fun); be surprised at the lack of clear technological advances. <br /> <br /> A running person can be a perfect garbage, but it's a tremendously fun garbage that I don't want to recommend to fans of Arnie and sci-fi activities in general.
