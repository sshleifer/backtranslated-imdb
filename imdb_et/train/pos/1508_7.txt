This film is good, what it is and modest; I wouldn't look at it twice, but I'm a graduate of Peter Cushing and that's why I looked at it. The best value of this movie is: BREVITY and efficiency. Compared to other similar films, this leg does not pull forever, because every four (plus one) segment lasts less than 30 minutes, the last one down to 10. Good pile. In the first segment, the "writer block" is a writer of fear separated from the old house that is looking for inspiration. He even finds too much when he starts seeing one of his fancy crazy. The plot is similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of the twist of viewpoints: does the writer become mentally ill ... or (when the exhibitions are over), his trophy wife wants her lover to play with her husband's phobias to crazy and insure her. .my is it bimbo to survive to enjoy the fruits of its brilliant plan? a museum that contains the shape of the long lost wax of adolescents that had ever separated them. From the Gothic museum keeper, they learn a depicting woman in a dead ax who is using a murderer ... or was she? <br /> <br /> The third segment was less interesting to me. <br /> <br /> The fourth shows a horror actor who thinks he is at the bottom of the C budget with the lowest budget. Looking for a costume that gives more credibility to his fictional vampire, he gets a real deal. This segment also lacks the first two. <br /> <br /> By acting fairly, the first two segments give most of it. A good film taken with a salt blade. Not the best Cushing or Lee ... but it's worth a look.
