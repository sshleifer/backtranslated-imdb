This is Casper's friendly spirit, short of my childhood, and I look at it again on YouTube (thanks to God! You Tube); after that i love this short and this is one of my favorite Casper shorts. <br /> <br /> I love how short the start of Frank Gallop's haunting story succeeds; Until we see Casper sitting at the tombstone of the cemetery, reading. Although every ghost rose from the graves to the people, Casper decided to leave for a friend. But to make a friend, anyone who sees Casper is trying. Poor Casper sat on the log and sniffed; until the little fox cube comes to her. Casper and the little fox quickly bind and quickly call the boy Ferdie and consider him his best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper's and Ferdie's relationship is in immense danger, but if Casper doesn't keep Ferdie's watchful when they play Hide and Seek. When Ferdie hides a hunter and two of her hunting dogs are coming and trying to kill a little Ferdie and Ferdie will work as fast as possible until she breathes and begins to rub. When the hunter strikes Ferdie Casper, they try to kill him and fly towards the hunter and claim that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone. And the hunter and the dogs are afraid of Casper. Casper screams at Ferdie that the hunter and dogs are gone and everything is fine. But Casper sees Ferdie's body not moving and asking if he's OK. When Casper sees that Ferdie is dead, he starts to sore because he lost "the only friend he had in his life." Casper returns to the cemetery where he is buried in Ferdie and made him a tombstone next to the tomb of Casper. Casper continues to mourn until he sees Ferdie as a resurrected ghost. Ferdie will stop Casper on her cheek. Casper screams with joy because he's reunited with Ferdie. <br /> <br /> Generally it is very good; although surprisingly disturbing, showing the death of a family comic book.
