I agree that the capital should be on DVD. I looked at this example only in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working in the financial sector in London abroad change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role he had. I can't believe the exhibition lasted only 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's amazing charming friend. When they presented this exhibition in the New York City area, it was always late or out. The exhibition is less than an hour. I felt that this show should have gone longer, but the changes made in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I don't care about Sylvia, but last year I missed the actor Julia Phillips-Lane. I felt that this exhibition took opportunities and often worked. It showed Americans who loved and decided to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant and did not try to overcome their British colleagues. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize rather than all of them British. I liked Julia Ormond's early role. I felt that this show should have lasted longer. It seemed to me that the previews lasted as long as less than an hour. They could have handed over to New York and it would have been in America.
