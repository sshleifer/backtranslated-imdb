What I love about this exhibition is that it follows the life of modern witches and it is a blast to experience your daily love, humor and adventure. The magic literature is so diverse, depicting ideas of classic, medieval and modern magic, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina's young servant, this exhibition is so fun and unique, because it allows us to experience a lot of modern magic, seven seasons! This exhibition has so many great features and joy to see how Sabrina lives in her daily life in mortal and "other" areas. I recommend it to every family because the TV series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!
