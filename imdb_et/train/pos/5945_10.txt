Let me make one thing clear? In most cases, the Hollywood exhibition mentality mentality p * me at all and even more specifically with his beloved, symbolic symbols. comic pages. Why? Well, let's take a typical Hollywood board meeting scenario to illustrate if we should ... <br /> <br /> Executive No.2 'Good point, let's do one in a hurry! ? We make a happy hat and randomly select a superhero to build a movie! '(Dip is going on and the famous superhero name is pulled out) <br /> <br /> Executive No.1' Great! Now who can we play this part? <br /> <br /> Comment # 2 'Who's the Big Mailbox Now?' <br /> <br /> Executor # 1 '* great actress name * this week.' <br /> <br /> Filler No 2 'But does he really fulfill his role? I mean, he's not like that character. <br /> <br /> Executive No.1 'Who cares? He's a big name; We'll make a movie with him anyway. <br /> <br /> Executive No.2 'You are absolutely right! And besides, we fill the whole movie so that it is full of glitzy special effects to soothe the moral masses that no one asks it anyway! lose the most modern superhero movies. All styles, essential and simply pathetic casting of iconic drivers. Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule; when Hollywood gets it right? take the original (and still the best!) to the original Superman; Christopher Reeve and lately Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in X-Men films. <br /> <br /> But back to the general negative traits of Hollywood today? did the leaders always have to choose the participants who actually fit the roles? In this less than ideal world, one filmmaker believes it simply or not by choosing actors who have their true similarity to their comic book. His name is Sandy Collora. Unfortunately (but usually) Hollywood has not yet been allowed to run a full-length movie for Collora, but fortunately he has given us exciting pictures of the ultimate result of two (yet) famous heroes of the super hero. One of them is the excellent Batman: Dead End, and the other is this hook-up movie, a totally fictional film called the best in the world. Well, don't handle our words here? it's an awesome thing! <br /> <br /> Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn (who looked fantastic but wasted in Barbara completely wasted) makes the most appropriate choice for playing a steel iconic man. In fact, there is no doubt ever closer to the comic in terms of physical similarity. <br /> <br /> This Clark Bartram has been added freshly with his superb imagination, like Dark Knight Batman: Dead End; Again, another very meaningful casting process! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ? If only this was a real, full-length movie! Hollywood Studio Leaders? take note! This is how it should be done! <br /> <br /> Finally, I find it interesting that the very short reactions that this short film has caused from fans. Obviously, the most striking and violent side effects are clearly (as is the case with Batman: Dead End) the younger, less kinematically experienced audience; the fact that their somewhat grammatically primitive lines and the liberal use of base dictation are betrayed. Such an unfortunate closed state of mind is indeed a sad phenomenon, although our above-mentioned studio leaders in Hollywood will undoubtedly have great satisfaction. After all, these very same misleading individuals are likely to be exactly the same type of CGI addicted, popcorn fillers that will delight most of the nonsense that Hollywood will be chanting these days.
