After seeing Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes, no actor should ever see that he could ever realize that he could ever be close to depicting Mr Brett as "one of the most interesting signs of literature". Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes and I don't think you can be another. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I have to admit that the other, but there is another. It can be argued that the scenarios of Mr. Rathbone were worse than the absolutely top-notch productions offered to Brett and I agree with it. However, when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett is always the only actor ever and truly "turns" into Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this topic and we, the public, should enjoy the unique performances of Mr.Brett. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
