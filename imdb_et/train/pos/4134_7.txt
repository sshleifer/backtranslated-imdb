Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes star "Lady X Divorce", a comedy played in 1938. Olivier plays young barrister Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to stay in his hotel room when the London fog is too dense for guests to listen to their home. The next day, his friend Lord Mere (Richardson) announced that his wife (Barnes) had spent the night with another person in the hotel and wanted to separate him. Believing a woman is Oberon, Olivier. Oberon, who is an individual and a judge's granddaughter, pretends to be the lady, Lady Mere, if she's really Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We have seen this plot or its variations dozens of times. It is pleasant with this pain. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, this great team at Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is devastatingly beautiful and does a good job of comedy when he imagines a powerful, nervous barrister. Oberon gives her a light touch. She looks extremely young with a full face, Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a very different hairstyle. She wears beautiful street clothes, even though her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in one dress she tries to make her hair, and she's ready to play snow. Binnie Barnes is delightful as a real Lady Sea. <br /> <br /> Its color is confusing, and as others have mentioned, it can really use recovery. Definitely worth seeing.
