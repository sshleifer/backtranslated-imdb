What a lovely heart warming television movie. The story is about a little five-year-old girl who has lost her father and finds it impossible. His mother is also very unhappy .. the only miracle can alleviate their misfortune. Samantha Mathis is great as the mother of a little girl as she was a "babysitter" "Jack and Sarah", which you should look at if you like both Samantha Mathis and happy; year tear jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is always a pleasing grandmother in such an offer and in an excellent film. Jodelle Ferland (a little five years old) is a charming and most convincing young actress. The film is based on a real story that makes it so touching. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of humanity, which is clearly illustrated and which is still around us in the complex world in which we live. "Mermaid" gives us hope, knowing that there are many cute people in the world who have a lot of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
