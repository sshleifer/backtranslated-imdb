A very unique Sci-Fi animated film, and frankly I love uniqueness no matter how it tends to be, better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to look at, the technique part is innovative, like "Waking Life", which I recently watched. <br /> <br /> It took a black and white style to get used to, but finally I love it, sketchlike pictures are really fancy! The contracted world of the future is the symbol of the final destination of the human group, which I love very much. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is good for sci-fi, not so intriguing, but it's OK, like some Hollywood products, a giant conspiracy of man's eternity, a little cliché and a twisted end isn't all that convincing, some developments are too simple and uncomfortable and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> So I think I'm just in love with the style of this movie, others aren't that good. <br /> <br /> Life's eternity, I think most people have reached unanimity that we don't want eternity, because it breaks down the idea of ​​life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful when everyone can live forever , so the world world becomes a disaster and chaos. Leaving a person is difficult and heartbreaking, but it is also an opportunity to show our lives truly and all emotions live their lives and make the world colorful and vibrant.
