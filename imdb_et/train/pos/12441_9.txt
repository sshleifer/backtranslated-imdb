It was a modesty we didn't know! It was hinted and summed up in the comic books for syndicates sold to newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were the real Modesty Blaise fans who were given The Dream Job - tell the prequel story of Modesty that fans have never seen before. In their audio commentary, they admitted that they changed their origins to make the story smoother. The "purists" should also note that we really do not know whether everything he told Miklos was true because he was "timing". I didn't rent or borrow a DVD like other "reviewers", I bought it! And I don't want a refund! I watched it three times and I didn't sleep it! Great dialogue and well-drawn characters I care about (even a bad man in Miklos) like novels and comics! I can't wait for the next Modesty (and Willie) movie, especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's coming!
