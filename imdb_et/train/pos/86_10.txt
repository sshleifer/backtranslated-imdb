I remember it in Salem's cinema (where I attended almost every "Kiddie Matin√©e" Saturday), Ohio, when I was a young boy and never forgot. It just amazed me and my friends. I wish I had a way to see it again! I've been trying to find a little summary or something like that. I only recently discovered that it was Cousteau's film, which, in my opinion, blew even more. How the hell he achieved is not my understanding. Fish is ATTENTION at one point when I remember correctly! If anyone could find me how to see it again, I would be very grateful!
