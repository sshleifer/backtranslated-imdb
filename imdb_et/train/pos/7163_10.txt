seriously i loved this movie. I had started reading the book and I loved it ... how everything was created and everything was aiming ... I think this movie was so good because Louis Sachar wrote the script. And of course Andrew Davis drew it ... Shia Lebouf gives his first film an excellent presentation ... the story is very cool and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... it is very similar to the book. this movie is not the least bit boring ... I loved it ... and I encourage everyone to read the book. All this film is very well assembled and carefully made ... two little for me in every way
