This is one of my favorite kung-fu movies and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Brothers in the late 70s. The plot is interesting and complicated, the characters are cool with your style - toad, snake, lizard, etc. Action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies, but it is interesting to display different kung-fu styles from different characters. I recommend this movie to those who think that all Shaw Brothers, especially Chang Cheh movies, are the same, most of his films usually focus on 10 tigers and the Shaolin vs Manchu conflict. This film is the breath of fresh air.
