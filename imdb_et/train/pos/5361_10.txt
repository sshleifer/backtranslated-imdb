If you have grown up with the game of nutrition, you realize that you will need a bigger and better solution gradually. Well, in the world of a running man, your needs will appear. In this game, prisoners compete for freedom and the final prize - their lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody that we follow every day. This is not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but in general it is a very good film. The basic idea that television companies one day are "real" rulers of the planet is very plausible and is very well portrayed. Of course, the usual Arnie's single liners, my favorite is when he's in the gamezoon, gameshow host asks: "All the last words?" Arnie says, "Yes, I'll be back", but the host quips "Only reboot" and presses the eject button. I give this film 10 originality. I had to look at it at least 30 times. Only the movie except Die Hard, which I often watched! <br /> <br /> In short, don't think for a moment that you own T.V.
