Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are good, but what gives this neo-noir to his juice is Hopper's horrible, violent character and JT Walsh's slipperyness. <br /> <br /> The tear turns into a mistake and tries to make a little dough out of it, but goes over his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallels in this movie's opening image when Cage goes to a trailer in Wyoming to get a drilling job using her friend ... and an opening plan at Brokeback Mountain, if the character does the same! But this is another story. Dennis Hopper is his best here ... devilish, one step by step, foolish and explosive. JT Walsh (RIP) is also a great man with a dark past who is trying to live legally (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only four real characters here, except for a hard-working deputy at Red Rock in Wyoming. The first twist strikes early and from there it is a nice neo-noir adventure in a sleepy little town. Satisfaction. 8 points.
