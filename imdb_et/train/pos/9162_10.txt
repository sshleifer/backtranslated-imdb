Although I didn't read "Classics" in literature until the age of 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because the book is not part of what I liked less than the parts I enjoyed more. The 1983 TV-mini series Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton had everything I had hoped for. I saw it as a full-length movie in 2006. Dalton's Mr Rochester was very good, but I loved Zelah's 'Jane Eyre'. Following the second classic film I saw recently, I was disappointed with the production, direction and dialogue. It was only faithful to Hollywood's greed and arrogance. The artistic license of the major works of literature is something of plagiarism. Using a title after a license is a fraud. Leave it to Brits for this right (among others). You can't read this book again without playing the movie with its right context and spirit. Well done BBC.
