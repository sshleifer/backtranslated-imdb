Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV is stolen, he is sent to Camp Green Lake. At this camp, Warden and his two henchmen ordered Mr and Mr Pendanski's messengers to dig holes after the hole. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I have never intended to look at "holes" and I have to admit that I was just watching the movie really because I'm such a Shia LaBeouf fan, but Even if you're not his fan, it's not important . "Holes" is one of the Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story is lovely written and contains a wonderful idea that you can add setbacks to the past. They are not distracting and really make a big setback. All cast is great. Young stars work well, and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a pleasure. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at the age of 17, she can act without mistakes. This is one of the Disney movies that you could surely use as a family. <br /> <br /> "I'm learning about success." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
