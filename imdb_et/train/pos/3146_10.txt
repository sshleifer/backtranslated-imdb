If the TV was a baseball league, this show would be a perfect record! With excellent pain and a perfect plot, this show showed 8 amazing seasons and great pleasure for television after dinner. Constantly changing relationships and explaining who the true father of Hyde was, the show had hit when it started in August 98, though it was set in 1976. and it is still with the circles. This show gave big laughs in premiere and it still repeats. If you look at some of the episodes of this exhibition, you will get everything and want more. Now it's just one of the best ever created, it's smart and funny.
