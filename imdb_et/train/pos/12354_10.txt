An excellent film that can be viewed with amazing scenes and talented actors such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of viewing, your eyes are locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathe in the atmosphere of the movie, waiting for the fate of the characters. This movie will make you leave your usual audience, it will take you, it will make you part of the story ... Costumes and settings are great; especially the okyase region is skillfully built. Certainly it is not very Akira Kurosawa, but it still gets a lot from the master, especially the style story tells us that we are in a remarkable cinema to the land that is quite far from Hollywood.
