That's what one of the girls said at the end. <br /> <br /> Is a football game a metaphor for a qualifying game between girls (or more generally a free thinking group) and authorities? "To Germany" means the future, which is hope? <br /> <br /> This is one of the most unforgettable movie experiences I've ever had - despite the raw material for cinematography and the plot, and the slight over-action (although I like it cast - they are loved and above the expectations of amateurs). The ridiculous situation is well caught. I feel that the game is not deeply disappointed (being a female and football fan), and I can't think of how to make convincing disguises. I do not know why there is no section of women where it would be possible to protect against dirty language and bad behavior - to fight for wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> The film is very wisely made - amazing title, filming during real game, spontaneity and a variety of methods that put viewers in the characters' shoes - a game that is so important, but inaccessible (not shown), flattering light and the delightful sound of the stadium, the van, and its useless if those who are inwardly involved, denote the crowd. I feel the comfort of radio, drink and food and, of course, the goodness and attention of every character to others. At the end of the credit, I'm kidding that no character has a name - it's just a "soldier" and it's just a "girl" or "sister".
