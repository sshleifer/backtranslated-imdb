"Five Days" is considered to be something special, a criminal drama that consists of a series of episodes, each of which is assigned to one day of police investigation. In fact, this story turns out to be less important than initially thought, because the fact that each episode's action is limited to 24 hours is hardly noticeable, and very few distinguish it from countless other crime stories. In fact, none of the last prime ministers can be suspected, because one of the sub-plots focuses on one cynical female policeman approaching retirement: and this is not just the absence of Helen Mirren, which makes comparisons unfavorable. There are a lot of serious over-emotions, manipulative music, and signs that seemingly seemed so that everyone is meaningful in some sense, the other is suspicious. And it is possible to guess the culprit before the end, not the story of internal dynamics, but rather because of the building of drama as a whole: certain things must be true to justify the series's focus on certain characters at certain times. Despite these shortcomings, the series grew to me: at last I was quite involved. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, who once made the Singing Detective, praised this "probably the best drama of the year" because there is little real originality here and the claim shows a lack of ambitious disappointment. "Five days" is not really a waste; but this is a formula, and hopefully the BBC's best offer would be something more innovative and fresh.
