I voted for this film 8 because of small child disorders. Moreover, this movie is one of my favorites! It's fun to say at least. However, the shooting places are ridiculous and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a bit too much of his "Matrix obsession" into it. It seems their enemies are just standing there ... waiting for them to shoot. But this film always touches me to cry. It has a lot of great humor, so it makes me laugh. Gackt is a great actor I have to say. It was Hyde's first action and he did it well. This role suits him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. The whole thing I would say is ideal for this movie. DO NOT DO! TO KNOW THIS!
