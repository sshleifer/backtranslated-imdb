Spanish movies are certainly, if not golden, definitely a silver time. Pi√©dras is another example of a film that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although the feelings are strong or almost alive or at the death level, they are still not melodramatic. This can happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories that connect. One of them is a slowed girl who doesn't dare to cross the street to the next block. One of them is a middle-aged woman who finds her life lover's mouth fetisch. The other is a girl with drug problems who loves to leave her. Another thing is the brothel's low, who (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing. It is in Spain, where participants take women seriously.
