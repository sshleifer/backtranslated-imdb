When Mulder looked for his real father here, he is Darren McGavin, the first X-files, sorry it was just one season. The producers of this exhibition did not know they had a classic in their class, and in 1993, Chris Carter came with what I called Night Stalker, The X Files follow-up. Both show that classics are, in my opinion, two examples that take viewers to a level of experience that comes only once from time to time and who, in X-files years later, should help Darren McGavin, like Arthur Dales, assist our two heroes in solving cases. . A tribute to a man who thinks so well done by Chris Carter, who brought back the forgotten TV show David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if it wasn't for X-files and that particular show I would never have known at night in Stalker.
