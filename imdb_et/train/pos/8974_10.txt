Jiøí Trnka made his last animated short-term accusation of totalitarianism, causing him problems in his home country, Czechoslovakia. The elements are scarce, symbolism is simple, and his trademark ornaments are almost absent here, allowing the viewer to focus on the fable. One man in his room devotes ceramics and takes care of his only plant. But suddenly a big hand enters the room and tells him to do his own shape. The man refuses and he is persecuted with the hand of a malicious glove. These days, when the real situation is trying to erase the impression of the reality factor from most animations, it is refreshing to watch a movie that makes this technique a part of pleasure.
