zero-day is based on the mass murder of a colombin high school. and a video diary of the two boys. At first you don't know what happens, you think it's just a bad student film. until they start talking about the terrible things they do in this school. until they start talking about bombs and weapons and come to shoot in the forest. they have a lot to say about this movie. everyone knows that this movie is a movie you forget about watching a movie and watching real video, two boys. <br /> <br /> Two boys are acting as they are a strange cult. they are burning all the things there. like playground games books DVD homework stuff school stuff. these two boys can be your friends, brothers or people you see on the street. it goes through the daily active ingredients there (and this makes the weapon. the videos they make, mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people in the clothes and things you've brought in don't say that right, but many people do such things . <br /> <br /> And this is also the case with the person suspected of being sensitive to the topic they have chosen for this movie. <br /> <br /> so my review on zero. <br /> < br /> and let me just say that the end scene is confusing.
