I saw this movie about a week ago and I mean it. I was very moved by this film. I found the characters very believable and very fond of the mistake. As in real life, though sometimes people are disappointed, as was the case with Leo, who, even when I liked his character, I couldn't be disappointed when he was ready to protect sexual sex, although he is fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed by Leo to reject the drugs available to him, and the terrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to return him on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why young men get HIV numbers. It is by no means meant for homosexual homosexual (homosexual) homosexual films and the film could have been made by a very young straight person who makes bad choices and does not seem to know the consequences of his and others. The only part of the movie I didn't understand was why the (gay-friendly) family didn't want to add Marcel to Leo's disease, so he didn't let him go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message in this movie is that either gay or straight is NOT an unwanted SEX!
