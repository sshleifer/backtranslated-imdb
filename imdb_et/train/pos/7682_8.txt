Holly is engaged in child sexual abuse that is restrained all over the world (about 2 million children are trafficked each year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation - this is the big order that the Priority Films team is doing successfully. American actor Ron Livington celebrates the film with the newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and brings them together, which is common for people in the infamous K11 Redlight district of Cambodia. Although it is a difficult topic to deal with, the film is with moments of laughter and hope when we feel close to the characters, keeping the two-hour movie too complex to watch. I am pleased that this kind of film brings the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution must be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's big and the movie must be all.
