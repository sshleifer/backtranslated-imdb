The only time I saw this movie was 10 years old. I've remembered all these for years when I didn't see it for a week or more. It just kidnapped me. I was on vacation with my aunts Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of it to look up as an adult. It has done a lot of research to find out what the movie was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally got its name and comments. I enjoyed it very much, but it gave me some fear! Jaqui
