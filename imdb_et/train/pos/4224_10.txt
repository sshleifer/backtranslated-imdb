I love this Columbo episode. Perhaps this is because Ruth Gordon is in it and he is wonderful as a successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is a delicious look as a perky, lovable author who suffered terribly when her niece died in a drowning accident. He blames his niece, his nephew. He's going to kill him to get him killed because the police have abandoned him. I would have loved someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronic. I never like anything to Hartle personally. And, of course, with Columbo, there are some laughs like when he interviews Veronica in the belly dance class. Ruth's Abigail is a smart mouth and fits with Columbo, which Peter Falk has always played perfectly.
