Take 4 pairs, whose relationships were already stony and put them on an island paradise, where 26 of them are tempted to be tempted. It was a prerequisite for the exhibition, simple, but outrageous and funny. Leave it to Fox to throw the morale out of the window and let it go. It was like the actual version of Melrose Place. It is good in the exhibition that it was not the involvement and manipulation of people for the money prize. It was about lust and temptation, clean and simple & the relationship between the final test. <br /> <br /> People either loved this or hated it. It was like a slowdown to see a terrible traffic accident. You know you shouldn't look, but you can't help. Drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy.
