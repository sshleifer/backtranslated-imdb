"Our song" gives us the lives of three teenagers Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn - the best girlfriends hanging at the end of the summer. A young summer - even if we don't know the signals and landmarks of this landscape, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is the same for all of us. Lazy breath of pressure and rebellion in schools. Welcome to warmth and idleness. <br /> <br /> But if this adolescent experience is universal, then the city of the mid-90s is a different place than most of us - perhaps as foreign as the state. Young bodies that carve new silhouettes ... refer to a new territory ... a maze in adulthood. The young mind comes to himself, speaking for himself, saying that this is who I am, that is who I want to be. It is / was always so. But it works in Brooklyn in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is the writer / director of this film project, but he admits everyone who has made suggestions to him. The opening title slide "Film by" seems to list everything in the universe. It's a gesture, but at the end of the movie we know it's real. [Closed titles also have some of the most logical financial and respectable credits I read.] Jan McLaughlin's vivid sound recording deserves special attention. McKay is a modest leader who knows who talks about this story - his three graces, Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They are the real thing, with their focus on true friendship and reality. This is not a transcript of a music video that speaks about teenage life. This is the seriousness of long unblinking enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> We can no longer talk, but we feel audible. These are true voices that clearly and boredom the everyday life of the crisis. We are witnessing the modern mathematics of teenage life - how its problems are interpreted, calculated and summed up and solved. Small scenes illustrate great thoughts. Lanisha hangs with her father in her security work - the only way she can spend time with her. We see the love that exists between them, but also the failures of family and fatherhood. In a merged scene, Lanisha protects her father's mother and we see how desperately she needs to love both of them and those who love her. Later, three friends were in the dark, sharing their vision and dreams - and we remember how crazy / funny kids are and tragically how realism grabs idealism these days. In the end, Maria is just a walk on her own. We see that he is gathering the courage to keep all his fears and doubts in the bay. He proves to us that we need the strength to be able to seize a life that makes life alive. <br /> <br /> The greatest gift of our song is that we deeply feel the profoundly uneven nature of friendship - how, one day, in life and in liveliness, this closeness can just turn and go away in the next case. It's terrible, but that's how it is, isn't it?
