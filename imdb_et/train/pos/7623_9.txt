Although I didn't originally want to jump to a "lost" observer, I accidentally tried one episode at the beginning of a season where the polar bear was and that has been my undivided attention ever since. Exhibition, that is. There is no polar bear. So wear (heh) with me when I throw out so much rambling, semi-cohesive praise when I can get together. <br /> <br /> "Missing" takes a simple idea that the passenger's flight filled the desert island and gradually adds to its extraordinary depth by exploring each character deeply and insecure? Where did they come from? It will soon become clear that the island where they are stranded will act as a common denominator for many things in their lives, regardless of whether they flee (Sawyer and Kate) or contact spirituality (Locke, Claire). But "lost" also increases the island itself and the mysterious horrors it has ... and they all seem to be a strange relationship. <br /> <br /> Although television actors are not well-known for their fine or dazzling abilities, most of the "lost" pains are indeed the prominent actors in the parts that present heart and humor in their performance. There is also a large amount of eye data, but not generally Hollywood plastic, like most TV shows. The characters feel very real and they are extremely compelling. Their interactions rarely fall into predictable sapphire, small arguments or cheesy melodrama (though they are irritatingly secretive)? these people first try to survive, and any relationship appears aside. The realism of these characters already contributes well to sculpture. <br /> <br /> About this plot ... Imagine a motif plot, then branches as subplots (in this case, one branch for each character)? Well, Lost adds branches to each branch and then tiny branches to these branches, like the other story. If you are a brother / sister against one of the main characters of the setbacks, you will get your story. If you are a dog, you have your story. If the writers are not able to pull all of them together, they eventually created themselves. I'm more than a little worried that this show is a disappointing disappointment because I'm sure most people are. <br /> <br /> But if you assume that the writers are pulling it out, "best" is probably the best television shot. <br /> <br /> 9/10
