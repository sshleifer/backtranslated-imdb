Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana who is a high butterfly and 2 x 4 shoulder. He's ready to fight someone, especially his father, who pays for his brother's boxing hours. Diana decides that boxing would be a good way to focus her anger. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adriani. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is great. See how their emotions against each other are depicted in a square circle.
