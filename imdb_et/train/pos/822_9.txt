The last film of Lucas saga is a proud, remarkable look. Often, this is considered a ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it is a 4th degree high notch (and only a notch under episodes III and V). In fact, I think this is the third best film in the 6-part saga. As for me, it's still a very fun movie. It's not a movie that has a beginning, a climax and an end; the film mechanism works with one purpose only: to bring Lucas into the universe. The whole thing is accompanied by an atmosphere that makes the film a bit too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. It's also fun. New characters are introduced and the old are facing new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 give (as usual) great comics. Find and Solo is a wonderful romantic duo and Luke is still a great feature. Again, this is the inner conflict of Luke (and Vader) that gives the spine its backbone. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very evident, and the film's loyalty, hope and redemption issues are resonating strongly. I am glad that Lucas finally gave up on the idea of ​​making episodes VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a wonderful, long-lasting, exciting and exciting saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best style.
