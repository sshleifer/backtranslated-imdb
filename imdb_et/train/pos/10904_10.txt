The most mobile and truly outstanding document ever created. I cried all the way from beginning to end. Watching an exhibition is immediately attempted by a man's affliction to live without pain, to live a life that we take for granted. The first time I heard the headline hearing that I saw this program almost fearlessly, I had a hard time understanding life in torment every day of every year of life. I really felt him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny chooses his coffin. Could you imagine it? What's more, even though he was painful and intolerable, he still opened his charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only people who deserves real respect and admiration, he is the definition of the role model, the real and unquestionable hero!
