I just saw it at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal. Located in Toronto, where the two losers live in the suppressed house in the middle of the road system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just as big as the two losers who just want the world to go. Action, dialogue and writing are great and the whole movie looks good for such a low budget flick. Director / writer Vincenzo Natali participated in this screening and he seemed so smart and underground. This man has such great stories that work so little on budgets so well that it gives a big budget to Hollywood's shame!
