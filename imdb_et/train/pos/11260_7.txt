Well, the story is a little hard to follow for the first time, but it's just for all the 70's bare-breasted vampires / witches dancing on the bongo drums. Of course, it cut off some vampire slaves. And there are some very interesting candles and their use. For girls girls, vampire or not ... this movie just rocks !!!
