I'm not quite sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie. I'm not even sure if it can be implemented. In recent years, cinemas have become full of comedy movies that are too stupid to even hurt us. That's why I thought the films that didn't meet these requirements were "serious comedies." <br /> <br /> Does a 40-year-old virgin fit into this guild? It's finally up to you to decide, but I think it's a very funny movie. You can laugh a lot, in addition, it gives a social comment through some really good stars and situations. <br /> <br /> I am pretty much more than a 40-year-old virgin, and even people who do not exactly match this specification may seem to have identified one of the characters in the movie, especially men. <br /> <br /> The story, as the title says, is Andy, a shy and quiet man, who collects performance, monitors his survivor with his eighties neighbors, and whose favorite band is Asia. <br /> <br /> Kal is Andy's partner in SmartTech. He believes Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert, but it seems that he gets what he wants with the opposite genre. <br /> <br /> David is a passionate man who is still in love with his former girlfriend. . And Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to have been affected by his constant cheating and caught acts. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure most of the 13-21 year olds have been watching this movie, but it's really no age limit. So if you haven't seen it and enjoy a little laugh, with social commentary, go to your video store and rest from these deep and depressing independent movies. <br /> <br /> It also includes DVD bonuses that you can see from the top down.
