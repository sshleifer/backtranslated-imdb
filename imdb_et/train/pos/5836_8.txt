Yes, as other reviewers have already said, it may not be L&H's vintage, but it is far from their worst job as a 20th century stupid ... I mean Fox. This movie definitely has all the basic ingredients that go wrong for boys. But this is their serious approach and determination that makes them funny. They do not play it laugh as other comedies, but they take their work and situation quite seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they face some of the key issues that we all face today, namely work-related stress. First of all, we can check out by a doctor and write a lot of necessary holidays and maybe stay by the sea. Then it comes to surreality. L&H always takes the most plausible conditions and exaggerates it, but never to an incredible point, except maybe once for some time. It makes us laugh because we can relate to their own predispositions and blackmail. This is what makes Stan and Ollie universal in their complaint. In this film, all these ingredients are cheerfully beautiful and graceful. It is not their best compared to their previous work, probably because it was the actual last film they made for Roach, because he wanted to reflect "big" studios and go to the properties only and wanted to rush and end his contractual obligations. GREAT ERROR! They should have stayed together and maybe five more years. What the world could have missed if they didn't consider it a choice. Look, laugh and enjoy it as your last great result.
