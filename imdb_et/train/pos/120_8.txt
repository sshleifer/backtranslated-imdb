It is not the job of every movie to stimulate you superficially. I take an ambitious failure in the face of the daily mass market. Although it cannot really be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This unclear quality makes me look over and over again. It is a challenging and provocative film that does not reflect things properly. The film's problem is in its structure. Its unobtrusive graph seems to be liquidating, as is the other end. Although everything is technically dazzling, this unit is just too long. The long culmination of Leo's awakening is about 20 minutes late. <br /> <br /> Great cinematic art is often at the expense of a decent script, but here the innovative camera technique offers a lot of visual ideas. The object of the composition is provocative and inclusive; The character is retrospective, but it is not in the foreground of its own hand. The imagined world is deliberate, deceptive and absurd. Keep your eyes on a memorable, technically amazing murder that will make your jaw fall. <br /> <br /> The compositions are stunning. If you selected (printed) video tape in the pan & scan format, it has never been seen. Where are the DVDs? You should see it at least once. You feel von Trier shifts more than he could chew, but this film gets richer for it. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's foreign correspondent, where uneven Europeans are also manipulating American Dupes and a number of Welles films that are joyful in technical terms. All von Trier's films are studying the difficult situation of Naif in the midst of unforgiving societies. After Zentropa, von Trier went away from such a brutal technical experiment against nervous, overpriced and subtle juices such as waves and dancers in the dark.
