The fight against the sword was out of this world, struggling with scenes that are outstanding without wire techniques (to the end) that are too common today. Chan and Pray's scene was probably the highlight of the movie. The characters of the bad boys' mansion attack were clich√©s, but the film is happy with it. Woo injecting with humor. <br /> <br /> Plots with twists and turns were unpredictable and exciting and you couldn't say who was good or bad or which sides were. <br /> <br /> A feeling of good temporary and well-timed surprise. The depth of the story is quite intense for the movie that flies this genre and reaches you most with kung-fu flicks.
