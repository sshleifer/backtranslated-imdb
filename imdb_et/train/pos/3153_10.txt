I make it short and sweet because I don't think there is really anyone about this show that has never seen it in a funny and unique, funny, and possibly funny show. <br /> <br /> You really have to look at it to understand your humor, and it took me some episodes to really get in there, but if you don't come back in. For example, the way Hydes's character always wants to see their friends in some kind of problem, the more fun it becomes. <br /> <br /> All the classics in the circle mean lies, writers, directors, the only recipe for success. One actress who thinks it's always a difficult time is Ashton Kutcher, but I think she's good at this show if I don't think anyone else has played that character Kelso. stupid. All the main characters are big and wouldn't be worth watching if I didn't mention the stone cold fox Mila Kun, now this spicy place with the ball ha ha all along with the amazing show.
