I've never commented on a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I have read the comments that say this movie will stay with you. It does. It has been almost 24 hours and I am still completely affected. This film left me questioning myself. How can I compare myself to Ben, who is completely selfless. I loved this movie. I love movies that shame me and think up to the end. I mainly feel two emotions, happiness and sadness. Amazing feeling good movie and also very sad. So I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but eventually they were forever. If you haven't seen this movie, get it and watch it. Just make sure you don't have the alarm. You want to see all its nuances. One for my library.
