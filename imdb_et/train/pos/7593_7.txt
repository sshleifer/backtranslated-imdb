The film is absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> Are you expecting a high-level intellectual movie based on the comic book Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's action is not the most mobile thing I've ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed this movie. Was it somewhere near awesome that anyone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? Not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you just took it to the surface value? Absolutely. This is a film about some of the idols of Chinese eye candies and musicians who can play basketball at an unrealistic level. There's an evil Triad-style guy and a plump schematic guy who gets Jay Chou all over. Interest in love. It's formal, but really, stop the disbelief for a while. Come on. This is called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you are logged into? Do it yourself if you look at it - I found myself with a copy of some of Engrish's subtitles that made the film an incomprehensible conversation, but we got a lot of laugh. They seem to be very fixed in Jerusalem and numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, cried, I shouted. I'll look at it again. <br /> <br /> Especially this is a fight against the scene at the bar. Well choreographed and well photographed. I especially enjoy a pool of billiards lit by plexi - I would like to play one of them. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty slippery for me, but I'm digging into the trash.
