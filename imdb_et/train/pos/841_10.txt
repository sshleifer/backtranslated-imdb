I found it to be a deeply entertaining dark comedy. Brosnan is a genius; if anyone now recognizes, he must not be in the role of a bond. Kinnear was as charismatic and funny as anyone could have been. I don't know if I laughed at any movie! What an unexpected joy! My favorite line would be "I feel like a bangkok whore on a Sunday after the Navy left city". Brosnan gave this highly binding line to such an unexpected comedy finish. I was very impressed by Hope Davis's performance. It seems that everyone in this film has branched out from its previous work to such an extent that it actually improved comedy. If you liked the dark and fun "man", it will definitely like it. <br /> <br /> I voted for 10.
