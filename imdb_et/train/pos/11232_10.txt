Okay, so during the first seasons it took some time to make special effects, but from the beginning Hidden Frontier has consistently given a good story and performances and has always been prepared for mistakes. They require people to see newer episodes first to see how good it is and to understand how much it has changed since the first episode. A fantastic marriage is cast and it shows on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of guest actor and fan-starring actors also confirms the exhibition as the story rises strongly. The exhibition has forced obstacles to different stories - depression, drug addiction and homosexuality - and they could have rubbed a few people in the wrong direction, but that is Star Trek. It depicts these story lines intelligently and emotionally, treating them finely and smoothly. Yes, they have used some of the signs of Trek's history, but they have made them right - in such a way as Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, who have been too little used in the exhibition, New Borders were born again in the books, but they lost after some time when Peter David , as more natural fantasy and serious sci-fi, and HF shows these signs in a completely different light that serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and get to know people involved. They release punches for every episode so fans can see what they are laughing at, because they do it in their spare time, with the dedication that would make many professional actors shock wide! <br /> <br /> What this series, which is coming to an end in 7 years, has achieved such amazing resources with such limited resources - the redundancy of people, the encouragement of others to do the same. The HF is living for a long time after its end, when people still enjoy the reason why it first started.
