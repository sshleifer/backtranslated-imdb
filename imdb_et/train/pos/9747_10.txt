I remember this movie when it first appeared in 1982 and loved it. About 4 years later, I was able to see Luciano Pavarotti singing at the New York Metropolitan Opera House (Tosca), so seeing the end of this film reminds me of a great evening. What's not to like about this movie? The music is great and Pavarotti (Fini) was his best and still looked great. The story is partly very funny and the "food government" scene is still one of the most fun I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight through the Napa Valley was beautiful and so the song he sang "When We Were in Love" (one of the few Pavarotti sings in English). And hearing the Santa Lucia duet is proud. Real people, this was a movie that was related to the opera singer Georgio Fini, who just happened to play Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their support roles. <br /> <br /> I am very glad that I still have this almost worn VHS tape on this movie, but I love it appearing on DVD, especially now Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think it also includes Nessun Dorma's best films, which he still sang on the movie today!
