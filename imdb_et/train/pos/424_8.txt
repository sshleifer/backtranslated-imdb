I love this movie because I grew up in racing racing. Behind Pat Boone's sulky reminds me of my father, who was pulled into the throttles, because unlike in-depth jockeys, normal and weighty men can be leaders. Yes, Indiana 1944 is a better film, but it's also a very different film. April Love is easy and easy to see, good film. (It is a disappointment that Pat Boone's religious / moral views have forbidden her to kiss a girl! Quite a change from today's standard price.) Home with Indiana Walter Brennan (filmed in black and white, with no hint that anyone will ever break the song) will fix stress and struggle better, making the end result more satisfying, but requires more emotional investment.
