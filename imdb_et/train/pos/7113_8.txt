This film is very interested in Philadelphia's suburbs and local history. This movie offers a great deal of Philadelphia in the 1940s. The city center scenes, the railway station that no longer exists, are the 30th street station that still exists, as well as scenes from the northeastern part of the city. Good pictures of old terraced houses as they appeared. The film is sometimes somewhat "threatening" - it causes the viewer to disappear in the short term ... but the overall story is solid and very touching. Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the Bright Victory movie, as well as the local film at the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has since become a university campus. Neither of these films is in any form and I can't imagine why. I have both of these at home in VHS, as shown in TCM in recent years. I recommend them elsewhere in my region outside of history.
