Wilson (Erica Gavin) has slept from the police and is sent to jail for this slick and fun example of the 70's main exploitation, celebrating Jonathan Demme's leading debut. After writing and producing some of the films by mentor Roger Cormans' New World, Demm was given the opportunity to lead for the first time and offers a film that offers not only nasty and violent anticipated and delicious doses, but also appealing to the quality of the tongue-cheek; it is often as funny as it is flashy. <br /> <br /> Stationary scenes include the mighty and raw vaudeville style for prisoners, as well as a strong queue of dreams and fantasies, a bright and apparently highly repressed superintendent McQueen (Barbara Steele's horror icon, making this marvelous act in this antagonistic role ). I also liked the bank robbery scene, which was a haywire and carjacking scene that was just daunting. As with other such films, it is commendable that it is as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation. These women are tough, they don't take garbage to anyone, and they are more than able to handle themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive cast here plays its roles: Juanita Brown as Aggie Maggie, Roberta Collins as Sassy Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as Lavelle Lovely, Gavin as a Newcomer and Lynda Gold (aka Crystin Sinclaire) complicit. <br /> <br /> As our climax plays out, the demme reaches the end of a tense "beating clock" when our heroes are flying to save Belle's lobbying by predators Dr Randolph (Warren Miller) who doesn't think anything about women Using <br /> <br /> Jumping on a John Cales delicious score, "Caged Heat" is a delightful entertainment and guaranteed time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
