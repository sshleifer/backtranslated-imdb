Steve Carrel proves to be a great leading person in this wonderful, original, fresh air. I see myself as if it was brilliantly fun. <br /> <br /> In principle, the movie's title says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man working in the electronics shop. He is a little nerd who loves video games and comics and has the biggest collection. His sons working with him discover that he is a poker game full of sexual intercourse during Virgin, and then Andy must go as funny as hate Odyessy's rude sexual awakening, but always screwed, which does not lose his innocence, but eventually gets he will finally be happy. <br /> <br /> Leave the small home, but take the whole family to see this awesome romantic adult comedy. It's hooked on you and cracked from the very beginning, and by the time it is over, you would like you to wear your very thick absorbent underwear. The only other thing I can say about this is too bad Steve Carrel wasn't recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago. The winner of the MTV Film Awards for the coming years is definitely the best competition. You can bet your hard earned dollar, people! <br /> <br /> I give it one perfect 10!
