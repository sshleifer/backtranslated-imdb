I saw True Crime when it was released for the first time in the mid-1990s, and I've been watching it several times. This is a great mystery of Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a senior high school in a California city whose classmate's younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadre who sees how bright she is, and they decide to work together to find a killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this. Real crime really feels "real" or real. I read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that there is a complete suspension of beliefs and that is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn are doing a good job, as do other players. Locations are right and the writer / director Pat Verducci really deals with the realities of teenage life and Mary's loneliness (see a scene where Mary awakens the queue after viewing photos in Tonys). I want Verducci to do more movies. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any other movie like real crime. 10/10
