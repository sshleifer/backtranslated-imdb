In addition to being one of the few films I ever teared down (this is masculinity), it is one of the most beautifully made Indian films ever made. From finely designed kits to those cast by Meena Kumari, no one can ever forget it. Pakeezah's music is amazing, all the more when you understand the uplifting poetry and is definitely one of the "OMG, 5-minute second song" movies. You know how trapped Sahibayan is among all the amazing jewelery he carries and the broken yard he accidentally passes. <br /> <br /> A parody of all the dreams you've ever had .....
