It is one of the most famous films of the seventies French sexual empowerment, playing Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles. It is also one of many dark seventies psychological dramas such as "Serie Noire", "Buffet Froid", "Beau Family", all by Blier. <br /> <br /> You would like to correct the previous comment published in the movie: the English title is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are "moving places", but the French word can be translated by the word "dancers", which is the metaphor of the testicle movement.
