I recently saw this movie in my international business class. I did not expect anything other than a boring documentary (not to say that I do not love a documentary that is just bad luck with movies of this class). Imagine your surprise when that movie, which is actually a movie, came. <br /> <br /> This film talks about all the cultural differences in the workplace and how they need to work together to get anywhere. The clash of culture shows how different the world is and how differently we perceive ourselves until someone reaches and awakens us. I'd like to recommend this movie to all the companies or just want to laugh because it's funny. Well, that's it! Greeting
