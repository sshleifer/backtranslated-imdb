... here comes the Romeo department to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me just say I was with this short film BLOW AWAY. I saw it by chance when I was at a movie festival in Boston and I thanked God for it every day. I really believe I was part of the events, as I read the Tarantino script before someone else did or saw the first screening of Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure which festival is short. or what the creative team has touched on for future products, but I hope I can have it there. <br /> <br /> Again, a truly incredible cinematic art.
