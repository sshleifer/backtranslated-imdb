A classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to the horror icon and launched the career of director Carpenter as well as the star Curtis. <br /> <br /> The seemingly uninterrupted murderer escapes from the spiritual body and returns to his hometown where he starts lurking at Halloween's local babysitter. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that will never live as a masterpiece of horror! The terrifying story of Carpenter and the smart direction give such a movie a cool cool life that really needs to be felt! The direction is often made up of simple elements, shadows, dark streets, doors that make the small town neighborhood a daily routine setting. From time to time, Carpenter has been shocked by his midnight and his strokes to make them most effective, which in itself are some of the fear filmmakers. In addition, he is smart enough to give us really nice young characters and a very scary cable to keep the tension even stronger. The highest carriers also go to Carpenter's simple but frightening music. In a way, Halloween is a great example of a perfect film of fear! <br /> <br /> Cast is great. Young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a very nice turn as a lovable babysitter, Laurie Strode, she's so good she's going to other horror movies before she gets into other big movies. The Big Donald Pleasants perfectly fill their Myer doctor, who has been desperately trying again. Loomis, Soles, Castle and others also support good. <br /> <br /> Just like Halloween's villain, he is an unstoppable force that never gets excited and fun. It's black for all genres! <br /> <br /> **** out ****
