Until I saw it special in HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I'm happy now! She's one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen! Rarely has the comedian been so immersed in his handmade as Eddie. I couldn't stop laughing at the whole show. If you want to laugh, you have to see that special!
