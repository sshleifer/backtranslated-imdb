Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who just gets out of prison at the beginning of the movie. As soon as he leaves the gates, he immediately starts working on the scheme to steal the bundle again, although this time his sights are quite high. This is actually one of the weaknesses of the movie because it doesn't know anything about computers (few in 1968), but manages to get the computer genius literally overnight! Yeah, of course. In any case, he emerges from a scheme that embodies a computer expert and works with a large American corporation so that he can finally collect cash. Given his knowledge of computers, it's rudimentary, it's amazing how he implements a brilliant plan AND can infiltrate the computer system and its defenses. But that's a movie, so I couldn't believe it. At the end of the film, he and his new husband (Maggie Smith) can reach a million pounds. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it becomes very, very confusing, and Smith announces that he actually managed to collect more than two million poor investments in the businesses that Ustinov started (although he did not know they were all seeming companies). This should mean that the stocks that were finally bought were worthless. What they are showing (and I might be wrong here) is that Ustinov and his new partners took stock quickly before knowing it, and so the stocks would be worthless. In both cases, the film seems to be posted at a magical end where no one is hurt and everyone is happy - and that just didn't make sense. It's a shame, really, when the actor and most of the writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just wonderful. <br /> <br /> If I see that it has come to an end, let me know, because at the end the film looked very vague.
