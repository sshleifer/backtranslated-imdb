I have to be honest, I was expecting a failure so bad because it really seemed like they tried to get the original movie milk to get the money. But it wasn't that funny (sometimes weird) about the movie. I loved how they spoke the story of Timon and Pumba, the story of Simba and him who had trouble sleeping was funny. Bubbles stop when the Jacuzzi and Pumba leave. It's all safe for fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will last some time because it's pretty good for live and DVD movies. Although the film does not look endlessly to the end, it works. 8 out of 10
