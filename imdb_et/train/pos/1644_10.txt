I saw the last half of this movie about a year ago and was finally very happy to find it available on DVD. Recently, I have seen several series of reality about PBS related to grazing, etc. None of them came to the story as the film works. Based on REAL reality, shots, blind, happy, tragic and enlightening films that should be shown to students or anyone interested in early boundaries. The fine by both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell adds a well-made script. The opening loan showed that it was through the National Foundation for Humanities. If it is such a product taxes could go so I would be happy to see more. I highly recommend it and encourage people to talk to a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the movie.
