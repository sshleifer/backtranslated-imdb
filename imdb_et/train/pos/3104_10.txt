This movie was great. I don't expect him to live the whole leap, but he did it. Like all Bourne movies, it is fast paced, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy, you also love it. The plot of the movie is simple and there is no change in the plots that would be too unrealistic. OK, Julia Stiles, who appears in a secure house in Italy, was somehow far removed, especially after what happened in supremacy, but it makes sense she is the only character "Treadstone" that Bourne knows she doesn't want her dead and she could trust and the only person who led him in the right direction. Action is driven by the characters and their reactions to those around them. The thing I always loved about Bourne's movies is that Bourne can hit the butt, but if it's as good as the people, he struggles to fight and takes a lot of damage. They don't treat the audience like idiots. <br /> <br /> All actors were confident in their performance. I believe Damon could play in Bourne's dream and receive excellent support from Joan Allen, who repeated his role in Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this film and trilogy. However, I miss Frank Potente.
