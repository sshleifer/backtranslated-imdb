Goldeneye is always one of the most legendary games in the history of VG. Their suspicion is not there. But this game, though quite different, may be today's Bond Champ, since then. <br /> <br /> It was not a bond game based on material from another medium. It was brand new; Scripted Game. Both had their own theme! Gameplay was great, and if you're a fan of both bond games and movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / most of the games, these cast members have portrayed their characters themselves, not playful fancy creations. What gives her a more cinematic feeling. With very "bonded" capable events, you will feel as if you are missing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish. Even after beating the game, there's still a lot to do. When you reach the leaderboard system and opening systems, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game. Despite the fact that it is quite old in the years of video games. It's still a good game that you can choose and play when you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life. Even now, I just thought I had his main song stuck. Such a great cast and well written story. The story lives on the screen almost as if the actors were in front of you and are as fun as the game itself. Greatly done, in the form of a real bond. It can only be called Awesome, Completely Awesome. <br /> <br /> I have to throw this game now. If you haven't played it yet, you're missing!
