The story of peace-loving farmers and peoples who fight for respect for the land, water, law and order, and for the long-standing respect and ultimate subjugation of their hired interests and the weapons they hired, were better (Shane) and probably in later films. well. There are some good activities and the overall layout of the story, except for the disappointing end, is well done. Law and order and religion are the roots of the city, but the order of old cattle, cowboys and gunslingers is still around. The clash between the two is done in a nicely staged loft where the townspeople go directly to the trap. Granger, an ex-gunfighter, plays this man scared by the townspeople who need his knowledge of a weapon.
