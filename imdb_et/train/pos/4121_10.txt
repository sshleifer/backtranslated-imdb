It has a tendency to get a lot of critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was great. This is an episodic multi-research study of the poorest in Tokyo, living in a city that is literally made of garbage. Although it looks just like the A-Bomb, the film has a technical color thanks to its brilliant use. The title comes from the mad young men who lead the imaginary troll through the slum. All the characters were great and all the stories binding, but perhaps the most tragic is the man and his son living in an abandoned car. When not looking for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build their dream house. Emotionally moving and beautiful film.
