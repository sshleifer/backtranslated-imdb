Best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. It's like a good TV series pilot. I even think it's a little "cult", like the magic of Quentin Tarantino or something else. They've hit a lot of Modesty's character, but I admit a bit of Willy Garwin's disappearance. Even though I've read a lot of comic books and Peter O'donnell's book, I'm not disappointed with this movie. A positive surprise about this story about Modesty and his childhood. I didn't put my expectations so high because of the bad film of 1966. So I can overestimate this movie a bit. But if you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see it! can't wait to follow up ...
