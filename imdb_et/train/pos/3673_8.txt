In 2004, I saw "true", Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it, I loved it and got excited. It became my favorite short film and made me evaluate so many formats. Of course I wanted to watch the whole movie and I would even check who's included, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw this Internet politely. <br /> <br /> First of all I have to say that it looks like YEAR. Photography is beautiful in every short and stroke, at worst it's nothing special - but still great and clear. Later I read a trick here and maybe it is how scanning in 6K gives greater justice to the whole DP work. My special favorites are the first scene of "Quais de Seine" (this sunlight!), Sin City-esquire (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14. Arrondiation" - but you know what I hell like all those : "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still makes me nervous with their brilliant colors (my eyes, trembling!) And "Quartier Latin" is gold imprisoned with silver. Beautiful, <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some BEAUTIFUL short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the content. I very much (and I mean very much) like the eclecticism I felt so successfully. You have never had the same topics or two short parties, and I think this formula is restrictive enough to make all these artists look at the short and beautiful things. I loved that I just got a love story with a crazy-chinese-musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder as a social commentary that made a humble monologue of terror comedy. I love surprises! And this movie has them! It's nice that they took the opportunity to let everyone in their directors bring out things that are not common in the usual cinema (which I have been very badly struggling with). It is not very experimental, but I can breathe the respiratory space that these people were. I like little time and I love the actor. I love simplicity and I love love. I like simple feelings and beauty and eclecticism and in general it is a movie that is very nice to see alone or with someone. Just feel. It was very good for me. <br /> <br /> There's something serious about it ... it's so sincere ... <br /> <br /> What didn't I like? Well, for me, there are two shorts that are not exactly the best - "Quais de Seine" (which is good-natured, confident and perhaps even necessary, but it seems too much like a commercial?) And "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" which though I love the actress, I felt her subjects were forced. But this is of course only me. "Tour Eiffel" I didn't love it either, but I think it's probably because of my very different sensitivity to Sylvain Chomet? I don't know if this film is of particular interest to people who already know actors and directors and they can rejoice in their communication, surprises (see Alexander Payne's funny role) and basically "what does that director do?" A big question. I enjoyed it so much. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: Most of the short pants I loved and all together formed a beautiful and energetic blend. I definitely recommend it. Definitely !!! Look at it if you like eclectic beautiful love!
