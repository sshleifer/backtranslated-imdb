This very good film tortures tension. Of course, the stakes are high - will the police and public health doctor Widmark hit criminals who do not know that they are suffering from an outbreak of a full-size epidemic? However, smaller plot elements put tension in every scene - between the Widmark and the police captain, between the poor sons between Palance and Mostel, between Palance and the man who was killed by a deadly man whom Palance mistakenly believes he is a dummy because he has smuggled some valuable goods, between Widmark and his wife, and the underlying question as to whether the public can be better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid panic. The film is also beautifully captured by Kazan, the exceptionally well-choreographed long films over New Orleans, ending in a stunning climax where Palance flees as a rat from its catchers through the city's docks and warehouses. The comment is excellent, probably the best I have heard, which includes cinematography, framing and lighting, product development, casting non-professional actors in small roles, and iron and parallelism, such as a comprehensive seminar on film techniques and films in the 1950s in general. Look at it once to enjoy the movie independently, and if you're interested in making movies, a second time with a commentary on learning.
