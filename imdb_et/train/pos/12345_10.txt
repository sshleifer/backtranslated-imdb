Kurosawa has a story that has the same diverse character as any of Shakespeare's drama, and the story is where every star plays a role as part of a larger story. It concerns, fun and intriguing in all parts. The development of characters is almost perfect, cinematography is lively and interesting, and the story draws you in. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that "Samurai freaks" and those who are embedded in the dynamics of late 18th and 19th century Japanese tales can do this film as the best work of Kurosawa. Maybe not his best, but even in his worst case, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is based on increasing the everyday life of ordinary people in a time of great change, that it is timeless, despite being placed in a non-distant past. <br /> <br /> I would like to wholeheartedly do it to all film buffers, and especially to those who are likely to continue reading the novel based on the film.
