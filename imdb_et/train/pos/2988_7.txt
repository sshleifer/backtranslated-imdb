Barbara Stanwyk's original is only recorded by Stanwyk's performance. The story and other performances are too bad and sweet movies are really enjoyable today. The Bette Midler version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, spiritual woman who gets pregnant and refuses to help her husband (Stephen Collins) or his friend (John Goodman's underestimated performance). She raises her daughter Jien, whom Trini Alvarado played so nice, and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do better for him and ultimately make a life-changing decision. There are many laughs, tears and memorable moments through the film, mainly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason, together with Jenny's wish, marks a stepmother who has proved to be very influential. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with lots of emotions, you'll enjoy the Bette Midler STELLA version.
