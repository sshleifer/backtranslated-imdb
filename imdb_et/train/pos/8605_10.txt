Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy celebrate this "contemporary" musical featuring MacDonald's comic abilities. The surreal 40-year-old musical seems to be the fashionable fun of the 40s, even if they were in the current fashion. The striking costumes and kits (yes B&W) add to the surreal, dreamy quality of the entire movie. The movie is livened up by a number of good songs, with "Twinkle in Your Eye" number highlighting, including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbr and Anne Jeffreys are also in great pain. They have also been seen in wider sections: Esther Dale, Almira Session, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtil, Cecil Cunningham and many others. your jitterbug / vamp routines. He could do that.
