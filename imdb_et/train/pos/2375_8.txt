I honestly believe it was the best war I have ever seen in the world. it was funny, but it was also an education that I learned a lot of film and if I could use it. my favorite was when the soldiers killed the robot and the other came behind it. in the world's last film war I think it should have been the first and it would have been better. but I'll give this film 2 thumbs up. <br /> <br /> And if they do, I'll definitely watch it. <br /> <br /> Thank you
