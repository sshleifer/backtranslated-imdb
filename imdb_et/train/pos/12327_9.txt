By 1987, Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's "clumsy checks" with Yun Fat's John Woo icon "Better tomorrow", "Zu Warriors" and the classic "Mr Vampire". Jackie Chan had a successful international success in the video, but it was China's ghost story that was the first real crossover theater hit in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western filmmakers had never seen anything like it. It was a film that took a number of ingredients that HK cinema had used for years (sailors, wildly choreographed martial arts and supernatural), and interfered with them to create a film that was unique in appearance, feeling and performance. Forget the poor and unnecessary aftertaste it has created, it's original and best. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching (still known as Action Choreographer on films such as Woo 'A Better Tomorrow 2' / 'The Killer') has been created under the watchful eye of the legendary producer Tsui Harki in a masterpiece of Fantasy / Horror. And with a team at its disposal (not less than 6 martial arts coordinators), the film's possibilities would be nothing more than wonderful. <br /> <br /> Stunningly Editable David Wu (who wrote / directed "Bride's White Hair 2" and edited classic titles such as "Better Tomorrow 1/2/3", "Hardboiled" and cult hit "The Club" ) is just a genius. Perfectly choreographed high flying, tree climbing sword variations make them some of the best HK movies. They are fast moving, extreme, but never confusing, even today, to the top of their art. <br /> <br /> The cinematic team has also done wonders. This is a film where every shot is a professionally designed painting. If the wonderful blue colored night sequences surrounded by the ever-present ghostly mist are our story discovering. This is a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty. Even Hsiao Zinc-worn silk garments and dresses become live parts of the film, be they romantic and battle scenes. Even the simple scene where Hsiao Tsing changes clothes has become more beautiful because the skill of each set combines the most memorable scene with such a simple law. The kits are also amazing, giving the forests a second world-wide thought and the temple and the harshness of the burned, flagged hell of the century's amazing finale. Zhongwen X's production design deserves the greatest praise. <br /> <br /> Another great factor in film success is the music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong movies have given us fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of the sequence, but the music on "Chinese Ghost Story" is simple. From the opening song, the music is as important as the characters. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect blend of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, watches and guitars are bouncing across action sequences, but they are slower, painfully romantic pieces that they own. Here; Flutes, String Instruments and Female Core Effects create what is the best piece of music on HK movie. Add this female vocal, an amazingly beautiful song that plays over the love of Tsau-shen and Hsiao Zinc (nothing can ever be seen, but the effect is wonderful. It's a lovingly innocent movie romance) and you have a brilliant example of power movie music can be . <br /> <br /> Of course, we also have talent. Leslie Cheung ("Better tomorrow 1 & 2" and a very popular singer) is outstanding as an innocent tax collector. His work (luckily light) in the comic is never up and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who later was mostly humiliated to support roles in movies like Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau's classic "God of Gambling") has never seen faster than he does here. She is an exhibition of essential beauty. His idea of ​​the tragic Hsiao Zinc is stunning. He shows the sadness of his characters about what he has done and what he does, but also gives the scenes a subtle eroticism, where he attracts men to their bad deaths. Veteran actor Wu Ma ("Mr. Vampire", "Swordsman") is very fun as smart, brave, but never so harsh, Yen. She runs between eccentric and tedious and practicing ease. And what just might have been a movie that could have harmed the movie is actually wonderfully fun and memorable. <br /> <br /> But monsters and beasties ?, I hear you cry. Well, they go from a raw but fun staging movement / animatronic zombie living in the temple (which results in a big running gag with constantly interrupted trials with a harshly unsuspecting Tsau-shen), rather exciting but surprisingly effective Lord Black. Complete with an arsenal of wicked flying heads and quite prominent wire work. Most of them have never been before. <br /> <br /> But the most striking effect and creation is the language of the killer of the spirit of the tree. First of all, we meet this thing with the "Evil Dead" style, rushing into the camera effect, as it falls under the victim's throat to offer a deadly French kiss that makes victims zombie-sex. But later it has been shown in all its mad glory. It can grow so big and long so that it catches the forest after the harvest, the trees split, the buildings and rolls that are slippery around people before they pick up and cast them against the tree species! It can even unlock to expose the mouth filled mouth! It's an outrageous idea that a deeply romantic main plot shouldn't work. But it has a fantastic and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> So what all this adds is a classic example of Hong Kong movies. Real teamwork that has given us a truly groundbreaking movie. This is a film full of nonsense, invention, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, lush visions, beautiful music, and most importantly, a lasting charm, one cinema that moves the most.
