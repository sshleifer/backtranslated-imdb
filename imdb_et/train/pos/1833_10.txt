The main goal here is, Aditiya (Kumar) is a millionaire spoiled son, Ishwar (Bachan), who owns the toy industry, Ishwar's son Aditya can't do anything wrong, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar's son on a responsible path before being it's too late because Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and has only 9 months to live when his son lives and marries Medal (Chopra), Ishwar gives Adity a good deal of forgiveness, but when a happy couple Aditya and Medal come back from the honeymoon, Medal is pregnant and forcing Isharit kicking out of Aditya's house to take more responsibility, Aditya doesn't know her father is suffering from lung cancer, and she doesn't know that her father has thrown her out of the hose to make her more responsible, Ishar can't bring her high up to Adity he dies with a hungry and pregnant woman. it is a race with time so Aditya does everything she can to prove her father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets her big break in the film industry and her father tells her she's going to die. br /> This film is absolutely brilliant, it is a breakthrough in the Indian cinema that was necessary for the Bollywood industry, Shah's leadership is almost flawless, but what's wrong with the film? The best part of this film is the relationship between the father's son, a tear. the spacing of the song is just right, the landscape is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Iran and Rajpal Yadav are too long and a bit annoying, but in general it's a brilliant film, I suggest that someone read this review to go and see it despite the other reviews. 9/10
