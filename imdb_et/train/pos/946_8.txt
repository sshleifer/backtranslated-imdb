Since Christmas celebrations have evolved over the years, whether they focus on religious or secular traditions, it is a time when people should behave a little better. It has somehow slid over the 19th century London Ebenezer Scrooge, a merchant and a money lender. <br /> <br /> As his nephew points to his uncle, he does not hold Christmas in any way, because Scrooge knows the whole thing is humbug. Scrooge's humanity had long been pulled out, it is a tough case, much like his 20th-century colleague, Mr. Potter from Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens told this story, redemption is not too late for us and the lonely ghost and the three spirits visit Scroog and show him how. <br /> <br /> Christmas Carol is a timeless holiday class that we sometimes forget that it is as much a 19th century UK social comment as Oliver Twist. The characters in this movie are middle and lower classes. Cratchits are a couple inclined over Oliver Twist Street people, but they have to fight to stay there. Still love and happiness radiate your home, thanks to the work of Bob Cratch. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did a lot of good in his life and just had to remember how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed to wake up to get the benefits he has made in this area. the old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart has taken over Scrooge in his live shows and filmed game. But George C. Scott hits the old movie pretty well. It makes sense, but because of the trace of sadness that drives us to change. Scott joins fine traditions, such as Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, both of which have made Scrooge's excellent interpretations. <br /> <br /> Among the supportive roles I enjoyed being a joyful and Christmas spirit by David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of the 32 Christmas arcade versions that have archived and is one of the best.
