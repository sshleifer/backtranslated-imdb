One of the ten best comedies. It seems like a comedy that is so cheerful and easy to sing. Keaton's comedies have been carefully, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought. Amazingly amusing, deliberately delightful and inventive, THREE AGES should be included in ten comedy drafts when I sketch one. The triple love story fascinates viewers; Do I want to bring this approach here? Keaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINY upside down or BO REBOURS. Again, in the waters of the ages and ages, a couple are moving through the Stone Age, Rome and Keaton times in the Mohammedan country, the Renaissance in Italy and China. The same device works in both movies, one gloomy, terrible melodrama; - Another, light, virtual? In Keaton it is essentially the same pair; and maybe the same is with Lang. Buster and Beery desired babe is great. I've found THREE AGES well-written and intelligent without being proudly complicated; The plot is basically very POPEYE like a kid's piece of furniture, the only protagonist being two male competitors Keaton and Beery. <br /> <br /> The Keaton movie is just very pleasant and perhaps one would be tempted to assure that it looks like ambitious fun? but it is not, but it is great fun, great fun, enough fun. And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis.
