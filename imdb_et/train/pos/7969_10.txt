Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. I know that the part where Shadow falls under the ditch ... I cried *, because I was just six, I cried! it takes me a lot to cry me! Dogs and cats are well trained. A nice family film, * not * completely hardened to a fluffy person or animal-to-wrestler, but can be a soft-crap a.k.a. for people like me. <br /> <br /> Good movie, 10/10,
