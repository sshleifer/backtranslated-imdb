I saw this movie in 1959 when I was in my family with an 11-year-old theater. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was very funny. . . Although I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful movie such a joy! I saw it this morning in the south of Turner. When I looked at it, I was completely laughing! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic of age. If you are too young to experience the fascinating time of this movie, I feel very sorry. Such a movie cannot be seen and understood as they can (even today) offer such a pleasant part of the sky to "old timers" like me. <br /> <br /> That's all I can do with respect, so younger people refrain from commenting on movies like "Mating". <br /> <br /> Such films were made for a generation that preceded your current group. And as such, these films speak a very different language when one understands you. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? If you do not understand the questions about the film, don't worry about yourself by providing comments on what? to be honest? No point.
