This is a great movie. A lot of combinations are cast and the story is decent. The film is essentially about a well thought out doctor who steals the bodies of the dead bride and takes them home. When the bodies are in his home, he removes stuff (I don't want to use that general term, but I forget what he had removed) and puts it on his wife to keep his youth. Then the situation is investigated by the reporter, Patricia Hunter, and begins to find out why the brides were dying. He visits a doctor's house and interesting things begin to happen. Be sure to check out this parent, but good if you can.
