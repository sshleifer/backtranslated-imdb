What outstanding film is what I do not describe. I don't know how the movie's rating is 7.3, it should be 9.3, but anyway no one else can do this movie and Akshay's action is just outstanding. a good unexpected end that makes the movie ideal. you should watch this movie once, I think twice that it is u. Anyway I love this movie and it's not just sad and funny, but it also gives u a really good meaning and what u should do, I think it's one of the best movies in Bollywood history. but i know people have deferent chooses so. the only thing i don't like about this movie is the music well, the background music is good, but the songs aren't good enough, i think the music would be better if AR Rahman would be the music director, but we can't do anything about it so ya .
