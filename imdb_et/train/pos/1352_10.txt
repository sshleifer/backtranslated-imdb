Never look at this movie and consider it a great classic with great veteran artists. At the time of making this film, people in America were different, there was no TV or all the modern things, except for getting started with the great movies made by Radio and Hollywood. Lovely romantic stories between young girls or boys were looked at differently than today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet", 44 played a young orphan who was called red hair because of red hair and found himself in the home of two older people who were like two clever owls and watched over by Ann Shirley. . It was a small town and everyone knew everything and, when something happened, the whole city got to know it in a few minutes. It's a down-to-earth movie that has nice, decent people trying to live each other in a very simple way. Today it looks like a corn ball and a fool, but believe me, this was how people were in America in 1920. & 30s and they were great generations who loved good family movies.
