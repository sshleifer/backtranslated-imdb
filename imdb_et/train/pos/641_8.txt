This show has some clich√©s and a couple up, moments like Dawson Creek (16-year-old who talks back when life made sense?), But in general it seems to be a decent show. Most of the signs seem to be very real, and the story seemed to be moving well, eventually ending up with a good lesson. I just hope that every episode is not life-changing like the first, which would be too much drama for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a teenager with passion for baseball, I believe many of us could be associated with his awe and sometimes with the vision of a tunnel for a team he always wanted to get involved.
