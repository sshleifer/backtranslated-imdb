In a small town country, a meteorite enters the jelly. The old alien is attacked by an old farmer and young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his friend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) are being driven by dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully treats the blister and asks Steve to find out where they found the old men. When Steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and residents, but no one believes them, while the blemish involves many people, getting bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> Blob is a cult and classic sci-fi. It's a low-budget movie with lots of ham actors and actors (except Steve McQueen), terrible effects, but also delightful and very, but very funny. This is the first time I see this classics (I had seen the 1988 relocation with Kevin Dillon) and I would recommend it to Steve McQueen fans and 50's sci-fi B movies. My review no 1400 movie theme couldn't be better. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
