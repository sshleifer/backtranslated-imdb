The best show from Seinfeld. She's really funny. His complete self-focused, stray gay stoner neighbors, leaving for singing or cartoons make it the most recent TV. One of the few examples I look at. A style where a wise pharmacist's old black lady ("wait now, you're close, you see an old one" with a finger on your face and walks away from the bed), a cough syrup overdose that sleeps with God. So stupid, it's just fun. The weak points shown are his sister and cop because they are too normal !! I really can't wait until the next example, something I haven't known for a long time.
