"The Woman in Black" is easily one of the largest British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer, after the arrival of a small town with the legacy of a deceased customer, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed in black. with an extremely frightening atmosphere and a calculation of fears and the maximum possible effect. The activity keeps the viewer deeply involved and the final is quite disturbing. Working is great and the tensions are from time to time almost intolerable. So if you want to see a really horrible horror movie give it one look. I dare to look at "Woman in Black" alone at night when the lights are off. Highly recommended.
