Well, after a long wait after seeing some clips from Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I had been waiting for this movie a long time ago. The plot was a simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is moving into an apartment building that is the gateway to hell. Sentinel is a creepy creepy movie, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mixture of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. Action is good, and there are some really distracting bits, such as an uncomfortable orgy with a dead father and a plump woman in the middle of an orgy eating a cake and laughing at the end is a strange mixture of deformed people and cannibals. It's very strange, campy, but in the end, I really believe in a big movie! One of my 70's favorites, even if it's not very original. It's crazy and extremely horrible! Probably one of my all-time favorites. 9/10
