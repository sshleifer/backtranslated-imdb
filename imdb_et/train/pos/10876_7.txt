I was really excited about seeing this movie. I thought that finally Australia had made a good movie. But I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was the most pathetic attempt ever to film. I'm sorry Molly Ringwald had to go to Australia for a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The show was terrible (especially an Australian man who tried to speak on an American accent) and Krund was also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard out of this movie, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like a cheesy movie "Stab" Scream 2), but I was a good movie and wants to slip it. <br /> <br /> WARNING! MAIN SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie was the end. I was expecting a great surprise about who the killer was ... but the killer wasn't even a human being. This made this realistic movie a very terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. You are probably disappointed!
