I remember this movie on television a few years ago and did not pay full attention, maybe even the absence of the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and overestimated. I decided to look at it again last night to see if I had taken it for the first time. I certainly did. It is one of the most annoying and astonishing films of all time and has clearly influenced films today and probably forever. I can't believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give their career performances and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story leaves you feeling disgusting and fearful when you look at it, it's really terrible. Oh, and did I mention that his song is great? Well this is, and this movie should be seen by film fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie for this experience. Just wait for the picnic.
