"Ah Ritchie has made another Gangster movie with Statham" thought the average fan was waiting for another Snatch / Lock Stock; waiting maybe a couple of time shifts, but not too little for me and the boys to swallow some beer. <br /> <br /> Ah, pay attention, you have to watch this movie. No cups of tea, no extra cooking casserole, no "keep it running" when you slide in the fridge - watch the movie! Nothing else to laugh apart from what you can do from violent violence (and if it is on your boat, so it is), but with a sharp solid direction, great dialogue and great performances. <br /> <br /> My favorite - Big Pussy from Soprano, always a reliable hood.
