Okay, this movie is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks, it's one of the most charming, most enjoyable movies you'll ever see as a child. It's an unforgettable movie about two adults and two bright children for fun. It may be a bit negative to look at, but try it, I don't think it was bad, I was very enthusiastic about film and animation, everything was pretty good. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderfully wonderful comedy for the whole family; even kids. Young people aged 7 and over will enjoy this wonderful, musical comedy with you and your family, especially animation. Animation movements and placements are really nice and worthy of thumbs. This is amazingly good music for the whole family, what are you waiting for? Go to the video store and rent Bedknobs and Broomsticks NOW.
