Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is a film whose only Ralph Bakshi is allegedly satirical accusation of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a glimpse into the life of black in modern America (for today) modern, i mean - 1975). Paramount fell like a hot potato that just burst into the flame. <br /> <br /> But this is Bakshi's film, controversial, exciting and black-and-white almost alone. Not just another casual "shock-jock" movie that is trying to shock after a shock. That's Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that when he made the movie, he has something to say ... <br /> <br /> Although its roots are based on cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not another camping call for a white-colored film or some other impact. "Coonskin" wants to be more. It aims to create higher attractions and much larger fish. <br /> <br /> The film is not a fun genre. Nor does it simply dispute black people, but it seems to show love, beauty and heart in strange places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells a story about some of the convicts who are waiting in prison. The fact that the "Coonskin" world alone can break out of prison makes it old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> One of the inmates speaks of Black Brother Harlem called Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox, who wants respect and some of this activity and is ready to get it with the necessary tools. Itallian mob is all real activities. <br /> <br /> A great name for black musicians: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright who takes Pulitzer home. Obviously something big happens here. <br /> <br /> The film plays such a world as it does on the racial divide. An angry, clean, deep, spiritual black man who hates his heart and gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi movies never know the meaning of the word "sublety". It looks like this word has never heard. But perhaps this kind of issue needs extremism. A true rapper satire. Some topics cannot be resolved gently. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is a godly merciless. There doesn't seem to be any member of the Harlem scene or minority here. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" "real", depending on the mood and the situation. Animated characters and human beings share the same reality and are meant to be literally. <br /> <br /> Bakshi doesn't just show ugly cartoons for shock computers. He always has something to say. Black face is also not free. Here, unlike Spike Lee's "Bamboozled", he seems to be using it to say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi movies, it includes animation and live action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just a trick here. All this technique is intertwined with each other, saying something. <br /> <br /> Somehow it seems inevitably dated. Many of these types of films (including Bakshi) are very topical, very current. They reflect the firm trend of the day, but looking at them many years later, it is just a mistaken feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth). <br /> <br /> Although music, clothing, slang and the city look like pictures that belong to the time capsule, the attitude, spirit and heart remain the same, no matter what the f - king ear is. Anyone who has really seen the movies, the state of affairs and the people, knows what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Even some black characters are bunny (junglebunny), big bear and fox. One of the sourest and most unpleasant racist characters is the dirty Harlem policeman who, after "police" death, is hot on their "dirty n ---- - d" track. But for him it's not just a business. Nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure for black patients. <br /> <br /> The order of the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving parts of the movie, many of which are. It plays like an opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> promo line: WARNING: "This movie offends everyone!" It's not just a leap. Continue with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
