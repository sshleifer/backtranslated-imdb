Unfortunately, this movie didn't make a DVD. I saw it first appeared in theaters in 1983 and when VHS appeared in 1992. When I recently saw a copy of VHS in the church market, I bought it right away. I was not disappointed. First, obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and joy to see. But then, the film takes you to an unrealistic world where you have to think about your values ​​and decide what is important to you. There are many things in the movie. This is about how the World Bank and big companies use developing capital to their capitalist schemes and enslave them to force them to pay the debt they can never repay. This is how our economic system exploits us, forcing us to pay by credit cards, mortgages and car payments. It's about rescuing the innocence that maybe we've never received and maybe we can't really save. It is about good and evil and how difficult it is sometimes to tell others. This raises many questions but does not provide answers. I think sometimes it's good. For this reason, this movie is what really needs to be saved and seen.
