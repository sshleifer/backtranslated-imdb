Incredible little English movie for so many reasons. First of all, this is a rare example of a light comedy by Laurence Olivier. Though his performance is not the standard he set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is completely believable as an imprisoned barrister. Historically, this film is very interesting both where and when it was. As an English language, he did not have a huge budget for Hollywood films of the same era, and it often shows, but the film that has been filmed just before the war and shows England that soon went off is more interesting. When we look at it today, we think of contemporary morality and, from a general perspective, this film and its closest American counterpart, "It Happened One Night", were in their days as the "Fatal Instinct" of our time. But after watching and enjoying this movie for the first time, I can't help but feel sad when I look at it today. If half of the film has disappeared before 1950, the rest of the movies will be difficult choices, and unfortunately, such movies often move to record movies, which we all consider important. Color displacement, lack of contrast, and overall poor print quality are the heartbreak. This movie with "It Happened One Night" is perfect to curl with the love that has arisen during the cool night and look, or better, why not double the function.
