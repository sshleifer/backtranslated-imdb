Zombie Bloodbath is a film made by zombie fans whose true love is the Horror genre. As I understand the comments and reading things, it was during the massive Midwest flood of 1993, when half of Missouri was underwater. The buildings were under water. cars and houses were underwater. In one article, it was said that zombies and the team of this film would help the river after shooting every day. The fact that this film has been made is a miracle. It's like a huge disguise for a zombie movie ever made with a thrombus filter. It's a movie to enjoy with friends who like crusts and fools. And it's fast paced and energetic and really funny. <br /> <br /> The toxic side effect of a nuclear power plant causes people to melt or zombies. The local government covers it, tears it in the factory and builds it around. Some Ground Circuits (?) Causes the Cave to Opening, and Some New Residents find the cave and unleash the undead in the newly built community. From there it will just be crazy and fun and fun. <br /> <br /> I've read these comments a few times here. And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this funny little movie three times in a different view, using fake names. They use the same words and phrases. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It's raw. He has some bad behavior. So do half of the movies. There's a lot of worse out there than this fun movie. If you hate this movie so much, don't buy it. Personal attacks are not necessary and call the crew or cast a "Trailer Trash". And it is obvious that you are not from Australia or England. It's just annoying that this great service, IMDb, doesn't catch people who use it, just in the other trash bin. There are bad comments and good comments and I don't mind them. I'll give you both bad and good comments. But it is painfully obvious that some fools want to use this forum only to attack the director of this movie. Sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "reviewers" even dig their "review" for advertising their own films. It's called this movie boring - well, love it or hate it, one thing that can never be said about this movie is that it is boring. It moves quickly and is never boring. <br /> <br /> Oh and this reviewer from the Netherlands ?? Um - LIAR. You tried to post this same view on Amazon and it was there. SAME only looks at it coming from Missouri. <br /> <br /> It's pointless to stop. Love it or hate it - give it a real overview or write something. It's obvious that you haven't seen the movies. <br /> <br /> But I have this record, and although it is not nearly the best I've seen, it's not the worst. And even the worst thing I would give to the actual REVOEW and not attack the director personally. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will help some people see stupidity here.
