It was a wonderfully crafty and entertaining movie that I would never see many, many times. Casting was great for matching young people with older characters. Here are those who really appreciate the good actors and the intelligent story. As far as Judi Dench is concerned, she is a beautiful and gift for any production she celebrates. I always have to think about Judi Dench in all his performances. He is a great actor and a joy to see if every transformation of his character lives. I can only be grateful for seeing such an outstanding picture for most of the recent films that lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The film's public needs heroes, not deviant manicures, lacking ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this film win the prizes it deserves. Thank you again for the great entertainment night. I congratulate the writer, director, producer and all those who did such good work.
