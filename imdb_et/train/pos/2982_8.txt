I enjoyed this flick thoroughly. I'm sure Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comics of our time. They have an unpleasant ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it nervous but realistic ... if that makes sense. This is what makes South Park so much fun. If you have passed the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and uncertain caricature ever, you will see the message being transmitted during each episode. This is evident in the BASEketball. Although it is led by David Zucker and it is completely superfluous, he has a sincere message about the company of America and the disgrace that is great sport. I am also a fan of sport, so I find this movie to be a lot of fun at times, because it's so strange that people hate love. The opening prologue is great ... tears of laughter every time I see these footballers start Riverdance! Some may not like such a movie because it's not just everyone's tea pot ... but like South Park, when you look at absurdity ... it has a truly real message that is transmitted in the word comedian genius. I gave this movie out of 10 out of 10.
