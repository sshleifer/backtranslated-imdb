I have to say I loved the point of disappearance. I've seen the original and it's pretty good for this remake. Although it didn't follow the original story (that's why I gave it to 8 out of 10), it was pretty good and it is probably a better story. <br /> <br /> As far as the car is concerned, the DJ's comment on the Challenger, which goes to the bulldozers at 185 mph, is quite unlikely (And if you look, the speedometer needle slips at 145-150 Â° C), but although I didn't see any scene at the start of the engine where they show the engine, the original style was full of Hemi, so it's possible. For those who say that aerodynamics does not allow it, today the traditionally aspirated Chrysler 300C can go 168 km / h, and if you look at this thing, you drive it on the road, it's like brick pushing through the wind through the 70th mph. In addition, in a wind tunnel test, if you put an air bag on Challenger, it would probably be more aerodynamic.
