The imprisonment of the wrongly imprisoned prisoner who was imprisoned was an electric shock and killed the random prisoners waiting for him to revenge the man who was in the frame. <br /> <br /> Viggo Mortensen is great and the actor is very good and the actor is generally good. Lane Smith is a delicious sore like a culprit. This film also has some great times, including death by mummification of the barbed wire.
