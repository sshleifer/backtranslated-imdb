I was so impressed by Doug McGrath's Jane Austen's novel Emma's film version, and I loved Rachel Portman's music score so much that when I went to a video store one day and discovered they were reunited with "Nicholas Nickleby" I rented it immediately without any other consideration . <br /> <br /> I have read this book and for those Jane Austen's adaptation to too critical fans I do not know what else McGrath could have done better to grasp the spirit of Miss Austen's work and the main elements of the plot, especially considering the two-hour movie restrictions (some have complained too long!). As for Gwen Paltrow's accent, I have to admit that I wasn't very familiar with him when I first saw it in the theater, and I was absolutely sure he was an English actor! <br /> <br /> Those who have criticized the film for their lush landscape are surprised. This is one of the things that I enjoy and look forward to seeing in an English countryside period. The beautiful backgrounds of the film are a great contribution to its appeal and success. If your idea of ​​an escapist ticket is brighter then maybe you should rent something "Death Wish III!" <br /> <br /> The English state settings are as attractive and captivating as the cast and combined story and entertainment file that won't let you tire of repeated views. McGrath is a miracle to chore the synergy of fine expressions that are so important in conveying the intricate romantic intrigues in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing film can also be a clinic that shows how enjoyable the film is. minus sex, violence or even a buggy antagonist. The story is often amusing, loving and sometimes quite touching. <br /> <br /> I have seen many competent adjustments to Jane Austen's book, but this is undoubtedly my favorite.
