Changing the prospects is necessary to enjoy today's British films, which allows them to look at their own and their own qualities rather than the criteria for evaluating American films. Britfilm must strive hard and it is difficult to do so, but it is possible for a warm British movie to be driven by an otherwise overwhelming competitor. <br /> <br /> This movie is not in its content, but only in its own forerunner, so it's all visible as the work of stars and directors somewhere near their end-of-life. It has been a few decades later, Gregory taught and this time two girls in her mind. He teaches human rights violations in his school room. If the students she has dismissed find her abuses in the middle, she has to face whether she is just talking about everything. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive film that states that you shouldn't do what it takes to do it, but with a naive guy who can basically all. Maybe. However, it is certainly not a protest, too warm. If the US film may seem realistic because they are urban and sharp, these and other British films of recent years - those who are not trying to match America with visceral excitement - are real, because British humor reveals the truth.
