One of the great things about many amazing Chinese movies you can find when you're happy is in video shops to see if they are very accurate repetitions of real stories. Goodbye, my husband, emperor and assassin and this movie are perfect examples. Filmmakers make a real story and work hard to create a movie without making dramatic or commercial comforts - featuring many Hollywood and especially Disney films. <br /> <br /> In this story, we follow this famous local street artist in later years as the master of masks, the master of Sichuan. Losing his only son many years before, he is looking for a male heir to continue his rare and dying art in a society that prohibits women from doing such work. Master Wang is sold to his son by a slave dealer. Everything is fine when she gladly prepares her art to pass on. But the son has finally become a girl. It will be a very interesting story, performed by Sichuan Opera Master Lian - the regional opera style of Beijing opera. Fans of Farewell My husband should carefully look at the image of Master Lian, which deals with the female role in Chinese opera. It can help them realize that their female roles players were probably not homosexuals or castrates, but people who are so psychologically conditioned that they are not fully aware of their sexuality.
