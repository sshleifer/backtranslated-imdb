My 2-year-old loves showing Doodlebops, he seems to keep his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, lively and the basic colors and everything. There is not much educational content that the target audience could benefit from, but it seems that they have a theme for each exhibition and are trying to teach children about sharing and respect and other basics so I like it. It is well produced with high product value. But it is really just an average exhibition like most TV shows these days. We do not buy the corner and our son carries everything Dooblebop. I don't think we would spend money on going to a live show when they ever came to town. Going to a zoo or research center is a much better experience for all involved and I think it is better to spend money.
