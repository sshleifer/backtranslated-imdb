Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most talented and reviewed comic actors of the last twenty years, returns Dooley, the film's detective. <br /> <br /> If you expect the same from the first movie, you're disappointed, but it's still a good movie. Realizing that all of the dog and human battles in the test scenarios were probably used in the first film, it becomes a little more psychological in its approach, because it focuses on a criminal whose fixation is Dooley's recently deceased husband after rejecting his book and blames Dooley for his death. <br /> <br /> The script may not be the best, but the film will allow both Belush and Christine Tucci to show their good performance while maintaining a sufficient amount of humor. the first film that makes it work, and the chemistry between the two stars is visible to everyone. <br /> <br /> A simple, easy going movie that may not be worth buying if you're not a real fan of either the first movie or Belush, which is definitely worth watching on the TV. <br /> <br />
