On the surface, this post-war romantic comedy is above average. Under plywood is the MGM character's actress stunt-casting her most funny. <br /> <br /> Wires are simple, but all secondary parts are mostly against type. Margaret Hamilton (aka Wicked Witch of West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive compulsive budget) and Sig Ruman (Marx Brothers inNight in Casablanca_ and always wonderful _Night at The Opera), playing well wanted to reach both wires, instead of driving them side by side because their "normal" characters would do. <br /> <br /> It is also fun for many romantic comedy conventions, which is another sign that it may be so "straight" romantic comedy, because it is sending many post-war romantic comedies and their two-dimensional stock characters . <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once, with interruptions, so I can't be positive, but this movie can be one of those that worked better at the time it was made, but it is less successful now that viewers see these secondary signs through a completely different lens. I expect this to be the case when I give it 9 letters. I thought it was hysterical.
