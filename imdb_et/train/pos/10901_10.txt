This is probably the best documentary I've seen for a long time. Jonny Kennedy was and still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. He was not only one of the most painful survivors of survival, but he used his beauty to show the world that life is after death and never to let people go and spread his love. Looking at his life's long struggle for minutes, it was heartbreaking. Listening to his smart associations and looking at his divine gestures was warm from the heart. And his smile was unintelligible. I feel blessed to be touched by this little giant. Please, if you ever have the opportunity to watch this movie - feel happy to have met Jonny Kennedy.
