It is an early Sci-Fi movie that shows the imaginary world or "Everytown" through 100 years. You can break up into about four different scenes or parts. The film dates back to 1940 until 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or "Boss" wanted to fly again after Everytown was bombed and the war broke out. <br /> <br /> Only this movie has about 3 errors: it is dim and the sound is some, no characters at all, the general plot is not at all certain. There's nothing on the plot that I can't put on my finger ... it just seems a bit fluffy. But if you love sci-fi and are interested in what H.G. Wells can happen in the next hundred years, it must be visible. It is worth noting that you would know what everyone is afraid of: a long, drawn-out war, because they were soon going to war with Germany and the threat of biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> The things that come are a pretty good movie that most people have to see once.
