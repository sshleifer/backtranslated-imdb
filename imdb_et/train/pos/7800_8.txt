I first saw this movie when I was about 13. That blew me then and in many aspects it still does. But I'm less inclined to see it as an accurate historical work now. Little effort has been made to investigate and interact with racism - and so it is not recognized that the strongest anti-racism weapon is for the most important people who commit it. Instead, it is a dichotomy - on the one hand the vision of the beak and the forests in the 3D panorama of the panorama - on the other hand, the two-dimensional symbols are unapologetic as meaningless evil. <br /> <br /> All of this makes the movie a big story, but I'm concerned that people see the image as "accurate."
