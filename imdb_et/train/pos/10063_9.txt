Filming is pleasant and the environment is very realistic. I liked it to boldly improve the encouragement of many complex moral and social concerns and basic human issues in China and the continent in the 1930s - I felt like I was getting real-time lessons, re-created even in the purist images of stunning traditional Chinese frames and street life. It seemed useful to experience. The role played by the Buddhist game is probably the most realistic - in both its humble and philosophical aspects, perhaps the most effective I saw in Chinese film. Casting is great. Pictures are memorable. Operation is strong enough. Thematically puer, but still rich enough to compliment this expression.
