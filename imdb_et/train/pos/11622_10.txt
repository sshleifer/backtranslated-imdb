Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams celebrate the action / thriller that was written and directed by the temporary champion Wes Craven. The whole movie starts with some problems with the Miami Atlantic hotel. All the hotel manager Lisa Reisert solves the problem. Then he goes to the airport and it starts all the trouble. He meets Jackson Rippner who doesn't like being called Jack Ripper when you know him and I mean. Then they get on board and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. Over the next half hour, Rippner terrorizes, tortures and scares Lisa. I'm not giving anything away. Then we move on where Jack runs to the airport at the airport. Then go Add to his house to see if his father is okay, and painfully, Rippner is already there. Throughout this scene, almost 12 minutes of violence and intense intensity. All in all, about 25 minutes of intense activity will come to an end. <br /> <br /> Not only was the film intense, it also had a large plot. As I said, I do not give anything because it is so shocking and exciting and somewhat disturbing / frightening. And the behavior of every character in each movie, even those that don't have any features at all, was perfect. It was incredible. Everything was fantastic in this movie! Functional, music, effects, makeup, leadership, editing, writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely a stopover. Red Eye is definitely invisible and definitely worth your money. You could watch this movie over and over and it would never be boring. <br /> <br /> The red eye that I have to say is better than 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA rating: PG-13: some intense violence and language sequences <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13: some very intense violence and language sequences <br /> < br /> My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Scary Scenes, Disruptive Content
