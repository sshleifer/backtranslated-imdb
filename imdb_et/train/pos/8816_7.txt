Given the nature and origin of 11 cinematographic works, it is not surprising that this film is the best neutral from the American point of view. Probably the most "given" segment is Ken Loach, who certainly won't pull the British new workforce. Although the events that took place a year ago are shocking and painful for most Americans, and most spectators who saw them live through CNN, etc., most writers and directors decide that the tragedy is not an American monopoly. If anyone were to be surprised that these 3000 deaths were given the same weight elsewhere, then in the West thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnian, Chilli, Kurdish (we need) victims are given. If it were a call for states to wake up, it would be tragic that, in the next 12 months, the deadlock on Israel and Palestine would be resolved, while George Bush Jn. would rather be revenge than made the world safer. I think many supporters think about where the idealism of founder fathers went and why, as a bastion of freedom, justice, and tolerance built for America, now sees the utmost importance of self-interest, while the third world admires where the next drink, food or ball comes from.
