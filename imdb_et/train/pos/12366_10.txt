Wonderful movie, one of the best horror movies in the 70s. He has realistic settings and atmosphere. As usual, the usual negative comment was inevitable. I have noticed that most of the horror films of a certain period of time cannot even achieve sufficiency. Obviously, the fact that most horror films are old and must be denigrati is like a spiritual mechanism that moves the potential of music critics here. <br /> <br /> Before reading, you already knew what the final decision was. The movie is a good gift because 10 is really well done. Raines reads quite well and the film, as a way of producing it, reminds me a lot of Kubrick's films. He's really impressed. Great movie really. I think the anthology of the film has been for years70.
