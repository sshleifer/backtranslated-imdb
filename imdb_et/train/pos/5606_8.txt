It is a very difficult film and almost impossible to get a grip on what's going on. At first it seems that this is rather a pedestrian filmman (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and rather calls himself when the current tenant (woman) suicides. Then the turns start. Are neighbors trying to kill him? And why are dead tenant clothes in the apartment? Finally, he doubts whether Trelkovksy is the previous tenant. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks Polanski pulls us to lie. We expect to see things from the perspective of what we see in things like a character, and that there may be distortions in reality. Let's assume that the camera shows us things from every possible perspective that we see reality - but Polanski is wrong with us.
