"Zabriskie Point" beautiful new edition plays in Paris and seems to be well in the Latin Quarter. It is time for a full evaluation of the film. We hope that the new edition means that in the near future there will be a DVD with some reasonable "extras". <br /> <br /> I remember watching ZP when he came out and thought it was crashing. This time I was completely scared and classified it as a "almost missed" masterpiece. The first part of the film is the time capsule I lived there in the late 60's in Los Angeles, and Antonion made a masterful job of capturing the nature of the place. Knit to the production designer Dean Tavoularis, who found some incredible places and did great work. <br /> <br /> I saw printing for 1 hour 50 minutes. Under the age of 16 (or 18 years old, I don't remember) is forbidden. I suspect that there is quite a lot of restored material in this publication. SPOILER - I don't know how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. At the moment, it seems that, according to current standards, it seems rather annoying. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost 1 hour on film. Before we heard out loud noises such as radio broadcasts, etc., Antonion was very brave to do so. I remember how much was done in the absence of action by non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette didn't bother me. Halprin is weaker, but gradually improves when the film continues. One picture is in a different aspect ratio and distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are actual staged shots, but not all that much. <br /> <br /> I am still trying to figure out how Antonioni was dealing with some of the airplane-flying Frechette shots. It looks like he's really flying some - there's no blue screen or double shot. <br /> <br /> I hope to see the movie a second time. Recommended for all Antonion fans.
