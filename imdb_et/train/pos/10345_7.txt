The only review of this movie from that date really marks the stars and the movie itself. I usually want to read user comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I don't know. It is unfortunate if there are not many comments on certain discs, because if there is only one review and it moves the movie unreasonably to the trash and pours, then you won't get an idea of ​​what to expect. I read the review before viewing this title, and I don't know where all the poison of this movie and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually did, even if the material was not the biggest. I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable. It's not one of the great classic classics, but a pleasant and funny deviation - much more than you expect in the latest movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
