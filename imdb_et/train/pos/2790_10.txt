Gurinda Chada's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a delicate, staggering comedy located in an ethnically diverse community near West Heahthrow Airport. <br /> <br /> Like the planes that are constantly arriving and departing from overhead lines, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters, Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), as they strike an improbable friendship that focuses on their mutual for passion for football and their technical commitment to David Beckham. <br /> <br /> Much of comedy goes beyond the misunderstandings of these two talented girls' families because they break all expectations and conventions with their very diverse family backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - Hounslow Team Champion - somewhere in the middle, as a broker, peace-maker and scared athlete, intervenes during the crisis, while remaining the main object of affection for both major characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, and without many obstacles and triumphs, we finally see our dedicated and beloved football heroes jumping to realize their dreams. <br /> <br /> Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mr Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr Paxton) are really a film that strikes the joy of adolescence and crosses all ethnic boundaries. <br /> <br /> Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are fighting for their own struggles, but still make a major contribution to understanding our main characters. <br /> <br /> In this unique way, this movie tells an important story that happened to be a football game. It marks the development of common understanding among ordinary people and the innate ability of young people to teach parents.
