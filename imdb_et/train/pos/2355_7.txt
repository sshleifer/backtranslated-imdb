... but I enjoyed this example anyway. I've read some of the comments that the previous reviewers had to say about this show, and it's hard for me to completely abandon all my criticism (except one: that the show was hidden, this program was NOT hidden). Many of the things people give out about this exhibition are money: pretentious; forced; burnt down; desperate attention; self-satisfied; Irritating Constant Conversation. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, really, really TRIED; and all the drawbacks. The exhibition was bright, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know, it was only once a week, I can take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it. I find it passing. But I think no one will bring it back.
