Each scene was put together perfectly. This film was a great cast and a team. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr., none and never exist. She is capable of shining every movie with her amazing talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie "Blockbuster" on the film shelf alone and, as I called, I couldn't take it and take it home. You can call me romantic, but this film touched my heart, not to mention that I was laughing at the same time. Although it made me cry, I finally admit that the whole film was brightened after that by the prospects of my life. I advised my horror, action and pure sense of humor who loved this movie. It is a film that has a good feeling of feeling. It could laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love and enjoy your life. Every time you deliberately move on to this movie, be aware that you are consciously choosing to live and feel it inspiring movie. What if it really happened to you? And keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
