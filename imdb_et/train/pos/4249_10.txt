Is it three men who are in their narrow white, attacking a caught guy or girl who says, "What's up, dog?" For any journey, Knuckleface Jones is something you like. This is a strange and surreal and not perfectly understandable yarn ... but it will never lose you. The first time I saw it, I laughed at myself. And every night after I came home and watch again. Forget about Coyote Ugly ... this is the movie that made Piper Perabo an impression. Look at this ... before it's too late!
