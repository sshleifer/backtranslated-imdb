This is the best movie I've ever seen! Perhaps this is because I live just a few miles from the village when the story happened, and I know how things in this area work in Sweden. The film tells the truth, believe me! It criticizes and respects the Dalarna lifestyle, and the manufacturer wants people who watch the film to be more open and attentive to your closest friends and relatives. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or in another country), you probably also know a lot about this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you to Maria Blom!
