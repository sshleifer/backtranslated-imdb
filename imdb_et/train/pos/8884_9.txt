I really enjoyed the 60s. Being of this generation (I'm waiting for "80s") was interesting to see a four-hour capsule unique for this era. <br /> <br /> One big problem in the movie was how the unbalanced movie was in the family. According to the NBC film, I saw that the story was essentially about two families fighting in the 1960s in America. Now I can do something, but I think we learned more about the white family than the African American family. <br /> <br /> I think 60s are using music to describe scenes better than any dialogue that might come out of the actors' mouths (all these are very talented.) This is a very visible first part of the mini series (about two hours) at the end. <br /> <br /> Very Good Movie!
