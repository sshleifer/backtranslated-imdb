It has been made more objective, realistic than the earlier filmed versions of the events with the legendary billboard for television, although one movie made after this was perhaps too far from the humanization of Sam Houston, Bowie, Travise and Crockett's <br /> <br /> Bowie, who played the sharp and cynical departure of James Arnes, who is still alive at the age of 85. do it. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </p> <p> -born Raul Julia Humanizes Gen. The Mexican dictator is portrayed but when lecherous, the vainglorious popinjay - gaudier uniform is never before or later. She gets great advice from European officials she has recruited, but she is convinced of her infallibility, but she does not consider it audible. Alec Baldwin is one of the actors whose age is suitable for his character: Col William Travis. His portrayal is serious. He's almost scared of the older men who share his command. <br /> <br /> One hilarious remark was Brian Keith as Crockett. In horns and wearing Ol Betsy, he stumbles as if he had migrated from another movie. Without imagination, the character is reduced to some stage of the convention. The script shows some historical facts that have been overlooked in earlier versions of films. We learn that Jim Bowie was a Santa Ana person with his own brother. The Mexican soldiers were badly involved in part because they had been a rifle left behind during the armed Napoleonic wars. "Santa Ana loves a good price." Bowie explains. The project of defending the entire former Spanish mission as a fortress was militarily weak - a fact that was studied more thoroughly in the 2004 film "Alamo".
