I am a fan of Hal Hartley films, especially Henry Fool of 1997. "Fay Grim" is the sequel to this movie and a similar style and sense of humor. However, the plot is completely different. Fay Grim (playing great iconic Parker Posey) is trying to find his lost man's laptops and finds himself in a conspiracy and espionage. Supporting cast (most of the first movie and Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and the 90's indie-darling very welcome return from Elina Lowensohn) is great and the film has many surprises. The director argues that it is part of "Star Wars" similar trilogy, which works under the series "Empire Strikes Back". If that's true, I can't wait to see the third installment! I hope I don't have to wait another 10 years for it.
