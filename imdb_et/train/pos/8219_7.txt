The dirty Harry series started with a very frightening policeman and was almost instantly eased for the "Magnum Force". By the time Enforcer moved, Dirty Harry was a bit more than a television police show (recorded only in Tyne Daly). After a seven-year break, Dirty Harry has finally returned to his roots. Maybe he's gone too long at this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood makes the first well-managed Harry movie, as Don Siegel did the first to make a big difference. Harry is darker again, not a pretty policeman he's got. He can once again say things like "Go ahead, do my day" and really mean it. "Sudden Impact" is a real sequel to Dirty Harry. "Enforcer" should never be done. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
