As if I have finished the heroic knight's chronicle in just a few minutes, I find myself very pleased, but the questions are still over me. Although it seems that the first 7 episodes are actually renaming the first record of the Lodos War, it is true that they are not. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different vision of how the original ended (and this may be the reason why the first 7 episodes occur), but I can't find it. CotHK says it will start 5 years after the Heros War, which Parn was part of. I think the director made the first 5 episodes of a very original summary to give the viewer a little reminder and an introduction to the characters and their deeds, as they appear much less after the Spark story. Now that a part of the Spark series hits, we'll find ourselves for another ten years (15 years after the Hero War). In some cases, Spark and his team are similar to Parni and his team when the journey begins, especially the story of love brewing between Spark and Nees. I also thought many times in CotHK that I threw the original series and if it wasn't for Spark's long blue hair, I know I would have pressed more than once to make sure the right disc was. however, these great backrests find that the writers did an excellent job of handling incredible characters and a remarkable story. The only thing that hurts me is that the Ashram and Wagnard return. Ummmm ... how ?? Don't make me wrong, both are big villains, although the only downside to the Ashram is that it supports Marmos. Maybe I missed some of the coarse parts of this part. As for the queue, I recommend CotHK. I place the entry of both CotHK and even more of the original Lodoss War beyond the Lord of the Rings. Both of them are more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend it.
