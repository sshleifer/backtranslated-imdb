Richard Brooks' Last hunt was a movie star Stewart Granger couldn't even mention mentioned? did he even draw a vintage poster for his signature in his later years? but then the director went to his wife so that it was understandable. For someone, this is one of the best of the 50's in the West and many years before its attitude towards the environment. <br /> <br /> In many cases, it is almost the same as following one of Anthony's Westerners, who see their heroes, hit their salvation strikes and scream at every step. Here, Granger's legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light, but after hitting the buffalo, he pays him the cattle with the poetic fairness of the herd, pulling Robert Taylor's nervous and proudly racist gunslinger back into the darkness, on the ground that "I have already been guilty of conscience. money. " Raised by the Indians, he is fully aware of the damage he is making to the disappearing buffalo, and he gradually gets almost as much as he consumes when Taylor hates. If two men fall over Debra Paget to swell? the only survivor of the Taylor band of Indians kills? and hiding white buffaloes, which are invaluable for evaluators and Indians for a variety of reasons, is a showdown inevitable, although the result is certainly not. <br /> <br /> Taylor is definitely an iron casting? It was Granger paying many epic roles in MGM developed films like Quo Vadis and Ivanhoe, which gave Taylor his 50th return after years of continuous decline. His hair color may not convince, but his performance, a low and violent man who hates that he does not carry a weapon, carries him. Granger's accent is not always convincing, but he does a good, quieter hero in the form of Jimmy Stewart, trying to keep his renewed respect and agree with his deeds before he finally gets the chance to change. Russ Tamblyn's Half-War Skinner and Lloyd Nolan's Single-Legged Old Player are also as good as they can get, but the actual star is a script: tightly drawn for a great eye and ear character? not to mention the end of Stanley Kubrick, who borrowed The Shining? it balances historical revisionism with fun dramas without ever selling short ones. The new French DVD is free but has a 2.35: 1 broadcast with English audio.
