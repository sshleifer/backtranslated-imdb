This documentary is incredibly thought-provoking, bringing you into the lives of two long-lasting love in the final stages of AIDS. The films made together in their twenty-two-year-olds really bring their last moments home. <br /> <br /> If this movie does not recognize the pain and embarrassment of these two interesting people, then you will not do it at heart.
