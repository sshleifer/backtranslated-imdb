To be honest, if someone told me that the director of the Lemony Snicket series of unfortunate events, Angels City and Caspers are going to make a clean low budget indie movie and that would be a good thing, I would say that this person must be joking. But that was what Brad Siberling did. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> "10 products or less" has a similar understanding of movies like "Before Sunrise", "Lost in Translation" or recently "once". This includes a possible meeting between two people who, if serendipity hadn't placed them there, would probably never have a crossroads, or if they didn't, they wouldn't say one to another. Like these films, "10 items or less" focuses on the relationships that build and how the characters build on each other's strengths and strengths. <br /> <br /> The story includes Morgan Freeman playing an unnamed actor who is going to investigate his role as a food worker for an upcoming independent film and his things that are out of his control, spend the day with a lady out of 10 or less tracks played by Paz Vega. She has a luscious marriage and hopes she will get a new job as a secretary. At first, Freeman's character just needs a lift. But after spending time with her, she wants to get to know her and maybe even give her advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling builds characters almost entirely through exchanges between Freeman and Vega. The plot is just the setting of the two characters that allow you to interact with most of the 80-minute movie. Freeman has a fun character because he seems to be a stranger in the lower class world to live the Vega character Scarlett. Meanwhile, Vega is growing out of stubborn cashier who is irritating to his life situation to go on. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of things that really happened in this movie. First of all, Siberling has probably taken note of an independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and not covered by Hollywood pitfalls. This is a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film. It works even if the situation itself is not conceivable. <br /> <br /> I have also impressed the presentations. Freeman's presence gives this film credibility from get-go, but he shows a certain amount of charm and fun that he doesn't usually see. At the same time, Paz Vega will be a breakthrough in US film in the future. I loved her in Spanglish and she's just as good here as the harsh, nonsense Scarlet. At the end of the film, he successfully transmits the growth of his character. I look forward to seeing her more in the movies. <br /> <br /> In general, the 10 smaller features are the most characteristic pieces that are well written and directed by Brad Siberling. He hasn't written much, and his feature film consists mainly of a great Hollywood movie. However, there is definitely an artist here and I want to see if he will take it again.
