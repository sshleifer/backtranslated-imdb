This film contains one of Richard Dreyfuss' greatest performances as an actor who plays the dictator so convincingly that his own mother does not see the criminals. This movie is also funny, but it also has a serious side. The film, which is the dictator's mistress Madonna, is particularly intriguing, but eventually becomes the leader of that country. Madonna's development of a mistress to a political leader greatly enhances the story and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character at the beginning of the film who is struggling with the actor and somewhat of a horse, is developing too, and finally the film commands respect. I liked this movie.
