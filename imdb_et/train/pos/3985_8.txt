I looked at it late as a TV movie last night purely by chance. In the stroke of the film, it was said that her mother stayed with her daughter and reminded her of a romantic journey, as I was saying that carpentry is hard to work with a new conservatory played by Daniel Craig, so that the plot was immediately visible. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the mother's carpenter's carpenter's interest is her daughter's boyfriend, so there's brewing there and not too many surprises. But I would hit Anne Reid's significant results and I was hooked. The direction allows him enough space to look in the mirrors and adjust the scarves when he expresses sadness. <br /> <br /> Sexual scenes were exciting and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't the older women's organizations be covered? Not here and we are being treated with the mother's sexuality for a tasty revival. Even more amazing are the drawings he made to (SPOILER!) Confirmed his daughter's doubt that something was going on here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw as a daughter did not convince me as much as the rest cast, but it could be me. Before the waves of the Raph locks, I waited to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would, in my opinion, be better offset. Bradshaw has a more happy face that did not bear the anger of the film. <br /> <br /> The end is weak. If the embarrassment of the mother she is ashamed of is so indifferent, maybe we might see some close-ups of those who say goodbye and see something for their individual reasons. Whatever he has done, he has recently lost a widow who leaves for a lonely home he shared with his wife for 30 years, and found no compassion. For a movie that is so full of emotion (and warned that it's like opening a champagne, you'll never get back on the lid), the end is a cold contradiction.
