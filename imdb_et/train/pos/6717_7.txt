This documentary was very thorough and revealed and at the same time fun, which I thought it was quite impressive. I felt they did a very good job covering sports from their origins to the present, but still there is a reason why I don't give such a movie a big score ... <br /> <br /> I felt that the story would focus too often a lot of "sports" nouns: too many in the individual places to surf, and especially too many single surfers. I felt that the documentary was more about the nature of sport, the ideology of sport, and so on. It would have been better (although it was, of course, covered, I don't think it would be as long as it was justified)). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not completely surfing, they sometimes hear and go to certain places and specific surfers may be bored. Although video clips and in-depth research have been well-respected, it could have been presented in a way that is better for those who are not eager surfers. <br /> <br /> In addition, my biggest disappointment was that when they talked about the fact that there were no stunning and wonderful events in the history of surfing, they did not have the actual material of these events, and all the time you were waiting for it on the silver screen The amazing, breath-taking event that these men talk about the changing moments of life and, finally, everything you get is a lot of people who talk about it, not the actual material. For me it was too audible, and then they couldn't see them. I understand how difficult it is to get all the material, but please: do not take the event so much and then do not show it. In general, there is a very fresh documentary that I enjoyed; For the above reasons, the best documentary is not, but being very fresh and with a very exciting film and good soundtrack, this is a documentary I would recommend to everyone.
