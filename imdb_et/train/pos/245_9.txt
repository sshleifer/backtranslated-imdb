The only reason I wanted to see it was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, this film was very remarkable. It's not bad, but it's not really good. Editing is good; The film is well developed. The direction is competent and guaranteed. The story is bursting. The movie works on average with Ledger, Bloom and usually large Watts and Rush. Shares are impenetrable when you are from the US, so just sit back and enjoy the landscape (or, as I like, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the movie, I wasn't bored or moved. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say that I didn't care about this point. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only reason I recommend this is that Orlando Bloom in some way shows some tips on the range (though often "I'm pretty and confusing" looks outstanding) so fangirls can find it is worth the price of matinee. Besides, it just can't be seen. It is not good enough or fun enough.
