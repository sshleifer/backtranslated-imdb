Stardust Another Guided Review (originally written on June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine has just started for this (no sites yet?), So I doubt most of you have heard about it. Actually, I wasn't either (sort of). When I got the post, I thought it was another code name and it was really worried that it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when I don't work, so I enjoy it 100% just a mortal film carrier. It turned out that it was not Transformers and I was aware of it as "Neil Gaiman Film". What is it talking about? In short, this is Gaiman's fairy tale boy and dropped a star. More than that, and I would give away plots of information that are (a) a breach of contract and (b) a violation of your fun. If you really want to know what it is, buy a book. The rumor is that Gaiman can be a writer. <br /> <br /> You don't know what to expect in a movie, as long as the surprise is worth it. And that was for sure. This review was "special" in that it included not only filmmakers, but also exhibitors (rarely mixed pictures) and local sci-fi / fantasy people. So, you know the expected audience, right? I think with this crowd and the Stardust title I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, how wonderful I was. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a fairy tale written by the author of the famous comic book. But it was not the Lord of the Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Rings (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than it all. <br /> <br /> But as Lord of the Rings, it was the humanism of the film that sells fantastic qualities. This is definitely a romantic story, but with a rich sense of humor. And this humor is kind of not shining. It's more than dramatic than comedy. Before I go on, we'll do this movie review. <br /> <br /> Action is at least good. It is always difficult to say more than fantasy movies, but I believe it was important to have worked well in roles. Unfortunately, Michelle Pfieffer is not one of them. He plays the villain and he does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett was a real jerk. That means a big villain. Peter O'Toole is fine, Peter frickin 'O'Toole - which is wonderful. Ricky Gervais is completely cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be mostly fun. He wanted to deliver the goods. And Charlie Cox (who?) If the lead was a good surprise man I never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always been confused with her. He may be big, and then he may miss the sign. Here he is first. And he is literally the star of this movie. Of course, his accent stumbles over here and there. And yes, he's not as good as he can be if Cox isn't in the scene. But ... look, look at yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects have been silenced yet and only where they should be. Best Flying Ship Still - Damage to Potter. The direction is light and flows well. Cinematography could have been better, but not all movies in New Zealand. Everything else is the top clamp. <br /> <br /> And now that it's done ... <br /> <br /> Writing. Oh, writing! Those, you fuck. In today's climate it is difficult to do something original and start wondering at first. Kingdom, a deadly king, a boy who proves his worth, witches, ghosts, aspirations (or three) - what's new? However, Gaiman's story only draws you in the knowledge of your surface so that it all gently belongs to the original boy and his heart. And while you suspect that it will all come to light, you will start to wonder in the third book and - if you are - find yourself in a clash of climate conflict and hope for the best. Finally, you will find this story, this movie is what all fairy tales should be, but not too often. Fantastic and real. (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan, but I wouldn't destroy it for you. For those who read the book, you can be sure that it was done right.) <Br / The people I spoke to later had the same impression. Great movie for every age group and new {UNHELD} for this generation. Empty will be filled only after the film has been widely released because you may be expecting it. You know when you get out. I sincerely hope that Stardus will not lose its tentpoles. Even if that is the case, I have the pleasure of pushing the hands of everyone I know. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> Forget {WITHHELD}. I'm a couple of years late, but ... "A great movie for every age group and a new generation of PRINCESS BRIDE." <br /> <br /> Maybe a little high on the rating, but I'm still confident that there are years to come, the same "Oh, I love this movie," the answer to this, because now the princess is the bride.
