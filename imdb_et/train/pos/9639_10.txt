Especially close and sharp sampling of one of the 18-year-old boy's revolutionary and dynamic emotional world, making his first experience in his gay love for another boy on vacation with his family. /> I liked this movie because of its extremely clear and surrogate storytelling, with all the "Sound-close-up" and quiet moments that were full of intense moods. <br /> <br />
