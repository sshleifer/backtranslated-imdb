A young cat is trying to steal his brothers from the death of the soul, but only half of it and then he has to go to the other side. Frankly, I'm not sure what happens in this movie, full of very strange, very surreal images, some of which parents may be disturbed (ie cats that cut off pigs who are traveling with them and frying like a bacon that all three eat ). <br /> <br /> This is a very strange film some have equated with Hello Kitty with acid, I think it's more like Hello Kitty, as Dali did. (It is certainly more alive than Destino, which was directly based on his work). <br /> <br /> If you have a very amazing movie that challenges your understanding of things, watch this movie. Just be prepared for very strange images that will be burned in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
