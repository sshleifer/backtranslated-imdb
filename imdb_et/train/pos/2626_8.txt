"Lion King 1 1/2" is Disney's most fun theater release. Recently I saw this movie after I hadn't seen it for many years. I remember for the first time I saw it, I had no expectations at all, and I was pleasantly surprised by this observable and very fun movie. <br /> <br /> Is it better than "Simba's Pride"? In many ways, yes. Though "Simba's pride" wasn't quite bad, she had problems: lack of a good script and bad character, which otherwise affected the okay movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway: it is nice to see Timon and Pumbaa's personalities flourish again in the way we (or certainly me) loved them in this movie; "Simba in pride" they were completely annoying and I didn't like the "Timon and Pumbaa" series. <br /> <br /> This movie can easily be stupid, but fortunately the filmmakers didn't take the wrong turn, and instead of making this movie really fun. There are some jokes that adults can enjoy themselves. The result is pretty good. There are two new songs that are memorable and two new characters, Timon's mother (known by Marge Simpsons' Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, which are enjoyable. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa is greatly depicted. Emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and do not feel inappropriate, which could easily have been done (especially in comedies). my voices? Yes there is. Although, fortunately, they do not affect too much, but I mention them: 1. Many scenes from the first film have been used here. Personally, it was strange to see old scenes that were integrated with new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. At the peak, some jokes become bad. <br /> <br /> 3. Storywise, this is Timon's story, and while filmmakers are trying to integrate their story into Simba, it makes the scenario somewhat quick at times. <br /> <br /> But this data does not affect this otherwise fun movie. This is the only really acceptable Disney sequel that should be in every movie collection.
