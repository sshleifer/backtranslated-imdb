Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been the best friends forever and after graduation they decide to travel to Thailand. Because of the incident, they meet young attractive mysterious strangers who invite them to go with Hong Kong over the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are hijacked by drug heroes and are sent to jail. Now is the time for ultimate survival and true friendship. It was a pretty good movie, I've seen it a couple of times, and after a while you'll notice that they are some holes in the plot, but the movie still keeps you entertained. Claire Danes did a good job as usual, she is a great actor. I'd give Brokedown Palace 8/10
