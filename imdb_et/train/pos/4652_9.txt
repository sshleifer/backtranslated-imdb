I think this movie is well done and realistic. I am used to watching Hollywood movies and use it as a standard for film evaluation, you are definitely disappointed. This film is much closer to the real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and it raises it to medium-sized movies. I have no experience with the Swedish military, so they can't make mistakes in their activities. But as I saw the extra extra, I am convinced that a lot has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a movie I recommend to others to watch. High quality realistic story and film.
