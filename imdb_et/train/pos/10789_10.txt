When I was little, my parents got to watch this movie. I really liked it and I watched it over and over again. Even when I was in Grade 3, I looked at it from time to time. Recently, I looked at it again, just for the sake of nostalgia, and although the exhibition was not for my age group (I am among my later teenagers), I still found myself entertaining and educating. This exhibition teaches good lessons about imagination and coping well with others. Some parts I found quite fun. Also, this exhibition has no bad content, so you can leave this exhibition alone for children and don't worry about them accepting a bad language or not. I recommend it.
