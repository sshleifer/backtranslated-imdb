i loved it and i was so broken that one more season !!! I wish they were! it was the best show ever !!!!!! apparently there is no chance that they will decide that the show is not canceled! ha ha i wish it was there! I'd be so excited! i really do! I miss it! and was particularly crushed so as not to know what would happen to Jason! I think they should do one more .... this I also think of my foolishness that u must write ten lines to comment. It changes your comment ... and nobody reads it! I really want to know what would have happened between Jason and Nicole ... maybe they could make a spin off!
