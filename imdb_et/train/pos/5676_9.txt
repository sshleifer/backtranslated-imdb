THREE BLACKADDER SERIES "If you want to do something right, kill Baldrick before you get started" Hot from the second series of heels back to the famous name of the current owner for luck and served as a butler Prince Regent, in vain and stupid foil for the Blackadders poison played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still a comic, which is another comic. The format is similar to the previous example, but now they had found a winning formula to change things. We see that Blackadder is trying to get rich on the back of a powerful regent, trying to make Bladrick M.P., who tries to make a bride suitable for the prince. In many ways, this is one of the most accurate series in history, the princess took over the throne during the madness of her fathers, and some characters speak a lot of times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington go through all the events and everyone can steal their scenes, not just with such a star
