Only once in a while can we get an R-rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention. This is even rarer when critics like it. I came back to a 40-year-old virgin and I can honestly say that it was one of the biggest laughs in my life. I went to show 10:35 and every line was filled. Not only did everyone laugh at their ass all the time. It's a two-hour endless laugh. I dare you to see this movie and not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. One man is forty years old and he is a virgin. But behind this simple five jokes, we are given a deep and complex story that is not just one more fun you ever know, but having real lessons behind it. The stars of Steve Carelli are Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old virgin. We are known as Steve Carelli, as I think one of the best theft ever. Stealing Bruce Almighty's and especially Anchorman's fun scenes Steve Carell has come a long way, as he is finally given a moment to shine as a star. No one will forget their name if they know it in a piercingly funny, intestinal burst, roll-in-the-a-fun comedy. The brilliant writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell is indeed expedient, and it's not just one story to talk about. The lesson behind the film's misery and vulgar non-stop ride is a major lesson. Though the movie is not presented in the best possible way, it gives us more than just a pleasant time. The burst of this gut keeps you from laughing all the time, while at the same time we see the real struggles of life for people like Andy and his associates. The end could not be better. It not only gives what we have promised but also gives one of the most memorable numbers ever seen in comedy. It would have been perfect if there were Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson somehow somehow, but you can't win everything, now you can. Catherine Keener gives an inexplicably perfect presentation like Trish, one woman Andy is really. Not only does he give us a laugh, it is crazy to see how bright his story is. He was perfect in his role and he and Carell are terrible, not to mention the fun chemistry on the screen. Alberta and Manitoba all went to a 40-year-old virgin with 18A. The same happened to four brothers, which I think is the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love it more on Ontario. Good luck to all your colleagues who are there! In general, Steve Carell gives one of the most fun performances I've ever seen and almost all the cast persons share non-stop laughter. Everyone loves this Virgin Virgin this summer and I encourage everyone to see it as fast as humanly possible. It's the best comedy of the year, hands down. It wins the longest yard, the wedding crasher, and of course, the most memorable comedies of Anatra and Apatow and Carelli. Love it. Every one of my favorite critics loved it, and it deserves instantly in the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a big star. Now look at one of the brightest summers. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
