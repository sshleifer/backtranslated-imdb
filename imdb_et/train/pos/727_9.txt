One of the best, if not the best, rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just pointless fun. There were really a lot of smart jokes there. Of course I love Ramone. But all the "anarchy" and "I hate high school" topics don't take the film too seriously, which is great about it. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film does not take itself seriously and is not pretentious, like so many teenage ticket prices in the 1970s, eighties and nineties. And to talk about it, it's not really dirty or nasty. Only PG rated. It's rare in this category of film. Great cult classic and truly incredible time capsule.
