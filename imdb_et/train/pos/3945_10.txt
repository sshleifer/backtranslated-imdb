The rating is only 5 because it is a movie that could have used better action and direction (or at least music!). But Walt Whitman's achievements are worth it 10. The previous poster calls the movie joyful, but I think it's a simple case if you don't see the trees in the forest. The filmmakers were probably more interested in getting the story out there than would be Hollywood's shiny film. And for that I commend them - the fact that it is non-mainstream also reflects the life of Whitman. This film is more documentary than the actors. The story of fascination, if you rarely hear these types of stories that shape current mental health, is the most important thing. I found this to be a very nice look at history.
