I ran this movie on TV and couldn't turn it off. Peter Sellers plays an unlikely companion who falls very hot and lovely Goldie Hawn (who wouldn't be?) For. So Goldie's character from the beginning to the end of the movie is not common today. This film gave me a different angle in human relationships and found it very funny. The role of Peter Sellers was hard to sell, but I think he pulls it well.
