no movie dennis bunker, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserve rating below 5 here. This is the version of poor men in movies, like 16 blocks or driving at noon at midnight, except the prisoner here is very simple with Ms. Eleniak. Tom Berenger plays one more rap, maverick's military type and William Mcnamara plays for his beginner to be released. The manor in front of the plot is absurd, because I lost the number of times Eleniak would have had and could have accessed, but it is a fun feeling-good movie and all of the above participants are good films that keep the movie going. This is not really a family movie because eleniak is a somewhat passionate and rare naked scene, but it is much better than some other guffs that came out at this time.
