For a film that has been little publicized and few people have heard of it, it was pretty good. This is another of today's British criminal films that are peculiar ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It's not as wild as "Snatch," but it's interesting and has some harsh characters. very interesting for the first viewer. Basically, it is a small key British man who, with the help of two Russian male friends, is taking away the Russian "mail order bride" by offering a few big surprises. <br /> Chapin and Nicole Kidman celebrate the stars and are very good, like Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz Kidman as a Russian cohort. It's a different film and has worked well. Kidman proves once again that he is more than just a pretty face.
