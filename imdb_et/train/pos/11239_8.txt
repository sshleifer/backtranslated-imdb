Hidden Frontier is remarkable as it is the longest running series of Internet-based Star Trek fans. Although the quality of production is not parallel to fan products such as Starship Exeter or New Voyages, the Hidden Frontier largely focuses on the story and in this respect it is very good. <br /> <br /> The hidden border has no physical sets; Instead, the participants are filmed with a green screen and a digital background. One of the hidden boundaries is the greatest work accomplished. One way to achieve this is by inserting virtual sets during filming, not after production. While this saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the resulting material is not as high as it would have been after production, although it is still its goal. <br /> <br /> Although this may not be the way for everyone's cup, the Hidden Frontier is also worth shooting, although you may want to start the third season as it is the place where manufacturers really are going.
