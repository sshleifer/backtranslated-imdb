Though I loved this movie, the trailers that hit the internet many years ago put their expectations a little high. <br /> <br /> My DVD, so don't get me wrong, I don't say wrong don't look at it or even buy it! It's just that I think the first scene was the best, and it was nothing more than the whole movie.
