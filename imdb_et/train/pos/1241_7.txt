This movie is very fun and every criticism is based on personal preference - not on the quality of the films. Other than the usual excessive obsession with some scenes from Murphy, this film is a great tool for your humor type. It has some pretty special effects and exciting scenes. <br /> <br /> As a missing child, Murphy's character begins to look for a lost girl who takes her on the road for which others believe she is "chosen" to protect the golden child. A young boy is born as an enlightened person whose goal is to save the world from evil forces, but whose lives are in danger, if not Murphy and his beautiful, mysterious and mysterious helper / defender. /> <br /> There are also moments of philosophical lessons to challenge an audience interested in thinking deeply. One such scene is where the golden child that Murphy's character has asked to protect is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. For older monks, the child can choose the decorative necklace, and the child is tested at his or her choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy based on the notion that both are good and evil forces in our world, most of which people are fully aware of. When we accept the premise of this plot, we have to perceive our inviolability with the perceived daily reality and prepare the ground and walls to crumble and reveal the evil that awaits us to destroy us. <br /> <br /> This is a great film with a good plot, good-performing and mostly pretty decent dialogue that combines a serious issue with the healthy balance of martial arts and with the humor of Eddie Murphy.
