this is the visual adaptation of the manga with very little dialogue. what kind of dialogue there will be the word "baloons" as it would be in manga. its plot is there, but only vaguely. there is a manga question on which it is based, available in English in the blast book collection "comics in underground Japan" and it has a real labeled dialog that explains the plot a little more than here. I recommend checking this volume if you liked it because it explains some of the "plot" of the movie that is otherwise inexplicable. animation is wise that it's pretty decent, the good use of computers and the use of images is mostly well done. it jumps in and out of episodes, like characters, cat and his brain's older sister cat migrate to an odd series of pictures: boat, circus, desert. only half an hour they undergo a number of semicircles and settings that make me believe that the director chose a number of long-term manga questions to randomly adjust them, but selected them visually. knowing what is happening can become somewhat more expensive. it mostly reminds me of things they played in a mtv show, a comic book sushi, especially a short one that contains a cat who drives a man behind a broken butt around the house. only in this case, the cats resemble more and more, and their adventure expands to include death and reincarnation and many other subjects [though not all so easy to say what is happening]. this DVD has a director's comment and features, but I can't comment on them because I didn't get to them. I will give it 8/10 now, here isnt much compared to this anime, and I hope more like that.
