An Itch In Time is one of Bob Clampett's home racing track, which hit WB in the early 1940s, including Horton Hatches The Egg and "The Turtle Winning Rabbit". Soaked in manic timing and exaggerated chaos, it is basically a flea that is busy breaking in for a new home, and a dog whose ground is broken. Because Captain Elmer gives him a frightening fleamer when he scratches so much, unhappy dogs are forced to withstand the upward spiral of torture, as home-made flea uses options and electrical tools to clear the ground. Ultimately, the little monster will light up the fuse of a small explosive hill that he has sacrificed to the back of his victim! There's a huge explosion, and the unhappy pooch covers his eyes when his back breaks in a relaxing fourth July. It really has to hurt and the dog is going to fly, but soon he will stop the action and say happily with a smile: "You are better off, because I think I will like it!" For years, this kinky confession has been censored, but the current prints have restored the clip so that the viewers can now enjoy it in their original devotion. But it is still cut, that the cat closes her brain after she says, "Now I've seen everything!". It was a common paw in WB, but since then it has been a comic and many others, including Horton.
