Directed by a partial reconstruction and partial end photo, the directors organized a rich, Venezuelan minority, political opposition, church (a cynical laugh) and a US government. This was another chapter in the history of US foreign policy, which Steven Kinzer calls "Overthrow" or "Sowing Democracy in American Style". In fact, this foreign guaranteed intervention was not only a coup against President Chavez, but also against a democratic majority who chose him. <br /> <br /> Because it is a brilliant documentary, it has been strongly confirmed by violent reactions to and against the Internet. As St. Augustine said, â€œMen love the truth when they swear by the light; they hate it if it proves them wrong. "<br /> <br /> This movie must be for all those who want to understand the world we live in.
