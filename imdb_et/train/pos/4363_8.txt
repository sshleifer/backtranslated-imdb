It's a bit annoying that Gig Young's character is on Gig Young's movie. But this movie is where Gig got his name and a nice career when he played small parts under another name. <br /> <br /> I am against most of the other comments and say that I really enjoyed it because of the vivid performance of Barbara Stanwycki as Fiona. He was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and weak as the oldest of the three daughters whose mother died in Lusitania and whose father died later during the Woar War. <br /> <br /> Like the "man" house, Fiona has for years been firmly committed to solving her father's will, which would allow Donald Trump to become Charles Barclay's family. But Fiona keeps secret why she hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a medieval, dirty sister married to English but craves her youngest sister boy (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you're a Stanwyck fan, that's not what.
