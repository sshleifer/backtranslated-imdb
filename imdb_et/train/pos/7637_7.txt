I like this movie even if I don't really know James Belush. In this movie, you can see several big names, Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Caine was, of course, already big. The plot of this movie is simple; it's the same as the Sliding Door movie. However, it was said lightly and I like comedy moments. It made me try to live my important moments again in life, for example, when I have taken this girl out for a movie and not others, etc. This tells us that the people around us could have played a different role in their lives when some minute data changed. It also reminds us to be careful about what we want. Life on the other side is not always as good as we think; Perhaps, what we are now is the best for us, all things.
