This exhibition was judged by critics and those who realized that the similarities between "Pushing Daisies" style and someone else were not stealing. (Yes, I've seen "Amelie". "" Pushing the birthdays "is somewhat similar, but still different enough to be original.) Rather, there are too few shows on television that have such a peculiar charm. but "PD" has been honestly said with this similarity: Bryan Fuller created both exhibitions. (Both shows include an "undead" young woman, for example.) This show never ends up being funny and charming, and it was always strange but always humane. <br /> <br /> I have to say the word counting conventions in progress: some people have complained that there was no moral center in this exhibition because the first (and subsequent) episode seems to make Ned live the death of Chuck's father without any consequences. it is a new concept "without any consequences" because despite the fact that Ned was just a boy and did not know he had caused Chuck's father to die, he still felt guilty at the moment he was In addition, Ned admitted nearly ten episodes to Chuck that he had caused his father to die with his gift. Now there is no police who would ask people who have magically caused one person to die to bring another person back to life, so that the questions of leaving and returning should be taken without social guidance. In other words, it's between Ned and Chuck who never wanted to forgive Ned soon. <br /> <br /> But this refers to the problem that the story continues in the online frames. I remember when David Caruso's "NYPD Blue" character did something wrong and seemed to have got it - the whole year - then he got stuck and was forced to step back (and left). The point is that viewers should now learn and not assume that simply because an ordinary sign does something wrong in one episode and is not caught in this episode, it has got it. It is always next week - and maybe even next year.
