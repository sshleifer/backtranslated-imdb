This movie is fun, original and beautifully targeted. I've become a BIG BAD SWIM groupie, watching it for film festivals always and everywhere. I've seen it one and a half times, and every time the enthusiastic audience response has confirmed it is one of the best films that will come out for years. Almost every festival he has reviewed has either sold out or won the audience's favorite prize. It is clear that people love this movie and even more clearly why they do it. Cinematic art is excellent, characterizing and brilliant, fantastic end and direction, full of wisdom and perfect timing. It's hard to believe this is Ishai Setton's first film. I hope it will be published soon so everyone can see it.
