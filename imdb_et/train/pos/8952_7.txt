Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she's interested in her pretty ordinary neighbor, Shep Henderson (James Stewart). He casts a spell on Shep, forcing him to dig his groom and fall for him. Things go pretty well until Gillian discovers that she cares for this mortal man. He decides to tell him the secret. But how does Shep react when he discovers that he was a "trick" to fall in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> When the lightweight comedies of the 1950s go, Bell Book and Candle are good, but something remarkable. It is enjoyable enough for the clock and should be approached by almost anyone who sits down. Just don't go to a movie that is waiting for the biggest thing after sliced ​​bread. Sometimes the movie is cute, funny and at the end it moves. Kim Novak and James Stewart are doing their best and have real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks surprisingly unbelievable. Supporting Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often ridiculous funny and steals a lot of attention from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that the Bell Book and Candle can't really decide what movie they want to be. Is it a comedy of a screwball? Is this a romantic comedy? Is this supernatural comedy? Being Director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach, the film could be even better and more memorable.
