It is a film of 17th-century Italian artists, and especially of an artist, a woman Artemisia, who was an unknown profession at that time, and she dared to paint her father with her unique muscular body. The work of the camera is mainly indoors where the artists mainly worked. There are some great shots. Close-ups of candlelight show the beautiful work of classical painters and it is interesting to look at painters and their students, supported by complex scaffolding, who practice religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, makeup) are quite authentic, as the Italian churches have preserved all these details on their frescoes for centuries. His father calls beautiful Artemisia to study under the great Florentine artist Tas, who has become an expert in perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but unsuspecting Artemis is introduced more than new painting techniques. After he puts him, he rapes violently. His father is outraged. Follow the court proceedings. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story, the end of which is not satisfactory. The distinctive feature of the film is artistic performance and attention to detail. Scenes, such as women running across the field with wind, carrying their bulky clothes, add great effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says he paints himself nicely; his father paints with others. As for this movie, I think it is the most.
