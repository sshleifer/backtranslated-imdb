This is the latest Dutch-language film by Paul Verhoeven, which made Hollywood films including Basic Instinct, Robocop and Total Recall before they were created. He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider trying to catch his web before we meet Gerard Reve, a tedious imaginative self-centered writer. Gerard is invited to be a guest speaker at the Literary Club meeting in the sea town for one hour or so from Amsterdam. Verhoeven gives us a glimpse of how Gerard's imagination changes reality. Asking if the writers are a little crazy, he admits reading the newspaper "and says" boom "I read" punishment "when he says" flood ", which I read as" blood "when he says" red "when I say "red" I see if he speaks enough time, he will believe it, "I lie to the truth." He accepts the duty of the club treasurer, the owner of a beautiful rich cabin to stay overnight. that he is a "black widow." Is it more of a twist to his reality or is he a murder? It is a psychological drama and his old films, which have been caught in my memory, thought it was my favorite gender. it looks like this is Paul Verhoeven, and he is a champion who puts us in doubt about our own realization of reality. It is a great change from the usual Hollywood price.
