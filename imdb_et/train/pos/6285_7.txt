What is the name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer hopes it will be filled with action. <br /> <br /> Producer Bruckheimer's latest film, Gone in 60 Seconds, is all about nomenclature. With the character monikers like Kip, Sway and Sphinx and the cars idealized names like Diane, Sue and the hard-to-understand Eleanor, it's just a non-stop action that keeps you wanting to just play the name of the game. <br /> <br /> Not a deep script in any way, but it is a great tool for action, like Nicolas Cage in Memphis Raines, with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, coming out of a car theft retirement to save her brother's life if you steal 50 year-old list of exotic cars one night. This film may not be for the same culture, but it is interesting. Though they have stars, none of them have extraordinary performances, including one very poor result from my favorite and newcomer Giovanni Ribis. Even Jolie, who came out of his recent Oscar victory, is just a symbolic love for almost every time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Can many beautiful cars and cars become a great movie? I think so. The film is a joy to watch, and while one particular scene leads you to an area of ​​disbelief, it is non-stop and the relationship is convincing. Just be cautious about other drivers who are fighting to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
