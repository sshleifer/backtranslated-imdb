I saw this movie first 21 years ago when it was ITV (before cable and satellite days) Matin√©e. I was in school with mumps and I was completely wrapped in film. I've been buying this video for about 10 years and I want to get a copy of it from the DVD. David Niven is my favorite actor all the time, and I think it's travesty that he had been through the Oscar for so many times. I also think the queen should have grabbed her because she just made the film industry as much as Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. The way the film turns black and white into color and again is well done and the film has star artists such as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and Richard Attenborough's early appearance.
