Leave these two stories pleasantly remembered and in the first, not too distant future, we see the young man as the exam day, the country's i.q test. The boy is a little overwhelmed because his parents are anxious because some of his friends have already done it and finally do the experiment. On arrival, she is given an injection and curious about why. The examiner smiles and tells her that it's just to make sure she tells the truth. The boy asked, again confused, why not? Later, the parents sit unexpectedly on the screen when the message appears and declares that the country is unfortunate, but their son's level of i.q has surpassed the country's share and politely asked if they would want a personal burial. Summarizing Scene Housing! The message of charity was a warm-hearted story between a girl from the past and the present man. What made the strange story of witchcraft accusations in the past and getting into the pages of the current history. A nice story with a warm-hearted conclusion.
