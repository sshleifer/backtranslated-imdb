I ask someone who says they don't care about this movie. Some reviewers have said that he does not have enough action, some say it is too long, and so on. Don't listen to them! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> Good performances are great! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson is married and is very characteristic of her size. Cinemaphotography was great and breathtaking. This is one of the few films I've seen in my life (with Shawshank) that was almost flawless in casting, guiding, writing, showing, etc. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it wasn't. t viewed in 50 or 100 top films. I felt so passionate that I just signed up for IMDB so I can find out for everyone what the real scoop is. I've seen this movie about 10 times (each time with another person) and everyone has loved it! You have to be awake and pay close attention to the first 30 minutes, because they are showing quite a few signs at first. If you are paying more attention than most of these juvenile children who write comments on movies on this site, if you love this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top ten and Matrix # 32?!?! This should show you the age range of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This is the best 50 movie !!!
