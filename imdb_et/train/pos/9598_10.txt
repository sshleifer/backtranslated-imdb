I watched the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the movie !! What to drive! And what a trip to finally find Darius Weems! Such a bold, smart, funny and talented spirit! And what team! Listen to Darius laughing at the presence of Panama City in the water to see his fear of being too close to the Louisiana alligators, a miracle in his eyes as he drove a balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, bet he was eating a spoonful of wasabi and the phone was calling home, and as always - boys are boys. Everyone has to see this movie - both young and old. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the team members are witnessing the heart of the younger generation. They got a new wheelchair for Darius; they documented accessibility issues; they took the journey of their life to Darius; and they touched many, many lives. Recognizing DMD and encouraging research funding, this film will help Darius Goes West's ultimate goal of treating DMD.
