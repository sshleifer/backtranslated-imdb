This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. If you have never seen it, hit him. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together, and while the movie amuses me very much, it reminds Julia of premature death. It is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue, which is too much for us in these terror and fear times.
