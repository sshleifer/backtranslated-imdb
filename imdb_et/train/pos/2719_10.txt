I saw this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It's just incredible how homosexual relationships between the author and the protagonists are sublimated in the film. The reporter is straight, the main characters are more than twinks. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, but the second time we look at it, we get all the interesting information that writer / director Brooks creates <br /> <br /> Attention is an amazing cut at the beginning, where killers and killers are interconnected. The phone cutter is cut with a Perry phone. Cutter, who washes her face, was cut with Perry, who washes her face. Only Perry looks in the mirror and saw his erotic male body away from the fantasy of playing his guitar in Las Vegas to empty his chair. This failure / fantasy fits with the unfortunate fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska to find it permanently empty. Don't know they're dying. Perry talks about his dreams of a yellow bird, "higher than Jesus", who attacks those who have persecuted them. "The nuns asked for grace," he says to us, "But the bird killed them anyway." Bird raised Perry to paradise. Strangely enough, Perry says he has a reluctance against nuns, God and faith. It will be repeated later in his last words if he wants an apology but he doesn't know who it is. <br /> <br /> The director puts all sorts of things and what. Nancy Cutter can bid for sleep at the clock house. He keeps the horse. Perry later commented on the picture of him and the house. Nancy can't sleep in her friends' house because her boyfriend arrives for dinner. The decision seals his fate. <br /> <br /> Perry tells Bogart about "Sierra Madre's Treasure". But this is another picture of Bogart, "Beat the Devil", written by Truman Capote, where the fictional treasure hunt is McGuffin. But Dick knows that the main characters of this movie didn't get anything. Dick wants hard cash, $ 10,000 he thinks Clutter is safe (which ironically turns out to be so fantastic as Perry's treasure in Mexico. He's thinking about mortality, ironically, his mortality is coming to an end in a matter of hours. ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours br /> <br /> Dick has said they didn't want witnesses to be remembered by anyone, later, actually, because they removed all the witnesses they remembered. <br /> <br /> "One witness," the detective says to Dick later, but was it a witness to a prisoner friend Dick, Perry, Truman Capote or God? The viewer will be witnessing after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Exciting film.
