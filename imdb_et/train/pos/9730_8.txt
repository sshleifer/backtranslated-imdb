UK newspaper reviews seem to have focused on the fact that reviewers are familiar with Toby Young, a journalist whose actual experience is the basis of this film. The keyword here is "based". Losing friends is a fictitious romcom. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young joins the prestigious journalism magazine in New York, where he continues to create gaffe before he finally gets it right and does it. That means he sells out and the film has some serious points about the integrity of the press. But they are not superfluous: the main substance remains a comedy that focuses on Sidney's malformations. The script has its own cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid, well-meaning Sunday, while being a smart, moderately unpleasant qualified writer. This contradiction is never such a big problem as Simon Pegg's (like Sidney) projects prove too well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges gives Sidney's editor too little, and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous, as the controversial subject of Sidney's affection and the Megan Fox (who plays the bimbo's star) can only say this: just say, Miss Fox, and I'll leave my wife, sell all my stuff and buy a plane ticket to bring my place to you as your consortium. Of course, given that I am a fat 56-year-old English accountant, you may not find my offer too tempting, but it is always on the table. Considering how short his career has been, it may be thought that Megan Fox has a bit too early to take on a role that ruthlessly captures an actor who can be expected: but he does it nicely, with some skill and very sexually. This girl goes a long way. <br /> <br /> Various experienced performers - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the USA. > There are a lot of ridiculous moments and I smiled largely. As always, the F-word performs when it doesn't really need to, though at least a couple of them are very funny.
