I show this film to university students in the Law on Speech and Media because its lessons are timeless: why talking about injustice is important and can bring about oppressed oppression. Why freedom of the press and freedom of expression are important for democracy. This is the story of how the world of apartheid was directed through the press of Steven Biko and Donald Woods. It also provides an important lesson of freedom of expression: "You can blow out the candle, but you can't blow out the fire. When the flame comes to an end, the wind blows the more." (By Biko by shaking Peter Gabriel on the tree).
