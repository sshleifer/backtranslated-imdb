I remember it when it appeared in the Palo Alto theater and didn't expect much. I mean - Australian movie? But it finally came to me. Here's the scene. Richard Chamberlain sits perpendicular to Sidney's apartment, which is home to the Australian Aboriginal parent, Charlie. <br /> <br /> Chamberlain: "You were out of my house last night. You?" And Charlie responds at a deliberate pace: "Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? .. Are you a fish? Are you a snake? Are you a man ?.Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? "This is a stunning scene, shooting all close-ups where Chamberlain's gently beautiful face fills the screen Charlie has a black, nose, bearded vision. <br /> <br /> Two men could not be different and this movie is a story about how Chamberlain accidentally collides with his humorous legal existence in the inexplicable, almost inexplicable mysteries of Charlie's world. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'll go much on a plot. This is a kind of apocalyptic story. But I have to say that anyone who has researched the Australian indigenous religion systems should become a plus. They all have a parallel universe, where dreams are real, from the direction of the bone to the dream time. It is an extremely horrible film without musical pieces or vivid special effects. The Charly world just begins to penetrate Chamberlain's dreams for reasons that are never quite clear. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the script, that's it. Nothing is ever clear. Does Chamberlain, who seems to have extraordinary communication with Aborigines, dies in the last wave? Are Aborigines? Is Sidney Whole? The basic assumption is also a bit difficult to accept, although it is a fantasy. Aborigines have invested in the spiritual forces that Americans give to American Indians, while the fact that mythology is mythology, and while one may be more complicated or satisfying - elegant and beautiful, if desired - mythology is still trying to overcome ordinary, demanding and sometimes frustrating physical presence. Charlie's mystery is more convincing that Moses' miracles Cecil B. DeMille's "Ten Commandments", but they are under the brothers. <br /> <br /> But I don't care about it. As a film, it is pretty good and it is especially important to celebrate the fame of the director, Peter Weir and the Australian film industry. It was the first wave of big movies from antipodes, some of which were dirty, like "Mad Max" and some fine and dramatic, like "Lantana". I like Weir's things that resemble Nicholas Roeg's pregnancy with unconscious fear. Try the example of "Picnic at Hanging Rock" on how to make a really cool movie not with one drop of blood.
