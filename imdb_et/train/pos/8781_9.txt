I consider myself to be a little bit of a joker and as such I have only one thing that won't let me call "Gentleman Jim", the best boxing ever made. This is Robert Wise / Paul Newman's flick "Somebody Up There Likes Me." This movie can be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is a close number 2. <br /> <br /> The film does not simply crown James J. Corbett's rise, but also shows the sport of boxing. important time of transition. At the end of the 19th century, the boxing shifted away from the brutal days of the rules of the naked fist because of the "gentle" days that were on the Queensbury rules marquee. And sports the league away from the days when it was an illegal sight and the direction of acceptance and respect. <br /> <br /> Gentleman Jim is not a realistic look these days. It's a romantic and sometimes a little hockey. But always happy. Errol Flynn is perfect as "Gentleman" Jim, who really is not a "gentleman" at all, but just a quick talk of the workgroup family. Alexis Smith is quite tempting as a top-class woman with whom she has a love / hate relationship (and we all know that this is, of course, a love that will win what's right). <br /> <br /> At the end of "Gentleman Jimi", a great John L Sullivan (whose famous line is NOT "I can lick any man in the world" of course ... romanticism again) over his belt to Corbett. It is really one of the best scenes for any ever made sporting events. Realistic? But wonderful. Hey, if you want to see reality instead of "Raging Bull". This is a much more realistic boxing film. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more fun.
