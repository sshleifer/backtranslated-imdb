Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertainment at the same time. The result is uneven but generally fun. Keaton balances all three aspects of his wiring quite well. Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very bad in his supporting role. Otherwise, it is quite an enjoyable time capsule.
