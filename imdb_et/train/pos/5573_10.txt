HAVE TO TAKE! I saw WHIPPED in the press and it was fun. We're talking about a nonstop laugh. This makes SOMETHING MARY a seemingly prone drama. Amanda Peet screams with the quality of her combination of beauty, brain and serious ability to act. Director Peter Cohen has made a top-notch film that shows men's egos in the urban world. With all this comedy, Whipped succeeds in its intelligence. What is so rare for the first time, especially for romantic comedy. He's a great talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber round off the depth of the pain and with very strong performances, as it would be the men of a slippery woman. You have to see that these men go to work and stick to Peet's web. Check out the trailer at whipped.com, it's worth a 3-minute download.
