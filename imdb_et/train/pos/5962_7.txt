I've seen the deaths of "80s rocker horrors" over the years, from debris such as "Terror on Tour" to ridiculously fun gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2". Somehow I managed to put it down, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and well received. Well, I finally got it done and it's just the most terrible (but almost always loving!) Subgroup. The plot (which was in the movie "Black Roses" pretty much raised) concerns the impressive malformation called Eddie, whose ridicule in her high school for the taste of her music. He loves the 80s metal, especially his idol Sammi Curri (played by late big Tony Fields.) After killing Samm, Eddie's favorite radio DJ gives him the final recording of Samm. When Eddie plays the record back, he discovers that he is a bit tougher, and bad things will happen to those who paralyze him. Is Sam's music? "Trick or Treat" is well done and compilation. Special effects are fantastic, even though they have typical 80s laser beams. I grew up in the 80s and although I was not a heavy metal fan, I remember the city's legend about how to play back, listening to Satan's worship. Haha! I also remember that my older siblings and neighbors said that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it's fun to see that they both make a harm as a safe radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. If only I had seen this movie as a child! Although the film seems to be funny in the popular 80s between the alleged devil worship and heavy metals, the viewer never sees why Sammi Curr has come back from the dead, causing anyone to go on his way to devastation and killing. This is the weakest point of the movie, but if you forget it, it's fun.
