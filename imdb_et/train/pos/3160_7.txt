This show has all the typical characters of comedy: a good boy, an idiot, a pervert, a rich girl ... but it's set for the 70's. This is the only difference he has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you like this show. His humor is pathetic! The jokes are so direct ... The typical dialogue is: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (Public laughs) Jackie: Fez you're perverted (the audience laughs) Fez: Oh yeah, I'm (for the audience joyful and laudable)" That's not funny. I think if it doesn't laugh (I don't know how you call it in English, sorry), you wouldn't want to laugh at all. It's not a smart comedy, it's an insult to the public. I like most of the American comedies, but it's not good at all. I'd give it out of 10 out of 10.
