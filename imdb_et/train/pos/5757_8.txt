This movie only started in the 1970s !! This is a strange action film placed in small California workers. Some mill or factory closes, so suddenly stunning bad behavior on the streets! The townspeople are tired! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to recruit his brother Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnamese Vet who looks and behaves little in balance. He hangs with other worst veterans in Vietnam. They come to clean up the city (they are replaced), but under these good deeds they actually work on gambling, ask for protection for money, and so on. It will take some time for people to catch up, and in the biblical Cain and Abel showdown, Vincent has to take his older brother. This film has an interesting blue collar that makes it interesting (note the scene of fighting against the flaws!). Vincent is almost angelic in this role? he thinks so high about his brother that he cannot imagine he has committed evil deeds. Finally, does he reach his senses? his girlfriend Victoria Principal has been attacked upside down and beaten at her own home. Kris Kristofferson is very effective with Aaron. He kindly denies all kinds of false deeds and even gently coughs and speaks Vincent's young daughter (he refers to him as "the son of Aason") even when he threatens his father's life, smiling all the time! Vincent and Kristofferson have a good contrast with each other. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting look as a "salon" girl who attracts Aaron's attention. It's a good 70's acting film, if it is!
