This film was great. <br /> <br /> The type was uneven. <br /> <br /> Action sequences worked out. <br /> <br /> But if you can laugh enough, it was quite an exciting romp that united Keystone Cops and Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> Caves were more stupid than bad. The good guys were not too good. Black actors played black stereotypes rather than ordinary characters. <br /> <br /> Child involvement was good. Compassion might otherwise have been a bit difficult. <br /> <br /> I have to agree to action. It was generally very good. I really wanted to beat Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And after all, is it not really a good movie character who wants to get the judge Reinhold?
