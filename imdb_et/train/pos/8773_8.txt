Errol Flynn is "Gentleman Jim" in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett, known as a man who beat John L. Sullivan. The film is directed by Flynn's good friend Raoul Walsh, also known as Alexis Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale Sr, William Frawley and Ward Bond. Flynn plays an ambitious, egotistical young man with natural talent for boxing and sponsored by an exclusive Olympic club in San Francisco in the late 1800s. What is important is that he is a "shanty Irish man" and the social climber is building up an annoyance for the members of the Olympic Club; most of them can't wait to see him lose the fight, and he has contributed to him. Nevertheless, he rises to fame, even acting as an actor. Finally, he gets the chance he is waiting for with World Champion John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan requires a $ 10,000 deposit to ensure that Corbett seems to be fighting for a $ 25,000 wallet. Corbett and his leader (Frawley) get desperate money. However, the aid is very unlikely. <br /> <br /> This is a very fun movie and Jim Corbett has a great role for Flynn, himself a professional fighter at once. He has the necessary charm, good looks and athleticism. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, his romantic interest, who demands that he hate him. In real life he does not seem to have been; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris in 1886-1895. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Corbett and his career, not during the boxing. Corbett used scientific methods and innovation and is thought to be prizefighting in the art form. In the movie, there is a Corbett Park and avoids his opponents; it is believed that he wore this way John L. Sullivan. <br /> <br /> A good movie to get Flynn too short of a superstar.
