This is a good family show with great actors. It's nice to break the reality that shows late. There's nothing else on television right now if you don't think Joan is like Arcadia because he also has a career line. Anyway, it's worth checking out the clubhouse because Jeremy Sumpter gives the headmaster (Pete Young) a kind of pleasure and naivety that is tempting without being too sweet and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round off the rest of the cast cast members and everyone is terrible in their role. I like Kirsten Storms like Pete's sister Betsy; he is quite a pill, but he cares for mom and brother, although he hates to show it. It may take a few episodes to find this foot, but the clubhouse is just one of the best examples that come along for a long time, so look out for people - you're glad you did!
