The 700 clubs provide an excellent perspective on world events. Some of them have described it as unpleasant or cheesyks. I find the program informative and inspiring. For many, it is natural that mud sludge to a program that has proven to be so successful. There are very few examples that show 40 years of success in the world of television media and 700 clubs are one of them. While Mr Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone has to be murdered, I find it curious that so many people literally drive themselves to a criticism contest. I have certainly said stupid things in my life. I would definitely agree to forgive Robertson because he puts out a big show.
