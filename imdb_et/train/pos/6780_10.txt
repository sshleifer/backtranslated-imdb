Colman's work is backed up by a well-written script. The 30's and 40's gargantuan Hollywood studios could copy some German expressionist film elements and add them to Hollywood films. very good use of shadows and light and silhouette. I really liked the scene where a third of the lights in the dressing room turns off near the beginning of the movie, and he starts to pronounce Otello when his face instantly becomes dark and evil. Already the viewer sees Shakespeare's text and drama to get "Tony" and he goes on his journey. I also enjoyed the dramatic death of the scene when she became emotionally burned and accidentally gets her costume too hard for her. Her actions "Tony Stop You Hurting Me" are chilling and suspenseful. you just don't know if he's going over the vertex and kills him at any moment. tracing a cat and mouse to expose the killer, was added nicely two-thirds of the film to add some faster pace and add the film to the narrative element. Master work by George Cukor. He's such a skilful director. Great movie. Too bad they don't like them ...
