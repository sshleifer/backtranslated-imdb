The river is one of those films that deserves to be seen in the theater, so its size can be genuinely appreciated. The action is wonderful and underestimated, every gesture and smile and carrying it with the arrow. Brad Pitt gives radiant power and Tom Skerrit is a powerful preacher father. Film moves like a river, you have to be prepared to follow it through ebbs and currents, but in the end it is worth it.
