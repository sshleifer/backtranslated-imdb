I'm a kung fu fan but not a Woo fan. I'm not interested in gangster movies that are filled with a general weapon. Now, martial arts; * it's beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here, offering a very fun kung fu movie that has almost * too much fighting, when such a thing is possible! That's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many fighting scenes are very good (and some are less good) and the main characters are fun and enjoyable. The bad guys are a bit too incredible, but fun. You Must See The Sleeping Wizard !! She can only be when she sleeps, fight - it's hysterical! <br /> <br /> In recurring viewing, the latter may be a bit bored and long-lasting for the competition, especially since many fighting scenes are actually not so good. So I appreciate it "only" in 10 out of 10. But it is almost "8". <br /> <br /> All in one of the best kung fu movies that are the prime minister of the kung fu cinema. All really good kung fu films have been in the mid to late 1970s, with some remarkable exceptions in the late 60s and early 70s (and early 80s to be fair).
