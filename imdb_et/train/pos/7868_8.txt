What's more, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you to the wild side. And it is remarkable, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai hi-society - stars and asterisks, glamor and witch doctors, business types and broker types, all smelly batches - is a sharp focus here. In a typical tabloid way, their worlds are opened, where each colorful story is a clever sub-block itself. <br /> <br /> A combat star, produced by a post-pregnancy stewardess and his high-level spouse. pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, reporters and police captain; all the tones on the screen and countless tones. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar is working on the dirt to dig up the dirt for kings, dances and living dead. Atul Kulkarni packs a punch like Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as a reporter for a former criminal, but she could have been a little busy with job changes and the chain of parties. <br /> <br /> Very focused (driving time 140 min) and refreshingly different movie, worth the money.
