This movie is fantastic. Finally well-written characters that can be loved by all their good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is uncertain in this self-acting role. I think it's the best he ever did. He has done other roles that showed that they are capable of this type of full-fledged work, but that role finally gave him room to do it. I almost died when she walked over her underwear and boots in the hotel lobby. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis also have couples who want, but also actors. Kinnear is so funny that she is really happy at the end. You give good players a good job to play, and they give us something more back.
