I just got this video and I watched it last night. The action started extremely bad (hey ------ hey ------ twister), but I got very good after the wards. The tower portions seemed extremely fake and many CGI effects were very upset, but the scene where the house was burst and the content inside which was blown and sucked was very well done and almost equivalent to films like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also very well done. The story was very well written and it is refreshing to see such a film that has been mistaken for the same old "disaster formulas" that this genre seems to have stood for 30 years. <br /> <br /> Although this movie had a very strange mix of FX and functional quality that deserves my A-book.
