"Girlfight" follows a New York High School girl from a lively way of thinking to the world of amateur boxers, where she finds self-esteem, purpose and much more. Although the film does not mean boxing, the box is all about the movie. So much so that you get an almost sweaty smell. Technically and artistically, this good gut with honesty and reality, "Girlfight" is not a chick flick and "Rocky". Rather, it is a very human drama that even viewers who do not know boxing can contact them.
