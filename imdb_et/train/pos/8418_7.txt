Russian emigrant director in Hollywood (William Powell) casts his epic on the Russian Revolution in 1928 and hires an old former General of the Tsarist regime (Emil Jannings) to play the film's general and both live drama and memory that was nine years ago (Evelyn Brent ). <br /> <br /> Try the way I can, I feel it is hard to warm the "last command" for all your virtues. "The New York Docks" was undoubtedly a great movie and "Underworld" is a movie I've always seen, but "The Last Command" is quite difficult. The prerequisite is exciting, but the treatment really does make the script come true, except for the Hollywood sequences that represent processing of work attachments and large-scale film production and cutting-edge technology. br /> <br /> Emil Jannings is a predictably wonderful Russian general who perfectly distinguishes between a traumatic and frustrated old ex-general, who is in his misery, and a powerful, cheerful commander. <br /> <br The end is great and worth waiting for, but in order to get there, you have to be bored at times.
