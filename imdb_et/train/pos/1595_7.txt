Although I would say I enjoy this example, I was expecting something completely different when I first saw: "I like you" I expected to find something like "All this" (I'm not sure if this happens more)) but i have to say that i like this show and although i don't classify it as a breakthrough, it is very charming and i also like the language between characters (including support cast) i would definitely say that it's nice to see Wesley Jonatan back on the screen because I loved her in City Guy. I had also seen a woman playing Valerie's friend in popularity and although I think it was a good show, I really don't like her character in this show because she's not just my cup, but she rounds it pretty well
