"Brave New Girl" comes from a small town in Holly from Texas, singing "Texas Yellow Rose" at a local competition and receiving a prestigious art college in Philadelphia. From there, the film grows into a story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it at a very nice pace. It was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding as well as Nick Roth. The work of the camera was really well done and I was finally very happy (it may seem like a sequel). Knit to the director and everyone else who participated in this production. Pretty pearl in film archives.
