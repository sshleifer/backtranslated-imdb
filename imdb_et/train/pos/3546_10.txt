One of the best music ever made is an example of where producers and directors were not afraid to choose their talents, rather than what people would expect. Lighting and kit are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (it has a special name that I don't think). The dialogue is also unique because no contractions are used. The film has been well developed from the beginning to the end, beautifully worked and interesting. True joy is Music. Such a number of first-rate songs from beginning to end, perfectly executed and orchestrated. Music is also very original and memorable, and I think it is better than many of the thirty to sixties musicals. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which can only have two or three. Not bad for a director who doesn't have this type of movie experience. Another quality is that every time he sees it is fresh.
