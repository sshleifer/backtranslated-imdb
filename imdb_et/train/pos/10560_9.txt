Jimmy Cagney constantly travels the story of this stage director who fights vigorously for future "talk" films. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deception, women, and dance is such that you will never be treated as a boring moment as a viewer. The direction of the scenes in the sample mass was very well done. At this frantic pace, the story has never disappeared. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the materials listed here have become a bit dated, but it doesn't matter because you look at it in 1933. it's awesome to look at it alongside the drops of many other films that appeared during this time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is an eye-catcher in this film that will never lose its exposure as ever as filmmaker-producing producers. In this way, he tries to get his ass out of business, he had started a large-scale manufacturer before. Joan Blondell is a fabulous, unnoticed interest in love, Nan, she gives such a cheerful performance that is so unusual for movies of this time, so cool to watch a woman portrayed as a strong woman. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the film was the huge productions at the end. They were in themselves excellent, beautifully choreographic and perfectly produced, but they just didn't seem to fit the story. The only link they have with the main story is that Cagney had to make three previews of the contract within 3 days and that was what he did. It was hard for me to believe that this was what the girls practiced throughout the film and that these kits could be a cinema. In this way, "Sitting in the backyard" was a much more appropriate story. <br /> <br /> The end results seemed to stop this frantically tempo story and it wasn't good. I was tired after the first musical sequence and then I realized two more were coming. These sequences also received a lot of smiles from the audience. <br /> <br /> All in all, the great movie was a sour end. <br /> <br /> 9/10
