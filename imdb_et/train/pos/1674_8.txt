Lisa Baumer (East Galli) is a big business man's adulterous woman who suppresses $ 1 million of life insurance when her husband is killed in a business accident on a business trip, initially suspected of being responsible for his recent spouses being changed and thus being a fellow researcher Peter Lynch ( George Hilton) and Interpol's agent on his tail. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece, to make money for his inheritance, but requires it in cash ... a dangerous course of events. Lynch, whose identity is now known to Baumer, is trying to protect her from the lover of her husband Lara Florakis, who, along with her companion Sharif, tries to kill them so much of the amount she considers to be right. And this is where our masked killer starts his cruel killings. The Greek police first suspect our hero's usual Lynch and warns that police inspector Stavros will not leave Athens (the familiar face of Luigi Pistill in Giallo and Spaghett). Lynch is then assisted by a magnificent Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps her investigate murders. Let's say that it can spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, so it's enough to say that there are enough red herring and most of them believable to keep Mystery / Thriller fans out of Giallo in this story. The No Shame DVD has an excellent transmission with both English and Italian audio. This is also a very memorable score for a good action that Bruno Nicolai can stop for a while.
