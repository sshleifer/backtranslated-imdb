Thanks to Jymn Magon for Disney's two best cartoons. This exhibition has improved significantly over the years. As a child, I didn't like it because I thought it was a Ducktales break that was my favorite Disney thing (like Grandmoffromero). Then later, though it was good but not great. But after reading the comment I decided to give it another chance and bought a DVD set and watched the whole pilot the first day I got it, and I was very pleasantly surprised. It's still my favorite episode, though the series was like that. At the end of the disc 1, I knew it was a top tennis. <br /> <br /> Characters are so complex and charming. My favorite must be Wildcat. He's totally fun and cute. My next favorite is the best pilot of the show, Baloo. I see why Jymn built an exhibition around him. Then it is Kit Cloudkicker. He & Baloo is the best in the series. After that, Louie. Jim Cummings did the perfect job with the original voice. After him, Rebecca. She has made me laugh and I believe she and Baloo will marry. And finally (for heroes), Molly. Although he is my least favorite, I still like it. I think she's a very cute character (much better than Ducktalesi Webby). And the villain was very original. Don Karnage and his air pirates always broke me up, Kahn is cold and ruthless, and Thembrians are always at least amusing. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, the stories go wild (time is waiting) Bear, a romantic red champion) something about touching (old man and Seaduck, lost paradise), fun, funny and exciting adventures (an ancient hit) in search and my favorite to Bell Bell). These are just some of my favorite episodes. Anyway, Talespin Disney is the best except Gummi Bears. GB had a decent amount of my favorite character (Cubbi), while TS didn't have enough Wildcati. But finally Talespin remains a classic. BOTTOM LINE-10/10 6. The best comic ever.
