This movie sat in my Tivol weeks before I watched it. I was afraid of a self-conscious yuppie flick that talks about bad relationships. I was wrong; it was an appealing excursion to New York's folded libido. <br /> <br /> The format is the same as Max Ophuls 'La Ronde', based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Credit" game, starting with one person, a prostitute, standing in the corner of Brooklyn Street. who is sex with her car but can't come in. She refuses to pay her. If she peees, she answers her mobile phone and takes the message. She runs away with her keys. <br /> <br /> he pleases him, he is desperate and unhappy, he tells him how beautiful and happy he is. If he leaves, he asks if he is desperate and unhappy. She is sitting on her, bouncing up and down. This time she comes, she leaves. <br /> <br /> Woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends. Hubby (Robert) talks about business, woman (Ellen) is boring and swapping the topic of sex and how often men j a woman thinks about it. Later, after leaving the guests, Ellen tries to attract Robert's sex. Robert doesn't want anything and puts it on a jazz disc. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert turns the music up; Ellen turns on the TV; Robert turns on another TV. Caffeine occurs. Ellen goes up to the roof, Robert joins her. Ellen admits she needs to experience more men than men other than Robert. Robert says he must also experience men. <br /> <br /> Next, we follow Robert when he visits Steve Buscem's artist. I want Buscemi to get more of these roles than he is a sexy, intelligent, perfectly desirable man. Robert praises Martin's work much more than he deserves, promising to show it. Martin is excited until it turns out that Robert is talking about his groin, it's a pair of dances. Robert tries to kiss, Martin on his lips, and Martin pulls back, saying he's not gay. Robert says he's not gay, Martin scoffs. Both recognize that artworks are bad. Robert leaves when Martin allows Robertil to kiss him. They're out and Robert goes to Martin. <br /> <br /> Next, we follow Martin when he is preparing for an art exhibition at Manhattan Gallery. He strikes Anna as an administrator, played by Rosario Dawson. (I had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words) ... and they love each other. <br /> <br /> Next we follow Anna, who is sitting at lunch. His boyfriend, Nick (Adrian Grenier), enters with flowers. He's cold against him; he tries to find out why. He congratulates him on the information he has sex with someone in San Francisco. She pulls out of her the fact that she has been with her former gf in San Francisco and has sex with her. The last revelation is wrong. They both prepare lunch, but decide they have to break down. Nick is cordial. <br /> <br /> And we follow Nick, who confesses his worries to an older woman he meets on a park bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is a strange kind of child, but is a good audience for Nick who needs a sympathetic ear. Two of them go to Coney Island at night and look at the stars. Nick remains under Joey's spell, despite their age difference. They go back to Joey's apartment and Nick realizes that she is going to have sex with an old woman. She's on her, she doesn't want to let her go. But he's able to escape. <br /> <br /> (This is the best role of Carol Kane as he played in Latke's wife's taxi.) Joey's phone rings and this is the guy who calls the Psychic Friends Network and Joey is one of his psychological friends. Although still suffering from Nick, he gradually gets into his psyche. The man is in his office late at night and wants to have sex with him. Although it is not Joey's activity, Joey goes along and breaks the future. He wants to talk, although he wants to get out of the phone and finds that he has got a lot of money out of his business and finds out tomorrow. His life has been destroyed. Joey understands that he is going to commit suicide and he tries to believe that he is his friend, that he cares about him. And he cares about him. <br /> <br /> But the man wraps his gun in his suitcase and goes out to look for a prostitute on the shore of Brooklin, and we're coming back to the same prostitute who started La Ronde. He wants to give him $ 75,000 when he kills him. He tried to kill himself, but he couldn't do it. Prostitute does not want to do this, but she insists on holding her hand, keeping the gun inside her mouth, telling her where to do it. Finally, the gun disappears and we see that the prostitute walks on the street and arrives at the corner where she usually does business. A contractor who did not pay him in the film earlier, rides up, rolls down the window. They look at each other. END.
