I saw it for the first time when this premiere more than ten years ago. I saw it today and it still affected me. She was fighting alone with a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), whom Jace is raping (played by David Lipper) who is hurting girls. Caitlin has clicked on a popular high school, but when he discovers that he is raped, the clique turns against him, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film crowns Caitlin's struggle against the whole city, including a high school that allows athletes to identify their social environment, allowing them to get away with whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Others and greens are top performers and there are real chemistry between the two. the whole movie. All the participants in the film who were inspired by the real events did a great job. He struggled alone, which strikes a primary school in a central environment (at least in 1995) and holds his own self-esteem and reputation at stake. Recommended. 10/10
