This is a great movie for fans of all Hong Kong movies. In addition to this small plot, a bit of weak drama and comedy, the film is an action full of weapons and martial arts. Keep me entertained from start to finish. I thought Shannon Lee was fantastic in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having an executive director like Corey Yuen, Hong Kong is strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended!
