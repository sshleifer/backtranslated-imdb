I've seen this movie to see. So far it was decided to actually rent it. It was worth it. This movie made me laugh from start to finish. Chris Rock is funny no matter what movie he is. But it should be real to be his greatest. If ur lookin is a family movie, ie pre-teens and up, then this is one u can't go over.
