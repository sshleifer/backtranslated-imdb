My baby carrier was a fan, so I saw many older episodes growing. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why I left the TV during the premiere of this TV. To my surprise, I found it to be enjoyable. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * dodges tomatoes from other fans * so I like them to focus only on these two. However, this can lead to hatred of fans of original exhibitions. I like the voice, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked to listen to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen, like Robi, likes me as he really enjoys his work as an actor. I also get technicians with their slightly autistic persons and their desire to play Dungeons and Dragons or act on Star Wars scenes (which of course are not called by these names).
