I liked the debut by Hideo Nakata, the director of the Circle. If you've seen a circle before, you'll know the style and idea of ​​this flick. It has a subtle spookiness that works better than a constant (and predictable) stingers that infect the most common films of this genre. If you like the movies that give you chills, you probably like it. Hideo Nakata is a good and horrible debut. 8/10
