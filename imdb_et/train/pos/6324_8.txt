These guys are nothing but ordinary suspects! They are a collection of pleasant oddballe with whom you want to get it, but they are so unhappy that it has very little chance. None of them is better than William H Macy, who depicts a man with a big heart, but it is probably his best result from Fargo. Sam Rockwell played the meathead boxer perfect and the rest of the gang were equally good. Luis Guzman brought some great comics like Cosimo and George Clooney stole every scene for his role on the ground. At the end of the Heist scene was completely fun. <br /> <br /> The direction was also by Russian-speaking brothers. There were definitely Coen brothers who know the movie and it's interesting to see how they develop their career. They have a long way to match Coen, but this is a great start and look forward to their next celluloid outing. ....... "Yo mutha whore"!
