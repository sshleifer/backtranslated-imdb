Or, I love stopping any formula image of this movie. I've visited it repeatedly and it's always up. Somewhat too stylized, but I think all the opera players love it. The Canadian compatriot Norman Jewison takes enormous opportunities with his films and casting, and it almost always pays off in movies that are in the middle and somehow delicious as it is. I have often thought about Cher's lack of operational positions, regardless of whether he has decided to minimize this part of his life or that he does not get enough good roles to chew. I found that she is a great actor who can play back like this one, or be bold and brave, as "Mask". I found that comedy shots were occasionally wide (hair salon called "Cinderella"), but that was the intention of both the writer and the director. Nicolas Page plays opera opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point calling for a knife to break his throat. Brooklyn's scenes are magical, it's Brooklyn's moonlight, romantic and dramatic, like an opera. All in all, a movie that didn't like every taste with long shots, and I loved the end, all brought together like a Greek cream, every part that was subtly nuanced and mixed with others, the camera pulled down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.
