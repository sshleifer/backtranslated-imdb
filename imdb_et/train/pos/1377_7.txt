In those areas where they overlap, this fine film lighted the year before 2004, which gave the impression of rheumy's eyes and heavy breathing young girls. Here the effect is much more realistic and indeed enters into the heads of the three main characters, because they are putting their way through the adolescents who have been robbed under the pitfalls. These three principals, unknown to me, provide very solid items, in fact, one that can be so natural that it is difficult for them to copy this quality from other films, so I wouldn't be too surprised to hear them again. It would be nice if it could go from art houses to multiple locations where there is only an external chance that it can "talk" to the bubble crowd.
