This early version of "The Prague Student" was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also "Golem" a few years later). In this film, he plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old movie to see them with the same stroke) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes him a pact for gold - the gold he needs to save for the countess since his death. <br /> <br /> Fast paced movement (movie lasts just over an hour) and pretty well written and featured: "Prague student" also has Faust legend shots and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, starting with a pact with a mysterious an indicator of potential evil and develops into the good and evil aspects of the same person.
