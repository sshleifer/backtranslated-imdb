Recently, I watched the 54th version of this movie with Judy, and although I appreciated that story and music, I found that the film couldn't keep my attention. I waited for the '76 remake of the same story except Barbra's twists. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and all its prices. This version is so much more real than "54", which has undoubtedly better music, better performance, a more engaging line, and of course deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is in the top 100 listings of the American Film Institute, while this thrilling remake does not make any list of critics.
