"High slaughter" is perhaps the most underestimated slip in the 1980s. This is one of the few films in this genre that always amazes me. Nonetheless, it is strongly based on the traditional slasher formula: a group of young men and women kill gruesomely one by one until the final showdown. <br /> <br /> The reason why "killing high" stands for the most movies in your genre is that it goes more than the top. Killer Marty has a good reason to intimidate his former classmates. They eat her when she was naked in the girls' dressing room, walked with her knee elbow, and she pulled her experiment from the research lab down so it could interfere with her. <br /> <br /> The victims of this movie are about as insignificant as you can. When they reunite years later - Marty's self-imposed high school meeting, you realize that they haven't matured so much. They're a lot of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense why they do not know why they were the only ones who once again showed up at a meeting that is going on at school, which has been left behind since then. And who thinks it is a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in an abandoned building, in a room with old cabinets - as well as in Marty's? There is a lot of faith that the viewer needs to enjoy this movie. The end makes little or no sense at all. And the scriptwriters have a strange understanding of how the April solstice works: The film says that after noon no more scams are allowed. <br /> <br /> Film is one of the best examples of Slasher's genre, despite all its mistakes. It is hard to see why he has not yet reached the DVD when there are so many other mill sliders with special publications.
