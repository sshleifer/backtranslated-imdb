OK, so the songs were badly written and generally bad songs (though Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sounded pretty good). And so they crushed the fourth wall at the end when the king and his nobles sang "battle" with ogre and praised Puss in Boots for not being aware of the rights. /> <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, who makes a movie in fairy tales, and he sings and dances. His style fits very well, as a terrifying, mischievous Puss who seems to have his master going into deeper and deeper problems, but in fact he has a plan he thinks about seven or eight moves. And if you've ever seen Walken in some of his bad roles, then you know * that ogre dusted up the HARD when Walken got his trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie and black-all for anyone who enjoys Christopher Walken's unique style.
