I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and I was interested in 106 minutes. I like documentaries but often find them by dragging them in about 25 minutes. Forbidden Lie $ has been turned on, never losing interest. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is a Jordanian woman who found fame and happiness in 2001 with her book Forbidden Love. his Muslim friend, whom his family murdered for communicating with a Christian man, speaks. A few years later, some journalists began to hit the story, which led the public to believe that it was a fraud. The film covers it quickly but thoroughly from the beginning, and from there we spend most of the time in Norma trying to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating wife for studying, and she does endless interviews with Khoury when she searches for the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, worried about the unpleasant portrait of her Jordanian Muslim colors. He refuses to return to Jordan and shows us the facts. However, Broinowski is not scary and puts the pieces slowly in front of us. Of course, what we find is a little point and it is very difficult to follow, and finally we do not know whether to believe Norma or not. She has been either quite unjustly trying to survive, or a fantastic spinster. The lies, the truth, and the half of the truth that he is watching through the film are brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses many interviews as well as dramatizations to tell the story, and Broinowski uses these dramatizations to show us why people like Norma are able to exist: we want to be connected. We go to the cinema every day and let us believe what is real on the screen. It might just be a little too much stuff to read, it didn't come after Brionowski's movie Q&A, but I took it away. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent Australian movie and must receive international releases and prizes when you ask me. Definitely the best movie I saw in AFF07. <br /> <br /> Go when you get this opportunity.
