Visconti's first film has all the visual appearance and impeccable technique of his brand, with the massive productions of Massimo Girotti as a beautiful bow and the best of Clara Calamai as a fabulous, frantic Giovanna. Restart several times as "Postmen twice" but never better. You can't believe it was the man's first movie! It shows someone's confidence during their career.
