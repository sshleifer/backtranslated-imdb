Group model caliber San Francisco women who have been from primary school, suddenly threaten and attack someone who sends them strange Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? <br /> <br /> My rating often changes the movie for later viewing - sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. But I don't remember another movie where my rating has changed as drastically as Valentine. For the first time, when I looked at it, I thought it was a terrible thing to show up in the theater - I gave it to 4 out of 10, which corresponds to the "F" class. Looking at this a second time last night, I don't remember what the hell I didn't like. I can only assume that maybe I was in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any case, I loved it this time, giving him 9 out of 10 or "A". <br /> <br /> It may seem ridiculous to say that I didn't get such a movie, but there's something to get. Valentine is almost comedy / horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for the 1998 Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teenage horror formula that became so popular after Scream (1996) and in 1996. is almost absurd (where absurdity is a positive stylistic concept). In addition, he gives us a movie full of humorous comments on romantic relationships. Humor is unusual in that it has the same cumbersome tone as teenage horror. Most of the film's situations and villains, humorous or not, are related to Valentine's Day theme. <br /> <br /> Many viewers separate points from clichés. - Issued but unlikely scenarios and plot development. In view of the above, the film is deliberately a cliché, unlikely and ridiculous. It's as if Blues tries (and usually succeeds) to overcome a typical teenager by mocking / looting genre conventions, while at the same time erasing erosion. This is an irony of attraction, based on the horror movie Valentine's Day. This is a discomfort that has been cleverly woven around the film and is at the heart of Slasher's genre, making it the main feed for Valentine's extravagant lampoon. Scream had a similar goal with his horror, but the twist was that the film was "self-conscious." Valentine's Day is not deliberately self-conscious; the viewer must rely on contextual clues for the satire. Sometimes I think in the movie "I have read too much", it is worth noting that Blanks said in the interview that he "did not want to just make another movie after the Urban Legend" and that Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something "adult". <br /> <br /> Other viewers may not like the fact that Valentine's Day is as different as the supposed source material, Tom Savage's same-name novel. The novel characters, settings and plot are very different from the movie. Sellers have said: "Although it was a good book, I didn't think it was the right story for the movie." Instead, a novel that was much drier and more serious than the launch pad was used as a motive to create variations for a horror / thriller story focused on Valentine's Day. While these facts do not help purists to recognize such a book as a movie, it is useful to understand why the film has its own different chart and attitude. Obviously, it is better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> The empty direction is visually impeccable. Valentine's Day has a lush look with sophisticated, deep colors, interesting sets and good performance. The barrels are adorable to keep your villain and attacking scenes with not too dark, clearly expressed activities. He also drives his actors terribly, often catalyzing humorous presentations. David Boreanaz, like Adam Carr, is involved in many funny moments. <br /> <br /> Although Valentine's Day is not a masterpiece, it is a very good horror / thriller film that seems to be strongly prone to misconceptions. If you look at it, it expects something more language-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it much more.
