One of the best documentaries of recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. In 1998, Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela, his support was largely from the poorer parts of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, coup d'Ã©tat was brief for Chavez. At that time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, where they made a documentary about Chavez for British television. Their film deconstructs the coup and its consequences and saves electrified history, inside and inside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez tried to free Venezuela from the US-imposed free market policy. Although Venezuelan oil was already state-owned, Chavez, who wanted to replace it, managed to gain private benefit. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite the fact that Venezuela is the world's fourth largest oil supplier, poverty is still there, foreign multinational corporations have literally taken away their resources. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins with Chavez's first years as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity with the poor and its various policies, which have proved to be popular among the working class locals (educational plans, oil revenues distribution, grassroots democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was an enormous advocate of education and printed thousands of copies of Venezuelan Constitution, encouraging children and adults to learn and understand. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately promised to redistribute the profits. Obviously, this oil company made it nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. The Media War. Six private TV channels immediately responded to a state-run TV channel. They questioned Chavez's motives, peace of mind, and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without a media release, the coup would not have been a success. The film explains that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily produced. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of "re-establishing democracy", the opposition impeded the state-run TV channel, ended the National Electoral Committee, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and took control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. The financial interests supported by the Military Union (supported by the US and the CIA) coupled a coup in the Presidential Palace to complete the coup. Snipers shot Chavez's supporters, but private media stations changed the film, so it turned out that the fire was directed to the opposition march, which was in fact safely relocated. <br /> <br /> 12. The police went on a shooting rifle against Chavez's supporters, bleeding on the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, who was in captivity, refused to resign. Of course, the media / government lied that he had left, but the Chavez Cabinet members passed on the truth to the international community, who eventually received a message to Venezuela via cable television. <br /> <br /> 14. The people rose, pushing back the return of the president they had chosen, which can only be constitutionally replaced by a referendum. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - This document is just over an hour. Nonetheless, it is an enthusiastic journalism and is dealt with as a 'media fight', which is rarely used. Makes a great companion of "Algier's Battle". <br /> <br /> One worth seeing.
