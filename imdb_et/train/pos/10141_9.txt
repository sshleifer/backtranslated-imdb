I was all ready for this episode, seeing that this "Master" really didn't have any horror films under his belt. But this is just the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The show was good !! I don't know how he stripped it, but we have a real talent in this episode! And while you see things that came out of the mile, it was at least entertaining and managed to deal with a 56-minute time-out that hasn't been for this series. <br /> <br In particular, I liked the end result, not the twist on one statement, but just the funny little bit where he gets, like never before, chicken pecked hubby. <br /> <br /> Really good effort. As I have said in other comments, these are not true masters who do a lot of these episodes .. but they may be masters in the future.
