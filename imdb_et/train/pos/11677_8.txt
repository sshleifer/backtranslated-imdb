I loved the Long Way Round and didn't even know about Rac Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my local grocery store. I bought this and after a little "hmm it's so good" the first episode I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was great, as did other team members. Great to see her again with Ewan. There was a fair bit of swearing there, but it didn't bother me. As far as this package is not mentioned. Thats more to do with the foolish Exemption from the classification certificate that BBFC has. They should have given him 15 languages ​​alone. <br /> <br /> A highly recommended series, I want more!
