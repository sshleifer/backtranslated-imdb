This is one of the best military films. And it's great because it focuses on values. It is a great story of human interest that is related to the dedication of honor, loyalty, love and judgment. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro have excellent leadership roles. It is wonderful to see that Master Chief's racism develops through Carl Brashear's fortune, driving and, yes, the glory of glory, towards respect and love. The title shows the source of their bond. I never noticed the last time I saw it, when Carl Lumbly, Carl Mac's father, Mac Brashear, was portrayed. In a sense, it is the cornerstone of the film that Carl is the memory of his father, which helps him carry out difficult times. <br /> <br /> I'm optional for what movies I buy. It's one of those rare things I want on my shelf. This will be many times in the future, I'm sure.
