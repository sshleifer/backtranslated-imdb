Forget campy "religious" movies that have monopolized the television / movie market ... this movie has a real sense of it. Although it can be considered a film with cheap emotional features, it is also a message of forgiveness and good morals. But I did not like the illumination of this movie ... for a movie on this topic it was too bright. I felt that it was removed from the overall attractiveness of the film, which is an almost unforgivable sin, but a recognizable majority and their performances prevent this from being monitored. <br /> <br /> Be sure to see ... buy a DVD.
