It was one of those films that I probably would never have taken out of the shelf, but it came one day to IFC and said: - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would really have lost the treasure. <br /> <br /> The object is frustrating - a young author in healing crippled accidents at a lower-class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to be a manipulative tear-jerker. But that does not happen, because it was written by Neal Jimenez after she was inadvertently paralyzed. There's no Hollywood luck here. All the patients in the church come from a wildly different background, but they share a sense of helplessness in the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a "lonely wolf", forced into an embarrassing addiction to her girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is good as a former female man whose family breaks down; but William Forsythe takes the cake tough, who decided to pay someone to lose his independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
