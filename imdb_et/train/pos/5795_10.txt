This movie is my favorite of all time !!! In this great movie you have to see Michael Jackson !! I'm always over a month watching it! This is the movie you really see, even if you are not a MJ fan, because this movie writes, like Captain EO, E.T. and Ghosts, a little movie and music history! This wonderful movie, Michael's feather, is black! And: Smooth Criminal, is really the most wonderful, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life! Thank you for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician who hits this planet, he is a good man and he always shines in his eyes when you listen to his music !! Please, if you don't know this movie, check it out and don't miss it because it would be too bad if you don't miss it! - Highly recommended movie for every movie lover
