One of my favorite films of all time. Just beautiful, full of human feelings, spirit, humor, intelligence. The story is growing, as is the lesson of life, just a wonderful movie in so many ways. <br /> <br /> Also fantastic ..... a great selection of the best British talent. I loved all of these versatile elements of the movie. <br /> <br /> Italy must be one of the most romantic places to make this story - all about this movie. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
