It's a good movie, but it's not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies. It's about two men who want the world to go away and that's exactly what they get. Action is great, the end was not predictable, and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days. People complain that the film is too simple or too boring. I think they should just stick to movies like The Toxic Avenger (I really like B movies) or Billy and Mandy Grim Adventures. One note: if you notice it, this Cube has exactly the same participants except the four participants. Make two notes: wait after the credit (trust me about it). Enjoy the movie.
