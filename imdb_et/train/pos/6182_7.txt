This mystery of murder with musical numbers is long in terms of atmosphere and character, but rather short and varied. Based on the production of Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, it combines a combinational plot of land (an evening of murder takes place where a musical revue is staged). <br /> <br /> Cast is impressive and versatile: tough toe Victor McLaglen as a police officer who drives the investigation and never fools idiotically into any showgirl who happens; Jack Oakie (pre-pre-Jack Lemmon? Or Jack Lemmon was post-war Jack Oakie?) As an harassing director who must coordinate both the staged performance and the chaos behind the scenes; increasingly homey Jessie Ralph as a dressmaker with deep, dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who is near the end of a stunning close-up monologue, such as a tremulous maid who is in love with a male leader; Carl Brisson, a star of Denmark, just this male stove, leaving classic "cocktails for two", not once, twice; Kitty Carlisle, giving operative "Where they come and where they go" and other Johnston-Coslow songs; glorious Gertrude Michael, who left us too soon as an average showgirl whose love for Brison is open; usually ridiculous Toby Wing, who at least is the center of a ridiculous rolling joke. <br /> <br /> Once the plot complications are received, there will always be an interesting performer or a fun and vocal musical number to disturb the viewer. The film's most celebrated sequence is the "Marahuana" number, led by Michaels, but aside from its contradictory history, it is really one of the smallest music offers. All the songs here are staged as if they could actually fit into the standard proscenium theater space, unlike the Busby Berkeley style cinematic fantasy setting.
