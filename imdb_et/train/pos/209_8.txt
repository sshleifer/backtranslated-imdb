Walter Matthau and George Burns work just as well. Willy's acidity with puzzled amniotic Al is a mixture made in the sky. The scene, when they meet in Willy's apartment again, is a pearl and the last scene rounds up the film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives an excellent result because it is only a stranger, a semi-retired comedian, just as he can, the intonation of voices and exaggerated drama and his general misconception about what is happening. The timing of George Burns is legendary and nowhere better than this movie, his peaceful aplomb with a dry response to the desert is memorable. Watch the end of the scene when Al and her daughter ask something from a Spanish caregiver, and Ali's reaction - priceless.
