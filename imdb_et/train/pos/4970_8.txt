Some critics found this film dark, but for me it was good humor and optimism to overcome the impression. For example, the daughter's quietly positive and stoic character is still at the heart of the film, often balancing the unfortunate aspects of setting and line art. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters and the end result is unpredictable: I felt like it could have been. <br /> <br /> By the way, many of the reviews I read refer to the use of black and white, but the print I saw on the SBS TV network shown here in Australia was full color. <br /> <br />
