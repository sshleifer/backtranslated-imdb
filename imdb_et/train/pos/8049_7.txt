In general, I have to say that I liked the film. Some fighting scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One of the things that bothered me was that they used Asian to play black men. I really mean. Talk about bad taste. In the battle phase, you will see that one of the winners of the battle laughs. Otherwise, Sammo Bruce Lee will perfectly copy the struggles. 5 out of 10 stars.
