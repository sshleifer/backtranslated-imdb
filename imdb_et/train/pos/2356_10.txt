Daisies pushing was a great show. Like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can say it's created by Bryan Fuller. I understand how people who don't have much love for theater, cinema, musicals, etc. would be disturbed. It's not an ordinary television program, and it's awesome for some. These people need a bit more linear and muted shades to keep them happy. This program explodes the color, catches the old movie scenes, amazing music and talented performances. There is nothing random about the selection made for the costume of the costume. The story takes a lot of turns, but everything is very accessible, because the conversations are related to love, honesty, courage, loss and many other things we face every day. The only regrettable aspect was the termination of the exhibition and it was rushed because Daisies was postponed. Don't approach it as a regular TV show. Think of it as an evening in the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
