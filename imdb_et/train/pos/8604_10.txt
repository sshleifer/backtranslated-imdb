I know many people don't like this movie, but I think it's divine. I can't say much, but the film is a sensitive film. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful and there are many funny features in the film, especially when Briggitta learns from the actions of society and not. If you like musicals, I'd say you want it!
