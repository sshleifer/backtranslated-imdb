Looked at it last night and it was a heartfelt story, a great character evolution and a good karmic reference that comes from the exemplary and the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without giving up the plot too much It starts with the usual river, who gets to work in his office every day, inspiring dance lessons. On the way the protagonist and various characters meet smoothly on the dance floor, they learn to learn about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story includes a prologue that shows that dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it is not so easy in Japan to learn to dance when it's here in the United States. <br /> <br /> The film is light; you laugh loudly at some sight. At the same time, it is well described. All the characters in the movie have been taken seriously, as they are, and none of them have diminished due to these "shortcomings". <br /> <br /> I have been thinking with some friends about social dance training. It just happened that a friend loaned me a video about learning dance. Is it synchronous or what? I think so because now I've really tried it. <br /> <br /> Look at this wonderful family film (little kids may not get it, but teenagers would be sure) and smile at the real care you see it over and over. <br /> <br /> Why they would do a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery because it is perfect.
