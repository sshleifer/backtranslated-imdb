This is one of the best music concerts that anyone can see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin was completely new and heard it today for the first time today, the dimension of Sir P Mc's power to capture the crowd of all ages. This dock goes behind the scenes to show us life not just for the band but for all the roads. I saw this man living in Aussie in 1975 and I can assure you that his presentation here on DVD is no less than almost 30 years ago. I have a great 5.1 surround sound system that does justice and recommends it to a particular Beatles fan. This is the closest you get to the Beatles concert today. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are few entertainers who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd. If you want to record perfect music, buy a studio recorded CD. If you want to hear raw music when it's intended and spontaneous against the crowd, this crowd's excitement and emotion - this DVD is for you.
