In general, I am not a fan of big staging movies and first of all RUKA did not take my attention. But knowing that this film was made during Soviet-dominated repression in Czechoslovakia, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how this small film with an innocent appearance was subversive. This subtitle really made the film a life and gives it a real power in the form of a work of art as well as a political statement. <br /> <br /> The sad movie is made without dialogue, but it's pretty clear what's happening. A cute little wooden man makes a clay pot and enjoys the time when a confused animated hand appears and destroys the pot - instead of making a hand for sculpture. Well, a wooden man is trying again and again to prevent his hand and do his thing. But over time, the hand becomes more demanding and eventually the man drills. And finally, the man has died thanks to a confusing hand and a hand, a sign of true hypocrisy, giving the man a funeral funeral! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is a brutal attempt by Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his dominant government. Not surprisingly, although the Czechs loved the film and gave him critical praise, the state (i.e., the hand) denied this little parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see that his people would be released a little more than two decades later with the Velvet Revolution.
