In response to a man who commented on how the film drags and who believed that the role of Jessi's brother has no purpose, my answer is: <br /> <br /> The role of Jessi's brother is to give in the form of dramatic irony. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have anticipated the full life-related troubles by looking at how Jessi's brother found out. There are several cases where Brad Pitt and his life run in parallel, for example, when Jessi's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a more divergent bar and then finds Brad Pitti a few days later. There was dramatic irony, so that Craig Sheffer's character would have greater emotional instability in the death of his brothers, knowing that he could have avoided it more and then made a more powerful mood in the film.
