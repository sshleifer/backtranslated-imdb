I wouldn't say it's a bad movie; in fact it is a typical movie type that poverty line-studios released at that time. Filmed for the monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective as a somewhat demented medical-researcher who masks as a revered member of the community. In this film, Bela and her henchmen are stealing their young brides from being disgusted and, after their death, injecting Bela's wife with a serum taken from her body to keep her young. The task of Lugos is to make it a pleasant movie, but the film also suffers from the ultra-wood letters of Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (the name of a nice place on the horror flick) is particularly bad in this case. I've seen him in many movies and TV shows and he's always the same; rigid, wood and absolutely convincing. Miss Walters is just a little better, but she also has no talent to believe her role. However, the viewer can enjoy the great activities of Lugos, which is another dirty scheme that will eventually have to be released! Despite some bad action, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a movie for everyone.
