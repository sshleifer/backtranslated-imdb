It's a great series. You laugh, you cry, these wonderful people are part of your family. The way this family cares for one another and helps each other through the crisis is a great example of how we live our lives. There are many good things they do, and a lot of bad choices, but they never turn back to family, they work through problems. The youngest daughter Michelle is the cutest thing I've ever seen. Middle daughter Stephanie suffers from Middle Child Syndrome and with her family EVERYONE it is better. The oldest daughter DJ is growing, whether his father wants it to happen or not. One thing they all share is the lack of their mother. Danny (father), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these children so much, and this is evident in every episode.
