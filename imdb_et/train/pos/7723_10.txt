Many factors make it easy for me to say that I still think it is the most important scientific literature, despite some action, outdated dialogue, and so on. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is a scale imagination that describes Krell, the natural race on the planet, now all dead who were 1 million years older than the Earth's people (us) and their technology, especially the 8,000 cubic meter machine. Secondly, there are music and sound effects that are inseparable from each other. Unlike "2001", which had traditional classical music, it creates a frightening and frightening feeling. <br /> <br /> Third, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly imaginable ever, but also based on real science. and do not break the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, a forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that tries and incredibly succeeds in making an honest, intelligent, and ruthlessly logical statement about the limits of human (or any other biological entity) development. or on the ceiling, no matter how long we live as a movement. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable destiny.
