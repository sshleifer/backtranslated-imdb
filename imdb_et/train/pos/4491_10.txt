I love this movie Spring and Port Wine. I was born in Leigh, about 7 miles from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My job was through Little Lever Farnworth every day, sometimes by bike, but then by car when I promised it would bring back all the memories to the working class neighbors who were almost always broken but who would always help you. Fred Dibnah was the holy corner of Bromwich where my bed was. If you didn't see the movie the first time you were released, you might be forgiven to compare it with soap, such as coronary St, well, I agree that it is soap, but then it was called "Kitchen Sink Drama!" Watch this movie for talented tales that soon became the frequent roles of televisions for households, I mainly look at the punches of the countryside and feel a good factor that people are poor but happy!
