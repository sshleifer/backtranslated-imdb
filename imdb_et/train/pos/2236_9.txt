Most of all about this movie, I remember that he blasted on the local KTLA TV (Chapter 5) every Christmas period from the mid-1970s to the end, mainly thanks to a true story on or near Christmas Eve. It was always a bit annoying to see the hell that this girl goes through, being a lonely survivor of an air crash in the Peruvian jungle. The young girl who pulled out her infected foot, the graphic scene made this young viewer quite impressed. Not the kind of Christmas joy I used to get used to. Definitely not the production of Rankin-Bass.
