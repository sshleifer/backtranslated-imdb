*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two such training sessions ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry seems to have regained his "Sudden Impact", "thrilling thriller". wisely plays his strengths: the Clint Eastwood charisma, who also led, and the story that spends enough time on the exposition and reserves his energy for big scenes. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time Harry takes off outside his native San Francisco (where he is again struggling with his bosses to "shoot first, ask questions later" tactics), the village of San Paulo. There, (WARNING: a potential spoiler), one person they raped for years has been murdered by murders whose sister has been catatonic since the attack. /> <br /> The killer depicts Sondra Locke and makes Jennifer Spencer's character an interesting combination of compassion and cold blood. Locke's cold eyes and cold voices, when they try to get their sister to the hospital or get rid of revenge, are very effective at painting the wrong woman, whose years of suffering and rage are beginning to bear deadly fruits. > <br /> Attackers are a despicable batch, especially a leader with a "psycho nut" practically attached to his forehead, and a lesbian who seems to be almost one of the boys, despite his anatomical inability to participate. While it is not explicitly graphically explicit, the posterior scenes are quite worrying and clearly intended to rejoice at the audience, as he kills his attackers. <br /> <br /> Some will leave a "sudden effect" in the trash: meaningless, manipulative revenge. At a certain level, it's true, but it's well done in the trash. The film's advantage is the strength of Sondra Locke's performance, which gives us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. What we have here is from the point of view of the film. <br /> <br /> You can take or leave the idea that some misconceptions deserve punishment by any necessary means, but because the secret behind the fears comes to Harry (understanding that intelligent dialogue is not provided), he has a choice - what to do a killer whose motivation he can express compassion, but whose behavior is bound by law not to endure. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry fare. <br /> <br /> The second quality of redemption is Eastwood's direction. After all, this filthy Harry movie and Eastwood knows this character better than anyone else. The film is focused on style and wisdom, and edited to give high scores to action scenes. Some of the best "Harry Moments" in the series are here, including Harry's most famous line, "Go ahead - do my day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden Influence" is a film that has the courage to convict the story of offensive crime and the resulting brutal consequences. It is also a damn detective story that is well done and well-spoken. And it is definitely not boring. For these criteria, it succeeds tremendously.
