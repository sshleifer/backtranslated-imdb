I can't really condemn the film because it works. There are enough movie noir elements that could be considered a Noir movie, but I think it's just a category. <br /> <br /> This piece has no wickedness and this is where noir elements fail. Of course, this disease can be considered exhausting, but I find it difficult to see. The movie gives clues to the darker side: Blackie can be a human trafficking, the New Orleans police are just too willing to arrest a reporter, the rupture hangs over all the people in the movie ... but they are really just tips. <br /> <br /> Reed's motivation hasn't been questioned, like one with Marlowe or Spade, nor has he tried to bring a person to Blackie who would make him even worse when he was actually trafficked. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what will not succeed at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, functioning is good, writing and direction are well done ... but there is nothing to change that movie that should go back. It's worth checking once, maybe twice, if you don't remember it years ago and then don't.
