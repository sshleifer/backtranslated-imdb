Breaking Glass is a film that anyone who wants to be in the music industry should see more than once. This is a very dark story about how a record company manipulates a singer to make things his way and make as much money as possible. Looking at some of today's "look stars" TV shows both in the UK and abroad, I am always reminded of this movie. Although the winners of these exhibitions are not experts in the field, they usually have one very big original hit and then downhill. This movie shows them before, although the effect seems the same. After his leader's release, which Phil Daniels played quite brilliantly, slowly, but surely the record company is changing his words, putting him on stimulants, and he's finally burnt down. You're potential stars tomorrow .... SEE THIS AND WARNING !!!
