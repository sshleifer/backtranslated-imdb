Some posters seem less robbed because it is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but obviously not pretending to be. You look for a long time to find a bigger Rodgers and Hart fan than I do, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly cut into the liver they knew outside of Der Bingle and adjusted some great songs - but beautiful, Moonlight turns into you, It's always your day, forever, etc. - to suit his very personal style and here they come out with another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad, once and for all, and a few surprising records of philosophies in If You missed your toes and occupied something. It is not necessary to take the small plot seriously - why else would Merlin be difficult if in most other versions he is more of Arthur's friend / mentor - so when you start thinking about why Sir Lancelot who has been sold to historians as the metamorphosis of chivalry and justice to the temptation of schoolhouse temptation that you can't get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie. In terms of balance, it does what it does, entertainment, so good luck.
