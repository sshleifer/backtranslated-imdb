Nothing (3+ outta 5 stars) Another strange assumption by the director of "Cube". This time there are two main characters who find themselves and their home a mysterious white space. Right next to your small two-storey house is NO. Intriguing to be sure, but I thought that the comedy tone created for this movie was extremely poorly prepared. There must be some humor, definitely ... and I have no problem with the humor that finally came from the difficult situation of our two heroes (their final "showdown" was definitely a hoot) ... but I really think the movie would have been much better if it were actually more rooted in the beginning. After watching the movie, I looked at the "making" feature on the DVD and at the end of the short trailer almost completely "bridgehead" of comedy aspects ... it looks like a completely different (and slightly better) film. The last half hour of the movie is where things really come together ... in a similar way to the recent movie "Primer". The actors are good if they do not overdo the comedy shtick. They are indeed quite believing in their "more normal" moments. I was probably ready to write this movie for an interim experiment ... but it finally won me. (And look at the last scene on credit ... just don't ask me to explain it.)
