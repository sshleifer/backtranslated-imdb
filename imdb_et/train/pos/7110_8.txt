John Garfield plays Marine, who is blinded by a grenade to fight Guadalcanal and has to learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical thoughts of darkness and is sure he will be a burden for everyone. Hospital staff and her wounded Marines can't go through her. Nor can her girl play back by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-esteem and prejudice. This is a complicated role that Garfield bears remarkably with high performance, which keeps one look despite the ever-present syrup melodrama. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where he is in a machine gun nest, trying to repel evolving Japanese soldiers in a belligerent battle and later in a dream order hospital where he sees himself with white sugar cane on the train platform, dark glasses and a tin cup holding his girlfriend away from the camera all the time.
