Personally, I enjoyed Cutly thouroughly. It was the first time I saw a theatrical release of Australia slip. Usually, the genre of traditional Hollywood movies is limited. <br /> <br /> Of all the usual mature comedies and dramas from Australia, I loved to see a domestic horror film that wasn't open. I didn't even think it was really a scam for other movies. It was a supernatural theme of horror like Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream or I know what you did last summer and therefore was more incredible to stop. I think it is time for Australian films to try to reach more traditional genres. <br /> <br /> The cut was original, scary and ultimately a bit fun. I would give it out of seven out of ten and not treat it as serious. He did what I expected to attract and scare me enough time to satisfy it. I enjoyed it.
