I still loved the madness than any movie I've seen for years. The 70's successful band decides to try it again. They start playing some concerts in a fun place in Europe, with fun results. Music is fantastic, scripting and acting are terrible. The characters are on the ground, especially the singer with higher heavy metal voice, make-up and personal problems. At the end of the concert was unreal. Go and see it, preferably in a cinema with good sound system :)
