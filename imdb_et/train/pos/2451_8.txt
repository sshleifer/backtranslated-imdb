George Lopez is a funny man even without sitcom. The first episodes I saw too often made jokes at the expense of my mother. As I looked more, there are more and more different. No one is really safe from his enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this season has progressed so George becomes more comfortable with his family's sitcom role. At first he was not, but he gets more and more groin. This will make both and the exhibitions gradually more fun. They had added a few characters to George this year. His wife's father is getting more and more involved with the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not as central to past seasons. I think it's reasonable to say George's comic timing, & ABC doesn't have good sitcoms, George Lopez has a good chance to be here at ABC after George W. Bush.
