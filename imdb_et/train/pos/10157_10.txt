This is a fun look at the gospel presented by Johnny Cash (naturally decorated black) who sings a lot and tells a bit. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is quite enjoyable. Also note the image of Jesus' blonde in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men with blond hair ...? Anyway, it's a fun presentation for all the biggest and most important stories.
