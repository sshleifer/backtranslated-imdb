It was the worst film I've ever seen, but it was also the best movie. The Sci Fi original should be bad, it makes them fun! Line, "I like my dinosaur meat well!" is probably the best deal ever! It also sounds like a dream caused by a pot. I can imagine it now, the writers wake up after a long night to get high and play the dance dance revolution, and put it together: Space soldiers got an alien planet infected with dinosaurs and having medieval houses in it. to protect the planet's learner. The best idea ever! In fact, a complete Sci Fi original movie checklist is suitable: weapons dinosaurs in medieval spaces are traveling terribly. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie, but don't buy it.
