I remember this movie. Quite intensive for 11 year olds. Good editing, I felt terrible for St Bernard. I'd look at it again if it were broadcast, but the signal goes over Pluto when I write it. Robert Culp. His career tip. I'm just glad I didn't live in that area. Oh, these 70s. With ten years. If they change it again, I bet it would be very violent and bloody. What are they waiting for? A great film for boys in puberty suburbs. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. It was certainly not done in Lodi NJ. The shot made with St. Bernard was the best and probably the strangest picture of the movie ... and then left the carcass in a curved position. Rotten kids.
