I've seen almost all of Cynthia Rothrock's movies and it's the fun of me. It reminds me of Jackie Chan's films early. Of course, Mrs Rothrock may not be the biggest actor, but she is very good to look at as a martial artist as well as a very cute young lady. This film, though probably not the best of all of his films, was the most fun.
