One thing about Hollywood, no one is successful and it must always be copied. Another thing is that players give their best studio out of their home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson received such awards for his performance on the Texas-based Giant, which Universal leaders had to think of. Similarly, Robert Stack received excellent comments from The High and Mighty as a pilot who had been broken by a damaged aircraft. because it was natural to give him one more crack up role. <br /> <br /> Both goals were achieved with "Wind on the Wind". Before Hudson was a great ranch owner, he is now the hunter of Robert Stack's father who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, part of James Dean without James Dean's racist Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of the advertising agency, used by Stack Hadley Oil Company. Hudson likes him, but he has blinded millions of Stack and if he sucks a girl, he has the means to continue the campaign. She marries Stack. And last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone, who is the Stack's immoral sister who has a yen for Rock, but Rock hasn't been hit by this wild child. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent more than ten years in the role of a colorless hero before landing a gem. Marilee Hadley received her best supporting actor award and was well earned. <br /> <br /> If you like the splashy technicolor Fifties soap opera, it's a movie for you.
