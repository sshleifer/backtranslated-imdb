Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comics who are probably the most funny. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I've ever seen and it's essential for anyone who loves a good smile! I watched this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still have fun laterally. This is definitely your video library. I guarantee you will have to watch it many times to hear all the jokes because you laugh so much - that you lose half of them! Delirious is fun! <br /> <br /> Although there are many funny comics - after that stand-up comedy, most of them have seemed to be second-class citizens. If you have never seen it - look, look at it - and you love it! This will make you a holler !!! :-)
