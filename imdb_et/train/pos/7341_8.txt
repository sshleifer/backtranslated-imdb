I enjoy Ralph Bakshi's films ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underrated animated "Lord of the Rings") and I'm a Frank Frazetta collector and fan. I am also a sword and sorcerer who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> In 1983, I left the "Fire and Ice" theater release and look forward to seeing it since the video or some revival. That's why the 2005 release was a dream for me. But I bought it somewhat scared because I was hoping that it would not only be worth looking at once and then put the accumulated dust on the shelf as "gathering" until I died. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and I was very pleased with this movie. <br /> <br /> As with Frazetta's art, this is a sharp film with physicality and sexuality that are hard to find in most fantasy / swords and witch movies without cheese or dirt. Art is good and you can see Frazetta's glimpse of his best. Even my young boys loved to watch it with me and ask to see it again. However, my husband has some objections because the princess is very clean (very Frazetta-esquire). I do not mind that because it is plausible and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> Roto-scoping is used, but I personally enjoy roto-scoping. It gives more fluid and realistic movements to the character that is hard to find in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some consistency issues, I recommend this movie to all Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan and Sword and Witch fans. Enjoy!
