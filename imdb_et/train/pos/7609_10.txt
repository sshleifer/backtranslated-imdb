A totally brilliant exhibition. The second season began where the first ended, a lot of mystery. Excitement in most, if not all, episodes and mysteries everywhere. One that made me think and think. It is truly amazing how a writer can get out of all the associations and associate all the characters and combine all these elements to make the lives of the exhibitors so meaningful. Never get upset and I'm looking forward to a new season. Hopefully more secrets will open up and more secrets will be solved at the same time. Good showing for this show is also perfect for characters. You really can't wait to discover the secret. Hopefully, it won't break the whole leap.
