The most important feature of this film is the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor by Christy Brown, an artist in Guinea and a fighter who, despite his physical condition, won all the odds. As a person working in patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their results were shockingly convincing. The great support Christy received from his family, the low-income, Dublin staff, encouraged him to do the impossible, and that image was a great support, has not read the book, but the dialogues were wisely designed to capture Christy Brown's witty lewd personality. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially classic film lovers.
