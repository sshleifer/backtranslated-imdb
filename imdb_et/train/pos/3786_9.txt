Chinese daughter Ying invited us to screen the Czech film (with English subtitles) at the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotář (Loners, 2000) and it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Like many other Czech films, it seems that seven average characters have a rather heavy and dirty life; The Web shows that this topic was popular with US films in the early 1990s. Their relationships break down, combine and recombine. Another typical feature of Czech films is that neither of the characters is generally negative and neither is permanently positive. You can also see how the characters depend on the characteristics of others in context; This is a very realistic feature of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a talented and married young surgeon with two daughters. However, you will learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman, Hanka. She is so obsessed that she dresses as a plumber repeatedly to get to Hanka's parents' house - a house she burns repeatedly. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Hankal has a very confusing relationship with her parents. He just decides - by tilting the coin - to break down with Petr, who works in a private radio station. Hanka does not see a good example of the civic life of his parents, but rather seems to have failed to create a better environment. But he's a very flexible figure when his boyfriends are moving. Hanka seems to have some serious plans with Jakub, who is an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be quite devastating for some time. But his band friends tell Jakub that he already has another girl. Hanka is disappointed and returns to his parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Petr break down, it is organized by Robert, who is also a beautician, who also works in a travel agency where his job is to show ordinary Czech life. for people of Japanese tourists. Robert - who also offers Jakub with marijuana - is never serious and usually sleeps with many different women; Finally, her mother dies in the hospital and has her own options for dealing with depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (Slavic word "spring"), who came to Macedonia from Prague, works as a barmaid - and you don't know if she came to Czech to see her father or UFOs. He seems rather confused, but sometimes also helps with other signs of their problems. <br /> <br /> Petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who loves his job - the job he eventually loses. He tells his audience that he broke Hank - that's how Ondřej learns about the news that makes him very happy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ondřej's wife Lenka is always ready to forgive and stabilize her marriage - even after Ondřej asks the magician to disappear, so Ondřej can hit Hank again. (The Master pays his debt because he is the brother of a major car accident victim - Jakub and Hanka take the victim to the hospital and Ondřej rescues his life.) your movies at Hanka's parents dinner. <br /> <br /> Seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague were less than four orders of magnitude. Given the real size of Czech capital, it seems a little unlikely that all of these events will take place in seven people, but it is fun.
