This is definitely one of my all-time trek episodes. This movie is just so much that its crazy crazy. First of all, boys are throwing on an alien planet that explodes. They correspond to the type of freaky librarian (very well played). Then Kirk will be able to bring himself back to the ground of the 16th century. McCoy and Spock are trying to follow, but almost freeze an alien's frozen version 100,000 years earlier. Kirk manages to lock himself and blame himself, while Spock has a nice time with a sexy cavegirl, who was beaten by a bad boy towards this frozen, terrible world. <br /> <br /> Spock decides to be happy when he and McCoy give a royal request if the doctor advises them to look out. Anyway, they all end up fleeing, leaving the bad cavegirl down. Before Spock finally gives and leaves, it takes a lot of conviction. Finally, you can literally taste it. Leaving the cavegirl all alone with her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching. Spock was supposed to be out of his volcano to leave his greatest hope for love and humanity. Although not so nice in the neighborhood! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you get so much of your band with this episode. Love Story, Salem's Witch Processes, Spock as a Person, Desperation to be completely isolated ... abandoned and three completely different aliens on the planet. He's amazing that they managed to capture it all in fifty minutes. It's classic, don't miss it .... I want this DVD fer shure vulcans !!!!!!
