During the years of participating in film festivals, I have seen many such films that never get theatrical distribution, and they reach WalMart's $ 3 boxes. I just found a Yank Tanks DVD, a great doc, but sad to make it the end result. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I wish I saw it in the cinema that's all. I would have preferred New Yorker's films to be translated directly into the title. That's good if the Americans are a little stretched. If the title of the movie helps the US audience to investigate random chaos, the better. Cinema imitates life and visa versa. <br /> <br /> I also found it bothering that subtitles put their prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to figure out, make the gringo audience a math. When watching a movie, especially in Paris, the viewer should not be reminded of being reminded: I am an American who watches a movie and converts me into euros for dollars. <br /> <br /> I expect more of these actors and more of the writer and director.
