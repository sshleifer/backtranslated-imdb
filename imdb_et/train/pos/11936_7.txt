I really enjoyed this movie as a young child. At this age, I thought the silly baseball games were funny and that the movie was "cool" for sports. Now, several years later, I can look back and see what this well-designed film was like. This film opened my eyes as a small child to struggles for other children and real problems. In these films, this kind of exposure is largely inadequate in these days, which I do not believe in our society. Of course, baseball games seem really stupid, but they pulled the kids in. A seven-year-old doesn't ask to see a movie about stepchildren, but they ask to see a baseball movie. Disney understood this fact and used it to teach these children a significant lesson from the world. for both children and Danny Glover, who all did a fantastic job.
