I can't believe people are looking for a plot in this movie. It's Laural and Hardy. Lighten up already. These two were a rebellion. Their comic genius is as funny today as 70 years ago. There is no dirty word out of the mouth and could not keep the audience in stitches. Their comedy was in no way complicated. If any pillow can't smile at you, there's no reason to see what these guys did. It was an easier time and people laughed at things that were funny without a plot. I think it takes a simple mind to enjoy this thing, so I qualify. Two male comedy teams don't count, we're just too complicated ... Are we happy?
