It's worth looking at twice, as a number of compelling stories offer a quick boost, "Bug" is a completely satisfying piece of art that plays an increasingly optimistic love for a multitude of examples of depressing reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch), whose main issue - from cockroach to air traveler to whom he is partly responsible - is filming the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surreal but delicious foods for her impossible wife Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable television technician with unlimited confidence in the bribe messages of the fortune: "You will meet your dream girl." <br /> <br /> This optimism has the power of exotic reality, all created by characters: parking tickets, clogged drain of Chinese food / donut, TV-breaking, broken car fender, destructive dinner booking, which ultimately leads to the cancellation of Hawaiian vacation. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny: Olive is drunk in Chippendale's performance, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative who is trying to deal with a client, dermatologic Cyr (Brian Cox), facing the restaurant inspector Dwight (Jamie Kennedy). refusal to write about a hostile Chinese cookie: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and the boy who sleeps when he has a teddy bear because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's lost cat. <br /> <br /> A little story about the public The access point (Darryl Ourse) and the local actress teacher who read "Boy in the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Mistake" attracts much to the level of "trains, planes and cars" but with a lower budget and a fresher eye.
