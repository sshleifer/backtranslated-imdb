It's not as violent as I expected, which makes violent scenes ever more brutal and more effective. <br /> <br /> There are many twists and turns and double crossings all the way. a film that makes it difficult to know who is on the side of a particular character. <br /> <br /> The plot is a pacey with good dialogue and character formation that gives an interesting overview of how Triad gang works. <br /> <br /> Violence, if it is, is brutal, no weapons or scenes with special effects, it is believable in your face of violence, and in the whole dialogue you should never forget that Triad is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The end is surprising but thoroughly consistent and credible.
