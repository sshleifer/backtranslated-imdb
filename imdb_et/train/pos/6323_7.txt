"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some more fun memories of recent memory. Looking at this comedy led by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, perhaps we were reminded of another movie we saw in the past, but because we opened the credit, we had to wait until we discovered what was reminded of us was 1958 Italy "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> Russo's brothers made a great cast to portray all the characters in the movie. There's nothing wrong with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, late Michael Jeter. Because it is a piece of the band, all the characters get brightness. No one could guess that these men could do the kind of work they do. Whatever could go wrong is what they succeed. George Clooney makes a small look like a master-cracker, who is also seen as a rabbi, but confused by the priest at the Cossimo funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy a movie is to sit back and relax and let everyone in those little times do your thing. Have their funny lines that make you laugh because everyone sees this gang as dead from start to finish!
