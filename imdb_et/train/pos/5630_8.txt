Marjorie (a fantastic and riveting performance by Farrah Fawcett) reduces the narrow attack on her car. But Joe steals his wallet and finds where Marjorie lives. He will pay him one fateful day. When Marjorie was subjected to a lot of deterioration and psychological abuse, Marjor managed to turn his tables to Joe and lock him in the fireplace. What is Marjorie Joe? Director Robert M. Young and scriptwriter William Mastrosimone made a harsh, sharp and often distracting moral story that brutally brutally punishes cruelty and painful destruction, also showing how any person who has been extruded is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe perceives women as strict objects, while Marjorie sees Joe only as an "animal." But this film against its admirable credit does not allow Joe to just have a one-dimensional slip of whistle; Instead, he is a terrifying real and ultimately merciful man with a wife and child (especially Joe's climatic confession is truly embarrassing). Fawcett and Russo are both outstanding; they get passionate Terry, Alfre Woodard as sensible Patricia and Sandy Martin from Diana Scarwid as a sympathetic police advisor to Sudow. Curtis Clark's brilliant cinematography as well as J.A.C. Redford delivery, skin monitoring score significantly improves claustrophobic tension. A true power source.
