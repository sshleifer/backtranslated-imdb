Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is returning to political confrontation. That is why this masterpiece should be shown in all secondary schools in Spain. This is a huge lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. An American pilot who participates in the Spanish Civil War chooses a democratically elected republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes of Uribe. The colors are great. War cruelty (can anyone tell me what the difference between any war and civil war is) is used as a hopeful scenario when two small children express their feelings and defend one another. Now there are active cowboys who begin to abuse power even against innocent children. A movie like "El viaje de Carol" / "Carol's journey" talks about so many sad stories of the 20th century. This is a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Again a great job from the Iberica Peninsula!
