SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 - All-Time TV Show <br /> <br /> Everyone thought it was a stupid thing that wouldn't go to a pilot episode. Sopranos have become a cultural phenomenon and are generally recognized as the biggest television shows of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays with mysterious New Jersey criminal boss, Tony Soprano, with stars. Edie Falco is excellent as a worrying, loving upper middle-class mother; Tony Sirico is huge as superstitious, greedy consiglier, who is often very funny. Although the example is often criticized for the negative stereotype of the Italian-Americans as a mafia, and if it is indisputable, I see so many positive exhibitions. Representing strong family values, friendship, love and compassion; can it be on a gangster television show? Yes, yes. In addition, other burning issues such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. are discussed. That's so much. Many of the questions in the exhibition are very real. <br /> <br /> Writing, which has been quite large, has infused so successfully current issues and has been able to infiltrate the symbols within the lives of things that makes the whole thing more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to David Chase, who has created a great TV treasure, and James Gandolfin, foreseeing the most complex and puzzling character of television. <br /> <br /> Just exceptional. <br /> <br /> 10/10
