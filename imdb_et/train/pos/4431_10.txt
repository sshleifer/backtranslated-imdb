This movie rate is one of my all time favorite top 10 movies. Many people who see this for the first time and know little about the movie on many topics probably do not understand why I find it so attractive to try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The film is very rich in historical details and cultural perceptions, and although it has some minor anachronisms, they are completely forgiving. The story is a famous duel exchange between Monk Benkei and the young Prince Yoshitsune on the Gojo Bridge. During the legendary struggle, Yoshitsune Benkei and monk become a loyal keeper of the Prince. This film is a review of this story and includes war, blind prophecy, and political maneuvering. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is "Mappo", a Buddha's prophecy that, after 1000 years, failed to teach and the world would fall into chaos. Heian was believed in Japan after the Mt Fuji eruption and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji) so that the world would fall into anarchy and collapse. It's the time of demons. <br /> <br /> Next, there's a way the movie solves Yoshitsune's sword training question by Karuma Tenk (Raven Goblins). The winning clans often fled to the mountains and hid themselves as demons to scare local people. It is said where the ninja clans started historically. Yoshitsune portrays Goy well all this. <br /> <br /> Then there are Benkei and different Buddhist strains, including many Shingon sect esoteric Buddhism. All of these are depicted quite accurately and simply add a bit of meditation and Ki energy in the film to make the story inseparable, ie it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension. film, but it does so in a tactical and threatening way. <br /> <br /> The all-in-all is full of exciting tidbits and rings that are surprisingly real in life. Landscape and costumes are also totally unacceptable and very authentic. The soundtrack is great, very whimsical and ominous. I also thought that the actual exemplary performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a big horseshoe hero, Shanaot (Yoshitsune) is depicted as a young man who tests his boundaries and grows more and more under his power, and Tetsukich, a glowing sword blade, makes a "common man" and an interesting image. its less than a flattering opinion of the killers who are proud of their social raiders. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, I suggest that you appeal an old book on Japanese history and see how this retelling becomes almost orthodox Robin Hood vs Little John story gory story intrigue, violence and infernal karma.
