I love movies and my own comics, the comics are different, but the movie, but I would give: 10 out of 10. It was fantastic. When movies are more awesome. I would have my children. And I'm a woman. Read comics you don't regret. Yes, in this movie, because his dead artist Brian P. we don't get almost as good artistic work. I am serious about not getting me wrong when these people made great but different versions for different people. Different punches for different people, as they say. Any guy who doesn't go over her is crazy or dislikes of women, or you know you're just planning on crazy. If I could count on my fingers, how I fell in love and how many times I read comics, I would definitely run out of my fingers, but hey always have toes.
