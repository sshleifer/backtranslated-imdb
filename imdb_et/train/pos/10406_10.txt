Abu, BAGDAD BRIEF, helps King Ahmed recover his kingdom from the evil witch. <br /> <br /> As the European War drove and important parts of the world flared up, Sir Alexander Korda opened the London movies for this gorgeous prison legend of Arab Nights legends. Filled with swords and sorcery, the audience gave the audience a short break in 1940. It is also a fine film art with a good actor and an intelligent script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt gets the best bills and he deserves it by playing the evil magic of Jaffar. Her bright face, piercing her eyes, reminds me of the quiet days she has played with such pleasures. Here's a criminal who's worth checking out. As a kid, Sabu, is his third film. Although it is not a hero in the normal sense, its character is heroic in actions and activities. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast will do a good job. John Justin is both an energetic and sensitive as an enlightened king who must learn about the living reality; Saba gets an important part of the activity (if he doesn't become a dog), but Justin is sporty enough, as needed. Lovely June Duprez plays with Basra's Endangered Princess, decorated with two very different men. The late film shows that the massive Rex Ingram shakes things like a gene. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his good voice as a narrator. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role in Basra's parenting Sultan, which is forever his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the screen and dialogue of the film). Obsolete Morton Selten is a benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an extraordinary actor, plays the double role of Jaffar's accomplice and six armed silver dancers. <br /> <br /> The film started in Britain, but the wartime hardships changed Korda to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram. The direction of art is the most attractive in the lively Technicolor, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, white and pink. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Born in Saba Dastagiri in 1924, Sabu worked Mysore stables in Maharaja, when he discovered Repeat company and put it in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, DRUM-1938, BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself ready in Hollywood when they were ready. After a special service in World War II, he started his career as a filmmaker, but he was indefinitely limited for years playing ethnic roles in unknown small films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) is one big exception. His latest film, Walt Disney A TIGER WALKS (1964) was a healing, but it was too late. At the end of 1963, Sabu died of a heart attack only at the age of 39.
