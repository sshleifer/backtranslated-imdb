All Kira Reed fans have to see it. The film presupposes difficulties with the novel Kira, who is unable to bring out new ideas. He also gets a divorce. But he meets with this man in a restaurant and he helps him out of the shell (and clothes). They go into the corner chamber and do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom (now never tells me these Playboy movies are fluffy piles of soft hearts. Remember, kids, safe sex). Later she admired her publisher, how big it was, but she didn't get her name. Nonetheless, the man finds him and they continue kinky games. But eventually he tires his sneakiness and wants to know more. When he does, all the hell will break and I will leave it. It is easily the best vision of these soft-hearted Playboys films. Check it out and admire the size of Kira.
