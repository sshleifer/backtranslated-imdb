Well, it can be one of the most funny movies of all time, and Sandy is giving you the strength! Unfortunately, his career never went quite well, but he is finally remembered for his three first-class photos: "Comedy King", "Dallas Doll" and "Without You". He dons to various New Yorkers to Diana Ross to create an amazing and fun critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, gentle and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces the audience in every scene and is actually "pretty beautiful". See it (if you are not from Iowa), you will enjoy it!
