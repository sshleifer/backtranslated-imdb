Stephane Rideau was already the star of Wild Reeds' tournaments and is one of France's largest indie stars. In this film he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets on the beach at Matieu (newcomer, nuanced, ethereal performance) on holiday. Mathieul has a difficult relationship with her sick mother, a demanding aunt and a sister (with whom she has a competitive relationship). Soon these two will be in love. <br /> <br /> The film's broken narrative - which consists of longer setbacks, current bits and pieces, and real-time forward-to-future - is a little frustrating. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not know what period we are, and the story may be difficult to follow. But leave it out: The final 45 minutes of the movie are so tempting that you can't take your eyes off the screen. The heartbreaking and uplifting changing film is the "Beautiful Thing" that must be seen in the cinema.
