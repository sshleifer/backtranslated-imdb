I thought this movie was much better than most movie critics do. Although it has confusing parts, it does not significantly affect the understanding of the film. When you say this: if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, this is probably not a movie for you. I thought all the participants in the film were outstanding. Every character has their own funny moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival smiled all over. I thought satire was at the top of a particular region, but it was deliberately done. John Cusack is right that, although it is set in the future, it will really look like your present.
