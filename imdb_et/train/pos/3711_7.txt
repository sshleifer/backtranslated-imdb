"Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!" ? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Laughton led the "Hunter's Night", a horrible South Gothic part where Robert Mitchum plays a scary serum murder. One of the most famous sequences of the film consists of two children fleeing Mitchum on the boat, the children talking frantically, while Mitchum goes after them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played an equally horrible killer "Cape Fear", the second film in South America. This film had a local lawyer who tried to protect his family and ended up with Mitchum, who terrorizes people with the boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese tried to try and bring out the mainstream, rebuilding Cape Fear, the boat scene and everything. <br /> <br /> Now we have Robert Altman's "Gingerbread Man", the second slice of a small town in southern Gothic. Altman says he consulted inspiration for the "Hunter's Night" and treated such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to "spread his wings and try a popcorn image", but what he secretly tries to do here is to deconstruct canonical films. South Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> So instead of a small boat showdown, we get a huge ship. Instead of kidnapping two children, we'll send the two children safely back to the police. Instead of hiding the money, we have the last will and will to make money. Instead of being a fair lawyer in 1961 and the regrettable lawyer of the 1991 remake, we get a pretty three-dimensional lawyer from Kenneth Branagh. Instead of a family monster, we arrive at a hero who kidnaps bad guys. Instead of a monster breaking into a family boat, we have a hero on the monster's "houseboat". Likewise, instead of the murderous serum murder, we get Robert Duvall's innocent weird. . .etc etc etc. <br /> <br /> Altman continues by turning everything a little, pulling the edges and doing his thing. His touch is the most obvious film in the first semester, in a movie that is in an unpleasant room with the usual plot-based narrative and Altman's affection for overlapping dialogues, random narratives, camera movement and character not as much as they are just part of what's going on. <br /> <br /> Despite Altman's best intentions, the film never rises above average. Altman is too much involved with "thriller" conventions to do a lot of damage, his style is too lethargic to create tension, and the film isn't just radical enough to stand against other canonical movies in the genre. The "Gingerbread Man" is therefore too mainstream to work as a cleaner Altman movie and too Altman to work as a mainstream thriller. <br /> <br /> Film is not a complete waste. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and traditionally unbearable Daryl Hannah have all become succulent. The film also has a pleasant atmosphere that is directed to the approaching hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting turns. Although it is not a complete disaster with Scorses' Cape Fear, the film is still not something special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 90s, Altman made three successive films in the South of America: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". Unlike the "gingerbread man", both "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" deal with a broader genre, more relaxed canvases, which Altman was most comfortable with. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is the most important of these two films, the hierarchies of this class, politics, and crime, and the desire to radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks, would affect all serious 21st century movie criminals (see, for example, The Wire) . That means "cookie happiness", though much less of a story, is perhaps a better picture. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims it is his first thriller, but he directed "Pictures", an art house thriller, 1972. <br /> <br /> One view is worth it.
