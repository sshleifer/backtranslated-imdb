Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing presentation by Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who was terribly badly treated as a little boy by his monster, abusive, alcoholic stepfather, father, Barry (Gunnar Hansen's truly scary image). Eric has a compassionate groom (nice playing with lovely Tracee Newberry) and a job that writes autopsy reports in a local grudge. Eric complains of his evil past, worshiped with laughter, igniting Jack's demon (truly horrible Michael Robert Brandon) and sending his mother's recent death over the edge. horrible. Kallio managed (who also wrote a dense, intelligent script), working smoothly with a subtle sound (Jeff Steiger is particularly good at Eric's wannabe helpful angel Michael), a pretty tough but general polished cinematography by George Lieber, incredible live characters, raw, shocking and insecure attacking wild violence, frantic, spooky result by Dan Kolton, uncompromising endless end, grungy Detroit, Michigan locations, extremely serious tone and tense, this extremely strong and sharp psychological horrorist turns a constant trail that remains on a permanent path. Real sleeping place.
