What could be more than the idea that private detectives would participate in women whom they should spy on? And most of the written dialogue is completely banal. <br /> <br /> But the participants make the dialogue reasonable. There are real people behind the unrealistic lines. And management is wonderful. Each scene does what it considers and ends without dragging too long. <br /> <br /> I showed it to many friends in the mid-80s because I was confused about how such a bad material was for a good movie. Friends also enjoyed it.
