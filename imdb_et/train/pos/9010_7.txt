Slightly peculiar and contiguous bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worth watching. Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter), a young woman with a wheelchair, is linked to the reluctant caregivers Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who dreams of flying people. He builds an airplane in his garage and plans to fly it. He wants to revitalize his own difficult life by taking care of an independent, dying Jane who suffers from a neurological illness that has everything but who has left his speechless and very little motor skills. A wheelchair-bound and full of spirit, his last deadly desire to lose his virginity. He offers himself to Richard, who doesn't help him directly; but is ready to put the bank to pay gigolot for action. I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has some charisma and attraction.
