After being considered the official Dirty Harry trilogue with The Enforcer (1976), this chapter was the last chapter. Dirty Harry is back, older, brighter and grittier than ever since the 1971 classic classic. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry has killed a psychopath killer, a vigilante police, and a Vietnamese veteran terrorist in the past. But now he is a new killer, a killer who wants profitability, down from the attackers. <br /> <br /> Sudden effects will give Dirty Harry a new meaning and a darker tone. Callahan is in a new murder case that returns to a woman (played by Sondra Locke) who was raped violently with her sister who was left traumatized. Ten years on, he will be revenge under attackers. While Callahan is in trouble with his superiors, after he provokes a mobile boss of a heart attack, he is also hunted by the mobile. So, in order to let the heat down the city, Harry is obliged to rest in the seaside town, but at the same time a violent victim in the city, while hunting its attackers. Harry is under investigation and finds that the killings are very similar as he lives on the killer trails. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the sudden impact must be one of my 10 best revenge films, as well as the second best Dirty Harry movie much better than both Enforcer and The Dead Pool. The sudden effect is what the original Dirty Harry was, a dark tone with entertaining value. <br /> <br /> So you feel happy, punk?
