I liked it a lot. In fact, when I see it again (and I'm going to), I just love it. I also repeat the other reviewers, saying that this movie is coming up to you. It starts slowly, but the road to enfoldsides is very natural and has a mood. You just got there. <br /> <br /> I liked the summer atmosphere of the film and thought the film was very touching. The characters have a strong reality and the film slowly and gently strikes the spell when you engage in different communication between them and you want to know how it ultimately turns out and which paths you choose. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this - there are hidden TV movies with more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing I am saying is that I miss the end that makes me crazy and I need to look at it again to see it. This is a movie that may not be for everyone, but I feel that it is heavily underestimated (even some of my film-purist friends who have seen almost every movie they haven't seen) and it doesn't even seem like a big part of the bulletin board, but to me I liked it a lot and all those who love warm family theaters, the atmosphere and the hastily fast pace should probably look at it. It is especially noteworthy that this is happening in South Carolina, so that for those (like me) who love lunch, and the films that take place there, it has a pearl. I add my voice nervously to the little comments and recommend this little known flick.
