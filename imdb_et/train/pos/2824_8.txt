The American film debut of Greta Garbo is an analogy to how our lives can be wiped out of fate and our actions, such as torrents, causing our part to lose. <br /> <br /> Greta is played by Leonora, a poor peasant girl who was in love with landowner Ricardo Cortez's character Don Rafael. Ricardo is also in love with her, but her dominant mother is too easily affected. Leonora gets homeless and travels to Paris, where he becomes a famous opera singer and freely develops a woman's reputation. In reality, part of his attitude to murder is because of Rafael's abandonment. <br /> <br /> He returns to his home to visit his family and eventually joins Rafael. Surprisingly, nobody knows that he is famous for La Brunna, and Garbo acts as his god, what he really was and what he was astonishingly astonished in later images. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez recalls Valentino looks in this regard and was taken care of by MGM as a Valentino clone, although he didn't think he could be in reality and right. She is an incredibly immature part like a weak daddy's mother and allows himself to live realistically but at the end of the movie. He can't beat Leonora when he returns home, and later, when he follows him, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautifully fired, with amazing storms and sets of Spanish depicting that time being authentic. The old timers, Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain, also present subtle secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Although this is a story of lost love and missed opportunities, Leonardo and Rafael do not believe they would have been happy together because he needed a more traditional woman and was a very career woman, and I don't think it would be small in the village happy. The end is alive and does not pull the strokes. <br /> <br /> See this Garbo American film debut and upcoming things.
