"Panic" is an enchanting, vague genre of film about the reconciliation of the film and the controversial middle-aged Hitman, associated with a younger, unhindered hairdresser, his love for a woman and son, his commitment to his employer / father with his identity. Although the film has a negligible purpose and an unclear end, it is an excellent production in almost every aspect. The clarity of characters and the sincerity of such an unlikely story can both fascinate and disrupt the audience.
