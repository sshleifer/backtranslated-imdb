The sniper gives a new meaning to war films. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, a lot of shooting, everyone dies, bam bam. "Sniper" takes war to new levels or improves. The film definitely transmits all the emotions it wants - the helplessness of people in the jungle, the hatred and the trust between Beckett and Miller, and the moment they unleash. A seemingly low budget movie makes every mistake with action, relationship, and excitement, because when it comes down, it's just one shot, one to kill.
