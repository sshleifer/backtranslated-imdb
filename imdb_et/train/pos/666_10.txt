The second episode of the season is a delightful holiday story about love, betrayal, ... and killing that escaped dead like Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) has just murdered her hub for her life insurance on Christmas Eve. What begins with a perfect crime begins with the struggle to survive, when the fraud, the Santa Clause suit, who carries the psychopath (Larry Drake, completely above) threatens his life ... as well as his valuable young daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is remembered even by those who are familiar with the program. By the way, this particular reviewer routinely reviews it every Christmas. The most remarkable is its expanding proportions and narrative twists, and everything through the prone is among the best crypt.
