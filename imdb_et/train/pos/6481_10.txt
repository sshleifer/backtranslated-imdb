I saw this series when I was a kid, and I loved the detail he'd gone and never forget it. Finally, I bought a DVD collection and that's exactly how I remembered it. That is how the doctor should be impartial and factual. The film material is incredible and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series I found to be equal is "Die Deutschen Panzer". <br /> <br /> I just want Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, so they can make big war movies. <Br /> <br /> Note. I would recommend
