It's very nice to watch all of the 60's movie. Humor is quite gentle, but it grew much more than I thought. The cast is first-rate and seems like a wonderful time. Ustinov travels through a film that breaks things quite funny under his breath, and it is all very insignificant; I'll buy the movie as soon as it appears on the DVD. The plot is that Ustinov was released from prison by putting him in jail and letting the US company in London, an American company, make money. Maggie Smith is her secretary for a while, and looking at the dismissal of many different jobs, it's part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual death game himself, and Karl Malden has a fun and close leader who heads the London office. The end is funny and nicely cynical.
