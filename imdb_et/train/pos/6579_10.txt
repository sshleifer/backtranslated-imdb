Methinks Quo Vadis Best Screen Version? ever done. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and obvious as in the book, sometimes curving and losing its aesthetic nuances. But the film is really and strangely "strange", it has a mystery and style that other versions - with R.Taylor and the new Poland - are definitely missing. It has the air of Roman decadence, the fall of paganism and the beauty of infant Christianity. At least I believe it is). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did a great job of portraying their characters. Forresti Petronius seems to be the greatest success story (not to mention Brandauer, who is once one of the biggest players) and collects the nature of this dying world (IMHO). That's it. So it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
