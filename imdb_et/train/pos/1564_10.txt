Chloe is rescued mysteriously from Dr. Casell, a corrupt doctor who is responsible for carrying Belle Reve's ability to project 33.1, and the second part comes from Clark later. He thinks Bart Allan has returned to Smallville and is meeting with Kent Farm. When Bart grabbed the LuthorCorp facility during the burglary, Clark discovered that the green arrow hired Bart (a.k.a.a. impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to study the project. Clark agrees to join the trio to save Bart and invite Chloe to participate in his mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode of this sixth season. In this episode, five heroes start their league with their saga: Clark, Green Arrow, Flash ("Impulse"), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloe's attendance is remarkable for the organization required for teamwork. Ultimately, Oliver breaks with Lois, based on the fight against criminals and Lex's secret laboratories around the world. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Justice")
