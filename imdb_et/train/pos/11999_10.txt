I've seen this wonderful production and I don't know if anyone can tell me about an actor who played a blacksmith's wife - I'm not sure about her character's name. I went to BYU with her and lost her contact - her maiden name was Kim Luke and I don't know if anyone has information about her. He's not listed on credits. This production was outstanding, all accounts had a tear-jerker that worked great. I think I don't even want to be in the general category "act", rather "imagine, knowing the amazing events that led to the opening of the sky to its final extradition" ... ... something like that. If someone worked with Kim or owns a website or something, please let me know! He was otherwise fantastic in his role .... Thank you, Melissa Thorne
