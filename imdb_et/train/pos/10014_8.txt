Night Listener earned my attention, Robin Williams shone as a New York radio receiver, in love with his 14-year-old son (Rory Culkin), who is very ill. Williams has never met a boyfriend personally because they have only been in contact with the phone. But Williams' former boyfriend (a nice job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, forcing Williams to meet him personally. The following will make Williams a lasting influence in a way he does not think. I'll leave it to this. Toni Collette also stars. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, Toni Collette gave a memorable picture of Culkin's adoptive parent. Sandra Oh also celebrated Williams' friend. The night listener is inspired by real events and has always had a pleasant, almost horrible silence. Sometimes it's predictable, thanks to some reading that I read before watching the movie and just because of the logic, but I still liked it. I enjoy Williams in such roles, more than his comedy characters, so it was an extra bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
