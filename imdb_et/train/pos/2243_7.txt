I thought the whole movie played beautifully fresh pictures and interesting cinematography all over it. The actors were behind their character in almost perfect timing and looked great. The music was lush and thoughtful. He even had a decent twist. What if everyone votes? The story was not completely fresh (it seemed like a "Running Man" remnant of the whole TV show idea), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism, how the public chooses from its Messiah, seemed quite true. It made sense to follow the man who had been put in front of a modern crowd and put him on his pedestal because of his opportunity. the word "God" in it, but it shows what the filmmakers are trying to do, teach people who may never have seen such a world, especially in today's world where Christianity is more or less accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7/10 stars in IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original. Check if you are not too offended to see an entertaining movie in Madrid, Spain, about the future of modern Messiah on your nearby television.
