Good story and great animation. The effects of Frazetta and Baksh are obvious and that is good. Anyone who enjoys Conan Barbarian or Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it. The struggle between good and evil is clear, although it may seem that sometimes our hero is neutral. Most often, fear films show that the elves are white skin and blonde hair, and the goblins and orcs are dark skin and hair. Anyone who knows the work of Frazetta, Bakshi or even Tolkien knows that they are not racist. Anyone who enjoys Fantasy movies should like this movie. It's not small children because of violence and sexual enthusiasm. The casting was well done and the scenes and music are first-rate. I hope someone will put this pearl on DVD soon. I find myself happy that I have a copy of VHS in good condition.
