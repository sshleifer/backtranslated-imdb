This movie is exactly what its title describes - an attempt to buy what the writers are offering. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's fun to see the 1996-style Toronto, which I remember all of its foolish discounts, sunglasses, clothes and attitudes. It hasn't really changed; just a nice, safe, inexpensive, provincial little city water that makes it a great meeting place for international movie types! It is also fun to see that Kenny and Spenny go to LA and find that this is Toronto again, only with strange assortment, bands, musicians, successful and even more powerful film types. <br /> <br /> I don't see Pitch as a movie to enjoy; it is not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone's aspirations. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money are in the studio departments and production houses. Potential (and "successful") writers, musicians and actors are still just transients, even when they reach Big Time. <br /> <br /> So Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy or not, but the message is still there.
