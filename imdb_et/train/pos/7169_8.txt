Usually, "kids" films are somewhat tedious quality, making it too sluggish and intolerant to the age of 13. \ t Of course, at times that often give the children the above-mentioned quality of film, this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. Action was decent and Stanley's turbulent dynamics with some other campers were more realistic than what most of the films wanted to portray. What I particularly liked about this movie was that this movie didn't try to break your heart or cry. Emotional force was a bit more natural than most depicted, like Shawshank's redemption in many ways (which is also a similar, redeeming end). Only below? Hikers are looking for lizards. Overall, 8/10.
