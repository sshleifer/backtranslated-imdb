The main role of this film, the path of self-destruction that became so clear to the broken police and the viewer of the past, is absolutely unique for this time, 1950. <br /> <br /> With haunting music and a well-written plot, the film is the best example of a movie's dwarf. The close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal mischief, Karl Malden stands out as his boss, who is not talking meaninglessly, but also sympathy for those under his hand. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this type of film for her. If there is a mistake, it would be Gene Tierney's breath of beauty, who seems to be tempered with a policeman odd. However, their scenes in the cafe are wonderful and rings. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in a small part of his father, is perfect, like Gary Merrill as a hood. Great lighting and mood. The building where deadly actions take place in the atmosphere, I love the older woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
