For the first time, I looked at the first series of Disney Channel UK 8 simple rules and got completely closed. If they didn't show it anymore, it was annoying, but then abc 1, which showed the 2nd series. I thought after reading John Ritter's death, the second series wouldn't start, but the 2nd series wasn't amazing because the last series is back to the old excellent standard. I hope they will continue to show more, though I could watch it every thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character in the airhead Bridget and also the amazing Charmed. Rory is also good, he also shares my name and Grampa. I will continue to look at it until it ends, until I hope it continues as funny as ever
