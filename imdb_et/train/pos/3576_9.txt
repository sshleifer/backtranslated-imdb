Honestly, I find this film almost too frustrating for myself. It's very frustrating until pretty much the end. I can in no way justify giving a judgment to any person who has dealt with things I did not like (well, except for the nasty character played by Fredrick Forrest). But it is still so depressing to see how people behave in this way, selling walls around them, just as a word or so the ice can break and encourage healing. <br /> <br /> The terrible tragedy strikes the Montana family. They believe they have lost one son, but it turns out they are gone. 2. It is important if they simply communicate and see their grief together, they will not lose their second son permanently. <br /> <br /> But they just can't. Something prevents this family from sharing their concerns. Some families retreat to silence and resentment, while others point to guilty fingers (and then go ahead and deceive their poor pregnant woman, pushing the dead girlfriend ... that Andy's character is truly a snake!) The only family that is in no way dangerous to Arnold, is his grandfather (Wilford Brimley). Grandfather seems to be able to talk to a boy without court decisions or even boys' gloves. He seems to know what a child thinks, though Arnold doesn't say much these days. It's really a blessing for a poor child to have someone with whom he can turn. No one else seems to understand that Arnold may be in shock, denying or that his way of anger may not be the same style or speed they would expect. It's so easy to decide and be angry and feel someone is "made of stone" just because they don't feel we should believe. <br /> <br /> The story is very quiet and naturalistic. You're not going to get a spoon-fed story or any Hollywood-sensitive resolution. I was very concerned that this child was so innocent that he thought it was necessary to grab several hundred miles to apologize to Andy's wife for not accusing himself. Arnold could have accidentally killed his brother, but no one is responsible for ending the marriage, which was apparently weak, except for two marriages. It's just stupid luck Arnold didn't get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are depressingly effective as parents who are in no way able to communicate with their son to find out what Arnold is going through. Jason Presson, whom I have not seen elsewhere, except the childhood favorite called EXPLORERS and the horrible story of THE LADY IN WHITE, did an incredible job, like Arnold, a great actor for children. <br /> <br /> In addition to being somewhat slow at times, STONE BOY is a great and very depressing film.
