"Adult film" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck is doing it well and is still better than the average movie, which is aging very well. Although it is a comic book, the rest of the film is lower, but the film has a great feature (Italians in Brooklyn) that is not used to exchange characters or viewers. (ie Mobsters is never a complication. It never gets grotesque like my big fat Greek wedding). The secondary story is economically spoken with short scenes that allow the larger yarn to be interrupted. These are scenes that are missing in today's movies, where their direct value cannot be impressed by manufacturers and big women. I miss these scenes. It also includes beautiful characters. The film takes its light and quiet path to its final result. There is no badly written scene that would include somewhere that some executives sphynter to relax. Drilling and Cher are doing a great job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck refers to the old school, ethnic, working week, New York, like â€œMarty, except Moonstruck is less sacred.
