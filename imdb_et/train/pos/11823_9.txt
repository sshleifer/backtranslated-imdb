I really enjoyed it to take Dick Tracy personally. It is a well-made product that used modern technology to handle imaginary comic book history. If you are a fan or recently watched some old Dick Tracy b & w movies, you will definitely get out of this release. Pastel colors and the larger characters of life that have been done carefully during an authentic era are entertainment because it is meant to be. Personally, I think Madonna's musical element is a big part of this movie - the CD containing the music of this movie is what I've often listened to over the years, it's just so well done and tuned to music and age. In my opinion, Madonna's best moment is both on the screen and especially musically. This is definitely your "boy".
