Classic comic, always enjoyable and funny. It has an interesting symbol with loved characters. Road Rovers is an exhibition worth seeing, it is a short 13 episode and if you can ever see it, you should do it. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD containing all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they did, you should buy it. if you have children who like dogs, they love to have tea! Road Rovers should have paid more attention when it was on the air, it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been much more appreciated than it was.
