I didn't approach "still crazy" with any real expectation. Just another rock'n'roll picture, I thought ... good nostalgia for baby boom. This movie is partly this, but so much more. Director Brian Gibson previously directed Tina Turner's biography and is quite successful in his style. I think it's right that it was his last movie. <br /> <br /> Cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is at the forefront of the band. Actor-turned director Bruce Robinson appears as a band-guitarist. She does a great job, although she hasn't appeared on the film since the late 1970s. If you are looking for a touching and funny movie (with some great songs), you have found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
