The last (I believe) The Boys movie with Hal Roach, this is also the last really funny movie they did before they went to the 20th century fox that so giftedly gave their talents. Although there are weak moments - for example, "lung tester" activity is a bit, ah ... overblown (but worth it, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but this flick is generally a good summary of what boys bring the screen. Richard Cramer (uncrowned) appeared in other L&H flicks and was threatened with Nick Granger here. A scene where the Boys have to eat their synthetic meals ("Looks good, smells good, and it probably tastes good. Eat it.") Is one of my favorite moments in creation. Stan & Ollie has always been a companion to the lives of millions of dedicated fans.
