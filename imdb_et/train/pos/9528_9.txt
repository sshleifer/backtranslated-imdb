Frankly, this movie has gone over most of its detective drivers. <br /> <br /> Unlike the disappearance (lost), salvation (rescued) and this movie is one of the few dealing with two concepts. The film also examines the love and disappointment that the father-son has in his relationship. First of all, it should be noted that none of them are currently fashionable. <br /> <br /> The premise is that dads are moving, hit by Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his offender John Rooney (Paul Newman), love your sons and do something to protect them. But Rooney's son, Connor, is even more bad than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover his father's stealing. When Connor learned that Michael Sullivan's son saw it, he mistakenly killed Sullivan's second son (and Sullivan's husband) who tried to silence witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides that he wants the price of vengeance at any cost, even at a terribly high cost. Rooney, who gives birth to Connor's birthday in one scene, refuses to give up her son Connor to Sullivan and hires a contract killer Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor to the journey that is on the road. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, accompanied by his surviving son, young Michael, continues Sullivan's way to Connor Rooney along the road to Perdition and Maguire continues to Sullivan. When Sullivan stands in the basement of Rooney's church and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family, says Rooney - "Michael, there are only murderers, .. and only one guarantee, no one of us sees in Heaven." predictably, one character and one character repent are saved. <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he characterizes himself to play Sullivan convincingly, giving fine and laconic performance. Newman is making an old Irish gangster, Rooney, showing his face and way hard, his eyes haunted by Connor's misdemeanors. Jude Law plays Maguire in an appropriately creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays young Michael naturally and without influence. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has always been a source of light, reflecting on the issues of salvation and disappearance. The camera pulled the green and gray palette. Gray belonged to fathers and depressed urban landscape of Illinois. The Greens belonged to the younger sons and to the rural areas of that country. Thomas Newman's lush, amazing and haunting music was weak with Irish recordings and was played in a Copland-like arrangement. Sets were authentic western downtown factories, churches. Homes went to glowing wood products. <br /> <br /> The excellence of the film is the creation of a unique feeling that comes from its deep themes, distinctive functioning, and surrounding music and cinematography. The only negative was the light anti-gun message that slipped into scenario y, the film was limited to political correctness. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie out of 10 out of 10; over time it is recognized as a great movie.
