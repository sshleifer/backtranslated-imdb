When I reach 35 on the back, I find that I shake my head more and more, who are sexual, nowadays, drug-influenced teens. It was great to remind me that it was just as bad for me as today for teenagers. This movie takes home to the core. If you are a fan of the 70s, you love the movie. KISS Poster to Angel Concert is a movie! <br /> <br /> Look young Laura Dern. Why didn't they have more Runaways songs I never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with Randy Quaid's character who fired a 16-year-old girl. When he was gone, he had a party with his friends that destroyed the guy. Police officers come and everyone but does not mention all minors drinking and how these children have received this thing. <br /> <br /> Fox is located there, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused and kids like one of the most lucrative tricks ever. <br /> <br /> I say I buy it and watch it with my children and talk about it all.
