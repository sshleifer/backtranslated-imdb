"The best in the world" is a unique project. This is a Superman / Batman crossover movie trailer that does not exist and never exists, at least not in this form, with their stars, actors and plot lines. <br /> <br /> So the film is one big tease, even more than the usual real movie trailers. The trailer jumps all over you. In this regard, I really disliked this short project. Looking at this trailer, it makes you hungry and more exciting and at the same time sad - and maybe you feel even cheated when it turns out that this trailer's full-length movie doesn't exist at all. That makes you think about why this project was first done. Certainly Sandy Collora's skills have to be shown, but she couldn't do it with a short short film like her earlier movie "Batman: Dead End". <br /> <br /> But if you have to gauge this briefly for what it is, so from a technical point of view it is really great. This is a great look and more professional than you might expect, though people who have already seen "Batman: Dead End" already know better than to wait for a short cardboard set, cheap home costumes, and third to appreciate the participants. The short is not always impressive and the budget was not obviously high, but mostly it is very impressive and professional, with nice costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> The short has a good fast and typical trailer that maybe a little too much to make it credible, but hey, it fits well in trailer style. It has some impressive shots, but also a few flat, mostly Superman flying sequences. It was obvious that the boy was just standing in a moving car under which the target camera was aimed at him. I found it even pretty ridiculous. But really better and remarkable moments compensate for it. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn seemed to be a good Superman / Clark Kent, although he is clearly not his biggest talented actor. Clark Bartram reiterates his Batman role and Kurt Carley seemed fantastic to Lex Luthor. The rest of the majority also served their purpose well enough. <br /> <br /> This is especially interesting to watch after two of the main superheroes of the film have been recently translated into "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". It is interesting to compare the style and character of these films. It's really amazing and fun to hear how much Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, an actor who played Lex Luthor's "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> This is a good looking, well-made and built trailer that still makes you more hungry even though you know it's no longer. Whatever happened to Waner Bros., is he going to create a real full-length Superman / Batman movie? I thought that developments were going on a few years ago, but nothing has been heard about it. Instead, two new separate Batman and Superman films were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
