Great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, especially the reputation of "Portobello ballet" are proud. As for the animated part, the match between the animals has become a quick classic; The peak of the armature attack is chilling and exciting. I suggest you see a restored 134-minute version or at least 112-minute video. In Italy, we only have a 98 minute version, although the film was released in the original version in 117 minutes. If possible, check out the German video cassette: it was created from a 98-minute run, but it lacked any reference to World War II and all the scenes between the English people and their Nazi invaders!
