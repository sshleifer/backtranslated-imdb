In the rapid economic development of the 1990s in China, traditional Chinese culture is recovering, partly due to the rise of nationalism, accompanied by an increase in wealth, and, more importantly, by the feelings of spiritual belonging after the old socialist ideology after the Cultural Revolution. <br /> <br /> But the Chinese traditional culture, namely, Confucianism, was not without disaster, as Chinese tradition takes the entire tradition without losing its share, and the discrimination shown by girls in this film is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Moreover, not only the part that should be thrown away, but the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera and its technique, such as facial change, was ignored in revival and extinction. <br /> <br /> The director used this film to criticize the problem of the reintroduction of modern Chinese traditions.
