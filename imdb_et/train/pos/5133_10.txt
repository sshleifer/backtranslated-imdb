All the big studios pulled Jazz one reeler through the thirties and forties (Universal took the lead). While most appeared on the screen as cheap as they did, Warner Bros (which drastically stopped making them in 1946) often distinguished the corners, mirrors and optical effects of their cameras thanks to some creative drivers like Jean Negulesco. It is appropriate that the best of this genre would come from the studio. <br /> <br /> What sets "Jammin 'Blues apart from the rest of the package is that it is more like an avant-garde experiment than Hollywood's musical. From the usual jazz session in July 1944, "trippy" dreams of escaping from the war time are highlighted by the street "On the Sunny Side Of The Street". Gjon Mili and operator Robert Burkes (later to work with Hitchcock) were promised a lot of artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio took less care of how he and his fellow musicians presented it. The optical printer is well used, displaying several images from the same artist at once. (Norman McLaren actually milked this process in "Pas De Deux" twenty years later, while the Linwood Dune team had a different impact on Citizen Kane.) With a strong emphasis on silhouettes and illuminated cigarette smoke, it was before that time; in some ways it was in the pre-psychedelic sixties, but clearly in the style of the forties of the forty films.
