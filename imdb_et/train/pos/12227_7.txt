I studied it after a fun and linguistic challenge "Clueless" (1995), perhaps Alicia Silverstone's best efforts at the beginning of her film career. "True Crime" is Kevin Dillon, which should help improve most movie projects. In fact, all the cast persons do a good job. The only disappointment I think is a film for me is the uncomfortable "feeling" of some scenes that arises from the need to launch a rather uncompromising, up-and-coming theme that is part of what the toning begins as a schoolgirl adventure. /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good here. He carries well the naive enthusiasm and the growing unrest that affects Mary Giordano when he maneuvers reality behind the serum murder. I think there is some mileage in characterizing his MG. The story is that he continues his law enforcement career. For the older Silverstone, it might be really interesting that, after the crisis, Giordano would return to the official's life again. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows your director good light. Pat Verducci also has a writing loan. I don't know any other movie work on PV. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, it has largely unknown supportive casting, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly that. Over the last ten years, he seems to have managed to deliver an impressive number of screen performances. I recall that I saw him recently in the "Carriers" (1998), which was made for military television broadcasts. Bill Nunn played Captain Arends. The fans of the classic US television comedy "Who's The Boss" may also be interested in "Carriers" because the leading player is Judith Light, who is remembered for his many affection because his long-term participation in the show is <br /> <br /> "True Crime "couldn't just work but it's OK. I think it's a fun story to see.
