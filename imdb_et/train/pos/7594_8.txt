I don't know letters or contemporary Chinese teenage music - but I know a pretty interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood, played for laughing love and a great mix of Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to have had a lot of fun because this - production values ​​are great - and modern China looks more beautiful here than Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> An abandoned orphan picture plot that has grown up at Kung Fu School can be kicked out and then discovered as a superstart as basketball (and love, etc.) is great - it's fresh, fun and enormous entertainment. <br /> <br /> With great action and good dialogue, it's just enjoyable for all ages - and our money was one of the best family movies we've seen for a long time. Please ignore the negative comments and give Dunk a chance - we were really glad we did - Hi sport comedy movie.
