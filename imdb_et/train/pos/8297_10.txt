Stylish film was pulled in two directions. Its preference is Wes Craven. The budget for a TV movie shows, on the negative side, what could have been as big as a bigger budget. It moves as Susan Lucci pulls Robert Urichfamily into his clutches and tries to convince him of the secret of his health club. His latest invention, a space capable of analyzing people or things, is unexpectedly useful in the new neighborhood. Anyone who sees it should pay attention to Susan Lucci. His appearance and performance had unexpected consequences a few years later. Actress, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. Lucci was given a portrait of her, followed by a Catherine sitter. The black Sunday of the portrait of Lucci and Barbara Steele was used as references to Catherine's portraits taken immediately by Armourae. Probably due to the personal nature of the artist and Catherine. This is how we see the second story in both movies and the appearance of an unknown woman that would make an interesting movie.
