This is one of my favorite martial arts movies from Hong Kong. This is one of John Woo's earliest films and one of the few traditional martial arts films he directed. In this film, you see her influence on working under Chang Cheh. Action is good, fighting choreography is led by Fong Hak On, one of the bad guys in the film. He celebrates Wei Pei's "Five Venoms" fame and a host of faces familiar to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers. The story is interesting, there are some decent plots and the creation of characters and their relationship with each other is wisely done. This movie has only published VHS in the UK. Media Asia has issued a DVD for the region 3 and available versions of DVDs from the US. The movie is nice to watch in either its original language or in a duplicate in English. I highly recommend this movie.
