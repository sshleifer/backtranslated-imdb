William Powell's final outing as Philo Vance performs at Kennel Murder Case, where the dog of the Championship leads another two murders and one human attempt. It is all explained how it leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> The Vance murders by SS Van Dine were the most popular at that time and smart Mr Van Dine thought he would sell his books one by one to the highest studio provider. That's why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios that put them out. If Bill Powell did not get more audible with MGM than the Charles Charles of the Thin Man series, he would be known as the greatest of Philo Vance. It turns out that Powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same race where the murdered dog had entered and then became the first murder victim. As usual, Powell shows Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was to use his loose part to break the locked courtyard where the first murder victim was found. <br /> <br /> I said locked inside and it was the top story, so it was to find out how. Powell has a cute group of suspects, as extensive as the usual Thin Man secret. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor are doing their roles well. <br /> <br /> The Warner Brothers liked this version so much that it actually re-uses it in the thirties when James Stephenson is one and only out of Philo Vance. It has no candle. <br /> <br /> Since this is the only Powell Philo Vance that has been performed with VHS or DVD, look at it or get it when you can.
