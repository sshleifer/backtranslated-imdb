I saw this movie a year ago on television. Then it went under the heading "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a young boy, I remember the story being deeply moved and amazed by the visual effects of the trial (those who have seen it, know what I'm talking about). Such imagination! An ideal blend of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this film is here with the greatest classics: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with Wind. IMDB voters rate this film very well and correctly - over 51% of voters rated it from 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it from 8 or higher than 10. I was surprised that it wasn't on the top 250 movie list until I realized that few have seen / rated this movie compared to their list. What a pity. I hope this movie will appear on DVD in Region 1 (North America), so 1) I can buy it and 2), others discover its hidden treasure.
