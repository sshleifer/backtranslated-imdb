I loved to watch 'Sea Hunt' back in the day, was in high school and went home to do my homework, and at 4:30 am I would be looking at '' Sea Hunt '' and Mike Nelson in their underwater adventures. I love it ! He took a place under the big blue sea that was not very accessible at that time. Before 'Thunderball' or even before Cousteau changed, Mike Nelson was the one who created the children's imagination. I would be willing to bet that more than a few children developed their passion for oceanography or biology, or to look at one science, this exhibition has progressed, water photography is progressing, the excitement of exploration is easily stimulated by watching this exhibition. Watch and enjoy !!!
