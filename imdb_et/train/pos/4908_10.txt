I saw Martin for the first time when I was at home for 10 years, on the movie channel and still remember how it spoke to my life. It touched me because no other film touched me, and I remember my eyes seemingly. <br /> <br /> After I saw it for the first time, I couldn't find it elsewhere. I'd ask and no one would ever have heard of the movie! I think it was one of those rarest movies many people didn't know because someone and I don't know what I was talking about. Over the years, I was looking for a review of scanning shelves and cable television licenses in video stores, but I always came short. Finally, in 1996, I learned that I could make it a special order, and I've been watching it at least 50 times - and that still makes me cry. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but a really good boy) who wants to bring him back to a special lake where he grew up as a son. It was a special place where he lived from nature, spent his time with his dog and stayed alone in life. Soon he will go to the movie and he will go back to the lake. <br /> <br /> It is not long before the police found him, and Stecker grabs the child hostage to convince the police to go back. Soon Steckert and his hostage (2nd Martin) will get the best friends and have a lot of fun adventures - from the toy truck robbery to the train lift, all towards this special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Steckert has big setbacks on the lake as a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not destroy the end, but I will tell you that this movie is black. This is the best film I've ever seen in my life! I am definitely the biggest fan of this movie EVER! I managed to find the song that two Martti sing during the movie ("I'm going back to where I come ...) I'm going to even travel to Canada to see the lake and the cottage where Martin's Day was filmed, crazy, I know - but this film means so much to me.
