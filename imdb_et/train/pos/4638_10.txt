I saw this movie when I was in Israel in the summer. my Hebrew language is not smooth, so the subtitles were very useful, I didn't feel the movie at some point lost. You are used to getting used to subtitles in about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie blew me off !!!!!! It represents two of the most prominent taboos in the Middle East today: homosexual relations between Israel and Palestine. This allows a person to enter both conflict areas simultaneously. Dilemma, the accompanying emotions. The movie is in the tragedy when anger and rage go from one lover to one extreme! Absolute must see !!
