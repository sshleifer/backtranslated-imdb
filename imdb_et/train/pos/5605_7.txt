Roman Polanski's strange example clearly shows where his troubles were at the time it was made. Polanski himself plays a wretched man who rents a Paris apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed when he discovered what led him to him, so that he dressed up the events as if they had opened. A bit disturbing to the movie, and this is the horrible scary fear that Polanski stands out, but it is too much like the "Rosemary baby" and "Repulsion" rehash, two more Polanski films that deal with scary events but as worries when I don't read too much film, I have to believe that it was Polanco's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt was marked with sexual pervert and expelled from America. Do not make decisions in one way or another, but it is difficult to deny the evidence in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
