I remember this movie for a long time, though then, although it didn't have any special effects, acting was very good. And it has the same message today, although technology has changed, maybe they should redo this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also liked the music of the movie, Larry Norman was really a good songwriter during this time, although now most of the Christian music is worship and praise. I was always curious to know what happened to Patty after the end of the series? Did he start making more movies, eventually getting married and raising a family? I'd like an update.
