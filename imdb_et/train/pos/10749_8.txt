I rented it to my son, who recently found interest on September 11th. He was a kindergarten at that time and had no idea what was developing. I liked how it was said as a "documentary". If there was one movie I'd like to see on September 11th, this would be one! You usually see a movie with well-known actors. No one knew about this movie. You'll also see a movie about 9/11, you hear of a firefighter or two who lose their lives, saving people. I didn't feel like it had anything like that! I rented this movie only and would definitely like to add it to my collection! Very well done! My heart goes to the survivors and families of the 9 September victims!
