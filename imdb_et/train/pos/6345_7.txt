Costumes and make-up were great, with some extraordinarily funny features and a role for Jim Carrey. Carrey did such a good job as he could have done when writing a rather disappointing script. Of course, this was mostly a movie for kids, but if you are going to spend that much money doing a movie, you should at least give the body enough to go beyond Dr. Seuss. I was expecting more from Ron Howard. It is worth noting, but it does not have the necessary features to become a great class with any measure.
