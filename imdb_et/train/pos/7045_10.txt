This movie definitely gets me thumbs. It's a funny joke, and even this is from time to time a stereotypical and disparaging view of the people of Eastern Europe. Its plot is smart and 100% original and you probably have the whole movie believed. One person I was most impressed with in this film was Hilary Duff. It's easy and easy to see that he has taken a leap of faith that has stepped beyond the "chick-flick" genre. His accent is great and his acting power was surprisingly crisp and well executed. This is the best result I've ever seen of Hilary, and I've seen most of her movies. His character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "Eastern European Britney Spears" and is seen in some of his motifs and songs: "I want to blow you ... ... ...". You also feel sorry for her because her strength really grabs you, Yonica is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack had a laugh at the film, sometimes humor in hell, but also his facial expressions, and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will probably stir you all the time. I strongly recommend this movie.
