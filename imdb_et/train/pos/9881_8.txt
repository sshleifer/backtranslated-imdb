In the western part of Hollywood, there were harsh bunches of traces of hands, which, when they came to the city, were quite hard. Ultimately, trawling alone was a business before the railroads arrived in the United States. <br /> <br /> The times that worked on the trick head Gil Favor, played by Eric Fleming, were no different. But Fleming was all a businessman, had a job to do and hire a top team. <br /> <br /> Rawhide's long time, and because regulars mostly stayed with it, we found out all the bumps. The story of some points was focused on all of them, although most of them were Rowdy Yates of Fleming and Clint Eastwood, number 2 boy. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood's western image was designed by Rawhide, it's shameful that they aren't shown more often. Probably because they were black and white. If it had been NBC, it would have been done like a Bonanza color and it should be as often as it is. We would see a lot more men who became a legend of movement. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Eric Fleming left the show before closing the movie. He did some of them and hoped the exhibition would give him the name of a financial movie. Unfortunately, he was killed in a movie scene where a feature film was drowned in the river. If he had lived, he would have been named Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Clint took over the lead in the last season and then finished the show. And, of course, he became the icon of what he is today, not just in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough Westerner who had tough guys in it. No matter what the frills are, they worked with cowboys who just worked and fought with elements and in any situation they were thrown out every year. <br /> <br /> They won't make the TV show any more. What a pity.
