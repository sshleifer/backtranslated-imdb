I really enjoyed it - I'm a big movie fan that mixes your mind and leaves you with lots of questions and ideas to discuss, and that was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at it (well, almost always. Let's just forget about Jabberwocky and brothers Grimm, are we?). <br /> <br /> I especially liked how he was concerned with avoiding paradoxes - the way past and future events became interwoven and feed on one another. <br /> <br /> It was also aesthetically pleasing - the direction of art was really great and I wanted to be able to see it on the big screen. Future scenes knew Brazil in a very similar way, and even the current scenes were often visually convincing. they don't like Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt and they both gave amazing performances here. Pitt especially - I saw one or two films before, which made me realize that in fact he could actually act (as opposed to what I originally thought), but it really surpassed them. I found myself asking my friends at one point "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable result of his career (although it may not be too much).
