I say that the domino principle is a tremendously underrated film. Anyone who has taken the time to explore our modern conspiracy history, jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and many others can conclude that the domino author's principle really knew what he was talking about. Ros tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh. to mention some. The conspiracy scenario associated with spies, big business and political murders is not really fiction, but our hostile existential history.god helps us, but the domino principle is more of a fact than a fantasy. if it causes a little sleep loss, maybe it should do it. , study for yourself.
