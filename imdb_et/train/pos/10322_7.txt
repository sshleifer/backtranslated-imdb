The problem is that the film traveled to the coacillas of the 60s created concepts that comic books can only be made in a "camp" (ie the 60s Batman exhibition) for a TV and movie. So you have sequences with subtitles (come on!), Unreasonable Doc Savage from Marriage (he was uncomfortable in female masses, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair at night (the scene was secured for several nights by nightmares) and completely hockey that ended with a secondary bad, surrounded by gold like Herve Villechez, which is an Oscar statute. And if they don't make blooming Sousa March scores, the stunningly small funny music will bring down drama. <br /> <br /> Even as such, this movie ... okay. It's fun, and if it's serious, it's a very precise pulp. Except Monk, as mentioned earlier, he is very muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a harsh tough, in an attitude, not a Paul Gleason (unexplained) scarf. <br /> <br /> Green death sequences are, for example, very bad and nothing I recommend to children. But they are close to the pulp. When writers and manufacturers get it right, they get it right - I give it to them. <br /> <br /> But if manufacturers had made two Superman movies with Doc's loving care and scripts, such as Reeves, think what we might have been. I think the problem is schizophrenic in the film. It's a good idea to try to make 30 years of respect, but they're also trying to give the "heroes to be a camp" attitude Batman created. It has the impression that there was a sober, first draft of the pulp, and then someone came and said, "Hey, let's make it funny - it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> But Doc lives with Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch doesn't help Doc Savage in this movie, the man is really demented. So when the series actually reaches the TV (allegedly mid-season '9900'), Doc Savage, which was renewed in the 90s, once again lives.
