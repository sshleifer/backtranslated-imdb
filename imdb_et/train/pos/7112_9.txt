A very good warfare film that shows the impact of war on the hometown boy who loses sight in Guadalcanal and has to come home and adjust himself with the help of his family and friends. A great actor show will make this movie very fun. Eleanor Parker's role as a girlfriend was worthy of being an Oscar candidate. He has such innocence in this film. Ann Doran's role was just as satisfying as all his small supporters. I especially like the aura of the post-war city of Phildelphia. The hunting area is very good. Of course, the Guadalcanal war scene really showed the fear our soldiers faced during this epic battle. The film and what should not be forgotten are well deserved
