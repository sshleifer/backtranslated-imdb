Okay, so I've come far from Houston now, but when I see this movie, I bring back a little cowgirl dream to drive one day to Mr Gilley's. (It burned down before I was drinking.) <br /> <br /> When you grew up in East Texas, you know that this film is the exact image of modern life. If you don't trust me and watch a movie. Are you joining many who love it (and at the same time strangely rebounding), or at least you can have fun with funny jokes. (There are lots of materials to have fun.) This movie doesn't try to be P.C. (which was in the 80's) or hide the white trash element and it is honest with time and place. <br /> <br /> You have to be 10 for me!
