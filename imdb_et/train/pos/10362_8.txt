Meryl Streep is a wonderful, nuanced and stoic performance that is infamous for Lindy Chamberlain, who was accused and tried to kill her baby Azaria Chamberlain and used her defenses with her looting dingo. A CRY IN THE DARK is the "Evil Angels" and entitled "Australian Press Release" to watch. It is a scenario that is too real for us in America: a witch's wolf against a person who is considered a simple target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke in his mind, someone who did not play a compassionate card, and someone who was just difficult to move on with his life, despite his terrible challenge, was labeled as a suspect and hated even when he was clear of not killing his child. The media began to tighten up and gradually invade the privacy that soon the whole nation was glued to their kits, as they were split up by this family. And through all this, Lindy was still like never before, even when her husband Michael was breaking up. <br /> <br /> This attitude is, of course, a force of force that is unreasonable because it may seem and people react strongly to it. They want to see a crying mother cry and cry, and occasionally weak every step, not to sit and look empty. People do not understand that not everyone complains the same way and when someone decides to be strong, they start to speculate. Meryl Streep embodies this on the destroyed woman's hat and in this way creates a cold, but not unknown woman who stood in her convictions, even if they paid her freedom. Thanks to him, Sam Neill is allowed to slowly dissolve his character in despair - someone must be or Chamberlains too loose, and no one wants to see it. Except for the monster that has become the press at the time of writing. They always eat train crushes and eat mangled manure to the uninformed public.
