This is one of my all-time favorites. Great music and funny bits. I laugh every time in Millie, a servant who pretends to be dututan, keeping her delicious dress during the conversation and thoughtlessly polishing the furniture as she talks. I will never be able to bypass my French accent as he tries to throw him away as a superior daughter. <br /> <br /> Seeing the teenage Mel Torme and the very young Frank Sinatra song is such a treatment. My mother saw Frank Sinatra in the theater about the time that the movie came. He said they could not release the "bobby-soxers" between the movies (these days, you don't have to leave between the exhibitions). This movie shows how young Frank was attractive and attractive and also allows you to evaluate his early talent. And Victor Borge goes into his routine a bit, a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with sweet, easy stories. Very enjoyable.
