Sentimental story with sentimental soundtrack. It's about a little girl (obstructed by the voice) who treasures her green parrot Paulie. A parrot thinks and speaks like a person and gives help and advice to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> Parrot is definitely a movie star. Sometimes, the bird strikes the mood in the most remarkable and expressive way of matching the mood at times of depression. Also, synchronized voice is very well done and within minutes you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, the father gives the bird to the pawnshop, and the following scenes tell Paulie's story of a constant struggle over many years to get back together with his lover. One of the many memorable scenes is when he gets into a bad company and is encouraged to use spy houses. Paulie seems to have a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable, but who would like it differently. Children love this movie and anyone who keeps the bird as a pet will delight Paulie's mind.
