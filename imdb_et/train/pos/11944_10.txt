I gave it to 8, but since your people did 6.5 out of much better votes, I had to contribute. The Styx River was a pure genius. Of course, Woody was his perennial stuff, but at least his role was relevant. The first half hour was very fun and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. Dialogue was smart enough and the Woody card tricks at parties with the upper crust reaction were fun to watch. It was much better than newspaper critics sounded like that. And plus, a little sorcerer to go with it. And of course, did you notice that Johansen is a little clumsy? Charles Dance is always fun, like Hugh Jackman.
