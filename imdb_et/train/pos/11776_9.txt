Chuck Jones 'Hare Conditioned' is a fast paced, often fun cartoon. Bugs Bunny hitting a strange, yellow-skinned apartment house manager who wants to fill her, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of its multi-purpose setup. Chase takes Bugs and his chaser through various departments, resulting in an inspired gag where they quickly appear from different departments that carry any clothes related to that part of the store. However, this great worship is astonished by a truly inspired queue of elevators, where Bugs, a hidden elevator boy, tricks the shop manager to consistently get in or out lifts at the wrong time. This is a brilliant climatic kit that unfortunately makes the way to a not very funny final gag. By this time, "Hare Conditioned" has become its brand as one of the big wild energy bursts. As Bugs became more sophisticated than other cartoons during this time, Hare Conditioned showed that he could still be as attractive as an anarchic character.
