So are your bairnies in sleep mode? Spouse Visits Mother's Law? You are at home. It's a dark and stormy night, and there's no football on the TV and the dishwasher needs stacking? Now, what are you going to do? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you! Go make old-fashioned cocoa (Frys is the best!) Hold some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now choose and play Arthur Askeys World War Two thriller / horror Ghost Train, back to that comfortable sofa and enjoy the evening! <br /> <br /> Ghost Train is a real British war classic! Arthur Askey, with his side stroke, Stinker Murdoch, will entertain you and I suspect it is cast with a high octane, excitement and leak, espionage thriller. It is set in the old England during World War II. <br /> <br /> It is surrounded by a group of dirty people, who have to stay overnight, under no controlled conditions, in an old railway waiting room they discover, haunted by an old train. <br /> <br /> The plot opens properly and accurately, and it's a credit for all the pain, it's partly and sometimes really scary humor! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by this old boy Godfrey of Dads Army celebrity and it's smart) <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey is entertaining and very home to shape his routines for you and cast, he also can do a little bit of action! The cast is never staged, even the railroad porter and parrot give the film the necessary gravity. <br /> <br /> Oh, when it's over, don't forget to stack the washing machine!
