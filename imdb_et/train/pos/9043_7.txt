I just hit this movie on the TV one day. It was aired in the middle of the day on a channel that was not well known for encouraging good films. But that was nothing but good. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of a boy, Homer Hickam, inspired by Sputnick's launch. He and his friends are building rockets. His father does not want to rejoice over the new found hobby of his sons and see him as a coal mine rather than himself or go to college as his brother in his football scholarship. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. Maybe a little too predictable, but it's OK because it doesn't focus too much on those parts. This is an important part, but if it is an internal activity, the activities between the characters are focused. The story is good. It has some clichés, but it's OK. It is based on the actual event so you cannot simply exclude such clichés. The characters are really good. When the story is downhill, the characters are brought out and the film's performance and quality can be kept high. You know these signs and receive sympathy for them. They are well written and credible. <br /> <br /> This is a good looking movie. Sets and 50's styles are thorough and the images are well-designed and well-lit. All this makes the film's mood very good. <br /> <br /> Actress is very good. Jake Gyllenhaal provides excellent performance when Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper are good as John Hickam. As for the rest, they are also good. All of this forms a pretty strong cast. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm glad I captured this movie. It was first, after I saw it, that it was based on real events. If I knew it, it would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie that I believe everyone can enjoy. It's a kind of sensitive film. Not at all bad!
