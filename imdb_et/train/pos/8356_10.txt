Not sure if it is considered a spoiler or not, so be careful: <br /> <br /> Just a small but decisive thing to look at, an intriguing opportunity: boys steal a green Citroen at one point, enjoy the joy and return it the owner, who has made the car with purposeful and terrible hidden damage, hoping that the owner will collapse. Is it the same car they steal from the picnic family much later? We know that the original owner sold it. In the end, they drive the dangerous road I understand to have been closed to all but pedestrians in the last ten years. There is a whole new inclination to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> For another thing, this movie could have been called "a woman's scent." I don't remember another movie, certainly not an American who treats a woman's smell so honestly and openly, like a fine Bordeaux nose.
