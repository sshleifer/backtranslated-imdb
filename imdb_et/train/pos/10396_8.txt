It was usually the advice of Alexander Korda of many of his subjugations; the film is credited with three directors, but in fact Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped to push it to six. <br /> <br /> For John Kobal's "Top 100 Movies" 1987 interview, 81 film critics saw Baghdad's thief reaching 55th place. On closer inspection, only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor, and Kobal, who actually voted for this picture themselves, were showing up, but their large placements were enough to bring it close to the half way mark. <br /> <br /> During World War II, the film production in England and America changed and finally it was completed in 1940 and won three technical Oscars. Like Citizen Kane, there are some ways that you could admire rather than love. <br /> <br /> The special effects that are outstanding are still reasonable and really catch up. But it is not so much their effectiveness as the courage of the inventions. Among them is an amusing horse made from a set of models that, when inserted into the rear end, will fly. There's also a killer-toy of the six armed goddess Kali (maybe one woman who has two women behind her) and a pretty horrible giant spider. Also impressive is its excellent flying carpet tip. But the most memorable must be Rex Ingram, who sees a cinema evening of a great moment, a genie that is nearly a thousand feet long! Ingram represents the gene as a rather threatening creature and poses a threat to the procedure. And look for a moment when he is deceiving the bottle! <br /> <br /> This is what John Justin does with an Arab king who, for some strange reason, has English accents and a stiff upper lip. Saba, an amazingly muscular 15-year-old, is an Abu named companion. When they have gone through evil Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin finds himself blind and Abu becomes a dog. If it seems that the rest of the movie is being spoken of from the blind spot of the blind Ahmed (Justin), we find that halfway through the movie we are going to the present and the adventure continues. In fact, the other side is better, with a bigger incident and more fantastic in nature. <br /> <br /> Three small songs are pepper, although as the film lasts for 100 minutes, it seems to be the actual ingredient rather than a light flavoring; I do not classify it as music. It's all very fun; Justin and Jun Duprez are in love with mothers and fathers, Weaver is a boo-lift villain and Abu is a youthful, unbreakable robber. The somewhat timed mindset of over 40s of English movies and the overwhelming melodrama may take some time, but if you have felt for the first half an hour, this movie really attracts you. Pretty commendable.
