I remember looking at "Gung Ho" with her mother and wondering why she always cries in the last few minutes. Of course I found the whole movie fun, especially the characters. Only when I was a lot older and looked at it again, I realized how much deeper this exhibition really is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe look like their reluctant mediators. Keaton finishes with my real lifestyle, and Watanabe adds humor and stamina to the mix. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply fabulous in terms of his comic relief. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the eighties. We can all learn from joining American and Japanese workers to this movie ... sometimes you can * be the best of both worlds. And now I understand why my mother knew how she did when they closed. I have one of these cars.
