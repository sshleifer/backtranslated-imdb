William Powell is a doctor who deals with the murder and former wife of The Ex-Mrs Bradford, as well as Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had chemistry with almost every woman he was with. Though he and Myrna Loy were perfect screen pairs, the actor made a few other "Thin Man" films, one of which was Ginger Rogers and this Arthur, with a very good result. <br /> <br /> No one is tired of seeing Powell as a smart, crazy professional, and "ex-Bradford" is no exception. Former Mrs. B is Mr B, who went to return and then moves back to help him solve the mystery he has dragged him. And it's not the first time he did it! It almost seems that it was a "Bradford" movie before, or that it had to be the first in a series of films - Mr. B complains that his mysterious writer ex always takes him to cases. This time, the horse falls down from the horse in a pet horse with a favorite horse and dies right before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The case solution is extreme, but it's next to the point. The thing is between the pair and the former lady's intervention. B. Jean Arthur is very funny in his role and very funny. However, if an actor who comes to Artyur so excitedly, it seems that humor seems more deliberate than dull. I suspect there was something else in the writer's mind - let's say, Carole Lombard's clever side. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, he says, "Ah, this is probably about my alimony. like William Powell and Jean Arthur have always been.
