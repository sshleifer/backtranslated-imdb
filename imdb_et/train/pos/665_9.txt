"And all through the house" is a special cryptic episode not only because it is from the first season, but this episode was the first I saw! I remember a young man who rests with his parents that in the summer of 1989 in our HBO hotel room in South Carolina, I saw this episode and was buried in Crypto right now and forever! I had always been a frightening fan of the series and liked the monster movies, and with this series of HBO's, I was once again afraid of joy. This episode, the first thing I saw is a memorable one for me and one of my favorites, it's just so nice with a nice twist. "And all through the house" is a nice cozy place on a snowy Christmas Eve that is a great way to relax! Anyway, you are Mary Ellen Trainor (who, by the way, plays in many Warner brothers, usually in small parts) as a greedy master woman who takes care of her door, waiting for money and new romance. Only like most of the horror series of things turn to the worst and bad people can get what they deserve. Coefficients are deposited to a great extent when a maniac dressed as Santa flees from a local nutty, making it late on Christmas Eve! Old E.C. from comic lessons you will learn that bad people get what they are bright! Well, this story ends with a perfect vacation trip! This story was also in the 1972 film and was performed by Joan Collins, undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the most classic chronic episodes of all time!
