"Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" None of the above is comparable to sophisticated shine in "Sopranos". Each symbol has layers of layers of absolute truth, completely three-dimensional. We take care of Tony Soprano with all his heart, despite the fact that he is evil in the simplest model of good and evil. Soprano is the most provocative, complicated and exciting competition ever created for this era. If you're in the mood to publicly challenge her as a spectator, and be forever entertained, see "Sopranos". I don't want to sit down and watch the first episode of the 1st season and don't want to continue this series. Every season is completely peculiar. DVDs are important for everyone's collection ****
