Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in exhibitions. I've read both of her books and I think she's great. Peter Faulk can provide the best of them. The combination of these two is magical. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a family who really knows each other. For the first time in a lifetime, the father and son connect through the road to a family crisis. They do everything the fathers and sons think they are living ... they just do it later in life. The situations are very funny, but they feel they could actually happen to people in real life (not obsurdly over the top or caricature). This is the first time I look at Paul Reiser and I have fully believed all the emotions I imagined. Sometimes her eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret a movie and a great story and plot. It has comedy and emotion, but an uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas is doing a good job :)
