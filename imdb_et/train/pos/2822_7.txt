Film Torrent was the first and the last for Greta Garbo. It was his first American film in MGM, the only American studio where he ever worked. It was also the last time someone else settled on his credit, his leading man with his Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on Entre Naranjos, a popular work by Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez. It concerns a couple of inappropriate lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who cannot come together very much, mainly thanks to the machinations of Martha Mattox, the mother of Cortez. <br /> <br /> Mattox is an evil woman who has some ideas about who her son should marry. Remember that this is Spain and such organized marriages were still on time. Mattox has a daughter of Gertrude Olmstead, a successor to Mack Swain, who has grown to grow hogs. Swain offers some time for comic relief for his delicate piglets before they grow into large old pigs that have to be killed. filmed in Rudolph Valentino's lead. Perhaps it would have been interesting if Valentino had done this with Garbo, but he could have gone further than making a movie. In any case, one Valentino wannabes is filled with Ricardo Cortez's male lead. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons Valentino did not want this movie is that it is clearly Garbo, unlike the other works mentioned earlier. . When he makes a Cortez dirt that does what Mattox and his "adviser" banker Tully Marshall say, he leaves Spain and goes to France where he becomes a great opera star. And he is leading a rather scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When he returns to Spain and tries to revive things, Mattox is even more outraged. He has a political career for his son. Cortez is now working on behalf of the Spanish Parliament, which is strangely Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the flood and dam breakage that causes all kinds of destruction on land. Cortez actually pulls Torrent on a boat ride, trying to save Garbo from damage. When they come together, they have a brutal understanding of the brutality that comes from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here, primitive, though they seem now, are quite remarkable for their time. They look very similar to the 20th century Fox's The Rains fires that appeared in 1939 and won the Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately, Torrent came one year before Oscar made his debut. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to end up with anything, so you have to watch a movie to find out if the Cortez and Garbo come together at the end. Garbo correctly won his reports on rave comments and at the age when exaggerated gestures were the norm for making a silent screen, he was very subtle in his role. So he would be the rest of his career, he had a remarkable face closeups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo continues to work much better than Torrent, this movie is still a good debut for her on the big American screen and keeps the audience up to date.
