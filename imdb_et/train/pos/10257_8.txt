what can i say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Well to tell the truth a lot it looks very fake like some slaps and kicks. how did Charlie go, though it was real, I don't know. im sure they will hit and hit him much harder than it was. However, scenes with squeezing and hot oil are very real. and the final needle in the eye is amazingly made and is probably the only thing on the film that has ever shocked me.
