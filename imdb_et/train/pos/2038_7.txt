This movie surpassed my expectations. I thought and heard it was garbage, so I didn't expect much. But I was pleasantly surprised. At first I didn't take the lead girl well and didn't care if she lived or died. After a while he certainly grew up on me and became a pleasant character. It's not just some movies where people die for no reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds to film, but explains a lot. I recommend this movie to everyone. If you're not sure, look at it anyway, it's just one and a half hours of your life. You live 80 years anyway.
