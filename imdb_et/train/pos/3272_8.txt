With the same director who made "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I am not surprised that this is a good film. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a movie that I haven't heard yet, but it has to be one of the best films of the late 80s - partly because it is the worst film of the last decades. (Not talking about Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) The actor is not brilliant, but just sure - unlike what some of the people here claim (they must have dreamed of "wonderful action" like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way that binds all the loose ends nicely. These unanswered questions will obviously be targeted, leaving it with an individual interpretation and with nothing like this. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual mix of children's movies and horror, effectively using sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical film-clich√© ultra-shy but secret, brilliant social challenge, but a normal normal child; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers who put their false kind in their books and on the screen like their childhood, as if one had cared more to look or read another poor, lonely childhood, as if it were all there or as if it were such a character in the background potential monopoly. Anna's and the boy's "lurking" scene (quite stretching) was a bit much - creating both indecisive feelings and entertainment - given that she was only 11 years old, but it was predicted that Burke was 13 years old. 14 when it was filmed. I have no idea why they do not fulfill the character's age and did not get a younger actor. It was obvious that Burke was not so young. Why do leaders always steer children who are older than what they play, so dilute realism, I never know.
