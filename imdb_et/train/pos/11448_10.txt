I first saw this absolutely damaging documentary when it was first released in 2001, and it really affected me so much so I took several of my friends to see it with repeated screenings. Bottom line: none of my friends went disappointed (ever!). This star film is a Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy, who creates natural materials (wood, water, flowers, stones, etc.) using absolutely beautiful works of art to create pieces that will eventually return to their natural state of temporary status?). We can see that Goldsworthy creates a number of temporary art works, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as a few pieces in the wild. German filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photos, and edits this meditation on a creative process that is a real face to face as well as a circumference (the music of the surrounding music, composed of Fred Frith and whose music is generally nervous experimental / noise) textured guitar, as well as a capable ensemble of musicians) . Although this movie has been available on DVDs for years, you may find a cinema that highlights the revival of this fine movie, always looking for it (it's just a movie designed for a big screen, with a skilful sound system that really experiences this movie in the right direction ). There is no MPAA rating but nothing offensive (unless the live birth of the sheep on the screen is offensive or disruptive)
