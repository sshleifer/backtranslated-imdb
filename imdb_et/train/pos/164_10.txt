Don't tell me I didn't warn you, but you laugh. It's probably enough to hurt. Of course it is a squirt of blood, but it's all fun. So, it's not a budget that needs a budget if you have such a script. <br /> <br /> Take your time and check it out. It's worth watching for two hours. If everyone could laugh during this movie, the world would be a much happier place to live. <br /> <br />
