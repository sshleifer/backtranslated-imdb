I was in the movie, but I don't know if they actually put that scene in. When we returned from school trips (2005), we stopped at the service station while they made the film, and we were asked (all of us) to go and shout! Free Bird! We were all about 10 years old, if someone who saw the film tells me if this part of the movie was actually kept, would be nice to know! I remember that I thought the film had never come out because it was 2 and a half years before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I think it has been a pretty successful movie, I can buy it, but first I would like to know if I'm in it! : D Thank you
