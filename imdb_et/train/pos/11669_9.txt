Being a prototype of the classic Errol Flynn adventure film and a good story and two more brilliant companions, Maureen O'Har (which is a fine beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this film to those who have even the slightest love for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Best of Hollywood!
