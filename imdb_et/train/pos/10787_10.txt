So when I was little I got this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved it. we would look at it all the time. when our friends came over, we would have a dream and we would look at the magical toys of the big candy mountains and grandfather. I'm now 21 and I love this movie, some old friends and I recently came together and watched it, we knew all the songs and danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. One friend bought this movie and the grandfather's magical toys for his 2-year-old daughter because he wants to pass on our love for this movie. It's really a movie that you can let your children watch and feel safe, not violence, bad language, but lots of great songs and important lessons.
