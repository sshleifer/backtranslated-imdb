All over the country, and especially in the political landscape, people who have any political ambitions should take the time to watch the movie. The film is called the "Town Hall", and with little imagination it can be synopsis across America. It just happens in New York. Here is the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino), who has enough to do little to manage the metropolitan area. His right-hand person is none other than the mayor's deputy Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally brilliant person whose ambitions relate to his mentor and both seemed to be in a higher position. Everyone is heading for this direction until the shooting of the police accuses Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) of leading the investigation, who believes that guilt points to the town hall and the mayor. The six-year-old boy and the death of a police officer are accused of a criminal offender whose questionable freedom brings about obvious political rewards and urban corruption, including union leaders such as Danny Aiello, played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judges such as Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also involved are party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works for the New York Probation Service. But this is the link between the mayor and his deputy, which is the task of random shooting. An excellent tool for Cusack and a solid contribution to becoming a classic. ****
