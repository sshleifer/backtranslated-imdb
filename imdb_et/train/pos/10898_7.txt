This movie is not as bad as I heard. It was enjoyable, funny and I love being around the saints. It is a pleasure for me from the Christmas shop and to listen to the music of the holiday. When this movie appears on the DVD, my place in Christmas collection will take place. This is a film to watch every year after Thanksgiving to get the best of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a little crazy, but I think it just adds a movie and why it's so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas twist of love. I enjoyed it. No, it is not Titanic and it doesn't make your heart pound with expectation, but it will bring a laugh or two. So laugh and enjoy time :)
