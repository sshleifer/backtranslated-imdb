This movie is wonderful. What separates it from 50 sci-fi is that an alien has no attributes, face, eyes, anything, but it can't be killed. I especially like the idea that this movie will not take place in a couple of days, it will happen one night, which is supposed to last at midnight. It's also scary that if the blow goes on you, you can't get it. You're stuck in it because it dissolves your flesh and eats your body slowly. My all time favorite 50 sci-fi movies and sometimes considered the most important. I understand why this Steve McQueen was frightening. All this and a memorable theme! How can I go wrong?
