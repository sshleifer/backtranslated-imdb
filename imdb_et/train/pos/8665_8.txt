I took this title Grindhouse Vol. One clean Euro trash film. But this film has a nice stamp of approval and it should serve a better transmission than what is there. Stupednous it's not ... it's satisfactory! Looking at this movie, I couldn't wonder ... how does Sergio Martino not do this flick? It has its signature and has been edited by Edwedge Fenech (unfortunately it is not as well known as it should be, but it got a nice fire in Hostel II). Double crosses and triple crosses undermine and film this film from the beginning to the end with Lee Van Cleef, who shifts under pressure from the first second. Did this man come to Italy to finally reach his potential, or did the studio system let this man slip? In addition to Lee's more recognizable films, filmmakers should try it and see how Sergio Leone would have reduced its epic scale in the United States once after a time (and a quarter of a budget) that would be what he would have seen. So refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and make this sofa matin√©e
