This beautiful story from an older store that arrives home and learns to love and be part of all the things she has left home is moving and moving. It shows the society that is alien to us in the western world, with the family feeling we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes funny and comic. It is a reality that we no longer see in our Western films. <br /> <br /> Operation is unusual because, as the movie progresses, it almost gives the impression that it's not action, but a documentary from ordinary people. It's brilliant leadership and making movies. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more films from this director.
