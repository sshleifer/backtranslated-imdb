I got this movie on a long night cable and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why this film was not better known because the topic is very disturbing. But if you can deal with sexual abuse, it is a well-functioning, suspicious and very interesting film. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the subject is not a weak heart, the film does not go to the film (for example, 8 mm). <br /> <br /> I recommend it to all who enjoy successive killer and temporary films.
