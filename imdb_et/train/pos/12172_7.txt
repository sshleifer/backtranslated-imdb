This movie starts brisk, in the middle there are some slow moments, but generally it moves well, there are some very good moments, then parsley at the end of Law 3. (with two different ends). Jason Lee is a star, but he's not the man leading tomorrow. He is humorous and owns, but he is a better supporting actor. Julia Stiles plays a role in comedy that is new to her, but she doesn't steal the movie as her caliber star should be. For an actor who has so many potentials (10 things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to see how he continues to do so, and then he doesn't have to play his role and go to the movie (as Daniel Day-Lewis did) 'Gangs'). Selma Blair is also a good young actor and does her job. I didn't expect him from the Academy and he didn't give it, but his performance was enough. Chris Koch presents another film that is "above average". Perhaps the problem in the script is more than anything else. I did like this movie! But this is not a movie where you walk and say ... "It was great!" ... This "story" has been done so many times before and here was not much new. The sample dinner was probably the best in the film and Larry Miller gives an incredible result in a supporting role (he may be the best surprise in the film). If you want to see a movie that laughs a few times and enjoys the evening, I can still recommend this movie, but if they haven't changed the end ... again ... they leave the church scene, or you are definitely disappointed.
