"Artemisia" speaks of one of the first female painters to gain historical recognition of the true story of the temptation and inconvenience of young Italian female enthusiasm that she faces. The film has a rich costume and sets and good casting and acting. But it is confusing when he tries to portray the esoterics and time of art, and he has performed on the artist's passionate image painted on canvas and studied through his involvement with men. A good movie for those interested in Renaissance paintings or periodicals.
