In addition to being a very fun movie, I can add that the costumes and landscapes were great. Such a fun loving woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, he also had two greedy daughters who wanted to get their money. This woman was lonely after her husband died. He had offered him in a theater that was going to be demolished. To avoid this, he bought it. His daughters feared that he would throw away his money and decided to act. The characters of this film's character were also a big plus. I would almost give a copy of this movie in my video library, but it has never been published yet. Sad.
