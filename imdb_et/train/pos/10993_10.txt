This film is a pearl because it moves with a soft but firm resolution. <br /> <br /> I warn the viewers that although it is counted as a company spy thriller, and Mrs Liu is there, she is moving purposefully but at a slow pace. It's not about explosions, cars, or flying balls. You must be patient and note here instead. It's calm because it's the main character. The viewer must look at him and think about it as the story develops. <br /> <br /> I don't give a spoiler - because it destroys the viewing point. The plot is what you read from other posts: the average white collar looking for change and adventure for the company's spy work. Just go somewhere and save and transmit the inside data secretly. <br /> <br /> Get it here. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a surreal walk, with the company's disappointment that creates the suburban paranoia. Then it starts to pick up. <br /> <br /> The performance of all parts is great - and yes, some actions are caricature characters. But they're all fit and entertaining. And the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as a soft, soft and cordial subject: everything is not right at first. <br /> <br /> And at the end: It's not what it looks like. <Br /> <br /> Keep comfort and turn on the lights to watch - and turn off the sound: This movie wants you to listen.
