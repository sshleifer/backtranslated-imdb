I saw this movie a few days ago. This movie is so big that I feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it - you can do it. It shows the true desire that is happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart is really something you love, you can change things and be happy.
