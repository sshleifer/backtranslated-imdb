I can confidently admit (IMDb geek) that "Phantom Lady" will never hit my movie's top 20 on my film. It may not even sneak into the top fifty. But instead of discrediting the film as good as many other genres of movie genre, it should be noted that "Phantom Lady has strong and lasting images in it to make it worth watching. All that is required of the viewer is the ability to overcome a terribly slow start. <br /> <br /> The movie can't be cooked until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) tries to prove everything except for one-handed boss Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who has been convicted of murder. 'Kansas' is Anderson's secretary day and amateur at night. As a beginner, he will do well on the streets of New York at night. Gradually, he begins to put together a mystery piece of murder. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines and only because of its presence the film works well. Somehow he can breathe a life-condemned man's film, which is not the least interesting. I'm not sure if this characteristic driver's fragmented dynamics becomes the actor's or director's guilt, but that is clearly where something gets really wrong in the movie. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Raines, as a novice detective, things are picking up as the second hidden move when 'Kansas' pays for a late-night traveler (Elisha Cook, Jr) to look for some information to help her convicted superior. He and the drummer paint the city with a new type of red time when they visit "night" jazz clubs. In an attempt to describe this scene, either the scene is unfair or worse, it can destroy the scene together. You know the scene when the last crash is over. If you have succeeded in this movie on DVD, you can re-scroll the scene again and again. As good as Raines is this movie that makes this movie remarkable. This is mainly due to the fact that I appreciate Phantom Lady 7, not 6. <br /> <br /> For the most part, this movie has been thrown out and delicate with some great scenes and one great scene. This is a "drum / sex scene" that separates this movie from the same ilk. <br /> <br /> And as the movie says, "that you never go wrong with Vanilla," I would also like to add that "Vanilla Walking" is a safe return option if you can't decide whether to use more delicious medicines. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Clark Richards
