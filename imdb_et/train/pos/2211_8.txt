I don't watch many TVs except Office, Weeds, Entourage, and E! I think I keep this play in good companies. <br /> <br /> I love this dirty overview of pop culture that this exhibition brings. Soup also helps me keep what people in the office say about Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best part is that the soup shows their highlighting. exhibitions, which are usually the most funny or controversial moments (most people grab an American Idol because it's an exhibition that is rumors), so most people claim to watch. And that means I don't have to suffer the other 98% of their minds about talking or "reality", having a funny "funny" or "shock". The only reason why soup does not seem to me to be 10 is sometimes sketches not so funny, and even rarer is not always a comment. But they can't all be running at home, if so, soup wouldn't be E! <br /> <br /> Joel's quick and Soup writing team (which includes McHale) is a great show. I enjoy the wife and the comments the team has outside the camera. Even if they are obviously smile from time to time with politeness, it is fun because it is forced. They are probably ironic. And that's part of what makes this show funny.
