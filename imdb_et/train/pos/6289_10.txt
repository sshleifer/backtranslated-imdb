This movie has taken a lot. The critics broke it when it came out and were accused of destroying Nicolas Cage's career. What I don't think people are getting is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar nominee for a movie, it's just some great Bruck-buster action. Fast cars, fast editing and a great soundtrack - that's exactly what he says about tin. For everyone who loves cars, it is also a clean remedy. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, Hummer and don't forget Eleanor! I think you would be tough to find a better action film and a better personal movie! Then maybe it's just me!
