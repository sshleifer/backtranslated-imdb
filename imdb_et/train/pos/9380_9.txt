A lovely old-fashioned thriller arriving like a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, "Red Rock West" follows the malfunctioning of N.Cage, an unemployed oilman in injured veterans, because his happiness turns bad from worse after he reaches an empty gas tank and barely gets enough for coffee in one of the easiest towns on the back. From the very beginning, it has been established that Mr Cage may be down, but he is not out and he may be broken, but he does not steal, not even in his current terrible situations. The Walsh man whom he has ordered to murder his wife, Mr Cage, calls on her to warn her of her husband's intentions. He, in turn, provides him with more money for Miss LFBoyle to murder Mr Walsh. Mr Cage decides to leave when he is still ahead, but when he leaves the city, he hits the roadside. Called when he was supposed to ride, he takes the man to the hospital to find out he's been shot. Mr. Cage's deputies who call the sheriff, who turns out to be Mr. JTWalsh. Events take a further complicated course of action if, by escaping from custody, Mr.Cage prevents him from realizing his real power. From now on, you may be forgiven for thinking "enough already", but as the screen shows a completely logical course of events, the narrative flow of the film at this point seems unstoppable. Mr D. Hopper is a comfortably hired killer, like Mr Cage, USMC veteran. This little piece of serendipity keeps Mr Cage alive for a long time to think of a murderous trio and survive. It is a tribute to all the participants that what sounds remarkably like paper on a piece of paper is actually a tense, exceptionally well-made image with a perfect performance. "Red Rock West" is a movie lover film. Within five minutes you will know that you are going somewhere where you have visited many times before, but you are very happy during your trip.
