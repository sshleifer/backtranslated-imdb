Although this film has some weaknesses, it is worth seeing. I chose it because of casting and praised Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing roles different from the past. Both represent very worrying people with warts, but they make them pleasing to humanity. The story touches, but it is the performances that are rising. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable achievement, which for romanticism opened my eyes to aspects of people with disabilities that I had never thought about before, but was also interesting for other reasons. I felt the movie ended too sharply, but better than the emotionally manipulative end (see "Stepping Up.") Very real English inclusion for my enjoyment - it was in the 90s in England, both in urban and rural areas, without being frustrating.
