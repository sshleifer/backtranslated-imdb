I had to commemorate the end of Marcello Mastroian's tenth anniversary, despite the many films I own in my VHS; but in view of my ongoing light Christmas marathon, I had to do that! As it happens, he has one of his best productions - and he was correctly nominated by the Oscar (if the film was also honored). It was also one of 14 collaborations with this second most widely recognized star that appeared in Italy, Sophia Loren; Both play against this type - he is an unforgettable housewife and homosexual! <br /> <br /> By the way, the movie's title is double-skinned: leading characters are gathered on a historic day when Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event is shown as a long archive) but a more precise reference to a short meeting of friends sharing their friendship, moments of revelation and short passion - although everyone knows that returning to their normal existence is inevitable, leading to the end of the dramatic bittersweet. It is practically two-handed (with all the other characters - except the apartment building, where this story takes place in its entirety), which includes Loren's terrible and passionately patriotic wife, who was surprisingly played by John Vernon. start and close sequences); still not hampered by the narrow place of director Scolat (for his record this is his 7th film, which I was watching and taking on 3 more VHS) and the operator Pasqualino De Santis, so the result - though essentially low - the key - is far from static: camera is allowed to console the various parts of a larger building by following the process closely or vaguely, as the situation requires, but always sharply. <br /> <br /> Of course, the narrative is totally dependent on the performances of the two letters to make it convincing and both offer (their screen chemistry is quite incomparable); however, it is interesting that Loren walked with her prize in her house, that is Mastroian's moving but unpleasant foreign creator (the film seems to be somewhat suspicious that it equates her sexual deviation with anti-fascism!)
