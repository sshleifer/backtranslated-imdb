I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know the whole book is so hard to play, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they staged a very good show with Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I saw Lady Dedlock's pain even through the arrogance of aristocracy. I'm sorry I think he's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could have made a better Jarndyce, but I'm fine with Mr Elliott. These long books by Dickens are not easy to introduce - Oliver Twist would be easier - it's long and if you don't care about all legal situations, it can be tough or boring. I think this presentation is fun enough to be boring. I just loved Mr. Smallweed - it can be fun. There is always a child - Jo breaks your heart ... I think we should be given the opportunity to decide for ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I have to say I love this example. Maybe when I read the book again, as usual, after seeing the film, I may be more critical. Meanwhile - I think it's a good presentation.
