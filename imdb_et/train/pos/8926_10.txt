I don't think anyone except Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung makes the cinema cleaner than Claire Denis. That means I don't love this, his latest movie, as much as his 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (although it's very close), which is one of my favorite films. Just because the narrative here is a bit too elliptical for your good. Don't do me the wrong thing, the fact that this movie is not on the plot, is really one of the best things, but I think Denis took it about one degree beyond what it needed to go and so the movie flirting in misunderstanding and some key points should have somehow explain (as the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart transplant instead of showing him there suddenly without an explanation of where he is or why he is there). Some other characters also seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses that Denis would once again use pleasant actors (especially the character of Beatrice Dalle is a bit annoying because you expect him to have any importance). However, the film is wonderfully absorbable and cinematic is amazing. This is definitely a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denise's highly acclaimed "Beau travail", if not better. Claire Denis must be my favorite French director, better than Leos Carax. I also have to admit that the South Korean sequence really makes "Lost in Translation" better than the film itself (and I, unlike some, am also a big fan of this movie).
