I read some comments about this TV movie, all of which said the film was too long and that it was basically just sensational entertainment. I agree that although the film goes a little too long (2t30 would be enough ...), but I don't think it would be sensationalizing. Jim Jones's expansive capability and slow disintegration of mental illness, paranoia and drug abuse are never treated voyeuristically. The film takes time to show how Jones recruits followers (the character of Brenda Vaccaro and Brad Dourif is stand-out on this issue), but also on the surprising change in Jones's perception of reality. It is reasonable to see that the egalitarian, left and compassionate preacher becomes such a destructive and cruel dictator. Perhaps the film is not exploring enough of Jones' motivation, which can occasionally be a little superficial attempt (may also be censorship). But Powers Boothe's mesmerizing performance makes it all. I do not know the real details of Jim Jones, but Boothe sure makes the monster credible and real. There are many strong scenes in the movie, including Jones' preaching words, Jones's meeting with Father Divine (resettled James Earl Jones), Congressman Leo Ryan (Ned Beatty) at Guyana camp and of course suicide. It is a rather grim look and Boothe is quite leading in these last moments. Madge Sinclair shines in this scene as one of the most skeptical followers and is also done by Veronica Cartwright (like Jones' wife) and Brad Dourif, especially when their time is drinking a drink of murder. The relative peace, the delicious direction and the beautiful beauty of the natural environment at the end of this scene all make these pictures quite impossible to erase. Worrying debate about human nature and its weaknesses. It is worth watching if you only remember that one of the 20th century truly terrible events. Don't let it be repeated. As ironically, Jim Jones's camp title is: "Those who don't know the past must repeat it."
