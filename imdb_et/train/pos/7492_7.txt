Although this horrible film is not a horror film in the traditional sense, it delivers the goods. The vampire seems to be in a small German city that empties its blood victims. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas, with his early roles, is skeptical in believing that a crazy crazy killer is not a vampire. The only one who believes in him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), an assistant to the inspector, and Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill), who is probably an outstanding scientist with vampire theory. The townspeople doubt the strange Herman Gleib, who played his usual craze by Dwight Frye, who seems to have a lot of fun with his role. The film contains a lot of humor that helps to relieve some of the intensity associated with killing everyone. One funny part is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Ruth Bertin's aunt, believing that weird Herman hasn't got into bats, but a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This budget movie highlights "Dr. Caligar's Cabinet" with Dr. Niemann using a recommendation to make somnambul's "Frankenstein" orders using human blood to help create life in the lab, and "Dracula" because everyone The murders believe, except for the inspector and his girlfriend, that they would be a bloodthirsty. Thses elements are well disturbed by director Frank R. Strayer with a little comedy. Drinking is working. The restored version I looked at used tinting to increase the horrible atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
