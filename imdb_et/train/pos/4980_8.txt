When I was browsing past sales prices, I ran these comments. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I bought this short film from my parents 30 years ago and I am always very happy with it. I have shown it to many of my friends and they all loved it too. I have the privilege of having this original 1932s black and white silent Shirley movie before it became popular or well known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the film is "racy". Great thing! I only want it for longer. It looks like I'm the only person who owns at least one of these originals, so I don't know how much it is worth?
