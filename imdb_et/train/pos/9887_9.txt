"Erendira" is a film from Mexico that is rarely spoken. The film only exists in low quality VHS format. It's a shame that there is no DVD for this movie. "Erendira" is wonderful and proud of its magic-realistic images. "Erendira" is based on the story "Romantic 100 Years". Erendira constantly dreams of her grandmother's house. Her evil grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forces her to pay for prostitution for damage. The whole city becomes part of Erendira. Although the subject sounds harsh, the film does not use sexuality. It's done in a mature artistic way. The film also has some amazing costumes. Some of the most surreal aspects of the film that seem to be the most out are origami birds that morphize into real birds, and golden orange, with a diamond in the middle. Erendira is an amazing film that can even throw away humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD. As they would say in espanol, "Es muy muy bien !!!
