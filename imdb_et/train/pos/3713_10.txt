This film is about style, atmosphere and acting. True, I didn't believe in all the plot developments, but it wasn't important - the terrible act, the unexpected twist of the plot and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me straight and spent me driving, and I had a great time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor, but also a champion of accents and he proves it with a flawless Georgian accent. He is surrounded by so many talent-supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr, Embeth Davidtz Schindler, and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, and Robert Duvall) to just bother me. I recently bought a copy of this movie and I never see it. Just the best thrillers of the year. If you have ignored this movie (and you have options), I suggest you watch it.
