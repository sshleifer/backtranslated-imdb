Not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read through other comments before I look short. I have to say that I do not agree with most of the negative comments or problems people have had with it. <br /> <br /> For the first time, "Lone Wolf" director / producer, I like to see things I have to strive for, not necessarily pro, but people who just keep my feet moist like me. <br /> <br /> Also, the first timing, as I read, praises the effort. Great work then in this part! There were a few notes about the music. I thought it was pretty nice for a piece. started with chords, it was like we knew the rails had a train, but we realize that it is just moving. Yes, there is a 180 degree slip / clip, but shi * happens. Does anyone else see Hugh's dirty shirt "white" (at the end of the rain), white? See how much money and people behind this movie! Give the child a break for the gods! All in all, I think it was very well done. Just two things I would have mentioned are worth mentioning - Don't walk with the camera on a shiny brass frame, and I would have just shown the pictures in the beginning that people wouldn't necessarily know what it is. <br /> <br /> My past experience has taught me that making a movie is not complicated, but it takes time to learn how to do it, it's time to do it, and then it's better to take some time think of all the details you need to call before "post production". IMHO, it seems that director / writer Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this is his first report, I would give him "A". The rest of you know the Principal's Office.
