I've loved this movie since his debut in 1981! I've lost track of how many times I've seen it! It will never help me laugh or rejoice when I feel down. The three leaders are fantastic and the script is invaluable, in addition to how you can't hear a nostalgic song song? I think I will quote this movie unrealized. I know basically the whole script, so if someone first monitors it, I have to say something when the next line is funny. I can't even narrow it even though Sir John's character is probably the most memorable one. The famous "I warn media", when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath, is still invaluable, but the list is really endless. The scene in Arthur's soon-to-be father's house is a scream, especially his communication with the moose. Do it yourself and watch this movie!
