Remember H.G. Wells 'Invisible Man'? Well here is another movie that is just more extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no story of invisibility as an option. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Cain, a scientific genius who goes into the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. First, the serum was light, so the person did not come back. Most of the first attempts ended with instability. Up to one night when he improved the formula. And who else, but Caine would be a lab. Gorilla was first and almost died, so when he came, it was close. So when he was Caine, he decided to use it fun. Then, when she was tired of not seeing her, the team tried her best to return the meat to the world. But the formula for visibility doesn't work as it should, and Caine penetrates into madness. So he's gonna be one mad invisible killer. It would be best to just get out of town rather than take close people's lives. I would care less about those who did you wrong. Great movie, fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
