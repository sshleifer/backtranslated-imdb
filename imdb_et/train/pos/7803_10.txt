I've just finished watching this movie in my GCSE history class. it was exciting and was a great overview of what actually happened to Steve Bikha during the Apartheid law. How can anybody say that this movie was the most boring or boring 2 and a half hours of my life, I don't know because it was hooked to me from start to finish. it was nice how Denzel Washington depicted him and showed how he was fighting the Apartheid Law and getting equal rights for the black people. In one part, Steve Biko tells the policeman that we are as weak and human as you are, to show them that he and all other South African black people are no different from the white. Donald Woods inspired me because he fort what he believed and did not fully believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and woke up to the world. I enjoyed this movie very much and recommend it to people. it helped me to see that racism is not right and that everything is equal, their fate should not be determined by the color of human skin. n
