Moonwalker is probably not a movie to watch if you are not a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan and enjoyed most of the movie, the end was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes were - if you're a fan. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that the first 50 minutes are repeatedly traceable. Every video dancing is breathtaking, the music is fantastic to listen to, and the dialogue is entertaining. <br /> <br /> It contains many of his best videos of Bad and his earlier videos. It also includes some live video. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Michael Jackson, you have to do it if you're not a fan / don't like Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> 9/10
