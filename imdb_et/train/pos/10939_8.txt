Five deadly poisons are a great kung-fu action movie packed in a mysterious twilight. The Kung-fu flick has all the usual light bulbs: great choreography, terrible copying, different fighting styles and a large number of very exaggerated, often haired human emotions. However, the plot is definitely better than average. It is interesting and keeps your attention in non-combat. Sometimes it is even able to listen to the audience, for example, if the X sign gets terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I love about five deadly poison is the beautiful simplicity of movie morale and themes. Almost everyone gets what comes to them. Crazy, greedy and corrupt loses. The bad guys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own betrayal and rebound. Good guys use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome odds and get out. The rocks of the noise!
