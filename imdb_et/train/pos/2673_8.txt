Hope of Hope (1990) is a trek that many nomadic and poor Turks make to live in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live like the West, that they are giving up their lives and living in an attempt to reach the land. So many of them have harassed the greedy who are making their lives when they take widespread rewards for desperate people who have not won. One family freaks cold, treacherous mountain areas and predators criminals only to discover that there is not always a shiny white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists around the world, not just in America. Some people tend to forget it. A movie heart cutter that leaves you wondering why it is at the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
