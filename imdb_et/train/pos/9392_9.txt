I came home late and turned on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert's summaries of their weeks. I didn't hear anything about "Red Rock West" except two thumbs up and saw it before he went. Due to the distributor's lack of money and lack of promotion, it would not be very long in theaters, but they said it was better. <br /> <br /> The following afternoon, I followed their advice. They were right, it was some of the fun I've ever had in movies. As some readers point out, a couple of plots are in the hole and the last 10 minutes don't seem to end. But it is worth having a fine craft that went to the first hour. This is the best role I have ever seen with Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems to be completely cast. Dennis Hopper goes almost to the top that becomes stupid, but confirms how well everything else works. Sets and music contribute to almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I rented my family later, it didn't work well. The lengthy scene that created the tension in the theater was hard to understand, with confusion at home. It deserves your full attention; turn off your phone, make sure you don't disturb, watch or listen to every scene, especially at the beginning.
