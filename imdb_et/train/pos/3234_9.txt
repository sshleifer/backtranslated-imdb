I thought it was a very smart movie. I was very pleased with it and couldn't really ask any more. In fact, I am the owner of the movie because I didn't return it to anyone ... What should I do, but I really want to keep it because I enjoyed it. Also the fact that I don't have too many foreign films and that's the first. Now, I personally love Finnish things, so be sure to include how much I enjoyed it. But it is generally worth a look. But if you don't want to understand Finnish or read some subtitles a bit, then this movie isn't for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 definitely.
