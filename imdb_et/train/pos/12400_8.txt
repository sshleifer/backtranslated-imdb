This is the second Animatrix short and the first one can be "artistic". It contains a lot of references, metaphors and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially with a 9-minute working time. I've heard some complaints that it's "anti-human" or trying to hate people because of their "sins against the machine". I don't think it's true; it only uses robots to show us that when people are, we are not particularly opposed or open to anyone who is different from us. I would say that this is a very good job. The plot is good ... it plays as a historical document that tells what led to one of the major conflicts in the trilogy. Thus, it contains fictional news and other similar clips. Voting is very good if it is not much. Animation is nice and use of color, regardless of the usual realistic drawing style, makes smoother transitions and other surreal images more open. It has several strong violence and disturbing visuals, as well as little nudity. The disc has a comment, not English, but with subtitles and worth listening / reading. Well done and informative making has been done on both sides, so I would recommend following it after the next vision. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
