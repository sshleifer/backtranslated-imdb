Dragon Hunters must be the best handsome animation I've ever seen. It was a jaw fall. The film is about a couple of rogues who are looking for money, their strange hairy blue dog who sees the fire, and the girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they are sent to the quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world's gobbler, an impossibly huge dragon. But to be honest, it doesn't even mean what the film is. Because it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The difficulty of this fantasy world is different, so that architectural blocks and lands are floating in the middle of cathedrals, castles and villages, and there are floating lily pillows. The world is so creative, so unique, beautiful, as some silent narrative looks at it. The world looks like gorgeous paintings. Monsters are also visually stunning, like a fire dragon made up of a red bat. Some plots are not too original, like the main protagonists who want their farm in mice and men and never seem to be able to do that; But proud graphics, some serious events and emotional dialogue make this movie remarkable.
