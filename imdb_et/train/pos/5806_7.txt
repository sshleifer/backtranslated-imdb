When you see this movie, you'll see a wider video clip of popular music. But you will find more. Incredible FX, great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. When you compare this movie, you must remember that it is pop-extravagant. "Man in the mirror", "Leave me alone", "Smooth Criminal" and the Beatles "Come together".
