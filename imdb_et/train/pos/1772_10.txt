what a relief to find out I imagine this program! A summary of taxis is great. I also remember that it is haunting and not particularly family-oriented, I had to be 10/11 while watching it. I think the girl that the age of entertainment was the lead of very blonde hair and her persistently sad state. The theme was played on the flute I remember - though I don't remember how it went. I think the intro showed him playing - or maybe he played in the flute and especially when he was sad? Maybe I'm never forced to know how it ended or see a clip or hear a voice, but at least I know it's not just me.
