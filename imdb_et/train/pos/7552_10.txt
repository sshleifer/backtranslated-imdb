CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojirul. It won the "Best Short Film" at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and won the "Excellence Award" at the Japanese Media Art Festival. <br /> <br /> When death kills the soul of a small kitten Nyaako, Brother Nyatta starts a strange trip to get back. On the other side of the surreal dream they have many fantastic signs and remarkable, often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime like something you have never seen before. This is Hello Kitty Acid! It is very original, amazingly beautiful and has great strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and gory. This is more for adults than for children (they may not understand at all). A great trip for those who get this absolute masterpiece. Must-have!
