This is a very strange film director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows the work of William knows that it's a bit off-the-fly (if not brilliant), but it takes the cake. <br /> <br /> There are two unfortunate ragdolls who need to save their new French doll by a lustful pirate toy and find themselves in the mercy of a number of embarrassing characters. The strength of this film is mainly its aesthetic quality; its strange character design, its powerful animation and sharp contrast to sweet and scary. Williams' brilliant animation depicted Raggedy Anni and Andy as true fluff, floppy, and darned, not as simple comic versions of the dolls that made it more credible (at least in visual terms). Animation shines with the Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees, whose body walks with two different personalities who control each end, the chase of a quiet movie with Sir Leonard Looney and of course Greedy. <br /> Greedy animation is in itself the finest psychedelic animation I've ever seen. This animation has something that just makes your jaw - and every second is something new. Life in what was considered "Taffy Pitis" is a massive blob in Ahnus who lives and relentlessly eats sweets. She sings a song that I can't help but feel under the sexual undertone, then I try to kill Raggedy Anni for her candy heart. songs. It is constantly climbing at the pace of the film because there are sixty of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones), including "I look and see what?" ), "I never get enough", "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm at home". Others just seem to be unnecessary and, frankly, not too amazing to listen to.
