I think the movie was kind of strange. In the opening scene, a person is killed without reason. He can't mention it again. Special effects could have been better, but I enjoyed watching a parent's horror film. This is not the best example of a classic horror film, but it was still the right movie. I'll give it about 10 out of 10.
