This film is one of the few Indian films that will not go away in time, nor will its spell-binding appeal ever change even if Indian cinema becomes an artificially populated pop culture ghost, while exercise-oriented extras will take style movie songs to improve PT. <br /> <br /> Cinematography tells about Josef Werching's excellent skills, which emphasize the monumental and cinematic effect of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Days have been a great cinema when every scene had to be cut many times and done again before it was finalized, while special attention was paid to the handling and editing of scenes.

At the moment Raj Kumar and the strong wind blows to Kumar's veil and Kumar's feet ........ <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi must always remember the golden words in the history of Indian cinema to try to record this film for 12 years. He had to lead some of the vital songs without Meena's close-ups, because Meena Kumari, a leading woman, was ill and fought for her life in early 1971.
