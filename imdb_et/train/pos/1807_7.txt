This is one of the first movies I remember, or maybe the first one. A beautiful movie when we live in a world of violence and addictions, where we are sweetly introduced as a child. Little Babe, Casino and Constantine, it's all mixed well with cardboard and we get it. I don't know if it's really appreciated for kids, but I think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. I hate if a film (spescially cardboard) can have a good ending and its destruction, because every character has to have a happy ending, even if it sounds strange (I'm not a bitter person). But it was OK, he just goes to heaven and they let him in this way. <br /> <br /> All this is just a critic, this good movie is something new. very touching and i have to go
