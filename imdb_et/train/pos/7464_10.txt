Thinking of me for a few days after that. This is a great movie sign for me. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I'm tired of those people who need these happy Hollywood cookie cutter heads. I plan to see it again tonight to understand a little better, but regardless of the emotional messages of the film.
