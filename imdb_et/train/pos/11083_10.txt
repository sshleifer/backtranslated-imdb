Glacier Fox is one of the eternally thought-out and perfectly captured wildlife films. <br /> <br /> The film takes care of every member of this child's family, from the blind to the strongest - their adventures are sometimes fun and also tragic. Accept unpleasant countryside, audience hearts for family members. <br /> <br /> The music score and the words speak the story together with what's happening in general. <br /> <br /> Man is still one of the greatest predators, but we do not doubt that foxes are able to live, not just to survive human aspirations.
