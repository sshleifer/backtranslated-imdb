Cliffhanger is what seems to be Slyvester's Stallone's last feature film before he became such an underrated actor. It's about a climber who has to help his friend after a mercenary hostage who want them to find three suitcases that carry money over $ 100 million. It has a great sequence of activities, the edge of your seat and the fun time in the movies.
