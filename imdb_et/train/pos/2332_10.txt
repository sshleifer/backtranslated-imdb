"Imagine if you can bring things back with just one touch" As soon as I first heard this, my attention was hitched to the trailer, and after the first episode I found my love for this show. Today's fairy tale that brings my spirits up and keeps my attention throughout the exhibition. I think the act and the casting are just perfect, every character brings something unique to the exhibition that adds to its perfection. Even once Villains manages to flow A with a unique idea, from Bee Manist Guy, who can swallow kittens, they never seem to have let me down. And deaths, which usually lead to a depressing moment, are often purely comic (such as an exploding book of seizures and sniffing). <br /> <br /> Even though we have many crimes, we now have days, Daisies is one of the few who really is different from others, not just a mystery, but a love story, comedy and fairy tale with drama anger, all baked in one great pie ..... err show. > <br /> What really shocked me was that it was in ABC, for years I had no reason to turn to ABC, but that brought me a smile for a week. It was as if pushing Daisies back to ABC back to my life. But just after two seasons, a couple of awards, a big fan base and positive responses from critics have been shown. It would seem that Ned would have touched ABC again and killed forever. I am always a fan of this show, and I recommend it to anyone who loves to talk a lot and love their viewing.
