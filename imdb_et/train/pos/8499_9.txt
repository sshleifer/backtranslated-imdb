A very funny East-to-West-West film that is affected by the closure of GM Flint, the Michigan factory in the eighties, and the growth and integration of Japanese car makers in the US. It is located in the western part of Pennsylvania, with great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
