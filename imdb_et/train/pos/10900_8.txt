It was a documentary film for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I started to look back. I really like the main character of the film because it is true that I have a weaker skin problem, as he was, the Bullosa (EB) epidermal necrosis. This is a sad, sometimes fun and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disease. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a child (because of a waste of vocals) and has never passed puberty but is 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments see her terrible condition and beat her ties. He had a rather funny sense of humor, he even spoke outside the grave when he showed his body in a coffin. She talks about her story with the help of her mother, Edna Kennedy, her older brother and celebrity model, and Jonny backed by Nell McAndrew. It won BAFTA for best editing and the best new director (Factual) and was nominated for the best sound (Factual) and Flaherty documentary. The top 100 television shows in 2004 were number 10. A must see a documentary!
