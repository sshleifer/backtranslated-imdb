This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago I bought it on a DVD. But first I thought it was the original film. I've seen the series and it's a good movie, but here they are with "Life Legend, Part1 and 2" and "Fire in Space". The same thing they did with the first film, but with other episodes. However, this is a pretty good movie. Only the end is strange (you don't see what happens to Pegasus). However, I think it's pretty good. Participants and special effects were good. If you haven't seen it, look at it. Starring Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
