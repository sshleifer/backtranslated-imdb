The second official episode of the "Columbo" series ("Murder" with the book that was later filmed) hit first. Robert Culp, who would fit with Peter Falki's detective in several parts of the future, is a terrible leader of a complex private detective bureau, who murders a client's wife when he refuses to blackmail his blackmail schemes. These two stars are well suited for this smart cat and mouse exercise, one of the best in the series.
