I recently watched it on the Sundance channel. The idea of ​​the film was to bring many filmmakers who were beautiful in their country to make short films from eleven of these films, focusing on just one topic: September 11th. <br /> <br /> This movie can tell you why these filmmakers were big in their country because they had all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an Iranian film where the teacher tries to teach the students about the events of September 11, which they cannot realize until later. <br /> <br /> France's second film includes deaf women who are passionate about writing to their lover if they are not aware of what is happening as a TV. <br /> <br /> The next Egyptian film will involve the filmmaker himself in talking about recent events with a dead soldier, not just for the September 11 terrorists, but for bomb attacks in other places. <br /> <br /> The next one comes from Bolivia, where the girl learns from the events of September 11 and believes they have to march for them. <br /> <br /> The next African country where a group of boys follow a man they believe to be Bin Ladin. Next comes from Mexico, where nothing is shown but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> Next to an Israeli who accompanies a reporter bomb in a scene that tries to get a report, but often talks about attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies that I can 'Don't forget now, but everything is powerful. It will bring your emotions back from your day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
