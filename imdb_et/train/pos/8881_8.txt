First of all, the time of making this film must be taken into account. 1995. The rapper was in it and it added to it. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially uncomfortable teenager who tried to find and failed until he met and was Nazi friendly. They took her in. Nazi is not all uncomfortable, but like most gangs, they fill a gap that is missing, be it economic, social, emotional. Michael Rappaport played this part perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was a hot-hit star with questionable work ethic and wedge on his shoulder. She tried to apologize for herself and her difficult situations and had her girlfriend and professor to stretch her out. <br /> <br /> He was raped. He then found experimentation and political participation in his sexuality. <br /> <br /> This film is about racism and, like most racism issues, people have their own perspectives. <br /> <br /> I read so many comments on how there were no "bad" black characters, but there was bad white (Nazis). So what? Remy didn't depict evil at all, he tried to find his way and continued until some skinheads accepted it. He was scared, it was sad to see that he showed him how he did it. He even says that before he killed himself, I didn't want to do it, I wanted to be an engineer. Busta Rhymes was portrayed as a buggy thug. They both didn't show any rewards to their roommates, and generally they don't seem to be white people. They were angry like the Nazis, but not at the level of the Nazis in the sense of general paralysis. Sorry if it makes it unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say it shows white = black black = good. It is not true that the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (his own epps roommate) was a good boy, and even Remy was a good boy, he was just mistaken. , angry and careless. Although their constant harassment by the police seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit seemed to justify his anger. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. Like all the films that deal with racism, it's a great piece to get the debate. <br /> <br /> I don't think Cube and Busta could win these Nazis.
