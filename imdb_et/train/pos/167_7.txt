"Dance, Fools, Dance" is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Crawford plays Bonnie Jordan, a rich young woman whose life consists of parties, chewing and removing clothes to jump out of the yacht and go swimming. It all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) penniless. Bonnie works with Mary Smith's name; his brother goes to work to work. The main man is Jake Luva, represented by Clark Gable. Later, of course, he became a romantic hero, but at the beginning of the 30s MGM used him as halban. Do not understand that his brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie cozies to Luvani. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford did an excellent team. His facial expressions are a bit wild, but with his dance, this is one of the fun things in the movie. See Cliff Edwards, Jiminy Cricket's voice, like Bert. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting to see pre-code movies and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
