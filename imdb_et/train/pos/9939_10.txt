This is a series of cartoons, where most of the actions take place in the human body, where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I'm not trying to explain this in more detail, you have to see it yourself: you're not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember this as a child of the 80s (Swedish voice). I've talked to some people who were also kids of the 80s, and they loved it too! I have to admit that the educational part of the episodes did not come to my conscious level, but the whole idea of ​​educating children when they are fun is wonderful. I've recently seen some episodes; it has a sense of humor and heart that is difficult to find in other children's programs today. <br /> <br /> 5/5
