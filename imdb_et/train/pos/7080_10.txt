Terry Gilliam gives you an excellent movie that I enjoyed thoroughly. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt, and even a small Christover Plummer look make the movie absolutely great! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely my top 10. I think it's one of the four best Bruce Willis movies; and Brad Piti the best. Brad Pitt offers perfect performance. Maybe one of the ten best actors I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt were doing very well. Stylish story to support great performances; and back, Terry Gilliam is a great leader.
