Okay, I didn't get the Purgatory for the first time following this episode. It seemed something important happened that I couldn't put my finger on. This time, these Costa Mesa fires on television really liked - and it just helped me write an essay on Inferno! But let me see what has not been discussed yet ... <br /> <br /> The TWOP review mentioned that Tony had 7 flight slopes due to a broken elevator. Yes, there are 7 reasons, especially religious, but here is another one. Did the soul consult wikipedia and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels? Purgator. Except ante-Purgatory and Paradise. (Things at the bottom of the stairs and ... what Tony can't do.) <br /> <br /> It is said to be a "random" munga scene. As soon as the monks appeared, it fits perfectly with Tony from the Purgatory. You can say that he is worried when Christian trade (death, illness, and sin) came and he is becoming increasingly desperate because a Christian heaven is looking for him very much. By the time he meets the monks he thinks "hey, how can these men help me?" that sounds like other religions (eg Buddhism) and thinks that some other way can lead him to "rescue". Not that Tony would literally think of becoming Buddhist, but it seems that Finnerty tried it (and confused). This bump on the face basically tells Tony he doesn't have quick solutions because, no, you can't suddenly embrace Buddhism and get out of here. <br /> <br /> Tony was not too concerned about getting to heaven originally. At the "entrance to the conference", he understands that he is not that easy. First of all, I saw the problem of name and driving license, as Tony led a double life that people are killing and sleeping, so most people are secret. He feels free to have a quasi-Melfi thing because "he is Kevin Finnerty". She thinks she can fool people who have KF cards like hotel administrators, but she won't get her out of the Purgatory. These helicopters - sky helicopters - are watching him and everything he does. <br /> <br /> After reading all of the "inFinnerty" theories, it seems that KF's identity is a reminder of infinity different ways Tony could have taken his life. Maybe there's no point for me with the fun of the car about Infiniti. At that moment my brain tends to get out.
