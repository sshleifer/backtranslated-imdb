It seems that Hal Hartley's films are being hit or left by most target audiences. This movie is no exception to this rule. Since 1998, Fay Grim has been working for Hartley Henry Foole. The focus of this time is on Henry's former spouse (playing perfectly always welcome Parker Posey), whom the CIA gons are about to reveal about Henry's unpublished book on his shady relationships. After this time, Fay comes to an odyssey that deals with international spies, etc. The film doesn't let the other half down. If you've been a fan of Hal Hartley before, you shouldn't miss it. Beginner Hartley's first timer, who has only heard about his film making technique, could get to know your previous movies (especially if you haven't seen Henry yet). I admired the camera work that reminded me of some of the early Man Ray photography.
