So, a couple of years ago, I turned to digital subscriber channels and thought I'd be waiting for "Girlfight" to wait for "Hart War" for half an hour. With that headline, I thought it was a "B" damage to the gangs of girls inside the city. Instead, it is a well-written, well-written story about a young woman who accidentally gets into a female box. He is responsible for taking his younger brother for his training and for his interest in following his races. Because she doesn't really want to be a boxer (only after her father wants), she persuades her coach to take her instead. <br /> <br /> The story evolves intelligently and credibly as it passes through various aspirations in its quest. For starters, his brother coach doesn't want to take a female boxer. After you do it mercilessly, the problem is that it is matched to it. Then the confrontation with his father when he knows what's going on. Yes, the interest of love is evolving, but it helps to improve the plot by getting into a more intriguing interpersonal reaction with its own fighting-related consequences. The couple seems to have heard. Some time later, when I saw a lot of advertised and recognized "Million Dollar Baby", I thought "wait a minute, it seems familiar". Needless to say, I did not look at the "Hart War" that night.
