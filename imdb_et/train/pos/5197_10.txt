This film ran around the original Dolemite. It had everything that made the film great. (Ernie Hudson couldn't do it alone and you know! LOL) I testify that I've killed my first movie on this movie and plan to buy the DVD version as soon as possible! This movie has so many memorable features that it's bad! I'm embarrassed to say that I know the song song back and forth! I love the character of Jimmy Lynch's death and he should have won the best supporting actor award at Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were never ready for that! It is a casual film composed of Crooked Cops, Chest, Chases, Bad Editing and of course martial arts. (Being 70's and I can say that everyone knows some martial arts). I think this movie must be restored and shown one night in the marathon in local theaters!
