This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. It's not just a fun movie or a well made movie. This is the landmark of the art of animation, and even if it wasn't, only the technical skill that went into doing it would give it a place in animation history. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion movie about the life of beetles. He imagined a single insect world with jobs, houses, nightclubs, film houses, even small props like posters and bikes and paintings. Mr Beetle has a dancing dragon-related affair that is an abundance of grasshopper; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Mrs. Beetle, who has her own thing. Mr Beetle pursues the lover, but forgives his wife. Two make up and go to the movie. And the movie they're watching is Mr. Beetle and the dragon. It is described as being banal, but when it is seen, it gets stuck. With Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz invented a lot of things that future animators would use in their work. For this reason, he must not be forgotten.
