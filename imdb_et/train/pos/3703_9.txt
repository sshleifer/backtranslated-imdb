Ok, so it's an adult movie. But it's really very tasteful. It is obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money on making a stylish film. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Even the actor was quite decent. The plot was stronger than most seen in adult movies. Camera operation was above average. It's just a good flick!
