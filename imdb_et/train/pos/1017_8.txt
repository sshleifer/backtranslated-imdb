I started to see the show from the first season and at the beginning I was relatively skeptical about it. The original film was kind of childish, and I was looking for some sci-fi shows while waiting for BSG's new season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes I became a fan. I'm a loved one - not-so-stupid-like-you-think-he-Jack-Jack O'Neill, not just smart Samantha Carter, glorious Teal'c, women and kids who are the favorite and brilliant Dr Daniel Jackson. Of course, the stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but they are not usually about fighting technology or space - it is helping your friend, even risking your life. It's about "we won't miss anyone". Fighting to the end when all hope is gone. Free will and all the good qualities that are human - human. <br /> <br /> And now this is the record that goes for the 10th season and is still good.
