I wish I could laugh as much as this show for the first time. I haven't done that before. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that I laugh almost as hard after watching the show and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is educated, it is poisonous, is a man of the world. He talks about politics and feels, however, that there is no need to deal with the political debate. He's over it. I would contrast him with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try and convince people of his ideas, and it doesn't seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain.
