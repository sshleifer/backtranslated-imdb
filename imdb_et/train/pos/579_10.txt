In my humble opinion, this film did not receive this recognition. Robert Redford lives near me in Provence, Utah, Sundance. I have the biggest part of her work and it was my favorite. I'm sorry more people didn't appreciate that. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book for years before it appeared on the big screen. He gave me to read after seeing the movie together. The film and the book hit my emotional spot in my heart and I was crying for several days after seeing the film. Sometimes love is not enough to keep your loved ones hurt. We see this in our family relationships, but our love and our families and their stories suffer throughout the generation. Cinema was perfect and breathtaking - I was amazed at this beauty and how well it brought the author of the book, Norman Maclean, "But when I am alone in the light of the canyon, it seems that all existence is lost with my soul and memories, and Big Black Foot River sounds and the rhythm and hope of the four counts that the fish will rise. The river was cut by a larger flood of the world and runs across the clock from the stone to the basement, some rocks have timeless raindrops, the stones are words, and some words are theirs. in the book and at the end of the film (Robert Redford, who speaks like Norman Maclean), I think is basically a scripture. All the possible drawbacks that the film may have have overshadowed the story of beauty and grace and cinematography. It was beautiful!
