This contribution makes the CIA very similar. In fact, maybe they are. After all, the way the plot goes on seems to be one man capable of punishing him to kill everyone, including his people, to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is doing a very reliable job as Bourne tries to stay one step ahead of killing the whole movie. He is still trying to remember who he was and how he is there. He gets help from a couple of people and it seems that every minute is a movie, someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> This movie has little time to rest and the action sequences seem very real. There are many tracking sequences that have been filmed with a trembling doll, which in turn adds reality and makes it less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add a sense of reality to the film. <br /> <br /> The relationship between some sequences is great if you don't know if someone dies or if Bourne can do it. This is the kind of activity you are going to see when you want to offer entertainment and I'm sure it will take you to the next movie in the series.
