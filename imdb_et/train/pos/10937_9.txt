The film is honored and recognized by Kung Fu historians, a couple of critical areas: action and combat. But I have to say that the plot is probably the best and original I've ever seen in the martial arts movie. Five Deadly Venoms will undoubtedly have to be seen, not just that movie that can be viewed over and over again; but i also have to say that after you have looked at it, it might have been even better. It leaves you with something you want. Manufacturer Che Cheh creates a story for a beautiful potential masterpiece, but does not follow what we want more. The movie's fighting styles are really captured by the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, Rooms) and they are shown, but the battles are noticeably short. Rooms and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been shown much, much more, in fact attacked in the middle of the movie Rooms. Interestingly, with this movie, the lack of continuous action or struggle leads to the development of a large plot of land, one of the few kung fu movies where you really care and care about the results. This film has a dark and vicious tone and you are drawn. The whole film uses sister weapons and tactics for torture and adds movies. To start the movie and introduce Poison Clan's producer, Chang Cheh takes us to the grimm cave. Finished fighting scenes are definitely good, but seem to be bothered and somehow expected more. Although this movie is one of Shaw Brothers' best and it is quite enjoyable. My overall impression of the movie ends with: the styles that the fighters have shown us and not shown in detail are a sad thing that the director had something extraordinary at his fingertips, and he didn't expand it. I don't know what could have been the movie that is still one of the best. 8 out of 10 on a scale.
