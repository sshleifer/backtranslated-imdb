I liked this movie! Although it was not such a book, it is a classic Nancy Drew style. I had a lot of ads for this movie, and since I was really in Nancy Drew's books, I had great expectations for this film and they certainly met those expectations. Quite a lot of all the characters were exactly as I imagined reading these books. I'm really happy to see this movie. All the actors and actors really did as they were in the series of books. From this movie I've wanted to read every Nancy Drew book that's out there. All the actors and actors really got their characters, and it certainly showed this movie on the big screen. Certainly, it seemed that all the actors and actors were really in the positions where the characters were, which I would definitely give out of 10 out of 10.
