The 60's is a well-balanced mini-series between historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries, we follow a North American family with 3 members. But we don't see them only. We also follow the story of several characters such as the black admirer, the extreme student leader and the Vietnamese soldier. Filmography is simply extraordinary. In the first chapter, we see some pictures of the Vietnam War between the scenes. The next chapter will not start where the last one finishes, it will start for a while, giving us a little secret about what happened. In general, the 60's is a small series that must be not only for hippie fanatics, but for everyone with little curiosity about the subject.
