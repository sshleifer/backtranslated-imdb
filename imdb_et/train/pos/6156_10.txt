This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then I saw 11/21/01 the 30th anniversary of this movie DVD. WOW I remember why I loved this movie. The DVD is so big that it's another 30 min that the original wasn't. I didn't know it when I first looked. Since then, the film has been done so much more. The music they cut out should have stayed. You haven't seen this movie until you've seen the Full 131 min version. Many people say that music is forgotten. I remember every song of this movie from the heart, every song has its own charm, and it is a hole. I remember that when I was younger I had the song "Eglantine" a few times. In addition to "Briny Sea" (this song was meant to marry the spouses, but it was cut out of the movie). Please review the new uncut original 30 movie and vote for this movie. 10 what it really is.
