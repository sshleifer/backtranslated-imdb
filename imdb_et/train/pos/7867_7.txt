Madhur CHANDNI BAR started realistic movies, which some people called dry. <br /> <br /> He made SATTA, which was another realistic movie, but the great movie <br /> <br /> AAN men at work were his floppy movie <br /> <br /> He returns with its top competition PAGE 3 <br /> <br /> A film that shines in the life of journalists and is a great movie <br /> <br /> The film is well told, although Konkana's semi-fine romantic parts could be avoided, but it is forgiven . <br /> <br /> The whole Upendra Limaye track is too cool <br /> <br />, while the Atul Kulkarni trail is too good <br /> <br /> The choice between Manoj Joshi and his friends is funny first. but repeated at once <br /> <br /> The Bikram-Tara sub-block is great and so is the whole hospital scene and the last child abuse that shocks you. <br /> <br /> The film has an open tip that is nicely handled <br /> <br /> Madhur does a good job Music is fine <br /> <br Konkana stands out as a crazy moon using her expressions to the best Tara Sharma is decent, except for her voice Sandhya Mrid is good, as usually Upendra Limaye stands out as a policeman, one of the most talented actors unfortunately not being used well today. his little part of Boman Iran is restrained and whether a good job holiday is fine
