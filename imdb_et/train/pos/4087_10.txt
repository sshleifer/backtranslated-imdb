I have to say I thought I saw it all. I am an extremely jaded movie buff. This film didn't shock me in any way. I'm out of this point. But it took me to some emotional places I didn't know I could go to. I had no idea I could ever find a (ick) mindset about eroticism. Never ever. Never. Never. But you go. He did it. I have to give credit to the director. He pulled it out. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes of this movie is the TOTAL hole. Let's start with the very two horses that are having sex. After five minutes, I began to wonder if buying this movie wasn't a mistake. The old man in the wheelchair then speaks to another old man who is married to two people. Then some nervous guys shave. Then we'll see (briefly) the hot chick that gets it (but it's very short). At this point, I was worshiping the film out loud, trying to stay awake. In fact, I swam at a 40-minute mark and forced myself to finish the next night. <br /> <br /> Finally, we get good things for a girl (who knows who she is or who is). In this movie, the dream is that the forest beast has destroyed the Victorian era. The scene continues for some time now and is really the meat of the transaction (heh-heh). It is beautifully captured, perfectly edited and delivered. They are trying to end the plot at the end and it is sort of meaningful, but also like that. Oh well. I definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me shoot myself (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes will redeem it completely.
