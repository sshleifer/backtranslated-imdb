While many have unfortunately moved forward, the ballroom scene is still alive and continues their legacy. Some are still very alive and quite well, Octavia is faster and more beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very much accomplished and gives a great support to the gay community. He can rest in peace. After Anji passed Carmen, she became the mother of the Xtravaganza house (she was on the beach) and she is also looking more and more beautiful. Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed, whether they can all be at peace. There is currently another project known as "How do I look?", You can view the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
