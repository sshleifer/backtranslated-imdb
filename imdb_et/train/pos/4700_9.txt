I couldn't believe that IMDb's low price from 5.6 to Johnny Dangerously at the time I wrote this review, thought, and I thought I had to do something to promote this memorable comedy as much as possible. Seriously, so low estimates, people who have voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very low openness. If you don't like humor, don't look at them! Combining the absurd humor, very good storytelling, and the outstanding pace given by a number of running gags, this movie has reached its DVD collection. And this is not to mention here and there the visual shepherds, and of course, the use of keyboards and clich√©s based on our favorite organized films. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie to many people and introduced it without any specific expectations (except maybe watching comedy) - just the mental state you should see in the movie - they all really enjoyed it. It goes well, there is no time to look and there is no slowdown in the development of the story, which I find really easy. Of course, this is not perfect, some gags are a bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially when you consider your own opinions. That's why I rated this movie out of 10. In my opinion, this film is a precursor to "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well thought out comedies. What are more and more absurd nowadays, at the same time thinking and thinking. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people think they are understood correctly, if any. Finally, I would like to say: look at it for yourself, don't follow the average Joe's statement, and if you don't like it, you know that it wasn't good for your taste, which is understandable, but I think it is unlikely.
