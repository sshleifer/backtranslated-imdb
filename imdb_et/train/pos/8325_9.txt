I loved the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I first saw this trailer. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and his picture as a kind, playful, slightly crazy genius was enough to see me. Matthau added the spice Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy but delightful. A car mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who is Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed Catherine starts winning the heart. Take the jealous groom (who exemplifies the worst experimental psychology) and the Eisenhower blend, and you have pure fun. <br /> <br /> The film is full of great character actors and cheerfully sweet and funny performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein's mischievous imp; Cupid with slide rule. Tim Robbins is admirable when Ed and Meg Ryan play a step above their normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as "RRRatman" and Ryan fiancé; who does not have a single romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film fell on most radars, but it is a delightful treasure that doesn't grow with a repetitive view. It has first-rate writing and performances, and is a gentle treatment for less than a delicate world.
