When I think "women in prison", I think often goes to random Italian / Spanish products like Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; and although these films are often very weak, they are also very similar and when you have seen it; you would have seen them all. I must admit that such films are not usually my favorites; but in reality, the idea behind women has been very often done outside Italy and Spain; and Roger Corman's New World Pictures are responsible for their best. Drilled heat is the debut of the director of the Oscar winning director Jonathan Demme, which is a well-done little entertaining value! Of course, the film focuses on the story of a girl who has been caught in a crime and sent to a women's prison where she is introduced to many violent prisoners. This prison is ruled by a wheelchair superintendent McQueen; and he offends the playing of girls; this movie escapes the escape. <br /> <br /> This film is brighter than lighter than women in captivity; but it is more than compensated by some amazing scenes and dialogues and it ensures that Caged Heat offers entertainment. It must be said that the plot is not very original or ambitious and basically follows a similar structure, similar to many other women in the prison films that were in front of it; but this is not such a big problem. The film will never be boring and it is upright with scenes; including bankruptcy and bank robbery during the escape attempt. The film was helped by a solid direction from a person who continues to master the masterpiece 'Sheep's Silence' and a large selection with many challenges. including the most legendary Barbara Steele in the role of prisoner. All in all, drilled heat may not have much to think with the viewer. but it is a brilliant entertaining little floor game and anyone who enjoys this type of movie will definitely want to follow it.
