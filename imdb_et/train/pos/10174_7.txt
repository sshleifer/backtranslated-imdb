It was the second World War message for soldiers and allies to be cautious in spreading rumors. They were called "educational" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages with a funny-looking main character "Pvt. Snafu." is-you, and it happens here as Pvt. Snafu wrongly adds two and two things she hears and "five". You can start panic and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. That means you lose confidence in your country and your cause, as noted here in this comic book. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. This is still happening today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war," one big cup confirms at the end of its copy. Amazing how some Americans haven't learned yet. This comic can be 65 years old, but it's definitely sure. By writing this, there were two terrorist attacks in Europe today and some people still think that the "War on Terror" is just a bumper sticker. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The writer, "Dr. Suess", uses the analogy of "hot air balloon" to present the message above. Theodore Geisel (his real name) know that this rhyme is smart. <br /> <br /> There's nothing fun here, but it wasn't meant to be. You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the legitimate paranoia that was there in the Second World War. People forget that war could easily have won the other side. It was a tough time
