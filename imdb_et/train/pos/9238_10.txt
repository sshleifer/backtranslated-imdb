While others have commented that this video is only an edited version of the two exhibitions: "Fire in Space" and "Life-Legend", when you look at original exhibitions, you will find a dialog for this video release. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. I'd say if you want to see an example in your original version, check out the VHS video options. They have more to offer to the fan than the original episodes that the DVD now offers. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more Galactica 1980 scenes than the actual show itself. In general, I appreciate it as 10, because it gives you more benefits than the networks wanted to show to manufacturers in the given time.
