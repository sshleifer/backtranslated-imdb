Although I did not like Stanley and Iris as a film, I admire the actor. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I'm not always a fan of Fonda's work, but here he is gentle and strong. De Niro is able to do whatever he depicts in the actor's gold. She gives an excellent performance in this film and has a great scene where she has to take her father's home for the elderly because she can't take care of her, which breaks your heart. I do not recommend this movie as a great cinematic entertainment, but I say you don't see a lot of bets that work everywhere.
