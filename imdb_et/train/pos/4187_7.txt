This is a pretty good example of a movie noir. It is the beginning of the 50s, when communists are trying to steal secret secrets from the US government. He gives a pretty decent result, but he's not on the A list. It was interesting that he was not only a hero, but a major part of the film, an unlikely hero. It is not very common. Jean Peters gave the golden whore of the heart so much. This great actor, Thelma Ritter, shines in a stool-dove. <br /> <br /> The plot had a fair share of twists, nose and harsh talk. The end of the movie (at the metro stop) is a fighting scene that was quite tough and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think younger fans (like me) enjoy this movie. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a bit dated and then the whole Commie thing is superfluous.
