How tasty was my little Frenchman talking about a story that is alternately sad, frightening, and life-affirming. It ends with the brutality you knew it should happen, even though you hoped - maybe even believing - it wouldn't. <br /> <br /> This is the greatest strength of the movie: it professionally plays with your emotions and expectations, then the bomb will fall on you. <br /> <br /> I saw this film theory in the USC in the mid-90s. It's not easy to find, but it's definitely worth it.
