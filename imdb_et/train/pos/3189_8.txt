This is one of the best ensemble's comedy / music "B" movies I've seen (and since I'm in my 40's now and I only see it now, I'm not an expert, but I've seen all the famous movies out there). If there are several tons of participants who take the lead in a minute, the comedy usually mixes the pieces of music and often interrupts the music with the comedy stream. Call me a crazy mood, but when I saw it in TCM Europe, I smiled with joy! So who laughs at me? Undoubtedly, Mischa Auer gave me some terrible intestines that laugh, she even steals to the end, it was great! Talking about why I think this movie works because although L & H is a sales point (and why I tried to watch it (those and Hal Roach), I love them in my early Hal Roach case), it keeps them minimal and remains adult ticket prices (1930s standards and not so far from today's standards as you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also good to watch, I admit I only know about W OZ, and I loved him there and I laughed here a little bit of his waiter. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in the 30s movies that actually put me in (nothing tells me she was caught in real life); and musical numbers have a real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) of quality that blew me from what I am used to in this genre. I could go ahead, but be sure to really enjoy this movie. 8 out of 10 I saw it in TCM Europe and save it again with my wife TCM in the US. Good stuff!
