This anime shook my socks seriously. When the anime opened itself, I felt it was too slow; the story was not quite moving forward and Shirou was a pretty impressive man. When he learns more and learns more about Saber and the Holy Grail of War himself, the story strikes and you see many facets in its movement. It was fantastic. <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that the way in which advanced characters developed in the real world was a way of developing real people. There were no stupid, clear things there; The development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to look at, but I think Shirou and Saber grew up in their personalities just to look at it all. Some of the "surprise" people who appeared (Gilgamesh?) Also felt unique about the other pain in one way or another, which means we had no "Generic Bad-ass A" substitute "Generic Bad-ass B" as soon as A died. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved music. Open music shook and the last episode ended ... The topic of the last episode was seriously delayed. Good work, Type-MOON!
