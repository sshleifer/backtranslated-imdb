This is a great movie for true romance and athletes. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is the best in this movie. As a Drew fan, it was very good to see her shine after a number of flop. I had doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he completely gave Ben a comic, athletic crazy cost. Comedy in this movie is great, there were several laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Their first date started rocky when she showed flowers at her apartment, and she had a stomach sick of eating a new place a day earlier. Instead of leaving, he helps take care of him, helping him to change pajamas, then cleans his toilet and bathroom later, telling him he is "very lady-like ... no pieces." Everything goes well between Ben and Lindsay all winter, but then the baseball season begins. Lindsay begins to understand how obsessed Ben is with Red Sox and why this seemingly great man is still lonely. He tries to take it away and think of it as a good thing, because he has a quick work schedule and he doesn't feel guilty during the extra hours he is playing. He even buys all the Red Sox books he can find, including one "Bambino Curse". <br /> <br /> Everything goes pretty well until Lindsay has the wrong alarm that has disappeared from her time. Both of them make them both understand how seriously they can and will ask if it is the person with whom it wants to be. The very touching part of the film is after she tells her she got her period that shows her that she sadly put a small size red Sox jersey that she had just bought when she was pregnant. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ben tries to show him how important he is and decides to go to his friends' birthday after he said, "I had to check my calendar and when I saw there was a Red Sox / Yankee game , I knew I wanted to go. " Ben tells her it was "the best night of her life." Soon after he received a speech from his palm who went to the game, he gave up the party and told him "it was the best game ever!" for the lack of it and finally gets to Lindsay when she says, "A few minutes ago you said it was the best night of your life," he says "well that it was a few minutes ago." <br /> <br /> So they separate for a while, he understands how immature his obsession is, and decides to sell his season tickets, which he's uncle, because if he didn't, "remind him too much of what he gave them up ". Lindsay discovers through her friend and decides to stop her when she does. It ends very intelligently, showing how her love of childhood for baseball is hidden for all the new deeper love, Lindsay. They are still in games and even participate in the final World Series game and St. Louisis and it's a happy ending around. 2 thumbs up!
