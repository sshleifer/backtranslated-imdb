When we started to look at this series with a cable, I had no idea how that addicted. Even if you hate a character, you will keep back because they are so beautifully developed, you almost understand why they respond to disappointment, fear, greed or temptation as they do. It's almost the same as the viewer experiences one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why Adriana would put Christopher into abuse, orally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read in the newspaper to see how many women tolerate and tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an expensive endless supply of things, but I'm sure she will give it to her loving and faithful husband - or not. That's why I look. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you watch an episode, you will find something you missed the first five times. We also look at the episodes out of order (look at season 1 with late night ads, but the whole language, censored with A&E, movies on the movie network) - whenever they are, we're there. We're now completely broken. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprop. "My close-necked little one" is Johnny Boy's favorite. When these jewels have reached the vocabulary of our family, it is a sign that I should get life. When the series ends, I've collected all the DVDs and put it all in my will.
