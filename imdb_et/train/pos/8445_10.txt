Slaughter: The film turned out to be a well-written, well-run and well-run series. The loose ends were tied, which were not properly dealt with at the end of the final season. The whole series, and especially the movie, showed a life-like (and death) life-like picture of Baltimore, a culturally unique city with a very large murder. My attraction to the series began long before the Baltimore move, but when I experienced it, I realized how realistic it was. And the film definitely stayed in that spirit. Certainly the new episodes of the series will remain, but I am very grateful to NBC and the manufacturers and gave us the last glimpse of the dark side of Charm City.
