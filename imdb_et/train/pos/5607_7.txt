When I looked at the tenant and interpreted it as a horror film. He uses many genre sections: a sinful apartment, suspicious neighbors, manifestations, secrets, hallucinations. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, seemed to be around evil, the secret forces that tried to drive him crazy. When this movie is a horror movie, it is just a horror in the sense that Kafka's novel is horrible. In fact, this movie can be understood literally as a lonely man who slowly becomes crazy without external influence. just because the evolution of madness with the heroine has never convinced me; Rosemary baby, where the heroine is led by evil forces; and a tenant that may be the best paranoia research that has ever been made in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment where he killed himself. She has become obsessed with her and slowly starts to get her: she wears her clothes, puts her makeup, talks like her. But is he under the spirit, or does he just let his natural imagination get the best of him? It's hesitant about what is real and imaginative and that Polanski never solves, which makes it such an exciting film. Many movie events can be attributed to the supernatural just as usual, and it is the viewer to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although this is not my favorite movie, it is still a good example of his ability to skip and depict craziness very convincingly. And technically speaking, it's a miracle. Suffice it to say that he collaborates with the filmmaker Philippe Sarde and the leader of the legendary photographer Sven Nykvist (Bergman DP) in making this film. Slow-paced and sometimes uninteresting segments can enjoy this movie, but it's still an experience.
