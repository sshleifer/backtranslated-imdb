It's not as bad a movie as some reviewers and a summary of this movie's IMDB page, say it's. Why? First of all, in 1984, the filmmakers dared to face the issue of domestic violence as an element of a plot, so that the observers who complain have unfortunately disappeared from one of the main points! Secondly, without the relationship of Prince's film with his abusive father, the musical climax would not work as well as it does - so those reviewers who say that only music is good have again responded to one point - more specifically WHY it's so good ... because all the music in this movie has a plot element background that makes music more efficient. Third, give this movie a break! It's not so bad for filmmakers and filmmakers for the first time! There are a lot of worse movies out there for movie people! Finally, the evaluators who say the music is "good" have missed this point - look at the stylistic music, the variety, the musicians and the productions of productions - truly unique, going musically, where in the 1980s someone else did not work, and in the work of other artists (clothing and movement: what costumes were first Michael Jackson or Prince? Also see if you can see the hidden finger sweeping Prince does it in front of the film, long before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction"). The sum of its parts, not a bad film at all.
