I liked this movie, which I remember was one of the very well-made scenes in this movie, where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) is in bed in a smoking pot and then he starts visualizing that Ramones is in the room where his song sings "I want you around "... very cool things. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, peculiar and cool. Yes, I admit that the end is way-way over the top and far drawn ... but it doesn't matter because it's fun, it's a very fun movie. This is Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll forever <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the band that originally celebrated it. But I don't know if this is true or not
