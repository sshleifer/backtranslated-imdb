Bettie Page was a repressed icon of the 1950s, when he represented a decade of sexual freedom, but in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol does a great job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, a small town girl whose ambitions were big and big. His acting career did not go anywhere, but his body really brought him to the top of celebrities. The black-and-white color, which is colored apart when it gets out of the world of exploitation in New York, is a film (HBO) based on good film and highly believable supporting cast. The problem is that it is emotionally flat. It is difficult for a person to establish confirmation because Bettie is a rather low and naive business because he was built. Independent government inquiries are given a lot of screen time, which slows down the movie to the end. But it is definitely worth looking at and seeing what the state's repression was like in the fifties. 7/10
