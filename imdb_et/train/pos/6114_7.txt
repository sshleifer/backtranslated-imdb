A really sweet movie that has some similarities to the "My Sassy Girl" that hit 2001, but it is mostly charming. The biggest applause should go to two leaders. Ha-Neul Kim is so sweet and original, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. It is very good between the two chemistry. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG inputs to whip the visuals and also offers impressive combat scenes where Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked it much better than the highly rated "Volcano High" here. And this boy is the future - they look like those fighting techniques and the romantic leader. Not bad. Well, I can do briefly: a nice movie. My Rating: 7/10
