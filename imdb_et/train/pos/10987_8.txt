Trawling through the Sci Fi weekend part of the local Video Rentals stores, I lost hope of finding good movies I didn't see yet. Cypher's rent was like a punt probably on a very flat horse. My son is so tempting in the present B-science that he hasn't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that I didn't see anything about Cypher when he appeared in Australia. It must be very quiet or I just left it down. <br /> <br /> Well it was a really pleasant surprise! It's not a B movie either. It is not a "blocking" of the epic variety and does not try to be - a silent film that has to be seen many times to make its plot completely pleasant. <br /> <br /> Special effects are powerful when used - my only complaint is the super sound that is obviously CGI at first glance, but they get it right from the 2nd look, and everything else is the upper limit. In any case, the effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I'm not giving anything to the plot. The plot structure has a Russian doll aspect that resembles a bit of basic instinct (though with very different content). <br /> <br /> Just telling you that choosing Jeremy Northam for lead was the captain's move. The actor was born in Cambridge, England, and his accent on this film strikes his ear as a kind of extremely forced New England break, it's a key-free key. See the last twist of the plot and see why it's a great choice! And Lucy Liu is right with her, "can she make me - will she let me go"? <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies several times a day - that's one of them.
