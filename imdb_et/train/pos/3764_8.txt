Okay, I admit it - I'm a goof-ball and I love the really stupid comedy from time to time. Although I've seen more movies by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffu than practically every planet, I still have a soft cafe for comic comedy that isn't trying to be complicated but just funny. Some of the films that are instantly memorable are MONTH PYTHON AND St. GRAIL, UHF, INITIATING REVOLUTION WITHOUT MY, EFFICIENT BREW and Bill and Ted. They all have no snob complaint, but only a zombie or professional film critic might not like them. <br /> <br /> Although BILL & TED BOGUS JOURNEY is not as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted movie, it is still a lot of fun. Unlike the original, it seems to be actually better with repeated viewing. I remember that the film didn't want to see it for the first time - maybe because the second movie set to laugh so high. But every time I see it again, I'm surprised at all the great moments, especially those concerning Grim Reaper. And by the way, this cleaner is about as different from Bergman's SEVENTH SEAL as you can !! In addition to the big laugh, this movie also has great music - one way it is actually better than the first movie. At the end of the Kissi anthem is great, but so are the other hard stones - assuming you're not old like De Nomolos. Great viewing for both children and adults.
