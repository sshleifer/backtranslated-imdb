I love this movie because it showed they didn't kill for fun, but they saved the ones they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did an excellent job of Ned and Joe. It has a couple of quick inappropriate scenes, but that's fine. The language is very light and sometimes you don't even know it exists. This movie shows that simply because they are laws does not mean they are malicious killers! I hope people watch this movie and learn from such important times of history. There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie that they got their inspiration from their armor book Ned! Also, how people remember them, their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and be interested, as I have.
