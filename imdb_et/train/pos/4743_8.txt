This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. First, many sequences of action aren't really that fun. The first weapon battle in the film was just silly. Not cool cool or even funny, but just silly. This does not mean that there are not some great scenes, but most simply do not reach the level of a movie seen by another. On the contrary, this film actually has CHARACTERS, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for a bad bad guy who is flat as a billiard table) and most of them are pretty good. All the characters in this movie are fun to watch. Dialogue is quite funny and does not seem like a lot of loss of translation. This film is worth seeing, but I hope American scientists do not believe it is the best HK.
