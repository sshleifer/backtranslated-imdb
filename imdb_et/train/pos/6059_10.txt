This is a great documentary full of beautiful pictures and great stories from racing friends. The IMAX cameras give you a very broad perspective as the DVD movie is perfect. You hear every speaker almost all the time, the movie is not accelerated and just gives you a natural feeling of 230 km / h. Of course, some sound effects have been added, but I think they are good, they give depth to driving scenes ...
