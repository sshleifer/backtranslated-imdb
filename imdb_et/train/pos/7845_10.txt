So, Fox pulled the plug into the drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How is this flat? Do they expect us to invest our time in our new exhibitions if there is a real risk that you will never find what will happen? Why didn't the rest of the episodes already filmed in the United States remain? They were sent elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Do you listen? It was a great show, but you left us hanging. If you intend to introduce new drama / mysteries, at least blow the conclusion before the end of a sudden central theme. Every time something happens (and it seems to happen to you a lot - i.e. Fox), there are more people "waiting and waiting". This means that you see an artificially low interest rate and are likely to end the series. Look? It's a vicious circle. Don't let us down again ...
