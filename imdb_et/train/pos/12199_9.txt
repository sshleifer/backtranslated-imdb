The first secret is to guess what Welles' original film was. This makes it a real adventure - imagine how beautiful a woman has ever supported, to see the incomplete skeleton and to use cinematic forensics. <br /> <br /> If you do, you'll ever see and experience one of the best movie secrets ever. As the mysteries go, the narrative is quite common: simple diversion, one jealous man as a red herring. <br /> <br /> What is wonderful is the Welles story of placing an artificial eye that sees a dark, blind, diverse world. The first real noir, but even darker. This is not an obviously twisted world if you don't think about the camera. What we see is someone who creates a vocabulary that would later become ordinary. <br /> <br /> Kane was a great drama and story for the whole party. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Welles went on from there to explore Shakespeare's mysterious story and self-analysis with this eye. Othello and MacBeth are both at the beginning of this period and I think it's part of this one vision. <br /> <br /> Noir feels that it depends on people not being responsible for their lives, even a little - they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. So when talking about this story, Welles has to characterize the environment. There are several signs of suspicion in the mystery. And we have deliberately closed kits: park, yacht, picnic area, aquarium, dock, courtroom, Chinese theater and entertainment. I am sure that what the barbarians cut was a lot and a lot of "external" narrative that did not deal with character but with their strange environments. <br /> <br /> My solution to the mystery is that the entertainment house did it, among other characteristic environments that are suspect. In other words, the manipulation of black Irish languages ​​(who know the notes and one of the scenes written in the union hall was an ambitious novelist) was not a human conspiracy (park or civilized version, courtroom) nor the power of nature. (picnic or civilized version, aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, gods were deliberately capricious for entertainment. Of course, this is a reference to what Welles is doing: putting those people (including themselves) through hell into our own capriciousness, a thing highlighted by the Beijing opera suite, Welles. And, of course, it leads to an entertainment house where the environment is directly exposed to perception. <br /> <br /> Learn more about self-reference: Being aware of his relationship with his soon-to-be-spouse is definitely an informed comment. But I believe there is a strongly subconscious comment on his own looting of the environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Certainly Welles was as much as he was in his character. And this screwing took place in the form of the murder of this film, leaving the rotten body at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> This poor Rita comes from China all over, with a Chinese theater, expected rape above, a woman's disappearance. Investing outside the environment.
