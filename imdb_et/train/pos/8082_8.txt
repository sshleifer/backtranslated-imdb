It has been a while since I've been following this LOTR. I'm trying to buy a copy right now. Bakshi's work is absolutely right for the original work. Visual images are invasive and sometimes haunting. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes the film is confusing or confusing. There's one or two times when the story slows down to crawl. But in general - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
