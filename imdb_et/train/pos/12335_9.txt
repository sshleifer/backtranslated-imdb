Warning: Includes spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases terrible action. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Ney, Ivy's wife, are extremely woody. Ney is in bed, dying of arsenic poisoning, every hair is in place. But the film is so juicy and so enchanting. More faithful to the book than most movies of this era. Casting Joan Fontaine into a poison (and adultery that was just as shocking, but I wasn't kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke. He's just his usual Joan Fontainey himself. When the murderers had to, he dies when he falls "in front of his feet through an empty space on the floor."
