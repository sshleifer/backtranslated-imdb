In principle, a film can be one of the strangest titles made by one of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's make it straight, the film earned its hype as one of the most stylish makers / thrillers. <br /> <br /> When it comes to unpleasant tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts make a really great duo. Both this film and Deja Vu are the best thrillers you can expect. Washington really became very pleasant in the movies and all the scenes on the film. It would be easy to associate his character with emotions, so all the killings on the roads enjoyed it. It is a success that they created a super-dark Mexican city where many clothes were made. The extent of corruption depicted in a human fire would be convincing. I don't know what the Mexicans think when they watch it ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's face it again. It is one of the best Death Wish genres, but it also suffered from extensive violence. It is a bit annoying that they justify the action of the ghouls, making the film very realistic and let Denzel Washington play a tragic hero of the "lost sheep" type. Ultimately, they let a kidnapper in their swimming pool like a documentary. I checked IMDb when the movie is based on real events for it ...... So it's in your interest to find that the movie's theme is a bit fake. <br /> <br /> At the end I hope nobody will take this movie to real. <br /> <br /> 8/10 Art / Editing / Cinematography / Denzel Washington.
