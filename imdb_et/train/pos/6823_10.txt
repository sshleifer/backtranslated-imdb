I've been watching John Cassavetes movies last week - starting with a "powerful woman" and ending with "opening day". I'm totally and completely blown, especially by these two films. From the first minute to the last opening night I was fully and completely absorbed. I've only experienced it a few times, but the feeling that this movie was perfect lasted about two-thirds, right up to the credit. everything about this movie, how he's filmed, Gena Rowlands's incredibleness, credit, opening, music, plot, deep feel, pace, tenderness, originality, characters, winning little moments .... for me is really sublime. I could no longer accept the previous comment that touched it on an island in the desert, because the depth of this film is something to see. If your unhappy is a house fire, then I guarantee that instead of making the last ditch to save that bed in your bed, you will save this movie instead.
