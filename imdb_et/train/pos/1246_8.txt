The assumption may seem funny, but since Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps the audience mix with the mystery and the mix of today's hard-boiled children. Great casting, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis and Murphy, are at the height of their 80's tops in comedy / action. There are also some big F / X, a very surreal dream and a pretty original plot. Often, Murphy's butterfly pantheon is forgotten, but it's worth it.
