Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in his movie ... <br /> <br /> 'Lion King 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is a new classic story. What classic story do you ask? Why, "Lion King" Of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there is one thing Disney is never short of, it is narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. It's basically "Lion King" events, as Timon and Pumbaa have said. And that's why you need to know that "Lion King" is a heartfelt story to see where they come from. "Oh my god it is so flat ..." and on the other level I had a ball. Much of humor is predictable - I mean if Pumbaa is made up of two beds, one big for himself and a little Timon, then in the first nanosecond we all know that Timon takes a great deal. However, this does not prevent it from happily, which IMO is briefly "Hakuna Matata". It doesn't happen, that's right. <br /> <br /> And a warning note: there are also some jokes. Seriously, did you expect anything else in the movie where Pumbaa is at the center? But when funny jokes go, they are especially good and should satisfy even the most special expert. I am surprised that some of the actors were ready to return, which most of them have only two or three lines (if they are happy). Whoopi Goldberg is especially welcome. <br /> <br /> Music is also great. "Digga Tunnah" from the beginning to "It's all I need", "Warthog Rhapsody" customization (a song that was cut from "Lion King" and, frankly, much better in this openness), music leaves me something that can't get anything do not blame. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Timon and Pumbaa are fantastic characters, and although it can be argued that Hakuna Matata is just an excuse to see them in a variety of fun and dangerous situations then be it. It is rare to find signs you just want to spend. <br /> <br /> Will I start to amaze you? <br /> <br /> In both cases, 'Lion King 1 1/2' is good if you have seen the Lion King too many times. Especially when you're thinking now: "Don't be silly, there's no such thing as" Lion King "to see too many times!"
