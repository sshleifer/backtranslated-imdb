I'm totally addicted to this show. I can't wait until the week goes to see the following. it is a great story and has the best actors and actors. i tune every week to watch it even if i'm not at home i'm always on my vcr set tape monarch. simon rex is the best actor in the show. it is tense and exciting. I think this exhibition should stay in the air and I believe everyone should watch it. I saw the very first episode and actually I didn't look at it, but I looked at life one day and decided to watch it because it was and I love it completely and now it's my favorite show. I really mean it.
