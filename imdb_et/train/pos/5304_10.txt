Pecker is a funny, but twisted movie from Baltimore's small town, whose daily routine is interrupted by Pecker, a young photographer taking pictures of "real things". No beautiful models, no proud men, just living. This wonderful film amuses the plasticity of the urban art scene. There is one particular scene where a homeless woman, who trades at a Pecker mother's shelter, buys the same exact coat as one Whitney art spot just 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. It just shows you that whatever money you have, you may not always have the taste. What's more, John Waters sends you an endless laughter and a raw reality spiral. You can feel your traditional Hollywood movies with special effects and fame in the mountains, but give me "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another great John Waters movie) on "Titanic" or "Godzilla"!
