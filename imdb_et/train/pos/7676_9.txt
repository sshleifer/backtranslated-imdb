Brilliant! My wife and I joined the sprawling line to see Holly at Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the film, I understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a story about the impossible relationship between two people. She's a young girl, she's worn west. The film took all the bones of our body. There are no graphic scenes or anything that is hard to see - this is the surrealism of normality that really hits you in the gut. The film is beautifully captured. Among other things, we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's crude (can't believe it's his first deed) and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
