Advertising: Zandalee is a young woman who is increasingly feeling married to Thierry. Thierry himself fights his father's death last year and has lost his way. He has drowned in work, wrote in his writing, and Zandalee desperately leaves the attraction between them. Johnny and Thierry's old friend who once were exile artists enter it. But Johnny has painted and has just a day's job for rent. He takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow his destiny. There is a direct raw attraction between Zandalee and Johnny, and they do. But Zandalee fights his desire to wish and his conscience and love for his husband. But none of them, not Zandalee, not Johnny and not Thierry, can stop their mutual relationships to spin them completely out of control. <br /> <br /> Comments: It's set to thriller. But perhaps a heart thriller rather than a normal thriller, where it is related to life and death and the risk of violence. Not that the heart thriller cannot be taken in deadly dimensions, but the danger comes from another corner. And it's not really up to the other side of Zandalee until the thriller comes out, and although its base is down in the first half, I can't really describe the genre as a thriller. Much more romantic drama than anything else, but the main currents of other genres. There is an evolving thriller, but it also has more than a little vivid sensual color. Because that's what it is that drives the characters and thus the whole story. Wish. The need and need for it is, in my opinion, a necessity. <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty good, definitely much better than its current (4.1) rating. It will take time, but it will grow in a good state of mind and it will handle the erotic part very well with the taste. It is always an inseparable part of the story that needs to be given to make it a weight, and I didn't feel it was an excuse for a bare breast or something like that. But, unfortunately, the story is at its peak before the end, and the end itself seems to be even, even if it is sort of dramatic. <br /> <br /> Cast is impressive, driven by well-known actors like Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. The exhibition is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and highly adept behavior sometimes due to subtle desires, he stands out between Cage and Reinhold. His career later in Zandalee is too thin for talents, I just hope it is because of his own choices. Also, two personal favorites appear in small roles that give the film some extra edge, Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> If you are in the right mood, this is a very good movie, it may have used another end to get the credit that it really deserves. <br /> <br /> 7/10
