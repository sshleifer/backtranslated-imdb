This is one horrible movie. Fatter than anything David Lynch and it shows what a great director Polanski is because it's not his usual job, and that's BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> It all starts with the Trelkovski movement in the rental apartment in Paris. Soon he learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and believes that the rest of the people who lived there drew him to it. He also believes they are trying to do the same. What results are an amazing and frightening look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> The entire production is written with all the horror of the classic: from images to music, the viewer can feel the fear of Trelkovski. <br /> Are they all to kill him? Or maybe you just run him crazy? Are there any differences? Find out for yourself. 10/10
