I do not see sulfur film in the burial of such a film unless it is in any way more than just an entertainment tool for children and prepares them for the next line of goods. /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My children sat quietly throughout the thing and loved every minute. Despite this, the villain is a bit over his herd costume and manic laughter, but it's much easier to take than a dark, gloomy and very sick Pokemon 3. <br /> <br /> My kids have been watching Pokemon since it started and they arrive soon to the age where they "put things down" and go on to others. I'm glad we could enjoy it together.
