BABY FACE is one of the best "forgotten" movies before the code. This was shown last night after WATERLOO BRIDGE's 1931 version of TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to watch the movie because it is now four plus minutes restored. Stanwyck lives in East St. Louisi (where she might have known "Myra" - Mae Clarke - drunken parents at WATERLOO BRIDGE). His father is Robert Barrett. She has lived with her since her mother's death, and she has pimped her up in her restored dialogue when she was 14 years old. Now he is a local waitress and part-time whore in his jargon, his closest friend is Chico (Theresa Harris), an African-American servant who keeps Barrett bullying. It is one of the two good points of Stanwyck's personality that he stands in front of his father for Harris, threatening to leave when Harris is fired (and because it is foolish workers like Nat Pendleton who enjoy serving Stanwyck, but Barrett must obey him what he brings in , Barrett must obey it). <br /> <br /> A man who regularly goes to the speaker who likes Stanwyck is a shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier) who sees the girl's great potential as he just leaves his abandoned home. He also pushes Friedrich Nietzche's philosophy and ideas into power. More later on. <br /> <br /> After he gets out of the local political major (Arthur Hohl) and has a Barrett argument on it, the explosion kills Barrett and allows Stanwyck to leave his home town. He and Harris led in New York, succeeding to get free transport by rail when he sleeps with the brake (James Murray). They arrive in New York and after walking they see the Gotham Trust Company (founded in 1873) and the friendly guard tells him where the staff office is. <br /> <br /> We look at Stanwycki slowly to step up the business ladder to the top, similar (but sliding) as Robert Morse encouraged HOW TO MAKE BUSINESS ATTENTION. But Morse was the man in the leading company. Stanwyck knows his sexual temptation is his weapon. He goes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (part of the movie I always felt most shocking - curiously - when I watched it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker and finally George Brent. Everyone falls to him and is put aside if he no longer uses or destroys it. The new president of the bank, Brent, his grandfather, finally marries - and the film's crisis is when the bank's economic situation has shaken (especially after Brent buys him luck with jewelery and gives him valuable bonds). Brent accused. Does he shut up? <br /> <br /> SPOILER WILL: <br /> <br /> One of those films that is not recognized is that the theatrical and moral concepts of time still dictated. At the end, Stanwyck had entered Europe, giving up Brent's fate, but knowing that he couldn't do it, returned to his apartment building and found that he had let himself down. He's traveling with him to the hospital. Now, before finding the re-discovered material, the film, along with their apparently abandoning their bank, ended up with the bank to save it and stay back in East St.. Louis to live happily, how bad. <br /> <br /> They have good ends. Stanwyck should continue his destructive course, with Brent being the last victim. But even without the Breen office, script writers (one Darryl Zanuck, by the way) saw fit to find his moral center. He has no - at least none of the powerful men he hates. I don't think the listener of depression would have tolerated this type of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems due to changes in public opinion and changes in society. It was the men's world in the business world in 1933, so Stanwyck has cut off his work. Wood (if he is fired with him) admits that he didn't want him to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwyck would have found the woman all over. The movie has nervous, dirty comments (probably some jealousy) to Stanwycki from other secretaries and female employees. In 2006, she often faces women bosses and found that they were cutting her feet very quickly. Of course, if he finds one or two lesbians, he can try this way, but it's doubtful. And he never seems to meet men who are gay. They have gay male managers in business who don't give a damn about their feet or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then he is a mentor, Mr. Cragg. Cragg has been rebuilt in the "bowdlerized" version, trying to find him in a moral center. In fact, he pushes Nieztsche, but the road (in the broad sense) the Nazis pushed Nieztsche - to find his way to power and pushing it. Though Nieztsche sometimes struggled with power, it wasn't all his theories. Otherwise, no one read her today at college courses. Cragg is obviously self-conscious but only semi-educated. In short, if someone who had thoroughly studied Nieztsche had faced Cragg, he would look like a semi-educated fool. And it's a Stanwycki mentor! A good movie and it's worth 10 ... for that day, but seriously wrong.
