This movie is just so good! Despite Carmen Electra, this must be one of the best films I've ever seen. Jamie Kennedy is just amazing, and Loren Dean plays a very spoiled movie star. The plot is also large. It's all very real, which is scary. Here it is said that it is a drama, but it is one of the fucking funniest dramas I've ever seen. Go look.
