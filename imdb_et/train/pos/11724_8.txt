Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a cheap horror show. When he discovers that his dead aunt has left him with a few things, Elvira is going to England to get it, hoping it is a little money. But her horror explains that her aunt has left her home, dog and cookbook. Elvira decides to settle down anyway, but she can't live in peace with her striking dark look and stunning qualities. All the neighbors are now turning the whole city against him, and Elvira's outrageous attitude and appearance, everything is better because Elvira is a fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really nice to watch Elvira get to all these adventures, it's just great. The whole movie puts you in a halloween mood, surely it is stupid and jokes are cheap but it's a pleasure to watch it. I'd give Elvira a lover of darkness 8/10
