When I saw the movie for the first time in the early 1970s, I was anxious about this movie. Visually, this stunning and European and US campus events linked you to what Antonion was visually trying to say in the last 15 minutes of the movie: "remember" tyrannical institutions and big business interests. Repeated blowing in a beautiful house in the middle of a desert, a leading female character who enjoys natural cold water by painting an airplane in psychedelic designs (even if British Airways did it a few years ago). pictures copied by advertisers around the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd increased its fan after the film was released. <br /> <br /> You will see this movie about 30 years later and you start thinking about why the same movie has lost its appeal. Nowadays, anti-agency films are more of a substance - facts, documentation, fine performances and great scenarios. Antonion seems to be outdated; deficient genius. Even watching Antonion's "Blow Up" gives you the same feeling that he is a passport. <br /> <br /> "Zabriski Point" must be evaluated during its release. It was a great movie when you saw it on a large Panavision screen compared to dwarfed TV screens. The film's visual and phonetic (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, etc.) remain. The lead pair was not a big actor, but they were cute and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in the US, expanding personalized non-conformist values ​​in the film. Watch carefully and you appreciate the silent sounds of ordinary actors - Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, pool women, policemen on the airship. Actual sounds contradict non-conformists. Antonioni was appropriate 30 years ago, but his understanding of the media cannot be called into question today. He knew what he was doing.
