Well its time. I was really giving up and I hope that this season's entries will have a special episode. Although there are still too many hohum entries, at least this episode has proven to be good. It's pretty funny that director Rob Schmidt, who not only has the wrong lie to turn to his credit and writer John Esposito, whose only scripting route has so far included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift, should give us the best written and most thought-provoking season episode. "The Right to Death" is treated as the Cliff and Abbey story. There are a couple of conversations at the beginning of the episode. Abbey has been caught in Cliff's cheat and desperately tries to get her back. When they talk, they get into a car accident where Cliff is left with only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown out of the car and caught firing when the spark ignites and the gasoline dripping onto him burns. And it's just setup. While in hospital, Cliff must decide whether Abbey should live in this condition without skin and only nerve reflexes. There is also a side effect. Every time he slips, Abbey goes like a ghost and causes problems for all kinds of people. Hands down is the best episode of this season and it is definitely one of the biggest episodes. From the terrible effects on a tense script that threw a couple of twists, I didn't see that the arrival and arrest, which is so sensitive, can hardly touch it. The right to die should be the right to live forever.
