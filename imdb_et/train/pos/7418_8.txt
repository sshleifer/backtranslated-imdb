"Shower" is the story of loyalty, the unstoppable progress of the modern world to the detriment of traditional and human lifestyles. A man who was forced to choose between his successful career, the life of his big cities, his wife and his backward young brother. The eternal suspicion we want to do and what we should do. Modern China and Ancient. Public baths with their meetings, cricket matches and shopping malls and skyscraper. Many old men and women no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills another. <br /> <br /> Offer, move, funny moments and bitter sweets. Delicate crying and laughing equally. The actors are enormous, especially the one who plays the role of a slowed boy; and Yang Zhang does a good job, easy, easy, let the story just flow. <br /> <br /> My price: 8/10
