I read some of the previous comments that confirmed that this film loses steam at the end of the movie and that it ends with Cape Fear. I totally agree. I give a simple overview of the usual movements there. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought it was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What a bad psychopath !!! I have a lot of respect after my film. I was ripped off the whole movie. If you like mystery thrillers, be sure to see the movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is full of top stars and I recommend it!
