Interesting is how the research train flows. I started watching an article about Cristo "The Gates" in Central Park. The article noted that Maysles has been a Cristo filmographer for years. Hmmm ... Then I have to look at the body of my work. I believe that one of them has gone on, but the other is still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in his creation stages. Gray Gardens sounded very interesting. Video Station, Boulder CO, is a place to look for hidden or delicate and of course, it's in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who live in the past, and oh what a glorious past was. Edith had gone well, was born of Bouvier, married well, had many wonderful relationships and became a singer in the forties. Her daughter Edie was dututen, a fashion model and had many beams. He's never married and at some point he was home thirty. He seems to have a nervous system disorder. Too much to worry about. It's just the shadow of the world where they live, because Jackie O. came in and hit that place so that her aunt and cousin wouldn't be lifted. This is a 28-room mansion that is worn and worn. But in the movie you will notice fresh colors on the walls. If you look carefully at newspaper clippings, you will see that it was a very messy mess. Edie's equipment is very smart and creative. The observer gets the impression that Edith likes to go naked, but she's not in the movie. Edith was really pretty pretty and you can still see the shadow of her beauty when she sings "Tea for Two". Also, Edie was the beauty of her day and very attractive in the 56's. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When a cat urinates behind the Edith gate, she says, "at least someone does what they want"!
