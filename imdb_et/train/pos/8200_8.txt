Clint Eastwood has definitely made better movies than this, but it doesn't bother him. Dirty Harry is trying to get everyone's attention and if no one wants to look at romance, there is no reason why you don't like it. He's cool because he's dirty, he's great, because he's killing without much thought, it's perfect because he gets a ball through his heart and hero because he doesn't care. <br /> <br /> What I see in the movies that Eastwood is doing is that the role of leadership is always fascinating to the audience. In the heart of White Hunter Black, she is a crazy director, in "Fire of Line" she is "Old" and "while" almost "unemployed" with her job, ie she works for herself, doesn't care about her boss, Who practically sends him out on vacation. <br /> <br /> Based on the victim of violence, this film is promising for all "non-sense" filmmakers, but it doesn't have anything away from its central plot. a little worse, the fact is that although the character of the leading role is not comforting, it is not because it is too clear from the beginning. It is not a film that makes you sit without moving. There are also too many people who are Dirty Harry's farther.
