The financially robbed Paramount pulled out all the labels for this chapter: big budget, big cast, extravagant production, and Mitch Leisen, who was labeled director. What happened? Two Things: Busby Berkeley didn't work out of focus, and a mystery mystery script that didn't deserve the same trash as the worst Charlie Chan's first draft on the street. I have to believe that cutting was out of Leisen because the great Duke Ellington's number is finely cut, but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching: "Sweet Marihuana" number, which contains topless choir girls blower, bearing in mind the threatening product code and he also has a charming Toby Wing (to the detriment of horrible lines and a prototype buggy blonde) as a chorion that is otherwise busy for Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's behavior is happier than Melba Toast, but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen, as new platons, comes as a stereotypical fool detector. And try to see Lucy in the chorus. It's curiosity 7.0. February 2010 Rethink: I recently gave the film a second look and now I feel that I was wrong to confine myself to the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I understand Leisen's argument about more realistic product numbers in the plot context. I'm still having tremendous problems with editing. Paramount, the city 's worst big studio, faced enormous problems with the production code at the worst time in history, financially, and pulled out all its stops (see also the 1934 search for beauty). Must see for pre-codes.
