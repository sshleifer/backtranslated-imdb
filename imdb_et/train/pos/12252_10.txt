I've really enjoyed this "Emma" customization. I've seen it many times and I always look forward to seeing it again. Although it only lasts 107 minutes, most of the new plots and plots were developed satisfactorily. All characters are well represented. Most dialogues come directly from a novel that has no stupid jokes like Emma Thompson's sense and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Among the aliens I appreciate especially the perfect deed of the actors. The setup and costumes were beautiful. I find that this version is equal to the 1995 minisums "Pride and Prejudice", but then the producer and the script were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a really good job of depicting "Emma", of whom Jane Austen said she was creating a heroin, but she would love it. He is snobbish, but he has just enough young people and inexperience to be pleasant. Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Knightley, it is not an easy part for me, although he does not have the pride and pride of Mr Darcy, Colis Firth. Even the end scene (harvesting) that doesn't happen in the novel will give the right end unless it shows that Emma is cold with Frank Churchill and almost unpleasant, while she was thoroughly agreed with her in the novel, even saying she was had been twofold if he had been in his position. A strange deviation from the loyalty shown in the film. I find that costumes are more beautiful and sophisticated than other Jane Austen novels.
