This film and its sequel Barry Mckenzie owns, has two of the greatest comedies ever made. The great story that a young Aussie bloc travels to England to demand his legacy and meet his companions who are as lovable and innocent as he is. where else could you find someone who needs to drink so bad that he is as dry as dead dinghos? Big characters, top players and it's got big sheep and more. Upper notch. <br /> <br /> And some of the more fun songs you'll ever hear, and it's full of celebrities. Certainly my two favorite films all the time, I watch them at least once every two weeks.
