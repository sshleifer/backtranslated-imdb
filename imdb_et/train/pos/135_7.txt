It was great for a series of dolls because this movie showed all the series from one of seven. And it was about one woman trying to stop the new doll because I would never have thought the dolls were hurt. In addition, it showed some puppet theater series that I didn't see and what I see so badly as the second part. It showed the appearance of Torch, which can change things and people that are cool, and showed back the puppet master in the first part. It also showed small foreigners in part 4, which was also cool, showed other people episodes that may be good for them and it did so.
