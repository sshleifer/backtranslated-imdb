I don't understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, this is a typical boy meeting-girl romance, but it's made with such elegance and polish that time just flies. Henstridge (talking about winning a gene-pool lottery!) It's as magnetic and tempting as ever (who says the golden time of the cinema is dead?) And Vartan owns. two lines; The movie is alive when they share the scene - a lot! This is done so well that you find yourself ready to get together ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments - if you feel a little blue, look at this flick, you will feel much better. If you're already happy, you are euphoric. (PS: I'm 33, man, United Kingdom and hopeless romantic looking for my princess ...)
