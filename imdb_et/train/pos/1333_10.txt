I love this movie very much, which I looked at over and over again. I don't understand why anyone thinks this movie wasn't good. You may have seen better or whatever I personally love. This is one of my favorite films and I'm not a Hindi at all, but I love it. It may be a bit like "Pretty Woman" but I haven't seen it and I don't think it's better. I do not know why you are all talking about this, but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I have said that enough, but I love this movie, and for those who say it's not good, then I don't know why you watched it and what movies you think are good. Like everyone else, so I watched it, so I enjoyed it so many people didn't like it. About Rani Mukherjee (I think this is how you wrote your last name) she is very beautiful and my favorite actor ever!
