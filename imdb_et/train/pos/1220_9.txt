The origin of Care Bears and their cousin. If you saw the original movie, you notice the difference. Cousins ​​is raised with Care Bears instead of meeting them later. But I have no problems with this, preferring to treat movies as separate interpretations. Kids are adorable and fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The offender is a cheerfully threatening figure. I could feel the empathy of three children because I wasn't good at sports either. Cree Summer is great as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love toys or enjoyed the original, then you should not miss it. 9/10
