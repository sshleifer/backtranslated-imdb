Wow, it was another good spin off of the original American pie, not as good as a band camp, but definitely much better for a nude mile. Dwight and Erik stiffen in this comedy, but I preferred this dialogue naked for miles. The script was written much better and the comedy flowed more smoothly, but most of the comedy was sex, but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway? Miniature Rock also had a really good kameo, taking into account the intense effort he made in naked miles, his scene with stiffness was fantastic and I was laughing at my ass when I saw it. / / <br /> In my opinion, the film was a definite improvement over the naked mile, if you liked all the previous American Pie films, you should want a beta house if you don't see all the American pies that might not destroy the money.
