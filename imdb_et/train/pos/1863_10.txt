ANTWONE FISHER is a story of young emotionally troubled US Navy sailors. His problems are led by Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him understand that his troubles come from his childhood. <br /> <br /> Get ready for a tear or two. The film can melt the cold heart. I loved the story that turns so terribly that it would happen to someone in a positive ending. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful film, most importantly about forgiveness. Other important issues that you are thinking about are child abuse, adoption and care. There were many scenes I enjoyed. They covered the beginning (the dreams of a little boy? Check the giant pancakes!) And the end (dreams became reality), which combined the story nicely. <br /> <br /> Another great scene happened when the doctor encouraged Antwone to look for his family to find answers to his questions about him. My favorite scene happened when the young man finally got his mother and his reaction to him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All participants represented their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to leadership, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won the Oscar Award and is successful in all his roles. He was strongly represented in this film. <br /> <br /> The actor, Derek Luke, showed why he was so right for the Antwone Fisher part. He depicted a very real and heartfelt work. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant, who played part of Cheryl, was interested in Antwone's love, resembling the sunshine on the screen. Chemistry flowed well between romantic symbols. In a few minutes Fisher gave his mother a great performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
