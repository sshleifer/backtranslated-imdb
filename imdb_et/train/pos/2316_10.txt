I watched this movie randomly, curious on the TV. I like when I discover movies like small, delicate stories of ordinary people. Even if it is tragic at the end, the "Man of the Moon" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of Dan with innocent and pure love. This is a really beautiful, touching love story with 3 high points: Reese Witherspoon, who kept his promises in the cinema world, performance, the beautiful film "Old Lion" by Freddie Francis and James Newton Howard's fantastic result, which is really the soul of the movie. His subjects (which deserved the Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have changed the scenario in music.
