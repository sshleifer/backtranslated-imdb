Watching this movie really brought back some great memories of childhood. I am 34 years old, have not seen it since 12-14. I had almost forgotten this movie, but when I looked at it recently, some scenes literally brought to my eye! This little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like repeating my childhood. It was an amazing experience for me. That's why I always cherish this movie. I hope some other readers may be involved in my experience, not for that particular movie, but for every movie you haven't seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading
