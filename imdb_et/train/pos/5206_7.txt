This movie Evil Breed: Legend Samhain contains very little thought or effort. It is ridiculed by ultra-fast "slasher" death and simple nasty death. The actors were rated D because the actors show very little abilities and their stupidity in the film is too questionable. How they depicted what people behave at their age was incredibly different. The odd division into porn is probably a good thing, and any area that is honorable, but has fallen quite fast with absolute intestinal death. An example is a poor companion that has been removed from the tray and the scene lasts about 5 minutes. It is terribly clear how little children put in the fight. This movie is a good choice for those who want to watch terrible death and virtually torture.
