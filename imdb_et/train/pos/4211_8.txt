I watched it last night on television (HBO). I have to admit that most of the other FN films were out of tension in this film. I loved how Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the next moment. It was classic. Yes Yes. The dames, villians, cigars and thuggish cops! That is all. This movie gave me all the goods. I especially loved how they interfered with communism with a plot that is very common in this film era. It is also very daring because blacklisting was popular these days. I appreciate this movie one of the best I've seen in FN genre!
