"The Baghdad Thief" is an impressive form of evil magician Jaffari (Conrad Veidt). He prints with false and magical spells to become a king of his legitimate ruler, young King Ahmad, and a proud princess from his father ... <br /> <br /> He eventually falls victim to all tyrants (in books and legends) to love and ordinary people the one he ignored here is a little thief (Sabu). <br /> <br /> Good and evil armies, black and white, have perfectly realized both visual and literary concepts ... <br /> <br /> Script is poetic, simple and very beautiful ... men's costumes rise and fall like wings of black birds, attacking suddenly at night for destruction and fear ... <br /> <br /> The bright hero carries white turbans and clothes and his princess is dressed in pink and light blue ... <br / > <br /> For a stylish scene, it was suitable for everyone who had gone before, while using color brought a world that didn't seem possible before ... <br /> <br /> Flying carpet and flying white horse with a gigantic genie (great play by Rex Ingram), a good example of bad wizards and Sabu and Veidti, "The Baghdad Thief" captures the quality of the Arab nights and the real atmosphere ... <br /> The 1940 version remains the best fairy tales on the screen!
