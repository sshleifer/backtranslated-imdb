"Citizen X" speaks of "Rostov's butcher", the nickname of a terrifying and perverse Russian serum murderer who claimed that 52 lives in 1978-92. The film focuses on a novice detective (Rea) who is constantly killing the killer for all sorts of odds, in the face of unwelcome bureaucracy in self-service and convenient denial. The HBO product for t.v. offers solid, good items for the film, keeps the audience out of the harsh details, but plays like the style of Hollywood-like prices. A serious and relatively little known story that is more interesting than "Jack the Ripper" is even and straight. (B)
