"One of Hung's best early efforts. Humor is partly dead because Hung is trying to mimic Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also a bit where Hung pokes fun with Jackie Chani's drunk Master. Action is also pretty good, especially when Hung takes trio martial arts experts at the end. not the biggest movie, but pretty good '70's ​​kung fu, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee. Warn, though: most video movie versions have pretty bad quality, as well as the black surface character that some people find offensive. Sammo Hung is a pig that moves to Hong Kong to fight against some bad boys Sammo turns his dead Bruce Lee into an impersonal battle. <br /> <br /> This movie is often billed as Bruce Lee's "Enter the Dragon" parody, but it's not exactly ... Sammo is a shepherd of pigs - obsessed with Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives in a small open-air restaurant. from local gangsters looking for protection. When Sammo switches to combat mode, he turns on his Bruce Lee impersonation, which must be seen as believing! This movie is pretty sloppy, in many fighting scenes, Sammo fights against people who are obviously actors, not martial arts, and there is one sign that should be black, played by an Asian man with heavy (and potty) makeup. But what this film is not about budget and accuracy is more than an atmosphere and energy. Recommended for good mood. "
