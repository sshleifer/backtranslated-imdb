I'm honest, I finally checked this movie not for the stars - although they were reasonably observable and convincing, especially the three leading positions - or even the compelling story of the President's secret service violation (something, I) reported through the DVD apps of this exhibition, has never happened before. Assuming it is true, it is remarkable!). I got it because it was targeted and has no other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Well, okay, Clark Johnson, one of my faves from "Homicide: Life on the Street" and veteran (mostly) TV director. I would say he is doing a project that is observable, but quite average, despite the possibilities, as good as possible. <br /> <br /> Veteran and ace The secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) must find both who blackmail him and who killed his friend, targeted and incited a chopper of the air force and attended Prez (David Rasche. Anyone who remembers "Sledgehammer"?). His thing with his first wife (Kim Basinger, probably one of HOTTER's first women we've ever had, fictitious or real) is definitely not helping his views. He has to fight off a real mole and avoid a hound dog like his former best friend and co-worker and chief (Kiefer Sutherland, almost entirely in "24" mode). Throw in another major service agent (Martin Donovan and foxy, somewhat hard to buy as a concert by Eva Longorria) and shady foreign characters, and you have a fairly common political thriller that isn't as high as it wants and achieves as desired as it is effective. <br /> <br /> The summary line is the best way to describe how this show plays without giving a spoiler. The DVDs that seemed to me seemed more interesting and interesting to the film, even though the film itself was quite entertaining to keep most (including) interested.
