I saw this independent film in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One thing that was so funny was that it was based on a real story - fun! There are also some great characters in it. Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good. I loved her at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also terrible. I remember him from the class leader. I'm tired of all the dark films that continue. It's fun and easy, and I can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed. I will continue to check when this DVD will appear. Be sure to buy it.
