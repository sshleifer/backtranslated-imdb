I remember this series so well. It was great - both strong and compelling characters, stylish and sexy ... and so different from any other offerings - and now ... I'm sure it inspired the great Canadian drama "Entrepreneurs". <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available in DVD 2 in the UK. Take care of the series again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 has 13 episodes and season 2 looks like 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to have ended for 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was a lot of fun.
