I don't know what kind of movie some of these other people watched, but they had to see a different "Joseph Smith: The Prophet of Restoration" than what I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the film was so well made and inspiring. I think it's definitely worth it. From the beginning, it turns out that much care was taken in making this film. The wallpaper is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film will do a good job of portraying both Joseph Smith and the Prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are depicted with taste and respect. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend watching this movie.
