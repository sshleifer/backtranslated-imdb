The first 2 parts are trying to reduce the absurdity of the increase in wasted spending and governance by national barbarians. The third part speculates that development and exploration on the moon and beyond are key to ensuring meaningful use of human talents and resources. It has speeches that some viewers leave to be both naive and bombastic, but change others with astonishment. It depicts a space weapon / launcher and helicopter with inventive mass communication devices, lifts, flat panel panels and wireless intercoms. This is probably the wrong window for buildings in the future. But it is an unrestricted scientific / technological research of a childless vision. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this is a film about rational-minded groups who are guided by Spinozean-like morals in their quest for immortality, living ethically through science advancement and a unified world government. Successful characters (like the two Cabals) believe that humanity could "live forever", retaining our experiments and advances for future generations, always standing on our humanity as a giant shoulders. <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (author: A Space Odyssey, 2001) offered this film to Stanley Kubrick on an excellent SF movie. Kubrick hated it and said he would never look at another movie based on Clark's suggestions (source: Clarke's special millennium introduction to his 2001 novel). Although late, Clarke suggested this at the top of her list when someone asked her about the best SF movies. It has a beautiful Menzies art design but a mediocre special effect (especially toy containers). <br /> <br /> I personally loved it and I think it stands out as a zeitgeist of modernity. It is a bit na√Øve to see how long the creation of a society with crime is credible. It also seems unlikely about the inevitability of progress. It seems to me that we could just go back to the dark age or at least become so aware that we are killing ourselves or being unable to escape from the next great natural disaster. However, this obviously poses a risk that the public and child care annoyance will be threatened by the potential dangers of space accidents and deaths. It challenges us to choose the side of progress against small wishes for safety, convenience or happiness: <br /> <br /> CABAL: "Too much {rest} and too soon, and we call it death. go - conquer outside conquest - this little planet and its winds and roads, and all the laws of the mind and things that restrict him, the planets from him and finally the whole overflow of stars And if he has conquered all the depths of the space and all the mysteries of time, he is at the beginning "CABAL:" If we are no longer animals - we have to grab and live our little traces of happiness and suffer, no more - if all other animals do - or have done. " {He points to the stars.} "That's it - or is it? All the universe - or something ..." (quotes from the scenario). <br /> <br /> If it sounds like rationalization, devoting the entire society to success, then council members (world government) seem to be technocrats. But in fact, these "technocrats" allow their citizens to become craftsmen or do other passions freely, and should be reduced by government bans, anti-science and experimental laws, and other powers and power-limiting use that would make their critics a tyrant <br /> <br /> In fact, in the rebel group, all of the Council's scientific and technological developments are being felt, so they are trying to stop the advancement and stop the Council's freedom to experiment. The progress-oriented Council does not deprive rebels of free speech, but prepares their own "peace-gas" in an emergency and simply wants to move on to freedom and space. <br /> <br /> So it is also a story of freedom to do science, as much as it is about progress. Many of the people in our society agree with some of their main rooms, except for social prejudice (many want to ban cloning) or naturalism (some do not want us to move freely, and rather we are enslaved to dead land) or fear / cause (some believe that we are not ready for advanced science / technology because we can destroy ourselves). But Cabalil (President-in-Office of the Council) is the answer to the problem of danger: "Our {scientific} revolution did not lose death or threat. It just made death and a threat valuable" (scenario).
