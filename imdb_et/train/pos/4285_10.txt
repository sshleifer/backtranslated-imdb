This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. Yet, the appearance of this drama, which has become a feature film, is not worth anything. The masterpiece should not be seen (preferably with subtitles and not dubbed). <br /> <br /> In an old bus that travels to Belgrade's capital, war-threatening war decides on passenger behavior. Two Gypsy musicians sing their unhappy life, but also foresee a future tragedy; their singing shares and combines the stages of the film of this extraordinary work (in real life, Kostic's brothers are amateur actors, but with Stanojlo Milinkovic, who plows the way, gives real life). <br /> <br /> Spectrum characters give an excellent picture of the society facing war, an overview of the country's collective man: everyone is aware that war is about to start, but they are trying to live their lives best, hoping that ignorance can prevent tragedy . With the help of a simple film language, director Slobodan Paotn paints a picture of a society crushed by the previous war (World War I), but also highlights successful personal portraits: the provincialism of the singer, the inexperience of the young couples, the seriousness of the war veteran. on his way to visit his recently-equipped son and gloomy predictions about a man who seems to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly featured and edited in his narrative, memorable sound (first Gispsy songs), and well-tuned atmosphere, this feature (Bentn's debut) was just an introduction to the bitter-sweet comedies of many directors defining the 1980s Serbian cinematography: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota", and the favorite of my second director "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
