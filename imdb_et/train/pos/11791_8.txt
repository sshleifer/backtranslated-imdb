This is David Lynch's very intriguing short film and saying that the name David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch short. Blonde and brunette in a dark room. The blonde is crying, the brunette speaks in a threatening way to the blonde, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> There are many silent moments, but Angelo Badalament's haunting music has a strange relationship. This short seems a bit like "Mulholland Dr", the movie I loved, and that's why I liked it too. This is probably especially for Lynch fans, but you like it.
