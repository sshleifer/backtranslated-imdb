A separate conscious scientist finds how to find a new crater of influence of a meteor carrying a radioactive element. All the scientific and breakthrough technological talks of the 1930s are there, including the idea that radioactivity can be fully utilized. When he called his competitors, who had taken him out of the scientist and ridiculed him - witnessing his discovery, they offered a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course they steal a lot of dr. Rukhi's original discovery, giving him only a residual loan. In addition, the feminine weakness that looks like a strong comedy from the actress's worst Abbot and Costello (Lawton), literally steals dr. Rukhi's young trophy wife (Drake), who falls from the head of this man's head. When the horns grew like deer, he didn't start dr. Rukh (Karloff) is friendlier, so he starts a secret revenge mission ... killing 2 his enemy and friendly dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... finally give up the deadly radiation that allowed him to start his revenge, but (in my utmost dissatisfaction) spared adultery, and this bad apology to man when he was married. Action is usually good, because Karloff & Lugosi is very good. Check out the hysterical chamber house scene ... Other signs are not worth mentioning ... Recommended as all old universal horrors ...
