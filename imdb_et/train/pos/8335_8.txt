While sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is a good reason to see this movie, there is an extra plus supporting cast (including the fun trio of Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and Jacobi, Saks and Maher). Matthau looks like Einstein, Fry is perfect when Ryan's clinical groom and Shalub's line of Einstein's gonads are, as noted, one of the film's highlights. Robbins' first publicly released speech is pure poetry. The tissue for the writers to handle this foam mentally and lightly. I also thought Keene Curtis was great as Eisenhower. This can be considered something of a chick movie, but I think everyone gets out of it. Eight very strong points.
