I understand that this review gives me the patrol criticism of this site, but I protect it. <br /> <br /> A dentist is actually a very good movie. Working is not always the upper limit, but the excitement is good and the story is good. In addition, you see the guys from Linda Hoffman. Not that I am an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense. Corbin makes a great scary dentist. This is for dentists that jaws sharks ... ish. It obviously had a rather limited budget, but they did well with what they could and developed the symbols well (the ones that counted). <br /> <br /> The End.
