A great movie from two police who love the same woman. One policeman (Périer) killed him, but all the evidence seems to be accusing you (Montand). The unhappy Montand does not know who is the second lover who could have killed her, and Périer does not know if Montand had a girl thing. Montand must definitely find a killer ... and what a great ending! Highly recommended.
