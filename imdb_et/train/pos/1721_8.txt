If this film had been made a few years later, I would have given him a lower score. But in 1909 it was a small film that is still pretty good today. Just do not try to compare this silent film with the later silences - the industry changed so radically that short shorts in the first decade of the 20th century do not look like films made in the 1910s and beyond. <br /> <br /> This movie is 11 minutes long (most of that time on average for most movies) and it's a variation of Edgar Allen Poe's story, AMONTILLADO MONEY. Although many are familiar with the story, I do not specify, because I do not want to destroy the film. Just enough to say it's very horrible!
