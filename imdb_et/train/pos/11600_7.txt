William Hurt may no longer be an American matinee, but he still has a good taste of B-film projects. Here he plays a hazardous waste cleaning specialist with a tragic past, following a multi-year loser by the former real boy Weller - who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. The current beautiful boy, Hardy Kruger Jr. - probably more beautiful than his father - has been presented as Weller's arrogant boss in a terrible order in the chemical industry where the story moves. Natasha McElhone is a somewhat unpleasant government agent who is investigating an incident that inevitably offers a high level of love for hero Hurt. Michael Brandon opens up to play a tortuous type of prisoner whose fire can't wait. The Coca-Cola company wins the product placement award in 2000 as the soft drink has emerged throughout production.
