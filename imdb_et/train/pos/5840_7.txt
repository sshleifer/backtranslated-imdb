Although the film's premise is pretty flat (Ollie is diagnosed with "hornophobia"), this movie is a friendly and enjoyable little swing. It's also a little better than the movies they did after that - probably because it was the last Laurel and Hardy movie produced by Hal Roach. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see the last movie, because these films disappear all the chemistry and the boys play their parts purely for the stamens - nothing real Laurel and Hardy will ever do. They had a little edge that all the later films were missing. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie are working in the horn factory. It sounds pretty funny, but it's not. Not surprisingly, the whole racket is nervous at Ollie and takes time. Doctor (James Finlayson - in his latest film with his team) suggests an ocean trip. But they don't like sailing and Stan has the idea of ​​just renting a boat-related boat - then they get all the sea air they want without it all bothering! When they are on the boat, a dangerous escaped criminal force puts the boat and all of them at sea accidentally. Fortunately, this part of the movie really was very busy and very good result very well. <br /> <br /> Although it wasn't a big full length Laurel and Hardy movie, it was much better than many of them. it had no tedious and disturbing musical numbers (like DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOYLAND). In addition, there is a decent physical comedy - something that almost everyone would see after this movie. Some of this was due to the reduction in the health of the boys (and the growing surroundings of Ollie) and some of them were the general insipidness of their later films.
