In this film, there are some very smart humor that is both a parody of the actors and a tribute. But after a while, it just seems like a style exercise (despite the big gags, such as Balasko, who continues Dussolier's part, and very good participation by everyone) and I was wondering why Blier made this movie. Everything comes to an end when Blier, who heads Claude Brasseur, gets a phone call from his father (Bernard Blier) and gets the chance to tell him how much he doesn't. An effective emotional master and obviously affectionate. But there is not really enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the movie interesting throughout this working time. Some really nice scenes and sequences and anyone who loves the French cinema "mosntres sacr√©s" should enjoy this movie.
