Remember Ralph Bakshi? The man who was Terrytonon's animator, then Paramount Cartoon Studios, was Fritz's head of Cat 1 & 2 and Heavens Well, that's Coonskin. And it's really pretty good. Racist but good. The film takes place at Harlem's night (No, duh, that was the title of the work.), But with the twist that turns into the Disney movie's southern song. <br /> <br /> It's about Sampson (Barry White) and the preacher (Charles Gordone) is hurrying to help his friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from the prison, but stop by the roadblock and stop shooting with the police. Waiting for them, Randy involuntarily listens to the Scatman Crothers when he starts talking to Randy about "three men, I know you and your friends". The Pappy story is spoken in animation directed to live-action background images and film material. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit (Thomas Voice), Brother Bear (White Voice), and Preacher Fox (Gordone Voice) decide to pack and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages home and sells it to a person, who makes it brothel. Coming to Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox find that this is not all that has been done. They experience a person named Simple Savior, a fake revolutionary leader who wants to be a "Black Jesus" cousin, and that he gives his followers "strength to kill whites". In the terrible performance of his "church", the Savior is brutal with the symbols of black oppression represented by John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon before asking their churches for "donations". <br /> <br /> Rabbit first rises against Madigan, a virulently racist and homophobic white policeman and mafia bag, who demonstrates his contempt for African Americans in a variety of ways, including refusing to bathe before the expected meeting with them (he believes they are not worth). When Madigan discovers that Rabbit has taken up his salary, he will take his formations, Ruby and Bobby, a nightclub called "The Cottontail". <br /> <br /> Black stripper pulls him out of the LSD sugar cube to drink. Madigan, who is under the influence of her dough beverage, is then maneuvered for sexual communication with a stereotypically feminine man and then pushed by the clothes that women represented in the racist archetype, decorated with something racist, and finally pulled back the club where she discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. Then, reusing his drug from the delirium, he fires the weapon at random and the police kills a rabbit after the death, a bear, a fox and an opponent boxer rushes out of the boxer when it blows up. The live-action story ends with the escape of Randy and Pappy when they are shot by various white police officers, but they are able to bring it alive. <br /> <br /> This movie was controversial during this release and was re-edited by the director several times under the heading Street Fight, which is obvious as Street Fight is a 2005 documentary about racism on the streets. In fact, this film has the same theme as the documentary. <br /> <br /> It was caused by the classic classic classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre by Bryanston Pictures and Tobe Hopper. As Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but because of racism, Bryanston took over Bakshi's production. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth entertaining. The animation was fantastic at this time, the plot makes sense and it is funny. <br /> <br /> DATE: 9/10
