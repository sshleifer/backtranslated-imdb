Everyone should see this movie completely! It's amazing scary but doesn't use flat "jump-out-at-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" things. It's really great. Watch this amazing awesome movie !!! Director is Stanley Kubrick, who is just the biggest director ever to live. Every one of his films is masterpieces, including that. Shining is about the family that goes to the Colorado Rockies Hotel, who is caring for winters, and snow. Well, the house is haunted. The child is psychic. Spouse is easily affected by evil haunted hotels and ... well ... HILARITY ENSUES !!!! Not quite. It turns into a thrilling thriller, where things are thrown out of the viewer from all different directions and becomes scary. Not only classic, "Here's Johnny" scene. It's memorable, but you can't talk about the whole movie. This is one of those things where words do not explain enough and you just have to see it. So go to Netflix and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
