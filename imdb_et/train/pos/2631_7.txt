When Lion King is a serious story about a young lion who grows into the death of his father, Lion King 1 and 1 half are the opposite, full of madness and joy. Lion King talked about the story of a young lion from Simba, one and a half of Timone's and Pumbaa's sight, which is less than the perfect duo, made up of a home-made mate, because she couldn't dig in the tunnels with her friends and neighbors and the weave of the smell. The content of the movie is a bit short, but Disney is doing a good job of spending time with different sketches featuring Timone and Pumbaa when they watch the movie together. My favorite is singing along the side of the movie, make sure you look at the bug that is bouncing! Disney has advertised one and a half "rest of the story", though it is not. It's just a different perspective of Lion King, without any serious things that swelled most of the second half of the original Disney classic. Credit to Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa to work on their voice without making their efforts. Song, they entertain and make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a bathroom with a jacuzzi.
