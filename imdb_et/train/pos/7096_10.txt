I had the privilege of seeing this movie a year ago, and outside the theater I was facing a camera crew from a local TV channel who was looking for comments on the film. At the time, the only words that escaped from my mouth were "Awesome. Just awesome." I like to think I can express myself a little better, but at a time when I couldn't do it a little. <br /> <br /> The story is intriguing and thoughtlessly provocative, and action is first of all directors. This film was the first thing Terry Gilliam said he had no hand to write. Back to Universal after his long and difficult battle with "Brazil", Terry had achieved what he wanted the most; the final paragraph ". Terry is a master master and every shot is like a beautifully designed painting that has been built carefully and firmly and with conviction. Only justice, that such a person should be unlimited in the idea of ​​passing an idea. Unfortunately, such agreements still have limitations. <br /> <br /> The DVD of Universal Collector's Edition is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features are not in the box, including the director's / producer's commentary and an informative and very interesting 90-minute documentary about making the "Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys". It talks about some of the creative sections of filmmaking, including a nice test, when the previews are poorly tested, capturing the team with self-confidence and despair, and fortunately they decided to make very little change for us about the movie and released its tremendous success. <br /> <br />
