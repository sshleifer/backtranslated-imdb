At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends recall how embarrassing he was when looking for the neck. Meanwhile, the deceased Joe's London tarot card reveals the serial killer identity. He deceives Reaper and appears to American journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on the stage in the middle of the magic exhibition of Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and tells him that the murderer is Aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra pulls Sidi into her investigation, looking for evidence that Peter is a killer. But she falls in love with her and asks if Joe Strombel is right for her scoop. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great Woody Allen comedy outside of Manhattan, actually back in London. His ironic and spiritual lines are simply fantastic, and I laughed very enthusiastically with my hero's fate in a country where people travel on the "wrong side". Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is a great comedian. But his current museum, Scarlett Johansson, of whom I am a big fan, is overly active and disturbs many moments, changing the emphasis on hysterical pronunciation. His character is absolutely stupid and stupid, and I was quite disappointed with his performance (probably for the first time in filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still fun and worthy of entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop O Grande Furo" ("Scoop The Big Scoop")
