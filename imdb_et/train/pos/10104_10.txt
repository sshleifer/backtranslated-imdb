Om Puri, Smita Patili, and Sadashivi's Amrapurkar production and chemistry come out well, with a minimalist approach to Govind Nihlan's story and direction. Vijay Tendulkar's dialogues are also great. <br /> <br /> I didn't see another such movie. This is one whole, every piece fits well on the plot. This movie can't be impressed. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri comes out as Om Puri's ultimate husband and "baap". Om Puri is a young man who has been caught up in his conscience and inability to oppose the system. Sadhashiv, like Rama Shetty, just gives a film to his smile and soft speaker. Anand Velankar's first meeting with Rama Shetty at Sadhashivi is absurdly stunning. Smita Patil has no major role, but her part does not reflect the main plot. <br /> <br /> To add this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of the police, who has agreed to the system and its functioning. Saying the right things in the right place and knowing how to keep yourself out of trouble. She is also a guru of Om Puri and always helps her when she gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The movie focuses not only on the difficulties the cop is facing but also on the other. police in custody. Om Puri grabs hopelessness and a burning desire to get rid of this extraordinary performance of Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> Take care of all Indian movie fans.
