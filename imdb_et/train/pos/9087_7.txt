Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays in the Hollywwod hotel (of course). At the same time, the big egotist star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) is buggy and refuses to premiere her new picture. In panic, the studio is hiring a studio in Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to embody her and that Bowers takes her, which she doesn't tell her it's not Marshall. Of course they fall in love. You can understand a lot of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> The piece is old (finely), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very nice pair and have beautiful song rates. The result is good (emphasized by "Hooray for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley shows his unique visuals in a truly entertaining musical order (Edgar Kennedy makes his patented slow burn). Glenda Farrell also has some funny bits like Monas sister Jonesie. <br /> <br /> This movie is still not so good. The rest of the mugs are furious and most humor is not just funny. Especially Lola Lane just tries to play Mona for comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black girl laughs and in some places there is a really terrible racist "humor". This is probably what keeps it mostly out of TV. I understand that it was accepted at that time, but it is so rebellious today. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a film that has some serious problems, with good respect and some great songs. I'll give her 7.
