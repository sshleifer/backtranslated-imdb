Although it is definitely politically incorrect to sail, the portrayal of Dudley Moore's lovable lush Arthur Bach is such a charm, but he does not recognize this unique and wonderful character. How can you not laugh and strangle this infectious and stupid. Although I'm not really a fan of Liza Minnell, she was very good at Linda Marolla and I couldn't see anyone else on this role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and served his Oscar. The rest of the majority is excellent and this great tune "Arthur's Theme", wow. It really was one of the best comedies of the 1980s. Big movies get better with every view, and that's the case with Arthur.
