I've seen the movie Holes and said it must be the best movie all year round. It brings out the child in all. I mean, who should think that they have worrying boys when they punish? Louis Sachar is who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the biggest there. Reasonable and height is smart, but ZigZag / Ricky was higher and armpit / Theodore was higher. Also, X-Ray / Rex had to be one of the smallest boys, but it wasn't. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that the setbacks were quite convincing and long. I would have seen more today than the past, but my opinion. I especially like boys' work. Like Squid / Alan, played by Jake M.Smith was supposed to be a moody and tough child. Jake M.Smith did just that and did a great job in it, like almost all Holes participants. So I would say that if you haven't seen the holes, you should definitely see it when it reappears, or if you lose the whole lot.
