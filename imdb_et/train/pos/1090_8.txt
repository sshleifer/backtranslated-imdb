One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings. While deciding on this size, the dwelling would be a dream today. Still, Cary did a good life in the field of advertising, although she had a devil trying to give a slogan to a ham called Wham. <br /> <br /> What made this movie so popular was the lack of post-World War II housing. Post-war veterans demanded their rights under the GI Rights Act, which included housing loans. The problem was that, literally, the house was not enough to meet the demand. At a time when Eric Hodgins and the film were such a popular congress, and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act, which put the government for the first time in a home construction company. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and aunt who at the same time built their home, which they moved in the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and they were looking out of Rochester. Their place was not as big as the Connecticut house of eighteen rooms, but they were most likely to live the rest of their lives with Cary and Myrna. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was expensive and the cost just added and upward, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas, who offers advice, usually too late. The truth is, he is sweet for Myrna and Cary. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is simply to expand Nora Charles. If you can imagine Charles moving to the country and William Powell, who has a headache of Cary Grant, the film still works well. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings Builds His dream house is still working as a comedy because the situation is universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and Aunt Kate, who lived in their dream house for over 40 years.
