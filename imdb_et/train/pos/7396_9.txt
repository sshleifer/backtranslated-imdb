Another prominent foreign film that takes care of Hollywood's endless harvest! It's a story of life and life. No, certainly not a perfect little life that is so often depicted artificially in Hollywood films, but the real life with real stars that have strong and weak points like real people in our lives and in ourselves. <br /> The dynamics of all those lives that are intertwined with the walls of this sauna, and especially its old owners, are an excellent, heart-minded and highly thoughtless provocation. simple and beautiful life. In this movie you need to learn real wisdom when you only open yourself to it. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be disappointed.
