This is another big movie with great luck to see on the big screen for the first time (thanks to Rick Baker and others). In the late 80s I was a relatively newcomer to the genre and only really new to about three of JC, SH and YB. I wasn't sure what to expect if I paid my hard earned money to see the "triple classic" old Scalas. I don't have to worry, this movie was a breath. If you are a fan of Hong Kong / Kung Fu movies and have not seen this movie, do it now!
