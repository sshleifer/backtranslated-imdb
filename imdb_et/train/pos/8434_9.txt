I am always a fan of the play so I testify that I am biased. When the exhibition ended, I felt that too many questions were left unanswered. This movie seemed to me like closing. To see all the people I followed in recent years was finally the most useful. I've heard that this is probably the only killer movie we're expecting. If this is the case, this is the right way to go. This film is sometimes pleasant, sometimes disturbing, but always satisfactory. If you are or have ever been a fan, watch this movie.
