: Julianna Donald, Lonny Price and Louis Zorich. cameos: Art Carney, Brooke Sheild, Lisa Minelli, James Coco, Joan Rivers, Dabney Coleman, Linda Lavin, Gregory Hines and others. <br /> <br /> Muppeteers: Jim Henson Kermit, Rowlf, dr.Teeth, Swedish Chef, Waldorf, Ernie and others. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt Scooter, Janice, Statler and Beaker. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz like Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Animal, Bert, Cookie Monster and Sam the Eagle. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson like Camilla Chicken, Floyd Pepper, Lew Zealand, Crazy Harry and Pops. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz like Gonzo, Zoot, Beuregard and Bunsen Hunnydew <br /> <br /> Steve Whittemire like Rizzo rat and others. <br /> <br /> Another great Muppet flick. This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla are out of college and starring in the music they're trying to get to Broadway. After he could not get it badly, they were all divided and they went separately. I love symbols and cameos. The songs of the movie are "Together Again", "Look at Me, Here I am", "Saying Goodbye", "And I'm Always Loving You", "Rat Jazz", and "He makes me happy". and all the actors do a good job like the Muppets are in. Look at it! 91 minutes. Rated G. My rating: A.
