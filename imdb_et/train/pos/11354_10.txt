CitizenX (1995) is the emerging world response to sheep species. When "silence" terrorized our peace of mind, "Citizen" discourages us and saddles us. This dramatization of the Chikatilo incident quite well interprets, thanks to the western friendship of two Rostov police who become equal. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also challenge (!) Death Penalty much better than Kevin Spacey's The Life of David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> People are Machiavellian mammals under the limbic brain (internal logic). Why were the two children, who knew better, to kill death that they kidnapped? Why do bloody women call "li-lilililililii" in OBSCENE acts of terrorism? - My own term for this is "limbic domination", the desire for lizard logic to dominate the "enemy". If you have the words "enemy" / "revenge" in the dictionary, then you have a simple "limbic domination". <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, destroyed by World War II, Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don River) near the Black Sea did not push Andrei Chikatilo's desire for "limbic domination" over the strata of his civilization. The simple casualties of Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) were superstitions, usually children, who drove on an intercity train because they didn't get anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the rampant Soviet refusal to bureaucracy cost 52 such sheep. Rostov's serum killer traveled freely for almost 7 years after police arrest and let him go. <br /> <br /> Politicizing crimes is detrimental to police forces everywhere. Although policing is corrupt all over the world, politicians in the West can create chronic inter-agency competitions, blocking the co-ordinated response to crime, by harassing votes. In the CitizenX Soviet Union, Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) suffered a killer department under repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn plays a psychosexually inadequate Chikatilot with a flawless but underrated authority. complete ambiguity. In real life, Chikatilol also had a lifetime experience that combines and avoids capture. <br /> <br /> His catcher, on the other hand, looks like a strange bird that is given to sleepless, naive outbreaks. Perhaps by design, Stephen Rea gives a very strange result as forensic chief Burakov. A row of Russian accents is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humorless and sullen, contrary to everyone. <br /> <br /> So this is Donald Sutherland, who walks with the picture. Sutherland Colonel Fetisov, Burakov's chief, and first his only supporter, is an over-restrained, patient soldier whose dignified carriage recognizes decades of bureaucratic mechanisms. His revival as a logical but still passionate policeman becomes the cornerstone of the film ideally. <br /> <br /> Joss Ackland will turn once again, Communist ideology secretary Bondarchuk, following the investigation. Of course, in 1984, he probably lifted the bag of a man with a suspect, a communist arrest, a bag and a knife, allegedly home: Andrei Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> Soon he was replaced by Burakov's second Moscow apparatchik, Detective Gorbunov (John Wood), demanding that the investigation now focus on 'known homosexuals'. The sad, sad, more fun scene of this movie is during the institutionalized harassment of Bondarchuk and Gorbunov: one stupid cop is serious: "As I suspected, the comrade, this is fornication. I've done some drawings - to kick off a ridiculous." After the bodies began to grow in 1987, the police finally tried to obtain criminal profiles. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr. Alexander Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who named it UNSUB "CitizenX." Later he also observed Fetisov and Burakov that " ... you make a great person together. "We agree. <br /> <br /> The eminent pace that has spread over a decade fully encompasses Glasnost's institutional inertia -" unity "- it was not. Although Chikatilo was still in the train stations, the police plans had already been successful. In 1990, Colonel Fetisov was promoted His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene, allowing for the ultimate investigation without political interference. Employees, communication, advertising - maybe all were there. Calling just one evening on the phone, Fetisov got access to depressive forensic leadership access to the FBI Serial Murder Task Force in Quantico, where Fetisov discovered that staff are being routinely expelled from serum killings to prevent such psychological damage to investigators. /> <br /> Fetisov advises his recently advocated forensic chief, now "Colonel" Burakov, on all these changes in the confessional avalanche that is becoming the source of the film's power. Fetisov is the most urgent apology I have ever seen in the film: "Privately, I offer you and your wife a deep apology. I hope one day you can forgive me your ignorance, "almost whispering. <br /> <br /> Production of HBO, CitizenX is the film with the highest caliber. but Randy Edelman's rising soundtrack is absolutely overwhelming - and often our only breath-taking. Hungarian-speaking people recognize many Hungarian accents and credits. And because of ignorance, equally gloomy in the world, it makes murders unknown - but of course they were, as President Kennedy reminded us, "We all value the future of our children." The rape of serial rapists is dominant, and successive killers kill the dominant So some soldiers, such "limbic dominators" make poor people. <br /> <br /> WARNING-SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- Actual Andrei Chikatilo was the world's most prolific killer of serums. Convicted, he was executed in 1992 according to all the death sentences of the Soviet Union: one shot, the back of the head. Foolishly, such methods destroy any chance of learning a terrible brain after death. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best result is always to prevent killings, not to prosecute them. Fulfillment only ensures the inability of society to learn from the complex reality of the victims' deaths, even if we send even anecdotal evidence of how / why they died. The killers also do not regret being dead. <br /> <br /> Vengeance will not save the victims. There is nothing better for a killer blood than a counter-attack - if it's too late. <br /> <br /> In the name of revenge, the guardian of revenge is not fair, it is the attraction of livelihood. / 10)
