One of the best films of "Amitabh's comeback" that I liked. It was the stage when Govinda was strong with Dhawan. The songs were fantastic and completely like the "mast" type. An eternal entertainer who loves the versatile splitting of Anupam Kher. The story is very fun and complicated, as is known for David Dhawan's boilers. The timely appearance of Madhuri's "Nene" Dixit was a complete rebellion at the end. It was nice to see that Ami, after a long exile, had such power and humor. While some may consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I would look at it every day. I'll give it to 10 out of 10 just to be pure Bollywood.
