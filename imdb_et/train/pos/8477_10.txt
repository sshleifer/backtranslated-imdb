it is not so common in the sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a small child and I remembered it recently and thought to watch it. Although many details are, in my opinion, no longer clear, it is a general feeling that the film has captured me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel their children can handle mature and sometimes violent issues, I highly recommend this movie. It taught me a lot about life and death and brought me many emotions. This is one of my favorite films to date.
