It was undoubtedly the most disturbing film I've ever seen. The first half of the film is light and fun. The journey begins with such a peaceful note, specifying and emphasizing the beauty of the Appalachian mountains. But it's misleading. Obvious social problems (kinship) and deformations in rural areas are just the first disturbing aspects of the film. I still hear Bobby silence the pain and I was thinking. Lewis's leg made me win. However, when the film was generally very annoying and irritating, it raised interesting questions. When is moral or the right to take another person's life? What can morality do in some cases or not? And is dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Regardless of what conclusions can be drawn from the film, this achievement is in itself (despite certain aspects that were cool real and harsh).
