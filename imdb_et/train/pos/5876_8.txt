Now I really liked this movie, it was so funny. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are great actors, I think they should make a lot more movies in the future after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets a little trouble while looking for 3 women, but the way she gets out of the door and the other was just so funny she really worked in the movie and I hope that he will make much more comedy in the future, John Abraham will play his best friend, play his role really well and he is so underrated that I am glad some of his amazing work has been noticed, but he is really a good actor. I just love John, Neha Dhupia plays a small role in this movie and plays it well. <br /> <br /> Music is really good that I really recommend this movie to everyone.
