I was not only in this movie when I saw it in a movie theater in Boston. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans penetrated into Boston Common to see comedy .... about them .... Red Sox fanatics! The star of Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon is this lovely comedy of love and lust. Love is between two young lovers. Lust is that Red Sox won the World Series. Although Fallon is not a big actor, he is the best actor. She's funny and gets the most laugh. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I felt that supporting actor Ione Skye would have been a better actor in the role. All Boston Red Sox fans love this movie. For the rest of the world, it's just a funny movie.
