When I sat to watch the "Largo Winch", I waited for something other than action scenes and exciting cars. When I got up, I've seen both of them; Karl Roden was not the end of the film antagonist to start. Kristin Scott Thomas played his role well, but in my opinion the two stars were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both of whom were excellent. Radivoje Bukvicis portrayed Goran well. <br /> <br /> Blended linguistics brought the film a nice color, but I understand why people get bored with it. <br /> <br /> The Hong Kong landscape and especially amazing at the Croatian seaside seaside, and I hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered an incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone loves expensive limousine cars; this is their movie. It is also a film for people who love sequences, good actors, extreme beauty landscapes, and above all a fast, well-written action film, a dazzling fight and a deeply twisted inner drama. <br /> <br My voice, as it has enlightened, is a dark day: 10/10
