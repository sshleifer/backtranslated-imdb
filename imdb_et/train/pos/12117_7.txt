Though this movie made Davis a card thanks to its super-intense presentation by the illiterate guttersnip speaker / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this film is strange for me as a whole. Action is indeed the most fine. I can't figure out how or why Phillip, a sensitive, well-bred young man, is constantly abusing him, constantly feeding him: I think his naïve tolerance is, in a sense, totally ridiculously incredible. Yes, I know he is a sensitive club-like, introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that someone who cultivated would not tolerate or believe in her attitude or deeds. Davis is amazing in his role: yes, he can now go overboard in his histrionics, but it's a vividly creative idea of ​​how you look at it. Too bad he didn't play a gangster. His character would have been a very plausible little tramp!
