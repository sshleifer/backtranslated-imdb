Scott Henderson, an engineer who uses Carol Richman as his assistant, does this to call him "Kansas" when he talks to him. This shows us that Carol, which was actually played by Ella Raines, should be in the woods of Manhattan in the 1940s. Only a woman out of town would follow a shady bartender alone in the elevated subway. Even when the na√Øve girl could have taken such an adventure, Robert Siodmak was very good at guiding this film. He shows the story of infusion story with lots of raw sex that was surprising these days. How else could we justify how a drummer in a musical orchestra, where Scott takes a mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such a beautiful passage for a lady? Elisha Cook Jr. The high-voltage drummer does not hide his wish against any woman who sat in the front row of music where he plays. It was a real explicit invitation to first create a "phantom art", Fay Helm; Later, the Cliff drummer, insinuates himself very publicly with Ella Raines, who goes to the theater for the hidden mystery of his boss was originally. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that hooks at the beginning of every viewer. There's nothing explained about it, but it's in your best interest. The killer does not come to an end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines, with expressive eyes, was an actor. He keeps himself against many more experienced participants. The Hollywood director Franchot Tone, who works in Hollywood, never found what he deserved in this environment. He is the best friend of the accused. On the other hand, Alan Curtis comes over as a man who, in framing, receives his fate and is saved only by the secret of the woman who secretly loved her. Thomas Gomez, Inspector Burgess, is a film detective who has doubts that the police have hit the offender. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't disappoint.
