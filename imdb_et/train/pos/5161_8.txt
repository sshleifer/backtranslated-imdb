Kirk and the team land on a lone planet where the sun explodes. They intend to evacuate the population but find an abandoned place, except for Mr. Atoz, who runs a high-tech library. Despite the fact that he wanted him to respond directly to each person's location, Atoz is indifferent to these issues and requires them to quickly choose when there is time. They have no idea what they are talking about, but they are talking about the viewers' reflective hand disks and they see the past of the planet. When the plate is in the viewer, Kirk passes through the doorway and is magically transported back to the time that looks like the Earth on Louis XIV (1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, the viewer has a different disc and they are sent to hell in the ice age. Too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository. <br /> <br /> Although Kirki's visit is quite short and not all that exciting, Spock and McCoy have a lot of eventful because Spock falls from head to toe for Mariette Hartley - sent to this terrible place as a punishment. Spock scenes are conventionally interesting and very atypical for a logical man. <br /> <br /> Spock's departure from the norm, the wildly invented script and the very different regions make it an extraordinary episode - it's worth it. <br /> <br /> FYI - The great character actor Ian Wolfe played Mr. Atozit. I am a fan of big older films and have seen him in the 1930s and 40s as a supportive and a bit of a playful filmmaker, and he was almost exactly the same as he did since 1969. another 23 years - over 95 years old!
