This movie brings back many memories of the old classic cinema, where the actors did not have to look at their clothes to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think the main plus of this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, which is definitely a movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of comments about the movie being sick and too lush. In response, I think that is a certain amount of correct analysis, but given that it is a Barjatya film, I think it has been significantly reduced compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH. HSSH was almost intolerable in some places to watch. <br /> <br /> In this movie, when sentimental moments come, you will find yourself smiling, hoping that the budding couple would be the best and hoping that nothing will happen to them. Another great plus point is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both have worked very well, especially Shahid, who looks good in the movie. Amrita just looks stunning and should be taken seriously in the future as big stars. <br /> <br /> Although I really enjoyed the movie as a whole, I feel it was too long. Some could have been cut in the middle, and it could be even more affected. I also think of music, although it fits the film, when you see that the situations are a bit outdated and the film would have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack had been available. While shooting Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein songs is wonderful. <br /> <br /> First of all, I definitely recommend this movie, its romantic, stunning and dramatic climax. just in case you haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> PS.
