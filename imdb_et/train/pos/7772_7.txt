October 24, 1955, Hadley Oil Company Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) Heavy Work Geologist meets New York-based boss Bill Ryan's office with Executive Secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) with the son. During the meeting he admits that they had traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the reckless desire of Kyle, his best friend from childhood, to eat sandwiches from the club 21, and the meeting was just an excuse for Kyle's father, Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith) . Mitch and Kyle fall in love with Lucy, and Kyle uses his money to impress Lucy. then he opens his heart and makes a proposal to Lucy. They marry and travel to Acapulco and the insecure Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is a simple woman and has an unanswered number for Mitch who sees her as a sister. A year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and can be sterile and start drinking again. Jealous Marylee is poisoning Kyle to say that her husband and Mitch are a love affair. When Lucy finds she is pregnant, Kyle believes that the child belongs to Mitch and his distrust leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written Wind" is an overestimated melodramatic soap opera with artificial characters and situations. There are at least two big films with the drinking problems of the characters: "The Lost Weekend" (1945), with amazing Ray Milland and "Wines and Roses Days" (1962), with excellent performance by Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has reasonable performance and his motifs for drinking are low and clich√©. Finally, the forgotten "Written Wind" is only entertaining and never an Oscar candidate. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
