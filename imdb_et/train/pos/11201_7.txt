Surprisingly good Alfred Hitchcock's early effort. One of the only scenarios written by Hitchcock itself is a very remarkable film. It bounces off a spooky boxing game, where the carnival champion "One Round" Jack loses the challenge of a professional who is a professional prize. The film is slowed down by the development of characters and the introduction of the love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and professional boxer. The rest of the film represents a dramatic accumulation of relocation between two men, this time with a heavy crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for sensible cinematography and advocacy. The men's boxer-bought wristband continues the film as a symbol of his loyalty. The only major obstacle to this film is that the art of filming a boxing game was not perfect in 1927. Ultimately, the result will be somewhat anticlimactic. The story is what carries this movie.
