"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong movies I've ever seen. It's a brilliant blend of fantastic, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film has some great visual and amazing struggles. I especially love the struggle between the scene of Wu Ma and the daemon language of the tree. A truly original and refreshing film, and another Embalmer good suggestion.
