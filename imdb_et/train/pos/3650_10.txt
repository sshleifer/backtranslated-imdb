Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I had originally made and copied the VHS tape of this great TV show. I was heartily broken when I realized what I was doing because I didn't get a copy of it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Recently I ordered a digital cable and searched for upcoming films to my surprise was the film's planned show. This time I made a copy of it on the DVD so there is no error again. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was able to watch it again after eight years and it was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. This story is a bit of a forerunner that my first contact with the "Pandora Clock" came from reading a book on the public radio in real time. I just happened to tune my broadcaster home for lunch, and the first part was hooked. Every day I was waiting for the next chapter to read. <br /> <br /> When I learned a few months later that a book was being broadcasted on television, I definitely made the schedule for this event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the movie was very correct for the book, contrary to what the other reviewer said. This in itself is a rare achievement for TV films. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about casting. I couldn't imagine a better choice for Captain Netherlands than Richard Dean Anderson. In the literal sense, the film could have collapsed and burned without the pain of its central role. Anderson has never been better, and it is a shame that we have never seen him. In fact, all the cast members did a great job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film - and with the book - was the intervention of a terrorist attack that a private commercial plane was holding air-to-air missiles and his pilot arm and fired under a blow. Basically, we talk about it in less than 36 hours to organize and implement such a plan as it is, and people who are not at all realistic considering all involved players. It was also unrealistic to see how little the plane was affected by the first, then the two were blown out of the engine. <br /> <br /> This bovine meat left me in a pleasant building and found it very plausible how foreign governments were portrayed both in the film and by us. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it by all means.
