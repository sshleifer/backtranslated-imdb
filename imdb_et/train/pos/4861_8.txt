Joan Fontaine is in the 1937 musical "Damsel in Distress", where Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen play. The plot that is there is a British woman (Fontaine), who is in love with Americans who have been mistaken for Astaire, a musical comedy star. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some of the wonderful music of Gershwin, including "The Job of Nice when You Get It" and the "Misty Day". The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number that takes place in a fun house. <br /> <br /> The voice of Astaire's song sounds stronger in this movie than others, and has a couple of good dance numbers. Burns plays with his superior audience and Allen is Secretary of Burns. He's fun. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the movie. Stevens would have easily used a double, because he shows a dance with a long stroke and it takes place among the trees. I would have thought it was double except dancing was so bad. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing despite your mistakes.
