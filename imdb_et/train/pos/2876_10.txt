The Cinderella Story is one of my favorites from Charles Perrault with Sleeping Beauty, which also became a Disney movie in 1959; this movie is a Disney's sweet, enchanting masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film has a great soundtrack; this is a nice movie for me is a very good soundtrack and I also love songs; my favorite song is romantic "So it's love". I also love the movie with the mice, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the story, the little birds trying to wake up Cinderella in the morning; I also love it when Cinderella's friends (mice and birds) fix Cinderella to give birth to her mother's dress so she can go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia beat it on bits, b **** es!
