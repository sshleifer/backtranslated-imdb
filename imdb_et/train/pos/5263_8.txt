Netflix should mention this short feature of silk tights. It is a highly fluffy fluff that is much better. It was much better for Cole Porter's songs and much more energy. Silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment. Fred got too old for such a thing, though dances and Cyd are beautiful. I look at the version of Ninotchka Garbo-Melvyn Douglas. Is Silk socks Peter Lorre sick - does he seem to be very passive with more active numbers and less lines? Very pleased to have run Paree - Paree through a clean accident. The whole experience is much more enjoyable. Bob Hope, the simple "song and dance man" is pure joy.
