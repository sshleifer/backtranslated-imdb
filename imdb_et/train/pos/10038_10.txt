Titanic must be one of my favorite films of all time. It has its own problems (which films are not), but still enjoyable. <br /> <br /> If I stumble upon someone asking me why I like Titanic, I think my first reaction is "wait, don't you?" "I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I can't see why." The love story is too cheesy ", yes, but is it not enjoyable and moving? Good, Jack and Rose ' i love story is very unreal, everyone knows that this love does not really exist, but this is a movie, can not everyone look at a beautiful story that allows us to slip into fantasy for some time? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet, are terrible actors. , OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not fulfill their full potential, but I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors.I personally think they are both very talented actors who, unfortunately, are very famous for the movie, What they are not surprising is that I agree with many people that they didn't do as well as they could have expected, and finally, if someone complains that they don't like this film because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies, then I do it is a pity, but why did they go on earth and see a movie that is so clearly all these things. It's like people who complain. Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Just to be a movie, not because you don't like the genre, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Well deserves his oscare, especially the best cinematography, which I think is the best I've ever seen in the movie to see if the Lord of the Rings might be trilogy. The repetition of the story can be quite weak from time to time, but in general it is an amazing achievement if Titanic is so real and the sinking seems so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people do not like this film, but most often they don't like the basic idea of ​​being a love story, not their thinking about film and itself is poorly constructed. <br /> <br /> Tell you that I've read more than five books about Titanic, including the memories that made up the day it happened, and that this movie is very historically accurate, recording just a few bugs. The only thing I find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel and the iceberg seems quite unrealistic, as is the scene where they hit it. <br /> <br /> I am going to give this film to 10/10, not because I like to shoot romance, but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement.
