Imagine Richard, the painter of the painter whose real passion is driving. When we come into contact with him for the first time, he will be seen in a London building with his home wings. He has hanged his canvas and other work at his despair and pervades a flying device to his jump. If he gets into police custody, he will not suffer from scratch, but he will let him in front of a judge who orders him to do social work. Richard, whose relationship with Anne probably ended badly, decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds the country has a place in a large barn that he intends to use to build his own aircraft. <br /> <br /> Richard comes to try to help Jane with Harchard reluctantly. She is a young woman suffering from A.L.S. or Lou Gehrig's disease and is restricted to a motorized wheelchair. Jane is extremely intelligent but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary. He sometimes uses a hand-held device to talk, because his speech is not clear. What Jane loves to do is to lose her innocence at all costs. Jane and Richard meet when they meet, but mutual tolerance makes them comfortable with each other. <br /> <br /> Jane, who watches porn on her computer, has been thinking of finding someone like Richard Gere in "American Gigolo" who is sex with her for a fee. When Richard takes him to London, they find the right person for that. His fee is excessive, but they agree. Because they don't have the money, Richard decides to rob a big bank. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned when Jane realizes she can't go through what she wanted. Eventually, Richard Jane takes his voyage to drive his hard-built plane that brings them closer as they find affinity with each other. <br /> <br /> Peter Greengrass directed this peculiar film, which is an unusual situation. Jane is probably not in the mainstream movies of the romantic heroine, and yet she has a sweet aura about her that is not difficult for her to know and what she is trying to achieve. Mr. Greengrass shows the affinity for the film Richar Hawkins. The film does not try to be cute or give a rosy image of a young woman being treated for illness. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason for watching a movie. She does a wonderful Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh does not seem to be well suited for this type of comedy. Somehow he has trouble interpreting Richard. Gemma Jones has some good moments like Anne, Richard's former love. <br /> <br /> "Flight Theory" shows a good director. No doubt Peter Greengrass goes to bigger and better things.
