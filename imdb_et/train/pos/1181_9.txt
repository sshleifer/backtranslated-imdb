Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award-winning short film. The heart is a warm story of coping with sorrow and keeping those memories that we have loved and lost. Although only 15 minutes long, Griffiths can capture so much emotion and truth in a short time. Bud Tingwell gives a touching statement as Will, a widow who fights his wife's death. He faces loneliness and helpless harshness when he takes care of Ruth's pets, the Tulips. The film shows grief and responsibility to those they have loved and lost. Good cinematography, great direction and great action. It brings tears to all those who have lost their loved one and lived.
