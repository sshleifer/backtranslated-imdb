I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where he got stuck! This film tells a story that I have never said before - the Rosenstrasse (Berlin Street) uprising about German refugee women who were married to Jews at the end of World War II. So this is a unique story, and this is the only movie about the Holocaust I've ever seen, which shows that the good Germans (for example, Anne Frank's helping family was a Dutchman) who didn't support the Nazis, and actually had the belief in the immorality of their country and against cruelty during the Nazi regime, their lives were in danger. The action is great all over New York, which is an exciting and challenging story in New York, the Von Trotta championship in every scene and production values, including outstanding cinematography. Of course, the New York family could speak German. Many immigrants living in this country decide to talk to their family in their mother tongue - it's common. So criticism is unfounded. To put it more, it would break the experience. The movie is long but I didn't watch my watch once. I hope this film is divided into North America, because not only this film is a masterpiece, but it can actually help to cure any hostility that people have against Germans because of Hitler's support. If this movie is playing in your area, HOW WE ARE ATTENTION! You're glad you did!
