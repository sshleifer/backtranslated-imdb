Like romantic comedies, it was lovely and won. I thought writing might have been stronger to make the last connection a little better, but it's not a huge breakpoint. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf make a beautiful show and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors and I was just glad to see them as romantic. I hope we will see them soon in more projects. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie does not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and won. Not at all bad.
