I saw this cable in the early 90s and loved it. Never saw it again until it appeared recently on the cable. Still find this great Vietnamese movie. Not sure why it's not higher. I found all that convincing about this movie. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam), I can relate to the situations presented by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is now harder for our situation in Iraq. I would like this cable to be offered more often so that people can see it. The human tax of our soldiers is not on the battlefield. It brought home the rest of his life. And this movie is one of many that brings this home very hard. Great movie.
