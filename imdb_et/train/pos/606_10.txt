I've seen a lot of Saura movies and have always found an amazing way to put together music, dance, drama and great cinema in her movies. Iberia shows even better Saura, which deals with multimedia concepts and a more modern dance and music concept. Another thing that has attracted my attention is that in this film, dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important: the camera shows different aspects of interpreting music, not only examining technical issues, but also emotional gaming experience. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is another ingredient that makes this film the most aesthetic of her other works. That's why I strongly recommend it to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.
