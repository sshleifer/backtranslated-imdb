Man, some of you, of whom you have to. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for justifications or messages to justify it in your reality, why don't you understand that it's fiction? Story. Entertainment, for God's sake (not intended). It seems to me that too many people here are trying to be filmmakers - and they don't do it well. Under the direction of the film and Bill Paxton, I am so impressed that I contact him personally to tell him. You know, if you didn't try to analyze the hell story, you can just enjoy the movie. I and all my friends did!
