I rented this movie when it appeared on the videocassette and really liked it. I was able to buy it on a DVD a few weeks ago and since then I have been watching it several times. I should agree with others when they said the Indian summer was a nostalgic film. If I look at it, I'd like to have another 10-14. I think this is why we all like the film to some extent. We all want us to live our lives as adults with wisdom / knowledge. Wouldn't it be nice if all your friends / parents were young again? You don't have to worry about your job, being a parent, etc. I know I'd like to jump into De Lorean and go back in time. Although I enjoyed the movie very much all the time at my favorite movie, there are still meatballs with Bill Murray. I wish they could make this summer version of India.
