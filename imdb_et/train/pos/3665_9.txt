They did it. And boy, did they do it fantastically or what! The BBC finally brought the doctor back to our screen on Saturday night, where he belongs! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: "Rose" - One of the strengths of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and CEO. He is a fan of the play and knows what other fans want, but is also an experienced writer himself, so other people know. Another strength, as perfectly demonstrated here in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her character Rose Tyler. Finally, a doctor's companion can get a reliable back story and a strong character. It's also nice to see the return of the cars - a nice joke for the Classic Series. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWO: "End of the World" - at the beginning of this double-bill to show off the strengths of TARDIS, we'll get a story where special effects are all! Now they have the technology to create real, credible environments and monsters. Also at the end of this episode, the hints of a new doctor's past - very intriguing to kill all Time Lords and make him the only one. <br /> <br /> EPISODE THREE: "The impatient dead" - we were the future, now we have a past. The first episode written by non-Davies is a bit flat in some places, but it is made by Simon Callow by Charles Dickens and a sudden twist on the plot when it turns out that evil Gelf is not so pathetic ... br /> <br /> EPISODE FOUR: " London Foreigners "- The consequences of the doctors' activities in this series have been fully explored. We also have our first clinic; not the best of them. Slitheen is an interesting villain, although they can look too good for CGI. <br /> <br /> EPISODE FIVE: "The Third World War" - The second part of this story, Slitheen, mainly carries the same problems from the first. Also, at the end of the current episode, the clips of the next episode will disturb and violate people. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SIX: "Dalek" - Yes! We have had the future, the past and the present (ish), but now we get back to good things - the doctor's archive. I think we can complement Christopher Ecclestone - he was great as a doctor, and no longer in the episode where we see pain in his face when he remembers the war of time and his foreign nature when he almost turns into Dalek himself. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SEVEN: "Long game" - really just a story that works as a series finale prologue. Saved by Simon Pegg as a fragrant editor and Tamsin Grieg with a fun coming. The media controls us - it's never been done before, it's ... <br /> <br /> EPISODE EIGHT: "Father's Day" - this is a great episode. Perfect for the emotions and heartbreak of people at Rose and the real consequences of what happens when you really capture history. Billie Piper has complete signs here. <br /> <br /> EPISODE NINE: "Blank child" - I can't find this boy very scary. I'm sorry, but I don't. However, this is a good episode, but the rocker was still better - it is the "Next Time" bits that break them. John Barrowman is introduced here as Captain Jack, a disgraceful communal - he is a good actor who has been around for a while, but only seemingly noticed. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TEN: "Doctor Dances" - Its Second Part of WW2 Story - Well done in the historical context. A nice fabulous ending, though a bit confusing for younger viewers when "mommy" appears? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest in the series, but that doesn't mean it's bad. A nice return to Slitheen and an interesting medical and rose study. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - it starts with a rather foolish, pleasantly humorous humor and funny fun. in popular TV shows over Blighty's. But things are getting deadly seriously and finally the revelation is the best kliffirent in the series! <br /> <br /> EPISODE THRITEEN: "Leaving the Chances" - say goodbye to Christopher Ecclestone. A fantastic doctor in so many ways, David Tennant really needs to develop his socks to be as good as him. After all, the regeneration scene is beautifully played. Oh, and the songs are back - extreme! God blesses CGI because they can't pull it at all! <br /> <br /> Generally - brilliant! 9/10
