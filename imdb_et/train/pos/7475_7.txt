After some rather negative views on this movie, I wasn't sure if I would have to pay for renting it. But it was a pleasant surprise. I haven't seen the original movie, but if it were better, I'd be in the sky. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a strong result as a seemingly unstable David, convincing me he is more than a smile on his feet (only for the third time in his career were other examples of Magnolia and born in the fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is lightweight but fulfills the demands of her role as Diaz. The only disappointment is slightly Kand Russell. However, the film does not do the thing that really impresses - its film making. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe faces the role of director by offering himself a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. Crowe perfectly fills the growing madness of the film (a short sequence where Cruise walks through an empty time field is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (the specificity of the Crowe movie) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You are shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot seems to be a bit busy, but the issues behind it are endlessly debated. The film is not perfect, but the change in this welcome pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those who have been bred with Hollywood luster should be a revelation.
