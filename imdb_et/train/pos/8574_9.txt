This film works for both adults and children. This movie works on several levels: everything from car punishment to cake to some very good (yet subtle) fun adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is his sublimely evil best than Cruella ("Call Ella") to De Ville. even the puppy skin fur he had so intensely wanted. He even has all of his furs placed in the cave of an emergency castle where he lives. <br /> <br /> But it wouldn't be a "Dalmatian" movie without Cruell and no poisoning, and you know something will change its behavior. And now he needs another puppy (so 102 dalmatians) to finish his unpleasant scheme at that time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is immediately tempting as the hero of Second Chance Dog Shelters. Although he had "great expectations" in "Titanic" and last year's television version (Pip), I didn't recognize him; well, he was the fifth official at Lowe '' Titanic 'and I didn't see "great expectations" so I'm not terribly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is making a delightful move like a Cruell fur. She prance and postures the most outlandish and outrageous fur garments you've ever seen? and do it well. His "Wicked Witch of the West" tribute is fun. he was also Alonzo, 'Cruella butcher,' 101 dalmatians', and you can recognize him from all the "black allies" Brit-Coms. He plays his usual worship, with a good heart, with a somewhat dull effect. <br /> <br /> Oscars for costuming is generally given for the entire costume in the movie. This is unfortunate because Glenn Close's clothing is amazing? it is incredibly detailed (note his handcuffs when he gets rid of the behavioral modification clinic) and is worthy of the character of such supremacy. His clothes alone deserve at least the Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation has a special place in my heart? but comparing this movie to the original animation is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. Suffice it to say that "102 Dalmatians" are even better than the version of "101 Dalmatians" published in 1996. Here's a lot of fun: from sightings, dialogue and costumes to casting - it's a good movie for the whole family.
