For me, this picture is very high because it is a very enjoyable and amusing alien who takes over the city and many of his men. <br /> <br /> All cities and players are all in the style of the 1950s and the entire film has a deliberate sticky and kitschy feeling. Some scenes are fun like alien creatures. <br /> <br /> All actors give full blood and serious performances that make the movie even more fun and special effects and aliens at least seem to me deliberately 3rd speed, which adds entertainment. <br /> <br /> These types of films often deserve a cult: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
