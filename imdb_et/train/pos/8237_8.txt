Why did this film get R-Class for me?! While it's about meat eating zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good family-friendly movie - at least if your kids are over 10 years old. Unlike traditional zombie movies, it has a good sense of humor and traditional values ​​- though a little twisted! The language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity, and the film style is definitely the kids (like the old television show "Eerie, Indiana"), but some rapper created the R-class! Believe me, most children have seen inferior violence and it just seems silly that the audience thinks it's just an adult movie. <br /> <br /> The story is parallel to the world. Though fashion, cars and mores appear in 1953, this bizarre world has had a fierce recent zombie plague resulting in a "zombie war" and huge changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed struggle and the film is late at the scene where the father gives his son a pistol and tells him to keep it in his backpack "just in case"! As far as life outside school is concerned, it is also strange because people have now learned that zombies are not so bad! Heck, using shock collars and workouts, can be made for slaves who can do their housework, clean the streets, deliver milk, or be a "special friend" for a really sick boy. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with one particular family who finally buys his first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is excited and her son is slowly becoming a zombie friend. The father, on the other hand, is not convinced - because he was forced to kill his zombie father for years and he has not yet received it! Funny, indecent and unique - this movie must be viewed by a much wider audience.
