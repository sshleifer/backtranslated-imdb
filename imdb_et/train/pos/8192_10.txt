This two piece was great - the best since the series was returned. Of course, the story is hidden from the previous movies, but which TV shows do not do these days. What we had here was a good sci-fi story. A great big (really frightening) monster imprisoned on a deep well, some great aliens The Oodis - the best "new" aliens for whom the revived series has come out, mostly sympathetic and credible human characters (with a couple of unnamed "spending" security people really Star Treki in fashion), some great philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some top-notch special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved it every minute.
