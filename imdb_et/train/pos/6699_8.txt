When Sabrina first came on our screen, I had about 12 years and so I spent years with my teenagers observing teenage sorcerers in all strange situations. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite programs, the nervous feeling of the sevcom's sitcom "Bewitched", but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. He was also friendly and simple, which made him enjoyable viewing. At first the characters were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, Quiz, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal fame, shame that he left so early) Hilda and Zelda's aunts started OK, but then they became irritating. <br /> <br /> I also liked Kraft because he was always so little closer to discovering Sabrina's secret. What I loved about the first three series was the original ideas, the discovery of family secrets, and the learning of new faces, but as it went, it became more predictable. Too many signs came and left, like Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and then they decided to do it at Sabrina College, which destroyed it for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was absorbed by college, had less magic, no spelling book, no aunt with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were not annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring and I was just looking at what finally happened. The lack of Hilda and Zelda seemed wrong and Miles was just like that. The last episode made me feel much better (SPOILER) who had Sabrina on his wedding day with Harvey that Aaron was great! In general, it's a great program to forget the poor two or three series that reminded me of so many teenage shows. Magical.
