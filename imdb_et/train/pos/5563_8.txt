The opening sequence alone is the cost of the paid entrance, because Cheech and Chong drag the garbage of this large household over the car filled with gas. "Don't pour this man!", Funny things. And when the "plot" comes up, you're for one soldier. I recently watched this movie and it keeps up the same fun every time I watch. Look at it.
