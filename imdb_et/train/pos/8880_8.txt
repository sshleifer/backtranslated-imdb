Life in (some) college. Of course, artistic licenses have been made, but some of this film was seen in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to southern California colleges, where races are pretty much alone. It's funny because they are schools that want racial unity, equality, etc. and I can honestly say it's there. But the thing is, if the class releases or if they just wait for the class, they (students) just stand out with their race or people of ethnic origin. Is it bad? Not quite. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But as with one school school paper, I wrote this once: "We should all try to hang with other nationalities and try to feel them." Otherwise, you create your segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed in one of the schools I attended. Once upon a time, someone around the campus had leaflets that spoke of Aryan Race's glory and had some of the symbols of their racist organizations. Fortunately, there was nothing like this in a movie where young Caucasian men went down and started collecting multiculturalism. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing will happen. <Br /> <br /> So "higher education" is too dramatic? Exaggerated? Maybe. Is it "off mark?" It depends on where you went or went to school. Race thing, where ethnic groups are just hanging on their own, happens. Minus the Hollywood exaggeration, the race thing hit me pretty home.
