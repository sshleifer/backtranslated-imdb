Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland can be someone except Lynch, and that makes it a funny and collective comic. Violent? Yes, yes. Dreadful? Yes, yes. Absurd? Yes, yes. One garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful image of some Americans who have no trouble and no children for the brain and fun. From Mexico City I can say that I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1 - My teeth are bleeding, all the noise and violence make me scream and put me behind the bed. 2. Take it! Yes baby get and learn lesson: some people are never thankful for your actions. 3 - Ants. The more the Lynch episode all, music, surrealism and very sweet revenge ...
