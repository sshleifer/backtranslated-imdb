Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of this time, made films full of beautiful scenes, gentle love and respect for everything that is valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, when people should hear about it, they associate the name Marischka with the INSIDE trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957). However, he made other great films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and certainly MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN, which showed Queen Victoria's youth for years. Although it touches a little bit on the subject of INSIDE movies, I do not see much difference between this film and the ONE. They are very similar. <br /> <br /> The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the team is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> Cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was a lovely introduction to his guerrilla role, as this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy of the Austrian Empire. It's also a movie where Romy plays with her mother Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to play Romy with her mother. Romy's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was also her performance with her mother. Therefore, there were some voices that Romy began with his Austrian career as a mother. Indeed, it is the truth. <br /> <br /> Like SISSI, this movie shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small inn in Dover. Their compassion is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. And now...? What would it look like? Only sex ... But is this the only thing love is based on? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call them a goat, but I never admire those films. They are impressive !!! BEYOND, DEFINED!
