John Singleton's best film before he wanted to break up, like Shaft's remake, is a thought-provoking film that has roughly excellent actions and a great balance between the 3 main characters of the story, each with identifiable young problems. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most is that it also covers the problem of young black selfishness, a problem that is mostly ignored by the media and other films, mainly focusing on socio-economic problems and white-matter racism. This movie shows that blacks can be equally unknown and racist. The masterful thing about this movie is that it deals with so many topics without being low. It does not only concern racism, but also how difficult it is to adopt a new world (college), rape, discovery and isolation of sexuality. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson give everyone great performances and supportive casting is just as interesting as Jennifer Connelly's lez (yay) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes college booms that cause little unrest. <br /> <br /> The only negative is Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?") Professor's Caricature. There are certainly many professors nutty. But they're not that flat. Skinheads are also some caricatures, but I think they are similar in real life. <br /> <br /> Generally, this great underrated film has been a good thing if you liked American History X, which you love it <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
