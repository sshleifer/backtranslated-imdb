This is the most compelling and excellent force that Robert Taylor ever gave. He even surpasses his excellent performance as "Johnny Eager" who arrives 14 years after this movie. His appearance is still a miracle, but he has the maturity that gives him the edge of this violent violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is his last breed, buffalo hunter who kills not for money but for joy. His wild eye killing not only for buffaloes but for people is wonderful to watch. Basically, he is a lonely man who needs people around him but doesn't like him because of sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is hunting for the sick and is just passing because he is something else. Along the way, Charlie kills the Indians family and hits the beautiful Debra pagan. Charlie tries to seduce her but sees Sandy interested in her. Granger is a little sad to look at, so he's tired of hunting, longing for a girl and his baby. Lloyd Nolan as a drunken skinner is wonderful in playing his clever cracks and chords. Russ Tamblyn plays half the breed who is trying to fit in the white world. The group is a strange mixture of good and evil, young and old. Finally, Taylor, like many hunters before him, learns from the buffalo and runs off leaving Sandy with the girl. On return, this evening leaves with Sandy's wife, putting Charlie out of rape to get Sandy and become a girl. The final confrontation is a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. This is Taylor's movie all the time and he was a really much underrated actress.
