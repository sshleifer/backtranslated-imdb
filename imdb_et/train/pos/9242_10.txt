It is difficult to evaluate such films because you value it in production or just in fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie around 1988/89 or as I was a boy and I am sorry to say that he started a lifetime charm with ninjas. The plot is quite terrible and the actor is naturally terrible, but in this film the mystery surrounding the ninjas makes a good atmosphere. It is important that the scenes in the fight, though “little”, are really good. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it was better than I was a boy, but now I can see the pointless points of the incredible mess. In the movie, however, when "sit with some beer" in a martial arts movie that I can't eat, it gives and is much better than the "American Ninja" style garbage mountains, which in the 80s were hundreds of black suits boys, but really not very good in combat. <br /> <br /> An interesting note, Dura Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers, made another ninja movie under the flag of "Bonaire" "White Phantom" I have no idea whether it was to be a Sakura Killers sequel, but Sakura clan is again, one of the main features, including the same logo and similar story only at that time, including the White Ninja, was a little atmospheric feeling, but the fighting scenes are even narrower and fairer, are quite terrible. <br /> <br /> So if you you're a martial arts fan, let him kill for a few hours!
