and laugh out loud funny in many scenes. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the movie is well crowned, the story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best movie of Lemmon and Matheau as its co-stars, and the sloppy relationship between the Oscar and OCD Felix is ​​classic. <br /> <br /> The scene where Oscar reaches the double date will leave the room briefly and come back to find Felix and two girls all crying is pricelessly funny. <br /> <br /> For any fan of smart comedies, an odd couple will "go their way to see it".
