I've seen tons of HK makers and it's at the top of the genre. Active scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action film. Kung fu is prominent, pyrotechnic striking, stunt works from the heart. Editing is perfect, boosting the tension and completing the work of the fluid camera. The director of this film is the old Prof. Corey Yuen, whose continuation is filled with the best works of the genre, including the Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk of the Jet Li vehicle. If there is no one thing in this film, it is closest to the existence of a three-dimensional character, though Martin, the man's leader. This film is full of archetypes rather than characters - sexy killer, silly thief and his female girlfriend. That means Shannon Lee is a terrible screen; He is great in fighting, stunts and weapons. When she's on the screen, it's hard to take her eyes off. He's good. Why isn't this woman a big star?
