If you are a fan, you will probably enjoy it. If you don't know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema are, then this is not a movie to start with. It's very cute, silly, girls are hot and fun to watch. There is no sex until the end of the 45-minute movie, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot is not general. Misty Mundae's makeup in this movie is bad and her hair is uncomfortable braids so she's not as hot as the others. But her panties in this are pretty cute (you just have to look at the movie so it doesn't sound really strange). If you like it, you will probably enjoy this "70s girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit sexier graphic). If you want to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, horror / exploitable (but lower budget) movies, check out Factory 2000 Web site.
