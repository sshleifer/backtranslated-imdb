The second time I watch this movie, I like it even more than the first time. It is full of nuances and understanding of life as a fairly common and often frightening, but what elevates this film to an unmistakable height focuses little on the frequency of our lives, with which we usually only offer shorter attention. Here comes a film to mark these cases, at a meeting between a tow truck driver and a client who runs from a baby to a bush. Dialogue, action, pain and direction are excellent. None of the four in four, great revelations. I noticed that the real characters were their essential qualities and how their lives rose when they were celebrated. We need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives for everyone involved. 9 out of 10
