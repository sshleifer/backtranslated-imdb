This is a surprisingly effective thriller. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle "Ensign Ro" Forbes are successful, professional couples, writer, photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California, and in a compromise message, Mulder agrees to move on, provided they visit historical sites of interest related to famous sera killers. His idea: he writes words, takes pictures, ultimately the most sold coffee table that puts them in life. To finance the trip, they decide to share and advertise cars. Because their bad luck would be, Brad Pitt sees this ad, and shortly after his landlord's killing, he and his girlfriend Juliette Lewis meet a writer couple and start their own traveling. There will inevitably be annoyance. Pitt is outstanding as a genuinely chill-inspiring early gray, and Lewis is capable of supporting it with its usual white trash bin, which seems to be its default setting. Duchovny and Forbes are also a convincing double act, and because of the spiral of events, you are being sucked into their difficult situation as spectators and can be tortured. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, embarrassing and beautifully shot, it deserves recognition beyond the current status. Top movie.
