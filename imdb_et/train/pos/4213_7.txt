Director Samuel Fuller sets an excellent visual design: a turbulent pocket involuntarily lifts a microfilm into a woman's wallet; it turns out he is a communist courier, and now he is being monitored by the police. The film Noir Formula has all its glory - before the ingredients become cliche - including the location of the water area, floosies, saxophone soundtracks and one of the hell's climatic fistfight. The performances of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are the right target and the smart, sharp script is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received the Oscar nomination for a "professional stoolie" role. Exciting, atmospheric, tough like nails. *** from ****
