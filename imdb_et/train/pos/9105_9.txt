Women are never as attractive and pathetic as the Salazar movie Piedras. Although the editor has cut here and can help with the film, it is exciting and enjoyable with the intense sign of the latest films by Pedro Almodovar. 5 different women are engaged with male partners and families. Starting with a number of different from the northwest, which is bound to meet, Salrasar's portrait of her women is characterized by the same neurotic and borderline behaviors that are familiar to Almodovar. Lady of Kleptomania, who is fattened for smaller shoes, a burlesque house who took care of her disabled daughter, a dancer of drug addicts, obsessed with her ex-boyfriend and taxi driver, who took care of her late-disturbed children. Well-designed scenes in Madrid. Using some of Almodovar's familiar actor, the director in his first film manages to give depth to all the characters that share the movie and to create true compassion for everyone. Women control the plot line and the men end up with each other ... Surprisingly good for the first movie and worth the time in any standard. It is noticeable that Salazar hesitated the actors in some necessary instructions, but there is still an invisible action on the screen, especially Monica Cervera, who played in her former short film. <br /> <br /> Black for all Almodovar fans and enjoyable for everyone.
