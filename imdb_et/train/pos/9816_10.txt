Speed ​​is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the film and partly fit! It's hard to believe it's a real story, but what can you do? When I watched it, I wondered why they had to do all these things. It's not right, but they learned their lesson when they chose the wrong person! Anyway, if you see this movie on TV, check it out because it's good!
