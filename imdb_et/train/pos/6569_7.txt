"Jake Speed" is a great movie with a great message. This, of course, has its drawbacks. Sometimes it's a bit slow. It introduces your cable too far into the story. Its action is a stamp at the heart rate of the snail. It is a Z-class cast (although I have always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who has a straightforward appearance by Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But all this, "Jake Speed ​​is really inspiring thanks to Wayne Crawford's charming script (who plays the role of title) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I find That's so inspiring? Because it tells me, "Hey, why not try to be a good person." <br /> <br /> The story is basically a "strange strange land", a good and heroic Jake's speed. Jake is more than a knight's shiny armor, she's more than a knight's shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is a patience for optimism in the black, medium and evil world. <br /> <br /> That's why it was " Jake Speed ​​really needs to be hit. It has a great message that should have come to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a movie industry that really brought you a good and decent person. we should look at Walton in every cineplex in the theater, but it would be nice if we were too much em movies like "Jake Speed" would be an opportunity. ("Due South", a TV show in Canada's Mountie, is a good comparison to light up American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Of course, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and weapons, but the general message is that when you try good enough to be a good person, every time you beat the evil forces. 10/14/99
