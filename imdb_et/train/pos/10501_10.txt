Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the biggest ever created game. It's so addicting that you could play it for hours on end without pausing. I have to beat the game 4 times, but I've never got 120 stars ... (I've got 111) ... but I hope they will finally be achieved. Although I didn't play this game officially before I was seven, I loved that my sisters played it. Now I am 13 years old and I still play it by deleting games and starting again. <br /> <br /> Graphics are incredible at the beginning of N64. The game is addictive. Control is great. The levels are tough but not impossible. Bowser's struggles are complex. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why can't you do it yourself? Put the X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii away and go to Nintendo 64 and play this wonderful, wonderful game.
