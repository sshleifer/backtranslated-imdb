This is such a cool fantasy movie. One of my faves, it's really so cool. Directed by Bernard Rose, who led Candyman, he made this film a great start. <br /> <br /> A movie about a girl called Anna who gets sick of glandular fever on her 11th birthday. She pulls her book into a piece of paper house and falls into a dream where the house is real. Every subsequent dream he has made will change what he adds to the picture. In her third dream she meets a boy whom he thinks he has created Mark. He communicates with him and their relationship becomes stronger when dreams become darker and more frightening. Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is a terrible actor and it is very strange that after one movie she should disappear and never be again. He really gives a great result in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is also an ace. Like Broken Arrow, music is strange and mysterious. It's a real shame that the audio track is no longer available on the CD. The DVD is only available in R2.
