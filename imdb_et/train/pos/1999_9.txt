Oliver! musical is my favorite. Music, characters, story. It all seems perfect. Directed by this timeless classical novel, director Carol Reed brings Broadway to life on the screen. <br /> <br /> The transition from musical musical music is not easy. You must have the correct votes, the right set, the right script and the right game. All the characters refer to this game for hunting. It almost seems like it was written on the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in a joyful England, where a boy named Oliver manages to get out of the orphanage. He runs through the country to London where he meets a group of young criminals headed by Dodger, a clever, quick-handed pocket. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an older companion who sells all stolen goods. But not everything in London is good when Bill Sykes played Oliver, Fagin and his young troops and law with Oliver Reed and his loving friend Nancy. What it means is a wonderful story of love, affection and great musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you like musicals or not, listen to these stories and you worship them all day. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art.
