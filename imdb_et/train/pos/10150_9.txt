Of course, this movie is delicate and sweet and full of clich√©s, but it's fun and I watch movies. Entertaining. Natasha Henstridge is stunning even with short hair. His smile is bright and his beauty cannot be hidden. As for Michael Vartan, I am sure that women love him. Two of them seemed like a movie like eacb. I don't understand the comments that there were no chemistry between them. I think we can see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch, even if the d'Abo British accent didn't climb on his supposed Bronx speech. In fact, I didn't say it until I read these comments, but I went back to the DVD and now my dialogue is more British than American, but he was perfect for his role with one exception. <br /> <br /> This is a story of two nice people who marry important others, but who find their soul mates with each other. This may be an unlikely story, but who says movies should play like documentaries? It is no longer unrealistic as any drama that is screened on the tube every hour. That's why we look at them, escape from everyday life in a short time and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job, but hey, I'm a sentimental man who tears easily. Don't let me get it wrong, it must be a sentimental scene, and this movie had a lot of them. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 9/10 just because I save my 10/10 for a super cool super movie that I know will come one day. If you see that it is advertised as it appears in a movie or lifetime, or any other way, make a note to see it. I think you like it.
