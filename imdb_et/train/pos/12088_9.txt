Hardcastle and McCormick are a great TV show. Yes, it is predictable much like the Duke of Hazzard, the Hunter, the A team, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This show is just a good clean TV. Relationships between Hardcastle and McCormick are quite fun. Often, they take the Jabits several times with an episode that adds a lot of humor to the show. It includes multiple drives in almost every episode but does not have a good car chase? Especially with Coyote! I just want them to make clean television today, as I highly recommend today!
