I remember it for the first time in the 70's when it was shown on late night television. Fear of hell out of me. But then I was a teenager these days, not so much a scam for movies as I am now. <br /> <br /> CROP (aka DANSE MACABRE) is a great example of the 60s Italian horror genre, with Mario Bava BLACK SUNDAY (1960), LIVING COURSE (aka KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and Mario Caiano NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want a horrible atmosphere with great writing, check them too. I also appreciate them with their early Poe movies that Roger Corman did in the same period. <br /> <br /> I saw a new Synapse DVD, which was taken from a French print and is a great success compared to the old pan-and-scan print that made the round of television over the years. It adds a couple of minutes of dialogue (in French) that doesn't add much to the movie as a whole, but it's nice to see it complete without cuts. Unfortunately, DVD does not actually provide extras beyond the stop of the movie. <br /> <br /> One sign I noticed was in the opening picture, seeing a man with smoke effects next to the camera, which is reflected on the glass. Guest house door. I think the editors didn't get that time, or maybe they don't care, but that's something I didn't notice for the first time. This is a DVD miracle. You'll see all the flutes, bugs, and details that weren't the first phenomena. But regardless of that. <br /> <br /> However, it remains on 7 imdb meters <br /> <br />
