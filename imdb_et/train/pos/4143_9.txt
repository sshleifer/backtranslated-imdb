No, I'm not kidding. If you ever have EVER, you can see this movie. If you need to cut your hand, look at it. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> Fat Times The bus is different from the movies you've ever seen. It takes the trash and raises it to the work of art. Although it contains poor images, idiotic signs, bad dialogue, strange action and cinematography, which belongs to the public of Iowa, it actually succeeds in its film. He's trying to be a dumb, strange, most naughty movie you've ever seen. And the boy can never succeed. <br /> <br /> I put the plot on those who are worried about such things (filmmakers probably did not), but you really do not have to pay too much attention, because the whole plot of the movie is presented in a very long text that is played before the opening credit. In any case, the FDTB (as its admirers call it) is the story of a bus tour through Chicago, led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in the city and all passengers on the bus should die, and all their souls would have gone to hell unless Jesus was in the city, the lack of hell calls the work, and that anger Satan, because Well, he doesn't like him looks like a fool in front of a boy, so he decides to get people on the bus to overwrite his soul directly, but he's a devil so he has to hide himself, otherwise he's right, so he hides himself as Roger and gets on the bus where the driver has never been named, but he's some fat, so I think he's greasy. The bus (and riders) is a crash course with fun! <br /> <br /> Examples of some inconvenience: the title is repeated 3 times on the screen. I do not know why. A character appears on the bus without explanation or introduction, and from time to time sits next to others and they look at him as he does not belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and change the look of longing, which are really the same shots that are repeated over and over again. I do not know why. After Satan gives a minute long monologue to change the human form, the title card flashes "Satan begins to change." I do not know why. One sign is a woman who is obviously a drag-and-drop guy and what other characters call "glamorous Bridget." I don't know why it was. <br /> <br /> When last summer's Tromso practice became a good thing, I got my copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
