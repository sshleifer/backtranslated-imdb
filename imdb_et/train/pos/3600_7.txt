At first glance, I was expecting this film to be dirty because I thought the plot would be so feminist. But I was wrong. As you have read in earlier comments, I agree that the feminist part in this film is not a concern. I had never thought that the protagonist exaggerated his position as a woman. It's like Guzman, if somebody's back, it's the opposite of your classmates. So I was surprised by the story, I really thought it was pretty good, except for the predicted end. Perhaps it would have been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist to make the viewer somewhat surprised. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez earned his respect by putting his character away. I can't really explain why, but especially in love scenes she convinced me. I just saw the real, I thought. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 7 out of 10, only thanks to the boring last half hour.
