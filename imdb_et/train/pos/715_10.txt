All the people who sit here and say that the weak link in this film is Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was ok, if not for this irritating harpsichord. Rock and Roll High School focused on Ramones. How can anyone look at it and not get Joey Ramone's outflow by eating beans on the back, trying to keep him in the state, obviously a damp blanket issi-o. Ms. Trogar, explosive white mice, hall patrols ... an instant classic. The character of Riff Randell does not mean. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Ramones, you don't know the rock role and you don't deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
