"The little mess is now and then spoiled by the smartest men." <br /> <br /> If you're too smart to watch this movie, you're too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Wonderful romp, wonderful space, detailed acute eye. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - that al - just wonderful! <br /> <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. Enjoy yourself. Then, thank me.
