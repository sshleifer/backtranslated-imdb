I'm really shocked to see how many reviews this movie has. This movie wasn't meant to be a "deep thought" movie that most reviewers think it should be. In fact, it seems that if any film does not create a life-changing perception and a deep, twisted, mind-blowing plot, they would appreciate it 1 or 2. Don't leave the movie in the trash because you don't like the genre, the people. <br /> <br /> This movie was a Action / Comedy flick, and it was all about it. And in the case of action / comedy it was very well done. I was actually quite surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a fan of Jamie Foxx, and I had an overpowering plot he had. <br /> <br /> The plot was no wonder, using a typical criminal gets out of jail and thrown into action by trying to get into bad guys (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc. etc.), but it was warmed up by a bit of technological change. Now "bad guys" are actually "good guys" and REAL "bad boy" is uber-geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx plays convincingly humorous, at the same time a rather intelligent and serious protagonist and did not try to exaggerate the humor of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep background image like "Matrix" or drama like "Of Mice and Men, then this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy the raw mind, great fast filming and a random sense of humor, then this movie I would normally have rated it to about 8 (at the same level as Die Hard Trilogy), but I gave it to 10 to try and bring the result up to what it should be. <br /> <br />
