John Travolta, the world's greatest honkeytonk, and a mechanical bull ... what else can you ask! Yes, you probably don't see much surprise or deep meaning. But I've always found that this red neck romance is very enjoyable. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet in Gilley and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you may have for a pair of pairs. Honkeyton's scenes are fun with dance, mechanical horse riding, and of course the required shots. This is a good 1980's soundtrack that includes "Finding Love in Any Wrong Place", "Devil Went Down to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" as my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break your cowboy boots and let your bootie bootie! <br /> <br /> *** (Four)
