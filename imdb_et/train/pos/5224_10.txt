Ayone, who asks how this movie was nonsense or had no plot, had to look for "Jean de Florrette". WELCOME! this film is made for a casual act of comedy and does not in any way shape or shape. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you intend to kick out this movie, they seem to be missing. This film is clearly intended for people who do not know the so-called "American humor", which just seems to me a bunch. The question is everyone's opinion and you should be a little more grateful that some people's sense of humor may not be yours before you take your mouth off. <br /> <br /> Thank you
