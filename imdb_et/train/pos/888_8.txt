One of the best kung fu movies, but not so flawless, as I hoped, when you gave a glowing overview. The film starts well enough, the jokes are visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you think for this era) and make the non-combat dialogue sequences satisfactory (for kung fu, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always pieces of the period or (Jackie Chan Police Story I) police frames, Pedicab Driver gives us an overview of modern rural China. Unfortunately, in the last third of the film, in the third part of the dark melodrama tragedy I thought it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> Action is generally good, including between Sammo and 1/2 Shaw Brothers, only 2 stars, Kar-Leung Lau, and then finally the fight with the higher son who always plays Jet Li's bad guy. Here's just a 20-minute fight that is standard, but what disturbs me is the obvious acceleration of camera frames. I get that they have to shoot half the speed to prevent each other from being injured, but there is smooth editing and then it exists. It really takes away the struggles when it is obvious that the film material was confusing. <br /> <br /> This means that if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here doesn't convince you and if you don't, you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading it.
