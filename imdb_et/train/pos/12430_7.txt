Usually I don't watch movies because they are usually quite similar. There are many stereotypical scenes in this movie, but the assumptions and originality of the film are much easier to see. David Duchovny bent his usual way of doing things, which was good to see. Angelina Jolie was naturally beautiful and worked great. Everything is put together. Must see people who are bored with the same old movie.
