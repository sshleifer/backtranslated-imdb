A shocking, well-made cooler is an underestimated story of a cruel murder and evil power. <br /> <br /> A small town doctor is trying to find out who or who is doing a series of violent sexual murders. <br /> <br /> Incubus is a dense mystery with some terrible murderous traps based on dim and terrible climate change. The scenes of murder are intense and harsh, so it's not a strange movie! The direction of John Hough, along with the odd music score, combines the fear of a dark atmosphere that passes through the film. It also carries some Gothic vibe. It also features a nice shooting location and some stylish camera work. <br /> <br /> Cast is also not bad. Great John Cassavetes does a great job of replacing a new doctor. Also good are the performances by Kerrie Keane as a local reporter, Helen Hughes as a historical journalist and Duncan McIntosh's tortured psychological servant. - discovered and reassessed. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
