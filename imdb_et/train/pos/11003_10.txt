Listen, I don't care what anyone says, because Cypher is nothing more than a 5-star movie. Cypher is not a repetition of B-film. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say that I'm the world's best spy movie expert and this movie is nothing but a topplane. I can't look at how phenomenal this film is. Cypher is one of the best spy films ever created and ever made. The technology of this movie is over space time. Actually, I have to admit that Cypher surprised my hell completely. In fact, I have recommended this film to my colleagues more than any other film. Other critics, some of whom played the movie, have no idea what the hell they are talking about. Don't listen to the hate. And actually Cypher's reviews are mostly positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie, but also a fantastic movie. Cypher is such a film that is so advanced and so well designed that it is in front of most critics and all cynical leaders. There is nothing wrong with Cyprus or it is cheap. Again, cinematography, backgrounds, technology, storyline and actors are 100% world-class excellence. Of course I'm not giving anything away. It's not a spoiler. And while this is a statement by some critics that Cypher should have been cinemas, I believe quite the opposite. Cypher is a movie that seems to be just the right DVD release and not bad. Cypher has to be the biggest underground spy ever to hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... Look! Cypher also serves AONN Multimedia Research, 5 Star Eternal Spy Film Hall of Fame. Cypher is reluctant to this absolute best. Hands down and hats off. Nothing seems and the truth is unfamiliar to fiction. The future is now.
