Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin late to Jacquelyn Kennedy Ona. They live in a rodent-infected, well-maintained mansion, which the city considered to be a health hazard. Very soon it becomes quite clear that the two are away from the past. Little Edie seems to be out of the box when she acts with a ten-year mindset, though she's actually 53. The content is pretty much two. The first are conversations in the small Edie Sheep Big Edie driving away all his potential judges and destroying his ambitious career as a writer, actor and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, pointless and often entertaining. The second part consists of trying out a long test for both parties. Of course she thinks their song is perfect and it's just the other one that sounds bad. In one amazing scene, Big Edie physically attacks a little Edie with his sugar cane to stop his looting. It is very amazing, however, that there is serious abuse here and that the topics have gone too far to find out. Filmmakers seem to be treated like a circus that comes every day to save (and smile) any odd behavior that may occur. Ultimately, this is a sad picture because it shows how the world has just passed these two. Their hopes and dreams, as they lived, have broken down. Despite their regret, they need each other more than ever. Because without one, loneliness would not be a refuge. The most striking feature comes from Big Edie, whose many cats release themselves in their bedroom. His response to the odor-related complaint is simply incredible.
