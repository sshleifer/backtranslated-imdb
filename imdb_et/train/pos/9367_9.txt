It is not very common that the film can literally laugh at the audience and five minutes later they will fill their eyes with a tear. Many movies are trying to do this, but few are able to deliver the emotional impact of the film. Adam Sandler pulls you practically with his warmed and often violent outbursts, but he also laughs when his past shadow does not pull him. I do not break anything, but especially there is one scene that should water your eyes and shake your lips. Even the men of all men should be heartless bastards to feel something about watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great presentation, but Sandler has made it. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith are performing well, but there are two leading roles. Sandler's humor is still there, which actually saved the film's borderline. There's a lot to laugh to be, but don't think you're staying long because it rises again seriously, without much warning. <br /> <br /> I could go on and see how well this movie hits every human body's emotion, but I cut it one short. I feel like there's nothing more to say. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this movie. Even if you have to wait until it appears on the DVD, it's 100% worth. A deep moving film makes the eyes tears and face smile ... if, of course ... you are a heartless soul.
