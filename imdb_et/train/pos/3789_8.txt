Bravo is Czech, their repetitive film industry seems to be waking up from post-communist sleep. <br /> <br /> Loners is a comedy made with all the elements you could expect in modern Hollywood production. garbage that appears to be a genre in recent years. Great soundtrack, great visual editing, beautiful Prague city space, not to mention just a few. <br /> <br /> The story actually consists of a number of sub-stories that are often intertwined and overlapping, essentially a collage of fates, destiny, desires ... This follows a group of urban-young people up to the mid-thirties in a variety of situations, from everyday life to from leisure to career and obsession. And it's mountainous. The movie actually has a point where the whole theater where I was (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed non-stop for about 40-50 seconds. How often do you experience it with modern Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Although all the major cast is excellent (especially the upcoming Macedonian star Labina Mitevska, an immigrant who is facing too familiar difficulties) I have to find out Jiri Machacek from his superbly believable imagination of Jakub, constantly stoned with Bohemia. The brain is heavily influenced by the things he smokes while landing him in many funny situations. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Don't miss it! It has a lot to offer.
