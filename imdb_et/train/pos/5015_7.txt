Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinema that I don't think of. This movie was not too terrible, but it wasn't as good as the average. The main story about very immoral teenagers would have been to focus more on the forbidden romance and why it was ... should have come into it instead of scratching the surface basically "because mother says we can't." Some parts should have been completely abandoned or reprocessed to make them more relevant to the situation of the two main characters. Few times I was wondering if the writer / director was a fan of George Lucas's classic American Graffiti. Not that it is wrong to be a fan of this movie, but to look at the movie at times, I mean come! The worst part was that Madchen Amick had such a small part. He was the only one in one or two rows who actually did the trolley sample. (Take a good listening, it was there, even though his character was in California! DOH!) Maybe if he were a star, others could have followed and we would have had a more authentic sounding film. Well, what can you do if you have a director who is just a director and not an artist. Damage. In general I give it B- and it's a bit generous because I'm a part of Mrs. Amick.
