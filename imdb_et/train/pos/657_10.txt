La Mamani et la Putain must be seen as a film that is both related to the time it appeared (after 68 years) and forever. True, actors don't "act" ... True, they talk a lot ... But what they say is what makes life alive ... or dying. Françoise Lebrun's very long monologue is probably the most accurate and touching text ever written about woman, men and love. However, it is not easy to translate exactly. This film is a statement of how difficult it is to be a man and a woman (or two women in that case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of France's biggest actors.
