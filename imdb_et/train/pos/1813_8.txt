I liked this movie because I saw more than I expected. This is one of the few animated films that made me think about my subjects long after I finished. He speaks of death, revenge, and hell in such a way that you like the face in a blow, even if you suffer from a dream sequence in the middle of a movie. It makes this movie so good: the ability that is unique to Don Bluth (director) to play people's feelings and make them a sign of love or hatred at any time. And the fact that it has so many good signs, like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that the sad but happy ending, you have to say, "I have something in my eyes" to hide the others you called. All I said is just a few of the good points of this movie. As for the rest, you must see them very honestly in the film. Don Bluth, thank you.
