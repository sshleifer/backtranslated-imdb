In the Appalachian crisis, the influential film of the sliding man of four cities has become synonymous with rural exhaustion. Every four businessmen are faced with their darkest fears when dealing with a complicated ride around a river that is exchanged with a dam. When local people have to decide on their "path" with interlopers, it causes many deaths and trauma to survivors. All passengers are outstanding, although Voight provides leading and strongest performance. Rural landscapes and culture are well caught, including breathtaking dueling banjo. I saw it on the date it came out, not exactly the perfect date for the movie (although we both enjoyed it). I remember this, when the dramatic performance for Burt, Voight was already created. Not a movie you could watch every week, but with a strong punch and beautifully filmed.
