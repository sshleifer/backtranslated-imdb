Of course, for this super photography and awesome sound, this is a great home theater "show off" but it is also a drama and informative documentary. Parallel stories interwoven through this movie keep everyone interested. Young, old, boys and girls find it deep, we are all car fans, especially high-tech machines that are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and determination. Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder soundtrack are perfect for visual images and content. I don't want to end the end, but the final driving cycle of Quincy Jones 'Like Like them' can bring tears to the eye. Enjoy it!
