I went to see Vanilla Sky's big, big, huge !! .. With a Tom Cruise fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say. I thought it was a very moving movie and it wasn't what I expected. <br /> <br /> I had read the comments and I had decided not to see it and I am so pleased that I was "forced to see it. The strange thing is that I can't say why I would all say I found it is completely tied the next day and could not think about it. What I felt about the film, I can say it is not his style (fantasy, psychodrama, any) about the people and events that shape their life and how small events like getting into a car can change everything ...... <br /> <br /> As written by critics, maybe this original was a stunning second film for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but it was a completely different interpretation of the topic and in no way a narcissistic remake for Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can't even go for some trit, just glib phrases to describe a movie and watch it !!!! <br /> Yes, I know it is not a balanced passage been designed for an overview, but so what. It's not such a movie.
