I just finished watching the first album in a 4-disc (26 episode) collection created with UCLA Film and Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (apart from the first episode), the picture quality is pretty good. The DVD box is shown in the title here in IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is as pleasant as I saw it for the first time (5 years old) and Wally Cox is really in that role. If you're in the mood for the silent comedy that slips over you, instead of hitting you over the head, then treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you remember from your childhood. Although some gags are a bit of a crown, most are brilliant and well-executed ... and even the horns are fun. This is one of the TV series that lives in my early childhood memories.
