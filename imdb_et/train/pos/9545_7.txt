I don't know if to recommend this movie to Tetsuo fans or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily mark some things about this movie, which is very obvious in "Tetsuo" rip-off. The concept is similar, editing is as frantic and fast - it's good because, in addition to making the movie more dynamic, it hides some of the drawbacks due to low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> With less eroticism and "meatballs", a human being becomes a part of a machine (familiar?) called "Necroborg" (very original), due to narrow small foreigners. <br /> <br /> These narrow, small spaceships actually use human beings as their gladiator ships that they play with each other. They infect the body, somehow they can put a lot of mechanical parts, pulling them out of sight and turning it into a machine that targets other Necroborgs. Their goal is to win another alien who is in another Necroborg, to cut it off and eat. <br /> <br /> All in all, this plot sounds a bit stupid and I didn't expect much, but finally I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this is a low-budget flick, but it's still fairly decent. Don't expect much from the actors, they are usually not very good, but can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and gore, some odd situations, and the way the movie is directed and edited. Although the story is not too original, it has a certain charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
