I've just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say it's a work of art. I was very surprised to see a general rating of 5.2. <br /> <br /> The guy not only combines the ab list (ish) movie and makes them such famous characters, he has given us a fantastically versatile story of the film that has remained a lot of imagination. <br /> <br /> Too many people want a movie with a plot that can be understood and given to the disc ... but these are poor movie reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is special. Get it now!
