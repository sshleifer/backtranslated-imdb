It's a movie to see if you're married or married. The film is a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, work and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called death culture we are experiencing in the world is terrible, and this film will definitely make you think. <br /> <br /> Must see. I hope it will be divided as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast and the director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs and a 10-star rating from me!
