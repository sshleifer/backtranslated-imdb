ATTENTION ATTENTION <br /> <br /> You must not wait for the credibility of a feature film, where a superhero must complete an infinite number of incredible competitions, being kidnapped in this process, but recovering at lightning speed and making harmless gadgets in deadly weapons ... especially when Renny Harlin drives. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has many assets: a breathtaking landscape that was captured proudly, with special and visual effects (the first five minutes capturing and giving the film tone), a great musical result, welcome attempts to ease some tension, and solid cast: two heroes (Stallone, star and cowriter) , is the lion's share of the film material, but the great Michael Rooker is more than standing on his ground), the charming heroin (Janine Turner) and one of the darstardy heaps ever (priceless John Lithgow and deceptive feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex City - longer than usual and who does it best uses, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Good, sure entertainment if there is no credibility. As Roger Ebert wrote (about another movie) "It's a movie that can sit and enjoy as long as you don't make too much thinking." <br /> <br />
