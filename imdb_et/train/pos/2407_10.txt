The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (Bible faith). I will not go with the right-wing believers. I gave up this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For those who tried to take over our government, they do what Judas tried to do. I call it the Jewish syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not receive it, although Jesus said his Kingdom was not of this world. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely showed it. I liked the fact that it was easy for Jesus to play games and jokes with his disciples. He was also very proud of Jesus. <br /> <br /> This is a movie review. <br /> <br /> Very pleased.
