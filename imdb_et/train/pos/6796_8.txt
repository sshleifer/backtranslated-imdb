Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by Ulli Lommel, a German-born director. It manages, produces and celebrates this last production. He can not only make an interesting movie cheaply. But he will get to the bottom when Herr Lommel works from almost all of his movie catalogs. I've seen movies from Boogeyman I and II, from military birds, wolves, brain waves, and cocaine producers (even Andy Warhol makes this movie in the back of the scene). Even if he uses a lot of old material, he works well (and I can add it very creatively). <br /> <br /> The film follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. he also responds to a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote from the serial number in the late seventies and early seventies. Writer's friend (David Hess) helps him find this wannabe Zodiac. Can this killer stop? Does the writer put two and two together and take part in his old glory? Is David Hess still a man? You have to find out and see the Zodiac Killer yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie is not about the original Zodiac killer. I've also heard of people who take a video of this movie. So what. The artistic style of the director's old school reflects the fact that it has been made on video. My only complaint was overuse of film from Herr Lommel's earlier films (but I understand why "face" ".") Don't believe it. It's a sharp and street-level horror movie. As in the early abandonment of responsibility, this film does not help or praise the murder. You like this statement. <br /> <br /> Very recommended for Ulli Lommel fans.
