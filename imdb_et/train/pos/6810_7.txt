After reading the book, I did this DVD in Wal-Mart for 3 bucks and wondered what the hell ... I have a DVD and watched it last night. When I started looking at it, I checked the driving time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, yes, cool ... It seems that it runs quite slowly, knowing the story and how much it was. By the time I reached the actual killings, I was like "how much time has it left?" Checked. "One minute?! What the hell?!" I felt incredibly cheated, thinking that the movie progressed only a third of the story. <br /> <br /> Then I noticed that the DVD Scene Selection menu had Part 1 AND Part 2. I still had one and a half hours to go! Then I sat very happily and enjoyed the second part of the movie, even more than the first one. <br /> <br /> I testify that I have not seen the original 1967 film (despite my sincere desire), but I have read the novel and felt that it was a fairly descending film for two-part TV shows, ie. I think giving Perry a role was totally wrong and some small contradictions jumped to me, but still very well. The first half drags a bit, while the other half is more thrilling. I think they should have made the film more proportional, as Capote did in his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the murder arrest. Instead, the movie changes half before murders, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the murder arrest. Again, it makes the other party more exciting, but at the same time less tense, making the first half dragging on ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize that I've just made the mistake of moving things forward and moving on, so I close hell. Go watch the movie and make your fucking spirit! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
