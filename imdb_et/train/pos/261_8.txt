I went to watch this movie to wait in the theater for a nice relaxing time with my younger sister. Instead, I had to check myself to convince her I wasn't afraid. Many ways still have a story for children, but a scenario with many options. Perhaps it would have been one of the most frightening movies when it was planned for another audience.
