This movie is the best movie for Jim Carrey. Carrey had no ordinary face on this film. He was as funny as sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan accuses God (Morgan Freeman) of everything that goes wrong in his life. Then God comes down from heaven and gives Brum powers. As I said earlier, Carrey did a great job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great actors / actors. The plot was good because there were many sub-points in the main point. This film can be both funny (Bruce's dog) and sad ("break"). The script worked well. I'm glad they did this after the movie. I appreciate this movie 9/10.
