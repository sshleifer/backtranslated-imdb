For the first time, this film is a movie experience for many cast people. All of them are experienced actors and have played in several TV series and games. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's kind of strange to see him on the thriller while he is at the top of his comedy career in Turkey. This movie is Togan Gokbakar's first long-term shot and pretty much the first experience as a director. But they all did a good job. We are happy to see such an enthusiastic young man. They seem very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay is Saha Gokbakari's long-time sweetheart, as well as a talented actor who is known for his recent performance "Number 27" in theater and several TV series.
