Rated E <br /> <br /> I've never really belonged to Nintendo 64, but I've played many times. In my opinion with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games in the Nintendo 64 system. this game many times and every time good. If you have N64 and you don't have this game, you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side-scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 is 3D-Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is kind of strange, but there are many things in the game. You play as Super Mario and again you have to save the princess and 120 Powerful Bowzer. can do it in 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
