I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and I've been watching many of my movies so far, and none of them have ever made me laugh. It was also not how to lose friends and transfer people. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically good for people as pissing people. However, he has an innate ethic that prevents him from doing things that could just make him famous. Ultimately, he reaches them, with a culture of life. <br /> <br /> The movie is well humorous, romantic, a good actor, and also a bit of a dance. He's one of those movies where you can just stay happy.
