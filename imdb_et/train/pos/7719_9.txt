If you like Star Wars / Trek, see where they got all their ideas and cinematographic equipment. This is my best ever 2 favorite films, the other world-futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not hidden by an asylum-like trick (a la later by Lucas). And just because it was done in 1956, one cannot assume that you can see which strings hold the flying plate up. It was the first movie you couldn't. On the "A-Movie" scale, the miracle made by the economy and taste made it strong. And Wilcox's previous "hit" was "Lassie Come Home". As long as I looked at him, I assumed that Fred Wilcox was the leader who had become famous or later, but didn't want to be involved with sci-fi at the time, which was strictly the "B" genre. It was either a very VERY visionary production or a very random "mistake" by Hollywood bankrupt people. <br /> <br /> There are massive mats that have virtually microscopic action in real time that Lucas used extensively. There are intelligent machines that cross the stereotypical interface; "computers" because they are much less futuristic in later works later. Star Trek's "transporter" is almost unchanged Roddenberry 10 years later. And if Trek / Wars technobabble turns you off, FP's scientific references are not superfluous and everything is accurate even today. The "ship" kit is comprehensive, glitteringly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since then, and more convincing than what Trek has done for a TV or movie. We couldn't spend as much time as I wanted. <br /> <br /> If you ever thought about how competently crafted movies in space, then FP will explain it. This is definitely not "Wagontrain to the Stars".
