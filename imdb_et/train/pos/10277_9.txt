This is a very near perfect film. Mamet repeats the ideas but did not say it so briefly. It is actually a failure of trust, a human condition. The film tells us that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. Does anyone live today who has not seen it in their society every day? The film is highly structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Except, there are no innocent signs anymore. The world is now completely contaminated, destroyed and everyone involved. Would something be real? <br /> <br /> Don't miss the sound. It's wonderful.
