Jazzi's admirers respect this classical short time, showing some of the best jazz men in their business. It's like watching no fun music videos today. <br /> <br /> Jazzmen give us extra treatment for Marie Bryantis, who sings the classic version of the street. I had never heard his song before, Bryant sounds remarkably like Billie Holliday. This is a compliment to people. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work is also tops. Many black stereotypes are fed with this black black time, this film is being viewed and valued. Not great product values, but lots of good music.
