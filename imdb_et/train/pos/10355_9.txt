An exciting film based on a real story, an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), accused of killing her daughter. She insists that the dingo took her child, but the story is very suspicious. The film is actually a media circus that took place around the way the Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality, which ultimately led to the woman's belief based barely on truth. I love movies that are suspicious of the media, and also movies that are right about how people travel on the railroad of the legal system. I have always thought that the jury should show 12 angry men before they complete their tasks. It is not, as has often been said, a liberal film, but a clinical look at how we interpret events based on so many of our prejudices and desire to revenge. Similarly, crying in the dark is also clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film melodramatic at all. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found its inclusion.
