Not sure what to expect from this movie, given his amazing set of stars and directors, but ultimately not disappointed. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights was the American tourist. talking about a terrible French accent (which made me feel better), which was actually quite moving and a great way to build a movie. <br /> <br /> The story of the parameter and the looting victim was also a great move, and the pure comedy will receive the Coen Brothers and Steve Buscem. Tom Tykwer's clip was also impressive, though extensively his ambitious. <br /> <br /> However, the Bob Hoskins segment was quite remarkable and the vampire story was far away. The Wes Craven section dialogue also seemed very compulsive and the story of Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> All this movie is worth a look at good bits and a strong finish. It's not too painful to sit through the bad parts - they'll only last 5 minutes anyway. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
