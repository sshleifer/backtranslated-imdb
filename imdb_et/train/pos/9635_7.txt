The romance of the film, which is also his main theme, is good and nicely presented. But the love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Worse still, the main character's psychology is strange and incomprehensible, just like the end of the movie. Don't be afraid to watch this movie if it attracted your interest, but don't wait for it too much.
