Thomas Capano was not Anne Marie boss Tom Carper, governor. That's why the Feds started participating, called Clinton, and asked him to join the Fund. I lived outside Philadelphia at that time, so the incident was daily news for the front page. I also read the Ann Rule book and saw A & E's "City Confidential" segment. Tom Capano was a megalomaniac (sp.), A Uber controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but all she wanted was someone she could control. If he didn't let him do that anymore, he killed him, the final control form. I think it's a waste of money that he's still alive.
