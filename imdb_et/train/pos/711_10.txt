"Rock 'n' Roll High School" is likely to go down in history as the ultimate rebel party. Imagining a number of high school students who use Ramones music as inspiration to rise to their despotic principle (Mary Woronov, "Eating Raoul" celebrity), the whole film is a mile away. This is basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you will. Bullying fresh? Check it out. Dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also "Eating Raoul" *)? Check it out. Exploding Mice? Memorial. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is something that makes life worthwhile. Even like me, who doesn't know Ramones' music, it's a pure joy. What does Roger Corman's senior manager and Joe Dante co-lead? Too bad that director Allan Arkush later degenerated into a ticket like "Caddyshack II". <br /> <br /> Also starring PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who has appeared in all Joe Dante films and many Roger Corman), Don Steele and of course Ramone. Real petting. <br /> <br /> * It seems Bartel and Woronov are always labeled together. They also participated in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... where they repossessed their roles in "Eating Raoul".
