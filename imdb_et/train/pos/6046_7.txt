I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Let's face it; The assumption does not sound particularly appealing when it comes to saying that the money for the nightclub needs to be handed over, but it was easy in nature to win one. There were no moments that I found frightening, and I doubt I remember the next day, but it won't work as a nice deviation. What I found funny was watching it here in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend, who doesn't understand what I like. I told him there was a plot - three men had to return to London. Hardly satisfying her. There is no camera here that would have been waiting after reading a number of comments. However, I take exceptions with Withnail and I; not in the same league and I doubt if it was meant. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
