I liked this beautiful film every moment and I was interested in this female painter I haven't heard before. So I studied my life and work later. As can be expected, I learned that the film was not exactly historical. However, I was a little surprised by the very inaccurate comments made by the film. Come on, boys, the movie isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!). Every historical film distorts reality because it should be an independent work of art. Film director has the full right to use the elements of reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a great movie and I think it brought many people (including some who now give negative comments) to explore this fascinating artist's life and work.
