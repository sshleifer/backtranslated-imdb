I don't watch much porn, but I love porn stars. And I love gory movies. So when I heard the porn star gore, I was very excited. Of course, it was years ago, and when I heard about all the film making and finishing problems, I didn't think I'd actually see it. But I did and I'm not ashamed to admit that I loved it, even with all my mistakes. <br /> <br /> First, there are drawbacks. The story is in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story he wanted to say concerns Scotland's Sawney Beane. Why not just set it up and skip the third-class report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? It also violates its rules by saying that you are safe on the trajectories, but then the cannibal mutants will run everywhere. It's never clear how many cannibals we're dealing with. There is a big stone castle that is obviously old but no one has noticed it before. Self-conscious horror movie references are annoying and so are the characters. The heroine has a posteriori assembly of all his dead friends, which contains the sign he'S NOT coming to. The end does not make sense. <br /> <br /> What does it do? Gore! Of course I would have liked more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that was not afraid to be anything other than a gore movie. Two murders are surprised and Taylor Hayes has a nice nasty scene. Two natural murders are even given on DVD for extended frames. I've always remembered that gore could overcome the stupid story and the Evil breed strengthened it.
