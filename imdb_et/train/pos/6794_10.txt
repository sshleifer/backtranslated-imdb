I read most of the comments posted here, and I can say that most of these posters have great problems in life. This show, unlike most games, was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose heart in all that he did, was again a hit of play. He is a truly effervescent personality that looks like a lighthouse where he ever goes. She is fun and makes you smile and that's exactly what the show is. Dancers and questions, the round fashion they present, only add to the appeal of exhibitions. And while there's a lot of money, it's fun. The pressure (stress) present in most game examples is NOT here. Many people who posted messages complained about how much time dancers and questions have chosen, & c, as Millionaire has no similar waste of time. I can say that most of you have missed the whole concept. The idea here is FUN & ENJOY itself. There's something for everyone. Qustions test their knowledge, eye candy (dancers), temporary, Mr Shatner's wonderful fun personality ... well if it doesn't pull the guys up, then I feel bad; and if that's not enough, you can get RICH! I really leave the exhibition. ALL of the games that have ever been, and which are fairly honest, I show in HATE, that's what I really liked and really missed. The only game I ever liked was the game.
