The year is 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) doesn't like people. There's only one friend with whom he has and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an old sympathetic man. In Skagway they get into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the herd. Now, Jeff must only get it back and run through the US Canadian border with Dawson. those like Ladies of Ronda (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet) .These two guys get into gold trading. Illustrative work is great. Walter Brennan makes a fantastic sideways to Stewart.Ruth Roman is great and Corinne Calvet is admirable. Big Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman have smaller roles. It's fantastic to see how Jimmy Stewart crosses I'm his man and his rifle. But he is also vulnerable.
