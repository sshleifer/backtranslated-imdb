Of all the versions of Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story), I think it is the best of all of them. It is almost true that it has the original style - some minor deviations and drawbacks, eg. The absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that the Eumaeus cigar feels Odyssey to hide his home - a realistic exemplary and authentic landscape and costumes contribute to this truly memorable masterpiece, not a Hollywood sword and sandal to a B-flick. Despite the fact that dialogue and subtitles are entirely in Italian, if anyone knows it, it can still make head and tail what is happening and what the actors say (assuming you have a good text from Odyssey) at hand). At least I did and so much that it has inspired me to learn Italian to make the film even more appreciated.
