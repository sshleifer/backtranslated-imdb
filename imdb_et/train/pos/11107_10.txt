Sopranos (now preparing to finish) are the top of adult television and drama. When Sopranos reaches the mark, it really hits the mark. Using great writing and great actors (most of them are Goodfellas extras), the series's sound is progressing satisfactorily unpredictably and exceptionally. James Gandolfini, who is Tony Soprano and Edie Falco for all intense purposes, is definitely cast. There are also a lot of regular collections in the series to draw the plot with any necessary tools (usually violence and unpleasant language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are big secondary characters that make each episode more interesting. Seasonal extras are also worth including names like Steve Buscem (great!), Joe Pantoliano (great!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> Sopranos is a great realistic interpretation of family drama and today's mafia societies, which, despite the rare bad story, can be a unique TV. Symbols and simple story lines, dreams and shots, and many other things create interwoven stories and relationships that, at the end of each season, have decided to create yet another perfect HBO package.
