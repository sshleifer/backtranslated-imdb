This film literally has a clich√© for every single film and all of them act for their advantage. Directly by Lethal Weapon, Gary Busey, who hits this movie, doesn't let it entertain and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream vans, and if they aren't good enough to watch this movie, how's the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you don't know who Danny Trejo is, you probably don't like this movie.
