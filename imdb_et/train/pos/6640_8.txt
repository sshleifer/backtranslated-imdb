This one-minute film is arguably the first film ever made. Other inventors had previously filmed activities - such as sneezing Edison's motion photography - but Lumiere's brothers developed equipment that immensely improved the media. Of course, their "cinematographers" had to confuse their peers, including their subjects. In the first case, the brothers register workers leaving their factory, some of whom find it difficult to understand the camera's awareness. Lumieres is trying to make film and animal cycling more interesting, but "La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere" is almost no match with the inventiveness of these later films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the choice of ritual of the brother's chosen acquaintance class. Their choice is the first proof of their curiosity about all the people in the world, which makes it immensely satisfying and exciting to see the quality of these experiments. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
