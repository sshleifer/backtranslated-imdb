It was one of the best TV shows. Perfect mystery and intrigue and turns. Compulsive viewing. I was happy to see it in the UK. They may have failed in the episode, I can't remember, but it was at least once a week on a regular basis. My girlfriend and we could hook the trailer and neither of us is a big fan of the American series. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew it was something special. We left a few episodes and it made you sad and crazy for a week because they were missing. <br /> <br /> Great casting, great acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, better than her role as Custer. Lucas Black turned astonishingly to the child and Paige Turco was his best way because he was five. And, of course, Nick Searcy, like the long-lasting patient's sidekick of the sheriff. . It made the end weak and you could say they killed it. Why go to us? Why did they do this with one of the best examples? Shoot exec.
