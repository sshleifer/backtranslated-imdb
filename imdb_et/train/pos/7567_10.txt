An excellent film depicting cross-currents in the life of several ethnic blends of non-ordinary people in the western Pacific. Solid leadership and writing with subtle effects, especially Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe performances. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as a very successful "Crash", written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of action may not be as terrible as the city of Los Angeles, and characters may be more familiar with each other, but the personal relationships between the characters are both faulty and worrying and their characters. stories that are resonant like all those that are "Crash". For those viewers who rated "Crash", it must be a movie. This film also likes fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavets.
