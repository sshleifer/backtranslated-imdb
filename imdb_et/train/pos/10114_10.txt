"Edward D. Wood's Haunted World, Jr." is the final documentary about the life of a person who brought us such films as "Glen or Glenda", "Monster Bride" and of course "Plan 9 from Space". This exquisite film goes far beyond other documentaries, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "Plan 9 Companion", failed. He rounds up his surviving transmitter, many of whom have passed since filming and are honestly investigating Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in that he looks back at the darker corner of the previous Hollywood, which is sentimental to the director (down to music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves a director who is such a failed day. The whole two hours of the movie are loved and retrospectively cut by Ed's life and premature death for the viewer. The best I watched at 3 am wearing an angora sweater.
