This film answers the question of how the relationship will survive if your girlfriend is addicted, clinging, afflicted, jealous ... and who has the abilities and abilities far away from mortal women? <br /> <br /> Without breaking the film, I can be sure, but it's a lot of fun. Uma Thurman is perfect as a superhero of mercury, a uber-baby, a mysterious name called G-Girl, who, unlike most sisters, is not always * committed to truth, justice, and the way of America. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also believable as thorough, but somehow pulling, curator Jenny. G-Girl goes ballistic when she is shot down to a less blessed but more emotionally safe and well-regulated rival. It's funny, but it's not quite nice. <br /> <br /> This is a nice assumption, hell is not a rage like a super-heroine, and those involved cannot prevent it completely, but it has moments and I I think I can get a DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ..
