Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced to retire when he is forced to save his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) from his job. one night. He has to get his old team together so he can trust to pull him out and get out of his Germans. But the police are on him, so can he pull it? It was one of the biggest film candidates because the original was far from classic. And if you are not going to wait much for it and turn off your brain thinking part, then you can ignore the plot hole ans just the movie that it is. Finally you enjoy the ride. Look at it on a double bill that is fast and amazing, fast at night, just don't take the car to spin right after that. <br /> <br /> My Class: B - DVD / Extras: 7 Minutes of Jerry Bruckheimer's Interview; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action Overload: Lift the reel; Big Chase; "0 to 60" featurette; "Wild Rides" featurette; Letters on the move; Culture "Painted On The Heart" music video; "Shanghai Noon", "Mars Mission" and "Coyote Ugly"
