I think Blackadder the Third is the best in the series. <br /> <br /> In fact, all episodes are funny, personally I like the "French invasion" episode, but it is with supernatural actors. "MACBETH" is also very funny how Rowan plays with them is really (in English) humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Cast: Never say it, always call it Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, so you want me to say Scottish Play? Cast: YES Blackadder: not MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Rowan and I have most of my work, but I think she made the Blackadder series especially good. /> <br /> I hope Rowan continues his great style, but I think we can count on him because he is already working on a Bean 2 film that won't come out this year, I can't wait. .. <br /> <br /> I will give this 3rd Blackadder out of 10 out of 10.
