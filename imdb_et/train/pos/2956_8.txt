Nowadays, there are very few speakers who can capture the entire film because of their presence. One of those few is Judy Davis, who has built a successful career that creates attitudes that are strong in attitudes but are very vulnerable. It performs the roles that most other performers treat melodramatically and adds a fiery, deeply emotional intensity that draws attention from anywhere else on the screen. <br /> <br /> His skills are well shown on "High Tide" film, which matches him for the second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis his first big success with "My Brilliant Career". In this film, Davis played a young woman who had decided to do it in the world, despite the fact that she felt ashamed of the community and education. In the "High Rise", Davis's character, Lillie, is almost the opposite: he gave up his hope for his future when he was young, and, after giving birth to the child, renounces his responsibility and takes life without direction or meaning. When she finally meets her daughter years later, it is a thought to take care of her child's tightening; he knows this is his chance to accept his failures, but how can he be honest with his daughter and still get respect? <br /> <br /> Gillian Armstrong's films usually associate stories with characters who are keen to communicate with others, but face obstacles created by their own personal habits and addictions. "Oscar and Lucinda" were, for example, men and women who needed each other's love desperately, but they were always blinded by the hope their gambling addictions represented. Here we are diving with a family that is spoiled if the mother is unable to commit to a permanent life and her efforts to redeem her, even though they are absolutely convinced that it is better to go late. It's not just a movie that has high performance in its center, but also a rare achievement: a totally convincing story of salvation.
