One of the best comedies. I've seen this example about 10 times and will probably look at it at least 100 times. My friends and family cite this DVD so often that you think we were doing something other than watching it. The beginning of the Alcatra is a bit slow, but whether it passes or pulls through the part where Eddie is on stage. Watch the "Cake or Death" section (for the Church of England) and the "Hitler / Pol Pot" section (hard to explain, just look at it). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eyeglasses are obviously helpful, right?) Honest warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw a lot of four-point words.
