I saw it as a child in the late eighties and I have to say that Galaxy Express is one of those films that have long been in their imagination. If you have never understood an anime complaint, discovering this movie can be your golden ticket to the town of Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is as gentle and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Although the mobile phone animation is somewhat traditional, it has a lively style that depicts Leiji Matsumoto's great character design and visual talent talents. <br /> <br /> This is one of those unique children's films, such as Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and Oz's wizard, which completely transcends the family's entertainment status and is a classic of their home theater. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie very well.
