Finally a movie where the audience is expected to finish what happens. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) are going to destroy, because where else to go, but we don't know how or when to end the movie. Hoffman is great, as usual, and even Hawke was a decent younger brother who basically does what he has said, because he can't really think of himself. Hawke could have come out of her element a little, but she played that part well enough. Add Andy's wife, who was completely played by Marisa Tomei, puppy with Hank; Andy has forced the company to pay for its drugs and sexual addiction; and the father who finally finds out what happened on the day of the robbery. This movie thinks of you.
