The name just says it all. I watched this movie with my dad when he came out and served in Korea for having a great man of admiration. The disappointment of this film is that it only focuses on the short life of a person's life - it is interesting enough that the man's entire life would have made such an epic biography that it is incredible to imagine the cost of production. <br /> Some posters don't talk about a man's lack of qualities, which are cheap shots. The subject of "Commitment, Honor, State" is not just words that are gathered from the high-level officer's lips - it is a deep confirmation that one man is committed to his own country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck is a liberal that he got a better understanding of man. He does a good job of showing a fearless general that has been tempered with a human's human side.
