As part of our vocabulary in the late 1950s, we knew well Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright and so on. at this great show "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> It came on Saturday night and all was glued to the TV. It was a real exhibition that depicts family values. Perhaps there was a weekly crisis, but it was a strong family atmosphere that pulled everything together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was the dominant patriarch of the family. His words depicted wisdom. We often wondered that the widow, Ben Cartwright, must be the best man of the deceased husband. He raised wonderful sons. <br /> <br /> Of course we all thought about why Pernell Roberts left the show. The exhibition was a gold mine and Roberts made a lot of money on leaving. His career never happened when he was involved with Cartwright's son. He should have tried to come back to the series. He obviously lost outburst.
