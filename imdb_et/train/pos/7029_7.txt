I strongly recommend this movie to any musical fan whose death is seen in a musical image to make a foolish transition from the stairs. Of course it is long, but its length is a testimony of how real the original musical script is. Sets and cast make sweet apple, Ohi, the place to be. Fosse protege Anne Reinking also does an excellent job of choreography, giving the dances a nice little town, a spirit of time. <br /> <br /> A brief overview may seem strange for some, but they are really wonderful (reading "anonymous"). "Comments on Jason Alexander's results made me sick." Actually, he steals the word "perforamnce." Albertina mixes her unique manic nervousness with the charm of Dick Van Dyke-esque to create a new and improved Albert. As no one is in business, it is not painful either. George Wendt is another eye-catcher who improves Paul Lynde's take-up of Harry McAffe, making him less manic and more earthly and rigorous. His whole character and body language screaming "over my body" "Marc Kudisch takes the side of Conrad Birdie Elvis to new heights, where his" Honest Sincerity "is" thank you very much. "His physicality returns to the young Elvis, then swollen, stubborn Conrad. The fact is that this film is so different from the original film (which added happy faces, speed of turtles and Russian ballet !!!) What did no Bye, Bye Birdie do, I don't know? The only possible advantage the original version has over it is Ann Margret Otherwise, the update is better than possible. When the old version cuts many songs and dance breaks where they were not needed (and all the goals and goals ended in the middle of playing the movie), the new version has restored the original music score and added some great new stuff ("A Giant Step", which is special in this category). We know we live in tough times, but if you want to take away your worries and put on a happy face, it's worth it.
