"Straight Story" is a truly beautiful film from an older man named Alvin Straight, who drives his lawnmower across the country to visit his stranger, a dying brother. But this is just the basic synapse ... this movie is so much more. It was Richard Farnworth's last role before death, and that's definitely what he remembers. He is a stubborn old man, unlike many old men you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "Straight Story" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. It gets down and touches some of you, at least when you have a heart.
