This version of Bleak House is the best customization of a classical novel known to me. Representing the Chancery Court as a "character" of drama is great. The action is admirable from the translator, Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and two young lovers. But this is the web of the spider's office that keeps the whole thing together and cinematography is great. What's wrong with BBC copyright, which meant that this version could not be seen in the UK for many years on video or DVD? I tried to find out about them, but I was standing on a stone wall. Finally, I got a copy of DVD from Canada.
