I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog films and comedy films in such a way that they were twice as good. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite films. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is fun and divine, they make a great team. The only downside is that I don't really understand how Dooley's wife died. He died before that movie, but how? If they said so, I have to miss it. Other than that, I'll give her two thumbs / tails! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have a lot of training. They were so funny and all the voices that Jerry Lee did when Dooley talked to him were so funny. my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he bites the peoples to get information very funny
