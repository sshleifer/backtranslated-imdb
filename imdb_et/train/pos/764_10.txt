Undoubtedly, Beat Street is the best explosive image film. All this is on the ground, clothes (puma), music and most importantly dancing! The story is basic, but hey, what's up there? The idea behind the film is to show you at what point in time the children did what was important to them. This shows that teenagers in general are good, all these daily children were music, dance and friendship. Having recently watched a DVD, I was surprised at how well it was a test of time! The clothes didn't look dated (maybe because Puma is now with a huge comeback), music sounds fresh and dancing is still in sight. In the film, everyone aged 10-25 should see it as part of their youth culture.
