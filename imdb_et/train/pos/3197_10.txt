If you are a Crispin Glover fan, you must see it. If you are a Sean Penn fan, you must see it. If you are a fan of the movie in general, you have to see it. If you have no idea who is Crispin Glover and who has no idea who is Sean Penn, this movie still has a lot of value, but the more you have Crispin or Sean seen before, the better. > <br /> This movie is so funny, but it's also a pure genius. There is nothing I know about this film. It's your genre. I doubt that something will be done again. I can't say anything exactly why it has been done without any part of it, and some of the other reviews here. <br /> <br /> In response to all the reviewers here who gave him a bad overview, please review the movie again. In fact, there is no point in saying that this movie could rightly be called "boring". This is probably the most fun, fun, and least boring film ever made. And it only improves with age and repetition. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, can be said to have been seen. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, who is also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed. letters. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this movie are rare and difficult to find. However, after careful search, I managed to find the VHS version and there are a few ways to find out. But I really want someone to put it on a DVD.
