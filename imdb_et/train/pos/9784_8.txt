The sensitive film has no shine and to some extent a narrative structure, but it is still perfectly captured and executed. But the narrative structural point is debatable. Although it gives the impression that the ends at the end are binding in the final scenes, and combines their thoughts with what today's viewer could describe as "story", I am skeptical about whether this feeling * needs a * narrative structure that is certain and identifiable. Inevitably, it is compared to SOMERSAULT in that it is a central protagonist (I'm not sure it is the right word!) Is a young and very young looking woman whose newly discovered sexuality interferes and gives her the opportunity - although of course Cate Shortland's film is more about this aspect. But while the possibility that a careless viewer may reject this film as clich√©s, PEACHES is in some ways more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. Maybe it doesn't do it quite well. This is definitely very different from Monana's first feature - INTERVIEW! I'm not quite sure how the story between knitting and lung was added. Who knows - maybe they did. They certainly pulled the damaged and flawed nature of the character of knitting home - though I think it was achieved without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** JUST SAW THE FILM AGAIN ***** **** <br /> <br /> In the second look, I see how some would leave it as a telemovie, dressed as a feature . But I'm not sure how different these "categories" are, or even if we should differentiate it. In any case, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal and its content is hardly complicated, at least as in SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLAR, SHORT-TERM FAMILIES, AFTER EYES AND HUMAN CONSUMPTION. The performances are all good, but I realized that the main reason I enjoyed the movie was that it fits with the "Australian" genre without necessarily adding anything ... and I understand that it can be quite good reason for another person * NO * like it! Indeed, it is only when Lung enters into his Vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack. But this brings us to another debate - * should we assume that the film must challenge us all the time? Of course, I enjoy being challenged by a movie (or book or other people), but isn't there more space that is just a nice story? <br /> <br /> I haven't deleted my original post on this movie because I'm too aware of the orphan recordings of such behavior. But I lower my initial rating from 8, or 6.5. <br /> <br /> With regard to AFI's best film candidates, my votes go to HUMAN, THREE DOLLARS and HOW - and I think I watch HOW THE STEPS should win.
