Although the title "Before The Devil Knows You Are Dead" comes from the Irish proverb, the film plays like a tragedy in Greece. It all starts with botched robbery and continues to be under control, because two brothers are trying to get into the confusion they have got. <br /> <br /> Cast on well with Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke playing the above brothers. Significant support includes Albert Finney as his father and a lover of Marisa Tomei's brother and other husband. In addition to these principles, it is remarkable. <br /> <br /> The story is convincing and has been reported to some extent. The narrative structure keeps things interesting, offering different perspectives and frequent time changes. This means that the unpredictability of the film has somewhat melted down, as it soon becomes clear that this story is tragedy and through. All in all, it's a pretty impressive debut for Kelly Masterson, the first time screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The direction of Sidney Lumet is well solved, but I am more impressed by the fact that he is still over eighty years old. Carter Burwell's score was less impressive, but it's not a big mess. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie will turn out to be a serious look, and while the story and presentation can be superficial similar to other movies, this is a unique experience.
