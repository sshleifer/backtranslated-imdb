In my opinion, this must be one of Barbara Stanwyc's best performances. Then he was one of the few actors who and now who could say more with one view than the whole dialogue page. And I was fortunate enough to see an original and uncensored movie, plus 4 more minutes. Too bad a film is so short. Lily is a young woman who hardly keeps it with her father's illegal jargon. His only link to something is his good friend Chico, whom Theresa Harris played perfectly. Though Chico is an African-American (and the white woman is the best friend of a 30-year-old black woman, it was a controversial topic) and Lily is not, they have a special bond. And it's not sexual. Only 2 women left or pulled out of control. When Lily's father dies and she doesn't know what she's doing, she is told she has the ability to get out and get what she wants. Yes, it is immoral, but it is the point of the whole movie. Then they had to go "go" and destroy a few minutes. So, until the last few minutes of the movie, it's a great movie and it's worth watching. "Lesson" is still as valid as it was, and I'm sure it will be 100 years. Women, it's terrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, please note.
