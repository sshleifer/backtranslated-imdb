One of the first best music, Anchors Aweigh offers a number of memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly's dancing with Jerry's mouse, Kelly dancing with 7-year-old Sharon McMan, singing with Sinatra Jose Iturb playing the piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturb and much more. Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work, such as playing the piano below, through transparent keys and Grayson's song, seen through the finder of another camera. The plot is thin, but you get part of Kelly & Sinatra's enthusiasm. The sailors leave, they have to go home when the boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra fall for the aunt. To set up a complementary (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can listen to him with Jose Iturb. But Sinatra's young and naive in it and her singing words fall in love too quickly. Although they are trying to contact Iturb, who is never available, he starts to fall with another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly now loves Grayson. Anchors Awight most remembered with the live-action / cartoon series along with Tom and Jerry, but there's a lot more that is worth a look. I'll give her nine stars because, although it's not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - it's one of the first major productions of Technicolor (perhaps Meet Me In St Louis was the first) and better than most others.
