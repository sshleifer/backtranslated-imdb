This is an extremely powerful, real story movie that can be viewed. I say that because a brutal press can be for people, in this case, an Australian couple who is accused of killing their child are innocent. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her movie results, but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say that both were great, but the role was less difficult for Streep because he had to learn Australian accent. (She learned so well that I had difficulty understanding parts.) Without giving away anything, I can say that this movie is emotionally carried by you.
