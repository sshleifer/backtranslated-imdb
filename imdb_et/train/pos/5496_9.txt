Someone has already mentioned "at the right time in time" This document was so true that I had doubts about the authenticity of the scenes and thought it might have included some action, but not. It's all real. The story is not new to people in developing countries and / or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of people through corporate media, false information, artificial polarization of people, deliberately creating tensions in the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency, or even government (many believe, led by the US) uses agents attacking "any" to provoke masses to violence and thus justify their coup. The seafarer of the movie also mentions this. That they wanted the nations to come across the streets. All of these scenarios have been played in Turkey (US Pet Dog in the Middle East) throughout their history, who have experienced 3 coups, and lately the secret plans of the Turkish Army have been ironically reviewed through intergovernmental religious / conservative media against military a-religious doctrines in which a military agent is bombarded a very important mosque for provoking people, etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie unique is that they were filming from the inside, perhaps at random, when the events happened. It is clear that the directors are Chavez. Regardless of whether it caused the filtering and manipulation of directors' events and information, I do not know. <br /> <br /> And if Chavez protects Venezuelan people against the dictatorship of the US and world economy without repressing any opposing thinking with force and eventually becoming a self-conscious tyrant, history will tell, but at least Chavez is hopeful and I believe it deserves a chance.
