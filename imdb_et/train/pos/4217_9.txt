It always makes sense for a detective to surround the case and put the offender in the book. In this case, the climax gives me even greater pleasure. Abigail Mitchell's face as he realizes that his victim has left "dead body testimony" that leaves no doubt his guilt is very pleased to see a cunning stack. Please understand: When I admire Ruth Gordon's reality, * really * irritates me. He is selfish and demanding. She gets her way by placing a "little girl" act that is embarrassing for a woman of her age. Worse still, he has now set himself against a judge, a jury and a condemnant against his dead brother's wife. <br /> <br /> When Columbo goes too close, he tries to encourage him by manipulating him with a speech to a high-profile audience of ladies. He makes the tables perfectly, giving a very warm and humane speech about the reality of police work. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that Columbus can draw from justice. Abby's last complaint against his good character is rejected because he has too much self-esteem to do his job well. Here's one thing that Mitchell can't get out of!
