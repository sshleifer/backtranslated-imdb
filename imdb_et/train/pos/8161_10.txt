When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. However, this movie is not for everyone, especially for people who do not like gory scenes like a dentist with many gory scenes. That's why it's an R18 rating. It's about Beverly Hills dentist Dr. Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with a halfman. It's best to go to your dentist before you watch it. But if you don't like to go to the dentist, it's better not to look at it because you can go to life. the dentist has the best bloody vengeance I have seen. Who has ever seen a movie with a dentist (Spoiler) pulls out all his cheating husband's teeth and cut the tongue without anesthetic? Generally a fantastic flick, but not for everyone.
