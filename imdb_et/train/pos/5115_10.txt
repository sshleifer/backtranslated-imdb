I didn't see it in the movie theater. I acknowledge the bias against Vinnie-Barbarino. Who the hell was John Travolta for making movies? I remember Oscar forwarding this year, when Travolta was completely devastating when he didn't win. How does he dare to see what "real" participants were doing? I'm sorry John could have won. After capturing the movie cable years ago I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all wonderfully done. I also admit that I can never miss it. I have to stop and watch. Over the years I have learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my thumbs at my waist and learned more about Travolta. The only disappointment I had was to watch some of the music on Urban Cowboy's soundtrack. "Finding Love" defines a movie, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics that DIDN 'did not make a soundtrack. It should have been a double CD ........
