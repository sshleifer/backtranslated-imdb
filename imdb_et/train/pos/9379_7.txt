The more I look at Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Looking at this movie now (2005), I see that it doesn't fit into the genre of movies that appeared in the early 90s. I don't think it can be regarded as a movie but it is sometimes quite dark, mainly because of the illumination of characters and the odd personality. <br /> <br /> Typical performances of all three major players, all of whom did their job well. However, I thought that the characters of Hopper and Boyle were undeveloped because sometimes it was difficult to understand what they did and why they did it. Hopper is love or hates him. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts very unreal, there were parts where I had to hand it over to the director (ie when he first saw the sheriff). All in all, it's definitely worth watching this movie. *** 1/2
