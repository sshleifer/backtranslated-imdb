I looked at the exhibition 10 years ago and loved it !!! I am now in control of the DVD and I was watching the series and looking forward to the scenes I knew the exhibitions were (when Lucas confronted Gail in his house) and realized that it was missing - maybe I looked at seduction without leading up. Then I went to the line to review the BIOS of all the stars, and I found comments that show that the exhibitions have failed. Thanks !!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some comments say, "Strangler number 19, then triangle 20, when the other was around them on the other side. And the potato boy 5 and the dead world 6 were the opposite. Can anyone explain ?????
