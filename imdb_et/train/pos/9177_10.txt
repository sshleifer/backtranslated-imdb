I must say that this minisation was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but none of them are comparable. Best for me. I never imagined anyone else ever playing those characters. The last time I saw it was in 1984 when I was only 13. At that time I was in a book and I had just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. Miniseries was completely fascinated by me and I remember that none of the episodes have disappeared. I would like to see it again because it is so good. :-)
