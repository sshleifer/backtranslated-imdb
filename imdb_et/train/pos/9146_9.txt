This electrifying musician is more than a star of egotism, a musical genius that is a prince. The film is 90 minutes so long, but it's really easy to understand why it's a classic cult. <br /> <br /> Like other films that focus on a struggling young musician trying to be great, it has a hint to add a dimension to the musical number. Although this movie is not as good as 8 miles as the last example, it is still fun and the sound is much better. On the dramatic side of things, the story focuses on the young artist Kid (Prince) and the club's regular place. The club owner is frustrated by Kid's arrogance, and the little child knows he can be fired soon and replaced by a rival. On one side, parents have problems, his father abuses him violently. During the film, Kid learns some lessons in life and learns to appreciate more friends. This is all the things we have naturally seen in age dramas, but it is combined with music, with highly stylized music. <br /> <br /> Cast is good. The prince is pretty good on the dramatic side if he is not posing. He seems humane and relatable. Clarence Williams is also a very abusive father. Appollonia Kotero debuts as Princes sexy love interest. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the movie is, however, an excellent soundtrack. Musical numbers are well staged and electrified. Prince is undoubtedly a musical maestro, though very eccentric. If he is inspired, he is great, but often he makes songs that are just for his own taste, and sometimes his experimentation can be a fire, but it is just as many musical geniuses. The soundtrack of this movie is great, but only the Sexshooter is a weak spot. However, stopping the display of Purple Rain is challenging. This is one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
