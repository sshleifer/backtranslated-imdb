The Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural flower whose previous films have revealed the artistic excess and hollow eighties of the sixties. "The Notorious Bettie Page" refers to his uneven eye of fifty Americans, the time hidden in moral law of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing the beginning of sexual awakening, which would lead to free love for the next decade. Harron and his co-author Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopsy of the sex symbol. This is the underground icon of the film era and how his pure unashamed sexuality discovered both the predators' instincts and the uncertain thoughts of a culture that was not affected by naked body beauty. When the details of Bettie's life were all movies, why does it end before her most tragic period begins. It is clear that Harron is more interested in America's attitude towards sexual images. Together with Gretchen Mol's fearless leadership and W. Mott Hupfel III with amazingly atmospheric cinematography, he accomplishes this goal perfectly by keeping a mirror on the past, making the audience his own "enlightened" 21st-century attitudes so called pornography. As America stifles under new conservatism, this film is more than ever.
