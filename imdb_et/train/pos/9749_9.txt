I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I was certainly not the only one interested in opera, but he changed my views. I enjoyed this movie very much and I've enjoyed opera since then. I even bought several of my CDs. Who cares about what his ability to act was, he basically played himself, which was divine. He was so charming, so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many criticize him so hard. It was so straight, did not accept the people who overturned him or met him for his actions. He deserves to be honored and admired for his talent. He's definitely missed!
