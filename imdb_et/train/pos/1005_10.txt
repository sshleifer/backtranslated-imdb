The Verhoeven movie was a perfect and complete garbage. He is a nasty director of fear and should be ashamed. With his reading, he read two chapters of the book, got bored and decided to do the whole thing from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would never have supported this trash if he had seen it in life. It basically steals the name, the policy of this book (which is a good part of it) and throws it in some R & D so that the average idiot of the American filmmaker won't get bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is not perfect, but it is at least mostly accurate as possible.
