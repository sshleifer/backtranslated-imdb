This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, who played perfectly with Walter Matthau, and his cronies play the game with his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented car mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interaction between these great roles is reinforced by the amazing support of recognized character players. This movie is cute and fun ... "Feel good"! Heartfelt recommendations.
