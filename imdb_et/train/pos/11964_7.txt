I went to the cinema this afternoon to wait for Scoop. Fortunately, the film at least exceeded expectations, at least a bit. It's not heavy, something deep - and not anywhere as good as any real Allen masterpieces - but it's also quite enjoyable as a light, tortuous comedy. There's something simple and sweet. "Lovely" was the word I heard from the public when they walked after the show. It doesn't feel like Allen was hoping to create a masterpiece here, it seems she wanted to make a little comedy and have fun. Compared to almost everything Hollywood produces, Allen's things tend to charm. Even fluffy stuff. These days, it's just refreshing to go for a real human film.
