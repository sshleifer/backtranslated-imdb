Basically, I like the Verhoeven movie because in her movie I enjoy the brilliant pscychosexual story that I've seen before the "Basic Instinct" .it is really a great thriller I enjoyed very much. This is of course me this other Verhoeven watch movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this is his previous direction before his blocking screw hit the "Basic Instinct" and that's why I was very curious to watch this movie and yes, the film has fulfilled its hopes and expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant psychosexual drama that is illuminated by some audiences. The story of this film is a gay writer named "Reve" (Krabbe), an alcoholic person who lives by his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that can warn him of a future accident. introduce a seductive woman called "Christine" who has a mysterious past that she does not want to reveal. Take your sex in your house when she is a boy. next morning, she looks at her sexy, macho boyfriend on her desk with the person she met, curious to meet her and tell Christine to invite her to her home. <br /> <br /> That's it. I don't want to reveal the whole story because it's Verhoeven's movie and the end of the movie is really surprising! <br /> <br /> I especially like "Reve", which plays great "Krabbe" .i basically likes his action because, as a gay person, I am completely identified by his character and yes I love his charming face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr.Verhoeven for making this black comedy. br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie in 10 out of 10.
