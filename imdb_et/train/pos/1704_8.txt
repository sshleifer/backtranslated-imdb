"I moved out of here to get such a thing!" Small town sheriff strikes. <br /> <br /> "Is this happening in Chicago?" His deputy asks. Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians are carrying Halloween around the Orson Welles World War as a report of a true Mars invasion and conclude that they must act! The following are a bunch of bugs that include Mars' accidental attempts to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL". Everyone comes to the conclusion that they are kids in really good costumes, except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend, the boy's suit baby. <br /> <br /> The Mars themselves are comic and you get the impression that they are not threatening anyone, but not yourself. It's a fun family movie.
