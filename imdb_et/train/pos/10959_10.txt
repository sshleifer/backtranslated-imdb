All I can say is that if you don't love the big and small Edie after watching this movie, you are not a human! Even after it was first seen, I was hooked. It's a mesmerizing experience that is hard to describe because I'm sure other fans will confirm. After you look at it, you cry to think that these two wonderful women are no longer with us. At least we have gray gardens to remember! I think we all have long independence that these two ladies were honored with. Although I have always been admired by Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she won't be in your heart as Big and Little Edie do. What rare treatment is the knowledge of such people; I just wish I had!
