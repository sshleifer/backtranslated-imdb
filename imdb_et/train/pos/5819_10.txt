I've loved this movie since it first came out. I was about nine years old and now I'm 27. I remember playing Sega Genisis video game. I was so much fun when I wanted to show my son this movie. He also likes Michael Jackson and I know he loves this movie just like I was when I was a kid. Even if he's a lot younger than I was when I first saw it. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD! I hope it will appear on DVD! Please give it to the DVD! I'm dying to see it again! Well, this is my comment I hope one day I can watch the movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
