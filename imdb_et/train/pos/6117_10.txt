All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you are even "PC" remotely, or if you do not have serious confusion with a sense of humor, you probably won't. As this movie is sick and disgusting, it is really a comedy and not a "horror" movie. If you can understand someone who pushes the limits of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme, then to the point where it is so comic that you must believe it. This movie is so out of control that a big movie studio couldn't do it 10 feet (with a condom). In my opinion, the best, most extreme works of art are above ground. If you do not stay with the same old formula that people get used to, they will reject it. <br /> <br /> I have seen terrible, boredom, z-class, indy movies that were just a good VHS tape or DVD-R waste. I have also seen a stack of stink bombs from large studios that were a waste of millions of dollars. If NO BUDGET comes out like these two Ron Atkins / John Giancasprois and blows all the other "shock" movies out of the water, you must definitely watch the whole Indy movie scene. After that, you really see how much freedom the Indy filmmaker has when they work. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, even other people who saw this movie and "hated it". testify that they laughed all over. I don't think it's possible for anyone to look at them. So if you do not take everything you have seen in the mainstream media too seriously, and you can laugh with a misanthropic, puppet-producing psychopath who has finally grabbed you, then you must see it. You can just see it for an independent, cult classic, what it is. Both schizophrenia / schizophrenia 2 have more than 1000 DVDs among my favorite.
