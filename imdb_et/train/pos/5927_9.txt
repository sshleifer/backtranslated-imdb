Stephen King's movies are a funny thing to me. I really love them or I fuck them. Some of the poorer productions (like Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy. Some smaller ones, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is what I really enjoy and I watch it regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shaping the changing beings who, despite being a human being, become like cats. They are immune to the scratches of cats and whenever they move to a new city, they can catch and kill animals. When they go to their last city, they have to look for a virgin and if Charles finds one, he actually falls for him, but his mother must feed him heavily. The story revolves around what happens to the girl. Does Charles save her or use her to save her mother. <br /> <br /> Although this story contains recordings of incest, some of which may cause discomfort, it actually plays the story and is therefore not just a scandal in the movie. Like most of Stephen King's stories, it is located in a small town with many interesting signs. Operation is not the best, but also special effects, but somehow the whole thing tends to "gel" and it is a very traceable and enjoyable customization. <br /> <br /> For UK Readers: This production has been most recently featured on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror channels.
