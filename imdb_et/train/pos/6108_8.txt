I enjoyed this movie very much. Many people in Korea feel familiar with this film because many of them have instructors in school. Cinematography was average. The film would have been better if the angel or camera movement were more irregular. However, editing was very clean and unusual. <br /> <br /> Operation was also very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played innocent, weak girl in Korean soap opaera. But this time he plays a very cute tomboy. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role as very credible. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this movie is not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romance movies that characters cry in front of the river in front of the audience and I thought it was very outdated. There was no such crap in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well done.
