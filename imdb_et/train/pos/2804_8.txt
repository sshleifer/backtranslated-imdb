The title of this movie made me almost watch. Not just a Manchester United fan, but Beckham's mention was a bit down, but I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much of the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film came up with me, never looking at my watch and enjoying every second of the movie. If you liked East, you love this movie. OK, so the story is nothing new and the classic story is in the movie, but it's all done very calmly and with fresh air. Film moves very fast and keeps audiences entertained. Historical funny moments are good crying and not some bad sense of humor, and best of all it is a good British comedy.
