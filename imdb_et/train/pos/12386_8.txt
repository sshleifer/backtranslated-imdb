'' Sentinel '' is one of the best horror films already made in the movie! I think it is very scary because there are very few movies in fact. Alison Parker is a famous model. He writes the name of Michael Lerman, a lawyer, and is the best friend, another model called Jennifer. Everything was great in her life until she decided to live alone for a while and rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is with his neighbors who are very, very strange. Suddenly Alison is experiencing health problems and frequencies; He also remembers some painful facts about his past, which makes him a nightmare or illusion. But everything has a reason, and it is related to the new house he lives ... <br /> <br /> I personally find 'Sentinel' a very creepy movie and with '' exorcist '' they are the two most scary a movie I've already watched. When we discover that Alison's house is only a priest, and he himself froze my blood! It is also terrible to see that he has to become blind at the end of the film to be a new sentinel who keeps the monsters away from our world.
