"Written Wind" is an irresistible, perfectly kinky movie, because only Director Sirk could have done it. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freud symbols, strange melodramatics and colorful contrasts. The main theme of the film is the link between financial success and moral degradation. The circus seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. But I prefer to see the film as an excellent example of what Sirk could do with chips. The color palette is particularly impressive. Acting in the film is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an elegant aura, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (he has won the best supporting actor Oscar) who can keep the film at the boiling point. Kudos Frank Skinner's pulsating score, Russell Metty's brilliant camera works (every shot is a masterpiece in itself) and a production design department. Moreover, tuning the title is a beauty. This is an unforgettable movie.
