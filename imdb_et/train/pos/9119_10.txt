An interesting way to see how we behave as people so often is sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection, which we sometimes destroy what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the question of how we tend to ignore those who are not so explicit among us, and in doing so we can have a great opportunity. Comedy injecting makes watching a movie an enjoyable experience. Everyone who is interested in reflective but comic life must see. I look forward to your next product. Great work ...... Joanne
