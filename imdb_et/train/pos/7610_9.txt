Only seen in season 1, but it's just great! There are many people on the island. Nobody is who they seem to be and everybody seems to have a lot of skeletons in their closets .... it looks like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is it so big? It is probably not only when a spoonful of full X files is advertised, a dose of "what"? and the great "hey" and the island that you have ever dreamed of - in your most amazing nightmares and you lose. The story got so many turns that are incredible. Great structure, confident action with liberating acceptance that there are good and bad sides at the end of everyone (well almost everyone ... I think ...). But weird oh so weird ...
