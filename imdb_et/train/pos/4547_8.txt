It could be 10 if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood-patriotic scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the leading players in our time (why not ask for leadership) and the rest cast on a very high level. I personally impressed Hugh O 'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a child. The first scene I watched was really strong. Wow.
