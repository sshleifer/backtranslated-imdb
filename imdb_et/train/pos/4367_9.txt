I haven't seen this movie for years, so my knowledge is a little rusty. I remember that this film is twice Braveheart's film. It's just more realistic and has more credible signs. Ridb Roy looks like it would be imagined that Rob Roy looks like dirty hair and beard in simple clothes. Liam Nesson also has a Celtic look at him, he looks like Scotland and more importantly, Rob Roy. This is a comparison that refers to some people but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is supposed to play a man whose legend has been described by him as a 6 foot 7 giant, while Gibson is almost a shorter leg. The story includes a little romance, conspiracy, and underfilling. Sound like Braveheart? Instead of "Freedom", Freedom and Nationalism, we get a movie that says honor, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting film. Like the Gladiator. The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavor. The story is great when it comes to heroism and humanity. The scene where Mary is raped, and she walks from a burning house with true Scottish force, is followed by washing her sperm from her footpath in extreme panic. This is something that the heroine Braveheart never does. Generally it is stunning and almost flawless. Go and see it!
