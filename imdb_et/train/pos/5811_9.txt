Only 9/10 of me, the perfect ten would have been if there were more plot for the movie, but still Moonwalker is still a fun festival of music, dance and entertainment. From the video clip editing to Jackson's long career, he reminds the viewer why he is often considered a pop king. From our hit "I want you back" "We are the world", a multi-award winning charity record for Africa. According to this short movie, although it is weak in the Oscar winning script, it offers the audience a fantastic and fun drama. Completion is perfect (sexy!) By "Come together". Something that the whole family can see and enjoy.
