Although it is structured completely differently from Tim Krabb√©'s book, which wrote the original "The Vanishing", it has the same general feeling, except that Koolhoven's style is less entrepreneurial and lyrical. The start is great, the middle is good, but the sting is at the end. Surprisingly emotional end. As you can read in several magazines, there is sex in the film, but it is done very beautifully. Never express, but a lot of heat and sometimes even humor. It's a shame that American movies can't be as open as it is. When Dutch films tend to be over the edge of this theme, De Grot always remains within the limits of good taste. "De Grot" talks about an amazing story that has stretched over 30 years. When you leave the cinema, move it. What can we ask for more about the film? Anyway, this movie even gives you more.
