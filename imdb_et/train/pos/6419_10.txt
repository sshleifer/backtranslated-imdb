This movie is an excellent military film. It may not be a great Hollywood movie, but it doesn't matter. Hollywood has a great sacrifice of entertainment accuracy, but that's not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found this movie too slow for their taste, but ??? as a retired soldier? I appreciate that the film's team deliberately took their story as fully as possible, taking two hours and nine minutes away. The story itself has been repeatedly talked about and retreated, but is it a professional soldier? and an African American? Report the story of the film team and present the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's activity as a naval diver and his life as a naval diver after his graduation is not the only story he has given. There I also read about how the Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday defied his illegal order by his chief officer that the Petty Officer of Grade 2 Brashear should not pass his attempt to dive no matter how well he did, and paid the price for one loss and divestiture modification. It also tells the story of how Brashear found the Atlantic Ocean lost in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another sailor who was on a sliding line that would be hit. in two, when Brashear had not taken her off the road and took her off. It was a difficult story to talk about, and I admit that two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the whole story, and I can say from the scenes deleted from the DVD that the team tried to tell their story. to the fullest extent possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to have seen such a great story on such a wide scale and to see the naval traditions and respect both naturally and completely.
