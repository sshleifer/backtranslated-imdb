I've just been to Showtime in California for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. You think the recent wave of serial filmmakers is that California is worth mentioning in some of the earlier films, but hasn't done so. Perhaps, if this film sometimes appeared between 1996 and 1999, it might have been more successful. In my opinion, "California" differs from the most consecutive killer films published in the late 1990s. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of the modern killer movies like "Seven" or "Bone Collector". Many successive killer films have shown a murderer, but this person is always behind the mask or we never see them enough to actually learn. "California" is a film that actually tries to break this barrier and understand the criminals. He is trying to answer questions like "why do they do the things they do? Is it due to something that happened in their past? Does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they do it because they like killing the thrill?" some things "california" is trying to answer but also leave room for us to try to think things out ourselves. Brad Pitt is an eternal impression of an early gray. When we first meet at the beginning of the movie, we see that he is probably a disturbed person. When we see him for the first time, it's late at night. Drunk may be early. Then we see how he grabs the stone, throw the bridge away, and then lands on the windscreen of the passing car. Pitt is tight in this movie. It is always good to see him playing psychos or really bad people. It's funny that it would later make him pretty much like "12 Monkeys" and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum with David Fincher's "Seven".
