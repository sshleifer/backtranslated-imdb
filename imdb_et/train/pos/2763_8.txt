People tend to complain about the number of films made about people with mental disabilities. I do not see it as the right criticism, no more than the complaints of too many films about all kinds of people. Jaco van Dormael is doing a great job with script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work great together when Duquenne plays. The film has a surprisingly large base of events and is not just content that goes over the Rain Man example. The end is rather frustrating, but it doesn't destroy before a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
