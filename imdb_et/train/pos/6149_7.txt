I have just bought a revamped movie that I remember a lot of affection from childhood, and it is definitely meant to be curious in the afternoon. Bedknobs is definitely more sensible in its full form, deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) combine events quite properly. It's a bit uncomfortable how scenes have been rebuilt. It is clear that the soundtrack of this film material was lost or damaged, so some of Disney's bright sparks decided to copy the scenes with a new dialogue. What would have been great, except that the parties were not cast to do it (some for better reasons than others) and the whole thing is quite uncertain. Some of the lips synchronization is pretty poor, and David Tomlinson's voice has duplicated something that sounds absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson (I think it's actually a German hint). However, it is good to hear the full versions of all the songs (though "Step in the right direction" is not yet there) and the moments of magic in this film still stand out. And I urge you not to interfere with the young Pauls so innocently looking at Angela Lansbury and coos, "but what about my button?"
