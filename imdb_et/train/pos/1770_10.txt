In the previews, the "40-year-old virgin" boasts another immature sex, with about 40-seat Lonely Guy, who suddenly feels willing to act just because she hasn't done so. Too much of the past bad experience has reduced her enthusiasm for completely avoiding women. And then unexpected happens: he falls in love. What's more, this is a film called "40-year-old Virgin". <br /> <br /> The virgin title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is really 40 years old. an employee in a electronics store and collects vintage figures that are displayed everywhere in her beautiful bachelor block. She has a nice home theater system and she watches "Survivor" with her two kinds of elderly neighbors. He's a pretty picturesque definition of Lonely Guy, who has to go more and talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now here's the real novelty of this picture: it makes it impossible to deal with the theme of cute and mature fashion. This is a film that would have become very transparent in the hands of much more transparent filmmakers. It could have come to endless sexually transmitted diseases and jokes, but fortunately this picture is never low. Of course there is a sex game here, and even a few prods are directed to the gay community (which is by no means intended for homo-bashing), because two characters exchange offenses against the video game ("Mortal Kombat: Fraud," no less - the best testosterone-based fight for men "). . <br /> <br /> Like someone who is fast approaching 20, McFarlane Toys collects performance and has never done it myself. I found this movie in an amusing and touching way that a similar theme would never have been. Andy Stitzer character more than someone in the theater because I was the only teenager who was at this show, everyone else saw them all past the 40th, a little arrogant, I know, but would you ("your" in italics) still be able to associate if you were the only servant who was in the afternoon "40-year-old Virgin"? <br /> <br /> Of course, Andy has never had sex and wakes up daily with the "morning rise" (don't ask), and she's with her friendspressured to try to attract aliens. the opposite sex. When it was first discovered, Andy's virgin, at 40, her three friends and fellow colleagues David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) first assume she's gay because she's never been with a woman that cannot be beyond the truth. The truth is that Andy loves women, but the traumatic experiences of the past (which appeared afterwards one after another in a fun way) have been abandoned by her. <br /> <br /> David, Jay and Cal will start each and every mission of Andy, so help them all. But you know that such escapades end up with a catastrophe only, as Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy through the worst rash experience on one day, which I think nobody would go through and has a rather horrible clash with Beth (Elizabeth Banks) , a beautiful girl who works in a bookstore and has finally shown it to be a full sex event. <br /> <br /> Things that light up Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), a friendly woman who works in a shop across the street selling things to people on eBay. Hmmm. And with this nice-looking set of action imagery you can go see that, in the end, a big financial reward is waiting for him, that is, if he can "do the act." <br /> <br /> is the gender we expect. It deals with a very real question that many Lonely Guys are likely to pass through, not that something is wrong with a virgin, but look at the big picture: How many of us "Lonely Guys" want to be a lonely man forever? The important thing we teach in this picture is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I don't think he has to go through body waxing like Andy (which is fair, and according to this website and other news it was really real, and so was Carelli's shirt after blood)). <br /> <br /> "The 40-year-old virgin" was directed by Judd Apatow and also wrote to himself and Carell, who started with the Carelli Scit. Carell is sweet and humane because her character is not anyone who approaches this thing with her eyes. This is probably one of the most intelligent rumors I've ever seen and that is not offensive (a whole lot) because his characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carelli's mates, who give bad advice to cover the uncertainty of their relationship, can be at a fundamental level. <br /> <br /> How a "40-year-old virgin" plays is really funny at last, but I'll leave it with you, the viewer, shut. Certainly, if anyone can look at things with Andy and still have the strength to attract a sexy woman like Catherine Keener, it's true: it's never too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
