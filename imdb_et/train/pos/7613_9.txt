/ The first episode I saw in Lost made me think, what was some people who collapsed and got a giant monster. But it is not that it is much more, because they are not at all a monster and every episode you see in Lost is always better. an abandoned island with an underground bunker, and especially a connection between people who baptized each other before they fell. It's a secret. <br /> <br /> This series of rules and I can't wait to find out what's really going on there. I hope they won't let the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series deserves 9 out of 10
