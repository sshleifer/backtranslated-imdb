This film was interesting by Hollywood's novel Pearl S. Buck. Some may think today that it is widespread with racial stereotypes, but now the idea of ​​Chinese tribes was progressive in itself. I found that white actors who played Chinese were not as bad as I expected it to be an Asian black-and-white equivalent. Then there was really no Asian actress in America (not even George Takei) and Rainer did a good job. It wasn't the biggest result I've ever seen, but it was great for the old school pre-method. Jaanika's scene was very well taken off and contained convincing special effects. <br /> <br /> I do not know that the timing of release during the Great Depression makes it a movie allegory. Particularly peasant farmers are faced with an astonishing political upheaval and how they are all left behind. The film had some parallels with John Ford's style, but I think it was influenced by the eastern effect. . If it had been a Western family, the fruitful would eventually have won, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust and innocence. But he learns his lesson, then wins.
