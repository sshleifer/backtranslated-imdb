Cassandra Peterson originally set up Elvira as a late night filmmaker, and when this sign was unexpectedly popular, he suddenly found himself doing everything from beer ads to The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. He came to the top of his popularity in the late 1980s and produced the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK. <br /> <br /> The plot is weighty. Elvira's television host, Elvira, dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her big aunt dies, she drives to New England in the hope that the estate will give enough time to show her performances; he is disappointed when he found he has inherited a ruthless house, a bottle and an old book. It happens that the city is beyond the description, and it provokes the right indignation wherever it goes. It also happens that his great uncle is secretly evil in the war, and is very much planning to put his hands on the "old book". Throw a teenager, a stud muffin and an angry woman who has falsies and you go there. <br /> <br /> Nobody accuses him of being a cinematic masterpiece and drags it on now and then. But from the beginning, Cassandra Peterson demonstrates a tremendous noise: mixing the dirty, sexy and low-humor humor with a sharp comedy flash, dancing through a movie like a ringmaster in a horny and often circus of self-conscious jokes. From the FLASHDANCE disaster to the madness of witchcraft, it is never less than wild entertainment. It's a lot of fun, and the film's conclusion can even cause considerable tension. Is Elvira the best of his evil uncle and save the day? Well, I don't want to give up, so let's say you have a lot of fun finding out. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD is okay and there is little bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something stupid, it will definitely match your desire. And if you have never seen a bother, you are a cure. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
