If you've never seen this movie and acted like old veterans, it's your movie. Seeing Frank Sinatra, when he was very young and very thin, drowned with cheeks and a great voice that sang some old songs. Michele Morgan (Millie Pico) gave outstanding results with dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) played an excellent supporting role with Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who made a classical piano and did not hit comedy as he did during his career. It is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was very pleased to see his career early in the 1940s.
