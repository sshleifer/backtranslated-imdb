The comedy masterpiece, the masterpiece of horror, the masterpiece of romance, if there is something negative about the Chinese Ghost Story, may be that the special effects were outdated compared to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: a bad debtor must remain in a lonely area at the time of debt collection. Of course, this also happens to haunt. <br /> <br /> What I didn't expect this movie for the first time is that it is one of the most touching love songs I've ever seen; it doesn't lose any slapstick comedy that will make you sew. Unlike Asian cinema films, the Chinese ghost story is not difficult to swallow for those who have not known Chinese culture. Indeed, it plays timeless, non-cultural paranormal and romantic themes. <br /> <br /> Think of the evil one 2 if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix. This movie is real, even though many have forgotten it. This is absolutely one of the best I've ever seen. It is the ability to combine the best aspects of several genres and overcome cultural boundaries to turn to humanity everywhere, nothing fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.
