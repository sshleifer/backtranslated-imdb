I thought it was great and I still do. I am grateful that we can still see the various things Hollywood is flooding with us. Grace saving is smart and enjoyable - those who feel offensive to marijuana are better off seeing an American bride movie. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid. I smiled at my ass most of that time, but I also wondered what was the female leader who had to pay her dead husband. <br /> <br /> In short - a funny story with typical English humor for good action and leadership. You couldn't ask more. <br /> <br /> 7/10
