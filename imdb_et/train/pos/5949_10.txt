Hi again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and plausible story of romance and intrigue. Music is wonderful and memorable. Very good color film. Another movie I liked later was the High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thank you for your hearing, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
