This is a real eye candy. The world is made of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Huge monsters whose preferred attack method attacks the cathedral with their opponents ... Who can resist it? Ancient prophecy, a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess looking for her hero ... seem familiar ...? Yes, we heard this song before. However, you forget that you are watching spectacular landscapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch when it lasts. But after leaving the cinema, you miss a little more story. <br /> <br /> What's behind a 30-year round? What brought the knight crazy? Who built these fabulous monuments, castles and towns ... and why do they break down? And besides that, a bunch of farmers, where are the people? Really, this picture seems so intriguing, but it is not the Lord of the Rings.
