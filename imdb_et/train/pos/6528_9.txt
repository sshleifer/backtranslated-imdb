I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was absolutely in that. I love awesomely made fancy scenes. This is an amazing set-design. The scenes look like they were filmed in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so nice. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * Front Spoilers * <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about fantastic Blues men, black-and-white-old black men playing guitar and singing. It's really amazing. But it also blends into new bands and this is perhaps one thing I don't like in this documentary. It is too rich to use links to modern rock bands that play these Blues songs in a modern way. I didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome Blues songs. This is the same imperfect musical taste I found when I looked at Wim Wenders Buena Vista's social club. this documentary appeared to all and normal tourists at Croisette Beach in a free movie theater. While the sand, the quality of the projection, and the poor quality of the sound apparently made it a difficult experience to enjoy the thousands of people who sat in the sand that night.
