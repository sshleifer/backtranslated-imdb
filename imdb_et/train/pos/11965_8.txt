As I read the various "Scoop" comments in recent days, I walked to the theater that was made for Woody. Fortunately, I would not have been wrong anymore. Woody, that the performer slows the touch or two, but Woody, the writer / director, is in a fine form - and found a reliable way to integrate his 70-year-old self. Based on laughter and guilt, the audience lived in a one-time lining and dialogue with Allen in a way I haven't seen for years. <br /> <br /> The film's landscape, dominated by software-approved stories, a two-dimensional taste and a voucher collection, is a source of satisfaction and inspiration to see that Allen follows her very personal and satisfying path.
