"Victor does not have much, but it does not prevent him from trying to go to Judy, the most beautiful girl. Everything he has is a hope and one-bedroom apartment he shares with his family. Trust him, his brother worships him, and his half-sister just declared war, but Victor thinks that love can really conquer everything in this warm, authentic and touching romantic comedy about a part of the city that most people don't see, "a summary of DVD sleeves. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett's "Victor Vargas Raising" invites actor Victor Rasuki (Victor Vargas) and cast an interesting "debut" performance. Mr. Rasuk and juicy Judy Marte (like Judy Gonzalez) are sexy and loving sexual attraction joy discovering the "Lower East Side Kids". Considering how attractive they look at this picture, it is not difficult to predict that they will join - and although you do not know how they are "innocent", their characterization seems to be true. <br /> <br /> Victor's brother "Nino" plays Victor's brother, Silvestre Rasuk, who looks at his older brother. Sometimes it is nice to see the film brothers who actually look the same; and hopefully they will work together again. "Cocoa Coconut Sister" sister Krystal Rodriguez (like Vicki) and the old world of Altagracia Guzman (in the form of a grandmother) round off the sex-starved Dominican immigrant family. So, are the age-old movies coming in with the camera in hand or what? <br /> <br /> ******* Victor Theft (16.05.02) Peter Sollett ~ Victor Rasuk, July Marte, Silvestre Rasuk
