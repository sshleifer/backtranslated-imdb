I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa Film Festival and this is one of the best I've seen this year. The big screen (and I mean BIG, not one of these TV screens) has an excellent sound system that always enhances cinematic experience, because the film takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you in. <br /> <br /> that is loosely related. Their stories were crossing at certain points, and many lines of the story reminded me of the great Altman and his fine films. But the real hero of the film is probably the city of Madrid, which gives the whole film the background. It contains symbols, includes walkways and the paths they walk on, and sets the background for all events, all beautifully filmed scenes. <br /> <br /> The return of the movie will take place on certain topics (shoes, for example), making Salazar increasingly understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses. It combines city views with characters and elegantly matches the scene's background. A set of talented actors helps him to depict a variety of characters. One great example is the scene where Juaquin takes Anita for the first time across the street. It may not work on a small screen, but it gave me a big bump on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The film's message is very positive, so the movie is sometimes light and funny. The music along the film is usually a couple, with some instrumental pieces (I hope I put one in the music world, though I doubt seriously). <br /> <br /> All together, I came out of this movie is a sensational feeling and I have not just impressed (you have to take that word). For this and more, I give this film a strong 8/10.
