Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to leave his little life in Texas and make it big in the big city. Women are there to ask and men are mostly "tutti-fruttis". Wide-eyed, he comes to New York City, not ready for a number of humiliating misadventures he experiences, one worse than the other. In the midst of this chaos, he meets friends with Rico "Racso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless person who apparently lives in a condemned building. <br /> <br /> The story is not much MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes designed to bring not only Joe Buck's views, but also his past and show us the shock cuts and half-psychedelic dreams of his past: his failed relationship with him his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt), raped, her abandonment by her mother, and her obvious abuse by her grandmother, who also had the habit of financing men. The air of pessimism dominates the film from the very beginning, when Nilsson plays the entire opening credit he deceptively floral "Everybody's Talking"; we feel that even if we want Joe to finally notice his brand, it is likely that he will not be able to start working on the pennies that are in the final job - see the masterful shot from his external point later in the movie when he watches that the man works through the window in the dishwasher in the dishwasher and sees himself. We know from the point of view of our eyes that he does not want to stop this. <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger creates stupendous hopes of blind hopes in the late 1960s with haunted images of lost souls, and in the middle, twin-minded friendship, as they struggle in some sense in the midst of an incomprehensible comfort of dignified life. There is an indirect perception that they could have been lovers - Ratso arrives at Joe's party scene and their ultimate acceptance ultimately points to it - but it is essentially a friend movie that can survive literally with death and Joe, who at the end of Florida seems a lot changed, older, wiser.
