Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) will be close to rock stars in the future, but they still need more work on their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted will be in the popular popular history, but then the evil man (Joss Ackland) will be killed by Bill & Ted, sending cyber-angels to destroy them. The Kyborgs are sent to the past and they kill the real Bill & Ted. Now, both boys are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> The directors of Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) made smart follow-up with amazing visual effects. Much more fun and fun than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals the exhibition as Grim Reaper. The DVD / DVD has a good anamorphic wide screen (1.85: 1) and exquisite Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has a theatrical trailer and a shade of a fun scene. This sequel was Box Office as original, but it is also (Believe it or not), one of the best queues that have ever been made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin repeats his role briefly in the original. Pam Grier also seems to have a bit of a role to play. This is an enjoyable fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
