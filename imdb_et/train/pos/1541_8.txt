I just saw this movie today at Seattle International Film Festival and enjoyed it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Great writing and direction, great and credible interaction between most and great comic timing. <br /> <br /> This film concerns topics that are universal and isolated. As a result, I see European, Asian and American audiences who find all the points of similarity between this film and their life. <br /> <br /> If all that wasn't enough, this potential is the best underground movie of the year ... anyone spreading it in the US, please! <br /> <br /> Finally, thank Maria Flom! This is really a great movie.
