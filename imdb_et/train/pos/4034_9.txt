Pinjar is a really good film with a good actor, a good narrative, a good presentation, emotions and more. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of Bollywood films is improving these days and this film is one of the proofs. <br /> <br /> No Bollywood movie I remember has such an effect on me - I literally thought about a movie for a few hours - wondering about the different emotional situations that are experimenting with a human being. <br /> <br /> The film is based on Urmilla Matondkar and some Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in the background of the partition in northern India and all the troubles seem sweet compared to the problems she is facing. <br /> <br /> Need a movie. A technically good Bollywood product that I find comparable to movies from other countries in the world.
