Now a days, most people don't watch classic movies like this. Most friends only watch movies from the 90s. It has been confirmed. <br /> <br /> Most of these old movies are masterpieces that are unique in their own way. Just because these movies were thought and done when the ideas were fresh. Now people are just struggling with new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, film. For true fans of classic horror. This is for you. The film is based on a researcher from Scotland Yard, who is investigating the disappearance of an actor and gets into three other strange events with previous residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying anymore because I destroy the movie more than I already have. But this is a great movie as old as it is. And never mind watching it again!
