I've just been watching all 6 episodes on DVD. A working collection is great - no question. I didn't have to act enough for what I have to say. There is no real relationship, but a lot of first-class character development. Something like Tinker Tailor "whodunnit". If you like a good story slowly and carefully, then this is for you. Peter Egan as Head Magnus Pym is great. <br /> <br /> The film depicted the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British intelligence service, but who was so psychologically damaged by such an unhappy childhood that fraud was a lifestyle for everyone. As a child, he adored his father, but his father was repeatedly and worshiped. Pym did not betray ideology or money, but because he had to cheat on the closest people (wife, son, mentor). Pym is deadly damaged by his father's influence - it has eaten his moral fiber. He has no real love or loyalty in him. <br /> <br /> Severe psychological stuff and not the light moments of the 6-hour series. Very well done.
