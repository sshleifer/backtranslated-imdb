I adored this movie. Not only because I am a great fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he is in almost all German films. But also because he is not the main actor. Lead takes over Barnaby Metschura, who was the only reason to watch the Juliet of 2001 and who really carries it on the shoulder of the film. <br /> <br /> The family moves from Italy to Germany, looking for a "German dream" (this is my own invention and ironic ...) cheap labor in the steel and coal industry. But they finally open up the restaurant and the journey that the film only takes to that point is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From that moment on, the two main brothers of this family are Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream as a filmmaker threatens to rival his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. Here's a great - and completely neutral - look at what life can do with the choices you make. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie does not say what life (Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or more complete or more interesting. It only gives us a glimpse of what it is to look for in the identity of two countries and the way of thinking. and this image is not driven by bitterness or contempt for either country, which makes it such a big film for any country that is dealing with the tensions arising from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin moved from Turkey to Germany in the 1970s also gives this film a measure of high credibility and emotional accuracy. Cake icing is a fantastic show for the whole cast, especially by Metschurat and - it's really a stress - a little boy who plays the young Gigi. This child's performance would be a difficult act, followed by almost everyone! Great movie, look at it.
