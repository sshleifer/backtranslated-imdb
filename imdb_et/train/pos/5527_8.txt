Maybe there is a special reason why Fox and Child hit a special note in my heart. Having recently said goodbye to his new groom - one day - in an unknown time, I was a little overwhelmed with various emotions and suffered a little to put the bold face he needed. <Br /> <br /> I watched some movies and TV shows, but I missed what I missed, what is there and what I haven't seen. For this, I have this movie to thank. <br /> <br /> Being a lover of nature and listening to the movie, I was sure I would still like it. But I didn't like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Technical mastery is amazing. How did they do that? How did they catch the animals the way they did? It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is good and although the end is oh French and unclear, it's happy / sad. Again, he tried to catch me a little. As a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the end was over, while people on the plane were seen in the next 15 hours! Perhaps it is because the end ended with thinking back to what I left. And it's life. Of course, there are things you love and feel comfortable with ... but the big outdoors has a lot of secrets. So next time I see something out of the ordinary when it opens; I look at it, follow it and take it. That's exactly what's going to happen in this movie, and that's what you should do with this movie / nature doc. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It's two months after the airplane journey. We still do not know when we will see each other again, but we want.
