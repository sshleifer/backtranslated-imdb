The beautiful story of Stardust has been written by Neil Gaiman (MirrorMaski writer) and is really a good story. I think it likes all the labyrinths, the princesses' brides or the fans of the 10th kingdom, but it's completely unique and stands for it. And I feel that it is a much better end to adjusting the story of the story than what Neil Gaiman presented in his original novel. I won't break it for you. <br /> <br /> The main character Tristan (in the novel Tristran) is the son of a mortal and faerie slave kept in the witch field. The story begins with a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. If there is a falling star, Tristan promises to pull it on to the girl he has announced. She is not aware that the star in the girl's world has turned into a girl, and after her there are others. Three elderly witches who want to get their hearts back into youth, and some are beaten by princes. <br /> <br /> This is a really good story. It has humor, magic and beauty, a surreal scene and a visual. It's charming and I feel it can be followed by kids and adults of all ages. It's just magical. This is a real classic fairy tale that resembles a cinema since the 1980s.
