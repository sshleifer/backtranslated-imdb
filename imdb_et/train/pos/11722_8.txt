Frankly, I only watched this movie because of my puberty needs. I was thinking I couldn't get women at my age (I was 9 or 10) so I thought watching Elvira was splitting into a wardrobe for sex. <br /> <br /> I finished this time with this cult. classic about horror comedy, halloween parties, sassy humor and some sexy evil appear on Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just don't make such movies anymore ... It was a feeling of amateur effort to mix late night cable shows with host style. The truth is that it created a lot of fans because it is humor and Cassandra is able to present it. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that reminds me of the good days of the US Up All Night.
