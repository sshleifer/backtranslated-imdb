What I was expecting: A pretty flat overly stereotypical imagination of a sports-crazy guy and equally flat stereotypical imagination of a gal who likes it, but there is another banana that is his very eager support for his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: a homogeneous story where both man and gal finally acknowledge - to themselves and to each other - that they all have passions in their lives, but everyone can forgive others for sharing the love they share <br /> <br /> Sounds gentle, but with non-endless humor and terrible performances, this story works! Barrymore is a classic Barrymore: it's a great mix of sweet, strong and divine. We expect it from him and he will deliver. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is a nice surprise for this movie. It brings the blend of a perfect sports nut together with the recognition of the ordinary things in the living environment, like caring for children and his girlfriend. Fallon offers its features with subtle perfection. He may be caring ("You just ran over the field for me!") And at the same time his love for Red Sox was blinded ("How did the lawn feel? Kinda spongy?"). Fallon's image "made" a movie. Hopefully, this film is the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond the supreme supreme humor (ie Will Ferrell) that characterizes the SNLs. <br /> <br /> In short, a film that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male and female characters that went beyond this limitation and gave nonopop on-site humorous features that were most prominent in Fallon's brilliant nuance. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw it with my husband - not a baseball fan - and he loved it as much as I did. It's not "Guy Flick" or "Chick Flick". It's a terrible laugh. Look at this!
