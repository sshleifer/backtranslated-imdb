I cried my heart, watching this movie. I have never eaten any eating disorder, but I think it has to be the right picture. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is great! He expresses these feelings amazingly well. My teenage years came to me so lively. Anyone who has had a child or teenager in difficult times can be associated with this film. I suggest you see it! <br /> <br /> Music is also great - I have now discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I am also looking forward to seeing Alison Lohman in the White Ol√©ander because I'm positive, she fits perfectly into Agnes's role.
