Letters that do not have a destination reach the world behind the post offices of the other world. Here Alice can start working on finding a lost father. What he discovers is Frank's tortured soul. Quietly a small Aussie flic that came and went to the cinema. Now you will find this video store in a deep dark corner that hides fifty copies of this horrible GODZILLA movie. It is a disgrace because it turned out to be a satisfying film that tells a brave story with strong, simple images and effective presentations from two leaders. This film succeeds when Garry Marshall's second letter, Dear God (1996 - USA), failed and is close to Kevin Costner's turkey, but to Jianjun POSTMAN (1995 - China).
