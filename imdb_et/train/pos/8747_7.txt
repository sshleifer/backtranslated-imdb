* Possible Spoilers * Although Brokedown's Midnight Express and Back to Paradise (and better), he still hits the chord. <br /> <br /> Here is a story of two young girls who travel through Thailand and are arrested for drug trafficking. Was it Clare Danes' Alice? Was it Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? Was it a beautiful stranger with whom they met? None of this is really important because it is a story of friendship and trust and the limits they can stretch. Throw Bill Pullman as a uniquely styled lawyer and Jacqueline Kimina as your Thai bride (and a better lawyer than she is) and we have a nice little story that keeps the audience focused. <br /> <br /> The Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary or, for any reason, notorious - it's not the original concept, it doesn't show sensational violence that leads to the wannabe-avant-garde crowd that says it's "sharp realism "or" hard hit "- it's just a good story with some fine performances. Bill Pullman is weak when he is a lazy pull and a dirty way of speaking - I was completely bored of nature. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, though decent, has nothing remarkable. He's doing well, but it's not exactly memorable. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim is still in good shape, looking at a pleasant and defined character that doesn't really do much work. <Br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake - it's Clare Danes movie. I've long been a fan of my work, and it's not a change. He is fascinated by every scene he appears on, and if it were not for him, the film would probably be boring. I particularly praise him in the scene between him and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The film also has an excellent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
