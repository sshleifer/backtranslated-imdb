Those who only remember Mr. Peetri Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional racer would do well in the charm of the late 60s. Ustinov stars as a convicted offender (we see him for the first time on his last day when he prepares a prison governor's tax declaration) who, feeling the future of computers, is a (identity theft deficiency) like a computer expert and is going to penetrate America's international countries. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who wrote the script together) is in the top form, as well as the pleasant Maggie Smith, who is an unusually accident hero -sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also puts an amusing result on a suspicious executive with Maggie Smith's designs. In addition, Karl Malden is quietly funny as the boss of Ustinov and Newhart's wife. <br /> <br /> What does this movie really like? Not only is it a thoughtful "capricorn", it is also a tiny love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing, because the two are misguided in love (the whole card, which covers the card deck, is particularly effective.) <br /> <br /> So, what doesn't you like? Well, the script is no longer computer-literate than most movies (it is hardly any), although it captures the feeling of doing business in the late 1960s with a large railroad. There are also a few small plot errors that you probably won't see until the second or third look, but I think they are small niggles. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie you are looking for and after you see it if you want to see it regularly. <br /> <br />
