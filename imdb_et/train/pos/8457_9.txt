Gundam Wing is a good anime for me. Slightly slow movement (especially in the middle of the series), but it's all enjoyable. Now, before someone jumps into my case and calls me, I admit I've watched all of Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I admit that the story was talked about with some problems and some characters may seem "dirty" (ie Zechs Marquis' original Gundam career), but this is an alternative universe exhibition based on the original series, such as SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this series, make sure you first look at Gundam's original and then you know you're watching the AU series.
