I really don't like both Shrek films. (Because both of them "PG" and they have words, I would never say to myself, so I didn't like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: Cimarron Slave" I was watching for the first time last month, becoming a fan of animation films except Pixar. *** Front Spoilers *** "Spirit: Cimarron's Slave" is a horse that will finally be heard. One night, she sees a bright light and she descends to it. This activity ultimately leads to his capture and many more things. Throughout the film we hear a story. It is through the minds of the Spirit, though the horses never speak. That's what the movie does. They (filmmakers) repeated the real horses to make the horses. none of these sounds are made by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets rain, beautiful mare and Little Creek, native American, who owns Rain. Later, Little Creek releases the spirit and rain, they go home. <br /> <br /> I'm never a big fan of Brian Adams, but I'm going to buy this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't regret it. My score: 10/10
