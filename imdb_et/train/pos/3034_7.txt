Graham Greene's underrated insertion of the cinematic canon - its perceived mistakes can now be seen as virtues. The director of the theater, Shumlin, is framing his work with oppressive rigidity for the material, and seemingly intuitive compositions provide convincingly. The dark thriller and the story of moral regeneration (female character! In the 40's thrillers!) Is a hero on the film who turns into a mad and murderous (and possibly paedophile), which perfectly brings the distant ideologies of the Spanish civil war into a dangerous reality, one terrible murder , an amazing understanding of class and capitalism, smart theatrical metaphors, a rare rapprochement and end of Greene's God, which is happy only if you don't know anything about history.
