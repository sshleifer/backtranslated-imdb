Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action film. Story: A businessman is blackmailed by about 3 criminals. Roy Schieder is doing a great job as a leading character and special credit must go to John Glover, a kind of naughty psychopath. I have to mention that the characters of the villain are very complicated and interesting - something that is very rare for the feature film. also some beautiful and sexy women - the most remarkable are Kelly Preston as a young bate of Schieder's character. Vanity gives a very good result and appearance as a whore who is tied to three runners. I'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret hasn't lost it yet - this lady is a real babe. Don't look at the speed of this movie. I really don't know what the public and some critics are saying about this movie, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this really captivating and underrated movie. You enjoy it, it's a promise. Recommended A +.
