YES, the plot is hardly believable and very thin. YES, it works for the average ridiculous. YES, it's been done so many times. But what we do is a film that does not abandon these facts and pretends it is nothing more. There are indeed some initial death scenes and tension increases throughout the film. In addition, you will never be more than a few minutes away from killing. I invite everyone to look at this film with an unintended eye and look at what he intended; A scary, funny slasher whose theme is tuned.
