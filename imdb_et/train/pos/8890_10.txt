Well let me say this because I love history and I know the film is the most important piece in our history and it was a beautifully made movie and Julia Stiles became my # 1 favorite after she saw her "60s" and I got it movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you look for your new movies in the future and try to enjoy history !!
