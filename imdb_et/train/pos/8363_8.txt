This is one of the best classic Edgar Wallace films from the German series - it contains all the basics of the Wallace crime flic film that was really enjoyed since the 1960s: although his greatness, Mr. Kinski, is missing, you still have a young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, who is the main American smart woman, "you have the young Edd Arendt with his best (and equally typical) role - a cool, complicated British meatcut - and you have (not so young) Lowitz. as a melancholic, but very dry, ironic (and therefore very fun) police investigator. In addition, freaks and a very combious "evil dude" are offered behind the frog disguise (so the title of the movie!), You get an astonishing crooked soundtrack, classic b-movie scenes that have been filmed in some of the wildest perspectives (please remember the time of its origin!) queen and more ... All these ingredients are shaken well as a sweet delicious cocktail from pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - highly recommended !!
