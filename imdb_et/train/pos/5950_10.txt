This movie is great. The plot is a very good book, a classic book written by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene where Hank sings with children called "when you lie to your toe". It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it's fun and inspirational. The music is great and my favorite song is singing by King Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. A whole big movie or even a big Date movie. This is a movie that can be viewed over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is proud. I love this movie !! If you liked Danny Kaye at Jester, you will definitely like this movie.
