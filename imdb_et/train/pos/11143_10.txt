You saw it as a young naive punk when it was first released. When I was like a baby when I left the theater, I was trying to see no one. So when I saw it now in '07, I knew what to expect and what was ready and primed when their required moment was approaching. Fortunately, I was home this time. <br /> <br /> What I did not remember from my youthful view - or perhaps not having noticed it - was the technical shine of this film. Using memories that speak so much without using dialogue. The camera works, which seemed to have placed the viewer with the characters of the scene. Think of opening when Joe crosses the street for dinner, the camera behind the back seat of the woman and the child, designing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself and the characters - innocent, sad and brutally real. It is very touching to pull as close to this human drama as the people most of us are likely to trigger. And yet, Joe & Ratso could be one of us. Should be '70 when I saw it. I remember when I left the theater I was forced to find a company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I am not alone today. This is one big movie hell.
