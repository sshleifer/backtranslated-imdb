Of course, this movie is not historically accurate, but it is a great entertainment. Most DeMille images, especially the later epics, are slow and sprawling, but the action is moving at the clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very little silent moments. The action takes us to an Indian attack in the cabin; one of the best parts of the film with Jean Arthur, while trying to reassure the war-natured natives. This is followed by bringing him and Cooper to a war camp and being tortured. Later a long battle with Cheyenne comes. The whole thing is ridiculous, but fun and fun from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actors of this era and he looks here.
