Screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in New York. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture - he respects them - but Audrey Hepburn is (of course) in the eyes of others, because eventually he is princess Bogdanovich apparently in love with films 30 years before. She shoots her in loving close-ups, gets her leaves and boils her hard / soft-boiled between Ben Gazzara and lets her shine all over the room. The love-made connections made during the film are fast and fun, even though I made John Ritter's TV-style klutziness. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and grounded, reputation-sensual Patti Hansen are all interesting. But it's really Hepburn's Valentine and she's absolutely glowing. *** from ****
