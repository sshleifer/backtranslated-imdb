It was a good example of how an interesting movie can be done without the use of big stars and big effects. Just tell the real story of the struggle between two African American women in a difficult century. <br /> <br /> This movie invites us all to look at their personal prejudices and see people as people, not white, black, etc. <br /> <br /> Good movie with good message.
