but equally fun and casual! Love it or hate it, but don't wait for a complicated plot or nail removal. Think of it like Seinfeld, but without weak characters and repetitive performances (well ... so far; I feel like I'm developing favorites as the season continues). <br /> <br /> "Creature Convenience" is not a sense of humor - it is designed to enjoy the smallest part of your brain. This is why this exhibition embodies everything in the program that I need when I get home to work in the evening: a superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of "cute" characters to enjoy when I finally look up the computer to see what i'm missing. <br /> <br /> Funnier as most of today's sitcome, more peaceful than the evening at NASCAR. Just the right mix for dead air and return. Can't wait for next.
