This is one of the biggest 80s movies !!! It stays like a "tube". I can't believe Mad Magazine condemned it. And they proudly named their name "Stuart", "I-speak-a-no-Chinese" and "UPS guy on speed". What is it about? And I love Ron Leibman - he's a foxy! Think about why he removed his name from his credits? It was his more fun role I know. Of course, he is almost the same as Norma Raes. But in my opinion, this film is on Lampon Holiday. If you liked movies like Porky, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or some of the 80's teenage movies, you will love it! Rent it and see what I mean!
