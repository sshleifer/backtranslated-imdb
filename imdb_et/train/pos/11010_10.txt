When Matrix appeared in 1999 and asked for existence and identity, it was assumed that many films used it as inspiration. It wasn't a surprise, and it was up to 2002 to see a movie with a similar theme. But to say that Cypher is a clone that would discredit it. <br /> <br /> The story is from Morgan Sullivan, who is seeking a job with Digicorp, a large-scale tech company. His job is to be a spy and get information about a competing company while being under the foreseeable and false identity. His life is perfectly normal, but he must lie to his wife about what he actually does. But things start to turn, and before he knows what's going on, he's going to doubt who he really is. It is not helped by a strange woman who turns up ... <br /> <br /> Every direction turns and turns to never seem astonished and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> It is an appealing journey through too far into the future and with good functioning keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
