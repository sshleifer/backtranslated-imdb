I don't understand why the reviews of this movie are so universal when I just don't want to give my gift. I found it sick, brilliant, complicated and psychologically complicated. You don't get deeper into the idea of ​​a psychopath of a criminal in a Hollywood movie than that. It has layers inside layers, nuanced by Stone, and a primer that will keep you away even after it's over. People must overcome the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old and Michael Douglas is not. I predict that this movie is a huge hit on DVD when people see it and stop paying attention to professional assessors. Give him a hit, you may be glad you did!
