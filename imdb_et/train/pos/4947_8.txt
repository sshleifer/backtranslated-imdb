One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone who needs help. <br /> <br /> It's all for loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I've never met a man I didn't like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what's not to like? This his smile can warp diamonds. He's just so fantastic that I can see something he has. The same goes for Freeman. He's just a magical screen. <br /> <br /> Two of them gave us a movie that was funny from start to finish. Mexican supermarket Lorraine & Bobby and Packy. It was gentle, charming and just funny. <br /> <br /> You have to look through it.
