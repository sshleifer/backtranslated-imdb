Really amazing movie, the concept as a possible future vision is scary. The world is much overcrowded, unbearable heat damaged by the ozone layer and all our natural resources. In this terrible degenerate society, we have a great Charlton Heston as a pleasant film of a noirish-style detective who is trying to understand the truth behind the murder, contrary to the film noir legend Edward G Robinson, who turns the latter very good. <br /> <br /> One of the images that always stay with me from this movie is the masses of people who are in the stairwells and how Thorne (Heston) has to jump at any time. <br /> <br /> The use of movie music is also worthwhile, although it does not contain a score in the usual sense. The open topic is the good and later music pieces that we have here in the Simonson apartment, and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic, for an outstanding atmosphere.
