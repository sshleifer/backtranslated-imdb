Wrestlemania 14 does not often see one of the great Wrestleman, but I would like to personally put it in my top 5, if not in the top 3. It is so many great things and it really meant The Attitude Era, which I think WWE is the best time for . HBK has a lion's heart and he put Austin as he did, a clean class in his class. It has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see and has the best J.R and King. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? team battle for royal LOUD pop L.O.D return. I'm not a martial arts fan, and it's another medium. Very predictable, even if you see it for the first time, it's obvious. Despite the sunshine for 8 or so minutes, it certainly helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavy Duty Championship <br /> <br /> Rear Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> The trail comes with a surprising pop at its entrance. Fast, high flying and very exciting. If these two had more time, they would have torn their roofs down. The trail wins with Michinoku leader. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triangle H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stretching here is whether Chyna is hand-held. Nice butt for Owen, mixed reaction for trips. In fact, a really underrated game that is actually one of my favorites for Wrestleman. Two blends very well, and Owen can go with someone. The races will win with Chyna disturbances. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Matching mixed tag. Marc Mero & Sable Vs Goldust & Luna. For a woman who has never heard of it, defining pop for Sable. Sable looks really hot and the crowd just eats her! Constant Sable songs and they erupt almost every time he gets around. Not bad for a mixed tag match, it was entertaining and gave time well. The Sable team wins when Sable hits TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs Rock | C | Before reviewing the game, I would like to point out that Rock showed his huge potential, his interview with Jennifer Flowers before his game. Nice pop to Shamrock, great time for the Rock. Too disappointing short, and I thought the end was a bit stupid, even though Shamrock's eye-catching antics were fantastic to see, and the crowd went over it. Rock keeps the title when The Ref changes the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Dump Truck is suitable for WWF Team Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws. Outlaws aren't as much as they were now. The people are actually somewhat dead for that, but I thought it had some big Hardcore bits, some sick looking bumps. Cactus and Terry win titles at the end. <br /> <br /> Undertaker vs Kane 3/5 <br /> <br /> A great time for the Undertaker. Much better than Wrestlemania's 20 trips and the great man and grandmother was very good. It was a big hit out of everything, with the Undertaker taking a sick look through the table. WWE was smart, making Kane strong, even through defeat. After 2 tombstones have been thrown out, Taker puts him third. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special guest "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. Crowd goes to Austin ape sh * t, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed reaction for HBK. This is a truly special game that is one of the biggest events in the history of journalists that can be said when J.R is even breathless. HBK gives him everything that was supposed to be his last game, and Austin has rarely been better off. People's hostility and electricity is amazing and it's as exciting as it gets. Austin wins with a stunner, Tyson joined 3:16 with Michael. Austin racing is a miracle to see, one of the greatest people you will ever see, the king said it right, they went to nuts. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real. It has everything you want in Wrestlemania, and really start with Attitude Era. It's very special to me because it was the first Wrestleman I ever saw back in 98. "The Austin era has begun!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
