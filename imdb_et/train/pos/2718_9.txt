Last year we were treated with two films from Truman Capote, who wrote a book about which this film was made - Capote and Infamous. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine a movie like that done in 1967. a cool brutal drama; Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Professional, Whiteboard Jungle) raised the film to classic status. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Robert Blake, who celebrated this film, has had so many delayed problems that may be related to his killing in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will stay with you after watching.
