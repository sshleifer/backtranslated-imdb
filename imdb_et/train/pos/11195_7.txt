There are many meanings in the title - a boxing ring fighting differences and complaints, a wedding ring in which Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels his worries are over and a cause of trouble, a circular bracelet that Bill gives Mabel as a love sign. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer, Carl Brisson, Denmark, started in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Ring". Very young Ian Hunter, who kept the films for such a long career, plays Bob Corby, who is catching a beautiful girl at the fun fair Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis). He happens to be tied to one round of Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), but it doesn't stop him from flirting with Bob. Bob is convinced that he will go with Jack one round. He goes several rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer and he and his leader have come fairly to find out if Jack is as good a fighter as they have heard. He offers Jack and Jack goes with his nervous coach (big Gordon Harker) to get Mabel to marry. Jack wins his fight and marries next day with Mabel, but the deep attraction he and Bob feel for each other is still there. Jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight his wife with Bob. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cinema is in hell where the hero does not get out of line - Bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion - if only Mabel did the same! He has left him to Bob - and the battle is powerful at the end. It's intensely realistic - it's the last 20 minutes of the movie. From raw and enthusiastic, Jack has almost failed - then the circles that reunite with Mabel give him the courage to win. The question is, why would she even want to get her back - from the beginning she didn't think about starting with Bob - why didn't she do it yet? <br /> <br /> The film is symbolic. Jack shaking the promoter, makes Mabel's hand, accepting Bob's bracelet. When Jack puts a ring on Mabel's finger, Bobs slips under his hand. At the end, Jack sees Mabel's reflection in the ring water channel and gives him confidence to go ahead. It's a great movie that won't disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
