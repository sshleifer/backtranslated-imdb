Well, you take O.J. Simpson, as all American soldiers, turned to all American bus drivers who decided to rescue their passengers, but no one else is planning, and Arte Johnson has an absolutely straightforward role as a guide who doesn't know what to do, but doesn't want to admit they're in trouble and combine this with Lorenzo Lamas as one of three children facing the bad guys who intend to rob the heir and leave the desert to die for people and you need to act, plot twists and much drama. Everyone was good, but seeing Lamas as the worst of the bad boys really was my mind. He was too plausible as a terrifying bad man who not only wanted to rob the heir, but to rape women and humiliate him who tried to stop him. It was obviously long before he practiced his good pictures. And believe me in the 20-year-old Lorenzo's tight jeans that you really don't want to miss!
