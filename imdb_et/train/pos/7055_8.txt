Although Cinderella is not an obvious choice, I love Jaq and Gust, so I'm not hesitant. The format of the mice writing the book for Cinderella was inspired. I like to write stories myself and hope it encourages children. The three stories are cute and fun, though the songs were forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also liked to see Lucifer, Bruno, Mouse Choir and everyone else. Pom Pom proved Lucifer the ideal companion and I liked the government. Continued change. My Rating 8/10.
