I accidentally felt on television on this film and I couldn't leave it. This illustrates the conflict between events in the 60s, political conflict and race. priority and this movie really learned a lot of facts from me! By the way, I think all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I see this movie more than once a day !! It's really great .... what a shame only appeared on television, not in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
