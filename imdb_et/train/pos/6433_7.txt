Several posters have quoted Renoir, who expresses his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman's smile on the camera. The short answer would not be all of us, while the harsh reality is that only a few could do it. At this stage of his career, Bergman could not be arrested; In 1949, he left Hollywood to take a picture in Europe, fell on director Roberto Rossellini and never saw it. After five turkeys in Italy, he was probably ready to open the vein, but during the year, after he had done so for Renoir, he was where he belonged and with an Oscar for Anastasia. This is one of the three films Renoir made in a colorful and balanced way during this time, better than a golden trainer that is not difficult and even with French Can Can. Apparently, Renoir thought that a couple of wood-guiding men would go to him and that Renoir chose two cheeses in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer in both cases. The plot is based on a real case in French history, but Renoir has content that gives it a mild effort and focuses on creating his father's paintings created after setup. In his pastel colors, it reminds one more movie of the time, Les Grandes Manouvres, which is not bad. All in all, it remains a pleasant and beautiful and charismatic actor.
