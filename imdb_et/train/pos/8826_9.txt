If you've been entertained by straightforward strokes that are logical within this illogical situation, you'll enjoy this fun 8-minute Spanish movie. <br /> <br /> The woman enters a small cafe. The scene seems normal, but the opponent, customers and two musicians seem somehow strangely weak. <br /> <br /> Suddenly playing musicians and one man singing the title song, dancing table tops with musical comedy gestures. Customers, first motionless, alternating timing (badly, but really) with song phrases, read the pieces of paper in their palms. On and off they jump and dance (uncomfortably, but seriously) in choreographic movements such as backup singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? woman wondering. The answer appears when the soloist jacket opens and sees what is tight on his chest - just before the explosive runs ... <br /> <br /> Even if you don't take the song (probably ironically) lyrics, the situation-perfect performance should give you a smile and a smile ... I love to see it again!
