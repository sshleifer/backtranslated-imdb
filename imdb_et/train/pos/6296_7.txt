Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for a great break. Meanwhile, he works as a telephone advisor to the psychological helpline of Manhattan. One day, unfortunately, his apartment building is burning. Parker and his cat are doing it alive, but now it's a difficult task to find affordable housing in Big Apple. The word comes to Parker that a woman, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but only receives a gay man. Since Parker is straight but the price is right, she decides to pretend she is gay. Samantha loves her from the beginning and welcomes her as a new partner. But poor Parker. Sam is cute, smart and highly desirable. How can he control his true nature? Besides, does Sam have any successful businessman-boy anyway? It is a sweet, pleasant and humorous film with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, the plot string is how "how do I get this ruse" scenes when Sam asks Parker shampoo if he's in the shower or asks him to keep him in bed when he gets bad news. It is also necessary for Parker to produce his "counterfeit" gay mate Boris when Sam insists he wanted to know him. Hopefully, the gay community will not find it too insulting because this viewer thought most of the issues were sensitive and subtle. For the small-scale film, the costumes, the kits and the camera work were pretty nice. So if you love these funny love stories, get it right now. You like what you see, I know it.
