What a fun movie St Ives has. It reminds me of the type of film made in the 40s. A classic story that is rounded with characters and a plot that is neither dramatic nor overly complicated. In fact, this is nothing. The story of Robert Lewis Stevenson - here on the screen - is like Jane Austen's men. We get a story with romance in our hearts, but fun is also fun: battle scenes (sort of), prison escape, erroneous identities, sword game and the funniest line I've been hearing for years: "Only Scotland is informed of a hidden ball with the names of guests." a lot of fun, hardship and not a bit of a heartbeat, because St. Ives tries to fight and find her way back to the family and life she barely knew. Jean Marc Barri saw the title as absolutely perfect. Anna Friel is a refreshing joy, as the inventive Flora and Miranda Richardson will make the film wise and world-wide, there and everyone has seen Aunt Susan. Richard Grant offers comics in the highest order. .
