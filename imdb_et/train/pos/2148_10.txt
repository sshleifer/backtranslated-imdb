I always wait for this movie on TV. I need to get a DVD that I think. The number of different people is great. It tells me that everyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so peculiar but so full of emotions. This is a great movie with great dance. Unfortunately, we will never be able to see them go to Blackpool. Would it be a perfect sequel if they had. But I think it leaves it to your imagination what happened. <br /> <br /> Very simple and innocent story. He remains loyal to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want to. I don't like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere is more like an original than Lopez. I feel that the remake is not so easy and innocent.
