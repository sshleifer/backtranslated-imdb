Hard movie to comment on how you say it is bad? Well that's not, but it's just as hard to say it's good. Whatever it is, there are compelling views, it's as close as you can get complete destruction without being there. Photos of the tsunami coming to the coast of Thailand bring life, you know you want to go away, but you have to look. tragic circumstances, a view of what is happening in another country, no panders or insults. The facts are cellulose and the viewer has little need to understand or understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can't change history and you shouldn't show this movie in the dark hour of mankind.
