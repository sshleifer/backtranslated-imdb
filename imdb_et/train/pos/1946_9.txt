I wasn't really a big fan of Star Trek for 2-3 years. Thanks to the spread of Netflix and the video technology of 2000, I can go past all the great Star Trek episodes. For those who do not look at each episode and do not know them from the heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., the general consensus - "I like The Next Generation" is the best. This is because Captain Picard and his team were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek's hunger. But to be honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager's episodes more than TNG. Unlike TNG, Voyager's episodes are progressing over time. The data from TNG is great, but eventually they get old, but Voyager's doctor - it's creativity now! Instead of making artificial intelligence uncomfortable and distracting, give it the freedom to express beyond what you imagined. Picardo is not so much an actor, but an assumption that his expansive, self-education, doctor, self-realization, which is now the best scientific literature! Endgame depicts him as a husband who is married to an "organic", invented a neuro-implant with a transceiver for the human-machine interface, and even - in an Endgame episode to disobey the master's order and make "human" mistakes. Unlike DS9, blessed with two beautiful women right from episode 1, Voyager must remain 3 years without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo, who carried them with his personality. Of course, the rest of Voyager's chemistry just flows easily, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very natural. I love Tuvoc from time to time humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I'm so glad they released this original female captain - oh, if you can look at rare material - thanks to God for Kate! He has developed over seven years as an extremely self-confident, credible and respectable female captain. What a great job! Thank you for Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy exploring every episode, creative opportunity, morale, and our cosmic expansion.
