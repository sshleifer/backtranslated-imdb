Often I have not had the feeling of a film that could be a vision. But this film clearly has the seed of the foreground. <br /> <br /> We should not tend to be worrying and see armageddon because it seems to fit our current emotions. But did we say "1984"? If James Orwell knew that the Internet would not become a reality, long after 1984; In fact, it was in 1994; he could have reviewed his writing. Careful fee. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter. What is important is that we often feel better for the surrounding environment, but become an emotional "apple of love" when the need to knock on our door. Snapshot of yourself in old age. <br /> <br /> No matter what the period of time turns out to be for us, I know we haven't seen it yet. <br /> <br />
