Okay, this was a pretty damn good episode. Much better than credit. <br /> <br /> Camera performance is great. Best yet. I love this final shoot. The atmosphere is fantastic, costumes are great and the visitor (minus helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I don't like about this episode is that many things that have not been explained. why does it change sex? what is the purpose? and are they foreigners? what? Why didn't they show up in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I give this episode three high stars. One of my favorites yet, but the holes in the plot disturb me. Still ... don't let him destroy his entertainment.
