"Dan in Real Life," the most appropriate element is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. Choosing the Oscar winner Juliette Binoche for Dan's love was a great decision; he is exceptionally gifted, intelligent, naturally attractive and grateful for this part obsolete! If this film had been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another great aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that it is the perfect movie for adults who are interested in mature comedy, leaving out the "frat pack" of the three pillars of the formula: dark chicks, chauvinistic boys and stupid jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is funny and fun, intelligent laughs all over. When other comedies are built or almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience to laugh, Dan in Real Life jokes are more natural and smarter and involve some thinking in the audience. <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious, average girl plays too brutally by actress Brittany Robertson. It is hard to say whether it was a personal choice for him or as a director. In both cases, his character is unrealistic and annoying. However, this is only a small mistake in the movie and does not take the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> All in all, Dan in Real Life is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the clash of attacking and stupid comedies. The quality of writing, management, operation and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It's just a beautiful, frivolous comedy.
