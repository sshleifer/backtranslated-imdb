A lovely little movie that doesn't even spoil your grandmother, "The Grace of Preservation" seems like the same fabric as one and a half other British comedy in the last two years ... the underdog is facing reluctance, finds power to challenge and learns about something in the process. <br /> <br /> Widowed and thus broke, Grace is a master gardener, and she's involved to help her friend / worker Matthew grow their pot plants. She has done all this wrong, so Grace will help her out. They realize that he is the perfect person to clean the pot, both of which will benefit. She enjoys smoking, she has to raise money for paying her mortgage. <br /> <br /> Highlighting is Grace, who travels to London to deal with some of her goods dressed like White Travolta, wearing Saturday Night Fever, and that's why she looked like a painful thumb. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always observable and you can't say that many people. Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Karyo, who liked "La Femme Nikita", is memorable. <br /> <br /> Not deeply moving or insightful, but tremendously entertaining and vigorous after 90 minutes, it seems like a walk with friends. 8/10
