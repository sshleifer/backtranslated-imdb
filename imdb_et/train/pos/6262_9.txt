It was incredible, which means it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this amazing migration twice a year and that filmmakers Cooper and Schoedsack did not staged some of the scenes and frames. But what shots are they! The film is mostly brilliant in extreme conditions, and the Iranian music score added to video output adds value to this memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing it and "Kon Tiki" the same weekend, which was exciting and definitely made me see how harsh and resilient and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or adventure or science.
