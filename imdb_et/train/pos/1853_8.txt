Well, this is again a movie that plays your feelings and you come out with all the soft, not rocky film. But I'm strange to them, so I gave him a good score ... the operation was very good and had many feelings. Violence is minimal, which changes change. I would have given it 9 if it wasn't fun at the end! All in all, a good movie is with very good players. <br /> <br />
