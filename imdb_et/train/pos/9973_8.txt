I liked this version of Vanishing Point compared to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I could live a couple of times in the middle of the film (as I did with the 1971 version) than to me, it's not that big. Of course, this may be due to the fact that at the time of the 1971 release I was only nine. But I've seen a lot of reminiscences where I liked the original and the parent. I found that the 1997 version of the plot was more understandable and originally preserved, without compromising the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version had more excitement and was not so "blass" (boring)
