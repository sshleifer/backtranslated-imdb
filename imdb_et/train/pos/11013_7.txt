During the war, Hollywood made many films designed to support our troops to the public. Today, some of them see them or see them as propaganda - what they are technically, but a positive variety and meant to unite the nation. This movie is a pretty effective and fun example of a genre - with a pretty realistic script and good product values. Pat O'Brien plays a lot of the same character he played in many other movies (you know, a harsh, hard-to-control, but "swelling man"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and entertaining, and the rest of the extras are great (look for one of Robert Ryan's training as a bomber). Although the story resembles a number of other films about our pilots and teams, the film is well-designed to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. This, maybe, except just the end - where the film is a bit over-over, but also very satisfactory. The only serious negative, and for the most part, for nitpickerers, is that some film material is integrated somewhat into films and "nuts" like me, who are both historians and lovers of airplanes, most likely noticing it - probably not everyone else.
