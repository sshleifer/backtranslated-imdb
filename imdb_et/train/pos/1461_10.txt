The film depicts an outstanding Chinese photographer - generally a female - from the owner of a Chinese company who shares her shameless and misleading stance, her American counterparts also stupid and misleading, stressed employees who are given a voice and, of course, drunken Americans who wear unnecessary beads in New Orleans . <br /> <br /> The glow of nature comes when some Americans are really outraged that people who make their own necklaces with pearls could pay it like $ 0.10 an hour. You also have the feeling that employees may have the opportunity to escape from the processing at the beach factory, but are likely to do so if they are a popular punishment for the owner of a tired factory and / or they can work too hard for 20 hours a day. <br /> <br /> I'm wondering where these necklaces came from, not understanding how exhausting and difficult it is to do. I really appreciated this film, because it obviously represents how American indulgence affects something that is considered relatively harmless for the peoples in the world in the other half of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
