It must now be one of the best comedies on television. It takes a sweet, sweet idea to show you that revolves around a close family and makes it a pretty realistic but funny image of a typical family with brothers and parents, brat brothers, defenseless fathers and bimbo sisters. I'm almost surprised that this is Disney! <br /> <br /> With 8 simple rules, it's known to be a comedy and not to be more. Too many exhibitions (such as "sister, sister", and "Lizzie McGuire") just think that its characters are now teenagers, they should deal with social issues and lose their sense of humor, being too difficult. This is a trap "8 simple rules" is avoided; it solves some issues (such as schooling) but it is fun at the same time. In fact, the only time it was really serious was understandably when he dealt with John Ritter's tragic death and his character. <br /> <br /> And even though I think John Ritter is sad because he was the reason the exhibition made his mark, "8 simple rules" can still do well when he remembers his humor and doesn't make Cate's father Paul Hennessy second version.
