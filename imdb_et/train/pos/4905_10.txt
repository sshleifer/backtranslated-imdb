"The album of such old songs thinks they are new." This movie has a hard-to-understand combination of tempo and mood that puts some movies after opening. And why not? Dame Judith is a widow of Judith Dench, a playwright who plays saxophone with a street musician to help her get the songs right, being a joyful widow to Olympia Dukak, who lives in the Scottish castle with her many marriages of marriage, a drummer to Ian Holm who loved all members of World War II, all girls (more or less) ). But wait, there's more. Add Leslie Caronis to the bass and the last vocal of Clio Laine is incomparable and Blond Bombshells is the hottest band in England since the Beatles. Well, OK, not really, but this movie is the winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends the entire movie trying to reunite Blonde Bombshells to play her granddaughter's school dance. Before your eyes roll, imagine how hard and courageous it would be for a number of sexually mature women to advance to the Britney Spears generation after the name "Open Wound". <br /> <br /> The age when the actors 'career has passed since they are 30 years old, most of the ensembles' second album is the largest collection of hits and more than a month old music has almost no chance of playing, it's great to see real talent, real music and a really good movie from the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and I know I watch it many times and enjoy it every time.
