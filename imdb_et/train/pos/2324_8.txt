When I watched this movie, I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child growing up in a rural area, I felt like a boy again! A swimsuit (called "tank" in Central Texas) that runs through a rural area like a wild free spirit! The story was very plausible and I lost it completely and cried to the end. Through the pain we live through ... life goes on and can be forgiveness.
