This movie is a great example of storytelling. Action is great. The story is inspirational without being too manipulative or fake. There were a couple of points where they probably made people look better or worse than they really were, but given that it's a Hollywood movie, they showed an amazing limit. There was no explosion in the film, although they had one chance. The film, which had the arresting parts, was not made into a film of deeds. So the story is focused on the extraordinary person unfortunately at the usual time. Well done!
