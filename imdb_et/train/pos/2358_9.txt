Daisies is just a lovely fairy tale with "Amelie" aesthetics and romance tones. It has a beautiful palette, its shots are thoughtful and detailed, its names and dialogue are vivid and too cutesy to be real, great imagination and romance deep. <br /> <br /> Look at the blue sky in the pop you can't get because blue can't be found in the rest of the set or frames (with a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Look strangely natural and completely satisfying that goes out of the scene. <br /> <br /> This score is proud, its pouring is extremely pleasing, there is great music and two leading romantic stars can't touch each other or die. How much do you need sexual tension? (Actually, I wanted them to find it, but c'est la vie). <br /> <br /> This is just an exhibition that is glad to spend an hour and I highly recommend it. The other television is not very similar, and I would like to see more. It came to me through a week of flu as it makes a good business. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
