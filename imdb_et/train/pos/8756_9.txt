I got this movie randomly in the middle of the cable and had to be rented to see that it was complete and I was glad I did. I immediately drew a story and took care of the girls involved. The na√Øve high school graduates, the best friends from childhood, take a high school trip and take on a female named Nick who poses these serious problems. They are used as sacrifices for smuggling heroin. The girls who have been taken into custody learn to cope with their imprisonment, trying to find their way out of their problems. Everything they are trying to help themselves is short when the Thai criminal justice system shows weaknesses and girls get more trouble and lose the trust of their American lawyer, Yankee Hank. Hank gives up trying to protect them after he knows the betrayal of Alice (Claire Dane). But Thailand's mother-in-law Hank smells of rats and does some additional research and finds that girls are indeed victims. At the end of the film, when Alice didn't make herself a criminal to save Darlene (Beckins), I had tears. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
