Viktor McLaglen, the title of John Ford 's ATTENTION, reminded me of the man in the circus of Fellini LA STRADA. Anthony Quinn played a brutal man who could even be affected by the face of a pug that McLaglen played. Dublin, a victim of poverty, is the real life of the picture in 1922, the atmosphere. Dense fog and a long wet night are the main story of Irish patriotism and Irish Republican army combat. The individuality conflict and the reason for this is what changes the INFO label. McLaglen's big and simple sign just wants to go to America and we are often reminded of ticket prices. Two different characters are getting drunk in Ireland's psychological center. One of them is the previous one, the second is the WANTED sign. Should he do this and get the money to go? <br /> <br /> John Ford repeatedly said, "My name is Ford. I'm doing Western." After seeing the film, he can obviously do much more. The serious social issues discussed here are cordial and those you find yourself thinking about. And the appearance of the pieces is amazing. Ford was always known for his luminescent, proud cinematography, which helped to anticipate the conflicts of his characters. It is hard to paint, but he did it in pictures like SEARCHERS, painting John Wayne sometimes brutally. Victor McLaglen's performance is not only for the benefit of lighting, but for the ease of action. He casts a lot. He strikes people out. He's cruel, who doesn't know better. However, he should know whether to cross the IRA. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie to find out the sharp details. See also the patriotic depiction of McLaglen and Ford's IRA. Max Steiner's score is innovative when it fits with the character gestures, putting more emphasis on them. This was usually only seen in silent movies, especially in Chaplin. The issue of naming or notifying is obviously still important. Just look at how the media dealt with this year's Oscares, paying close attention to Elia Kazan's scandal.
