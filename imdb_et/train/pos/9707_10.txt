About a year ago I finally gave up on American television. I thought the TV would be completely abandoned until a friend living in England showed me some programs that included offices, an extra, a Blackadder and a gentleman's union. Then I decided to go to British television. Among all the above exhibitions, the Gentlemen's League is easily the darkest and the most twisted, offering a blame for a laugh and material that has not been found in any other comedy I have seen. Involved characters are the most unhappy couple, the butcher who puts the ingredients in the meat that doesn't say (probably the best). This program is one of the best I've seen.
