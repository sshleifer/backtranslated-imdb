What a big movie. The concept of the people who send people who fight against each other with giant robots is sticky. The end isn't just right, it's more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm an interesting writer. Unfortunately, we never see the relationship between Achilles and Athena more advanced than a few kisses and Athena's fear of Achilles' safety. Their romance is very enjoyable. <br /> <br />
