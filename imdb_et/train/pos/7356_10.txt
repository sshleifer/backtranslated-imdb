If you haven't seen Eva Longoria's "Desperate House Wives" on TV, you won't lose. Eva will be one of the biggest stars in Latina and you will see her soon in theaters. It was Eva's first film and she does a fantastic job. He was 24 when he shot, and then he looked hot. As for this low-budget movie, it is pretty good for the first time for a director who has another movie to be released, "Juarez, Mexico", which is currently playing at many US film festivals. In fact, he seems to have some news. What would be nice to see is the bigger budget "Snitch" 2.
