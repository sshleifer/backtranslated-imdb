For the first time I saw this movie in the eighties, but now this thriller was still considered topical. Some of the newer films focus on similar topics, but they do not correspond to this French milestone. <br /> <br /> The President - probably JF Kennedy - will be in the open car while the public is released. The resulting major investigation finds that the film "Lee Harvey Oswald" is guilty, but one member of the jury is calling for further investigation. He finds some surprising evidence ... <br /> <br /> Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK - a film with the same plot - it doesn't play emotions, but focuses on the fascinating description of conspiracy and how everything fits together, drawing a new picture of murder. Even a real psychological experiment is used to explain crime sites. Compared to JFK, this film is smarter, more intelligent and more exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in many newer films, I sometimes had a dance track. <br /> <br /> "I ... comme Icare" is "black it". His unique and brilliant and Ennio Morricone music is great. This film deserves a very good position if it were a Hollywood production, it would certainly be famous. <br /> <br />
