MAIN SPOILERS !! This is for people who see the movie !! <br /> <br /> Commentators have touched on the main theme of "The Glory" and too many comparisons with "Braveheart". I emphasize a few things about the film I haven't seen with other comments: <br /> <br /> This film is fundamentally different from abortion. The first sign of pregnancy is a girlfriend of Roth and when she coldly cites abortion, she says it's too late. His shame ("I have to recruit a bastard.") Makes him suicide much later. Another sign of finding yourself pregnant is Mary, Robi's wife, after Roth's character (and at least one sex with her husband Rob). Late, when Rob leaves the final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks what he should do about the questionable origins of pregnancy by highlighting the hints of abortion. Rob responds in a high tone, "it's not a child's fault," and then he says what he thinks the name should be, girl or boy. I find the hero a "lifelong" attitude towards Hollywood. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright to comment - not a random symbol. <br /> <br /> Another related topic is Roth's character bastard, someone who probably doesn't know who his father was and has little words for his mother, even though he is wearing his own picture of a case suspended from his neck. The coincidence is that Roth (no family stability) is the definition of psychopath walking, while Rob is a strong spouse / father figure and, of course, a hero. In the last sword fight between Robi and the villain (Roth), the former ones sliced ​​deeply across the chest - the left side of the chest - the heart. His employer and pseudo-father figure (John Hurt's character) holds his mother's picture in hand and looks at it before grabbing the dead Roth neck. <br /> <br /> What was interesting to me was also the direction of the rape scene, which was not quite graphic, but it was not in the camera and indirect. I found it surprising when it is somewhat factual, with Mary showing convincingly what is going through the trial and the traumatic stress that follows (as we call it now). My idea is that rape was not sensational, or just indirect, which I find to be an interesting medium for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the final battle, the previous comment must be corrected: the weapon Roth chose to be a rapier, a weapon Rob chose Claymore. Someone did their homework in this whole scene. Roth would have an upper hand in such a situation, but of course Claymore is clearly a Scottish weapon. Even more striking for me (as a prisoner and somebody who has read a bit about the subject) is that this last sword fight is one of the most convincing films ever made: Actors seem to actually kill each other - not the usual slashes of the opponents' blade we see in most in film calls (including in the opening of films). Even more serious is history, Roth is seen many times, using rapier as a thrust, which is its purpose with design! (The rapier was a sharp but mainly thrust weapon whose edges were mainly used to push opponents.) Rob uses Claymore with a wide slash as it is a design goal. The fight is going down because I'm waiting for it - Roth wins. Although Rob wins the day, grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolism) and amazing him by dying with powerful cutting. <br /> <br /> The crowd, RARE, is seeing this level of historical accuracy in the movie sword fight. br /> <br /> I also note that, for any reason, in 1995 (the year of release), I recall the mistrust of the US government. Hollywood was obviously tuned into this, with the release of "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart", and I think the anti-government is the reason why both films get so much comparison. I think the view that this film gives is refreshing to live with movie fans who are tired of the same old, not so hidden Hollywood message.
