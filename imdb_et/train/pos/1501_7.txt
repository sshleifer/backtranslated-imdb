A great movie and a great example of how a scary movie can be without the viewer showing anything. It is a collection of four stories that all surround the charming old-fashioned house of tenants and their various terrible and terrible destinies, all of which are related to the surrounding story that a Scottish yard inspector is looking for a missing horror film. It begins with a story about a mysterious writer whose main character becomes a bit too realistic, followed by a story of two old romantic competitors who become obsessed with a wax figure in a museum, a story of cute little English children who are something else and closing the story of what happened to a lost movie star and what he does to the inspector. This is a fantastic print that allows you to really do the job of Duffell's director and what he could achieve with a very small budget. Add Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliotti, Jossi Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee to the talent for action and you have a movie that can be enjoyed over and over again. Just don't answer the phone if someone from Stoker Real Estate calls offers you a great deal in a beautiful house in English?
