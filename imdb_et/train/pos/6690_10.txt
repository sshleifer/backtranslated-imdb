Mystery Men is one of those movies that is funny over time. Characters have naive innocence and jokes. It has become part of the "culture" of our family and we often quote them. This is my favorite movie of the last two years. My kids are 13 and 11 and we all love this movie. Great functioning and comedy. We also like Galaxy Quest and Monty Python. Okay, we're not talking here intellectually, but family bonding!
