The Brokedown Palace is the story of the two best siege, Alice and Darlene, who go spontaneously to Thailand and end up in jail after being planted with drugs. In this way, the film could become a serious and moving film, such as "Return to Paradise", but instead the film decided to focus on the situation of little girls and more friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both turn to great performances and the film is much more about their interaction - suspicion, jealousy, their friendship survey and testing, and finally the victims of friendship. . This film decides not to go deep into politics or even to the level of difficulty of prison life (which is a bit overcome) and to focus more on these friendship issues. <br /> <br /> Here were some plot holes, and some parts that just didn't seem credible or realistic. We didn't feel the real fear or hopelessness of our situation as we could. And we get very little life outside the walls of the prison, Bill Pullman plays an allegedly weak lawyer who really is in the heart of gold. In short, this all rights should be a much darker film than it was. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed it at all. The action was good, the soundtrack was perfect and the story was complicated enough to stay interesting. It's worth seeing.
