Another example of what British cinema can achieve: a simple story, talked about and worked well. Brenda Blethyn provides a layered and warming performance as a recently widowed and financially constrained Grace, assisted by a tough supporting cast. The "quirky small town" map is played on a slate, similar to many TV shows and films from the British Isles of recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others). As mentioned above, this film uses a nice, beautiful landscape, in this case the wet and wild Cornish coast. Some viewers may find it somewhat more difficult to accept wholesale cannabis use, while others may find it ends up just a little sweet and safe. But it is an enjoyable spliff to be sure.
