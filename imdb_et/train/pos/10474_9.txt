This film was impressively impressed. It contained the key elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companions. It was not just a genius musician who hit the bottom, but it was about a man who hit grief, trying to drastically find the comfort of his music. He finds a partner who comes with his problems. Claire and Des were able to give each other friendship and love, but more importantly, a conclusion about the events that had worst shaped their lives. <br /> <br /> Des is unlikely to be in the character's stage. Yet he has a musical genius. He also has in the past an event that has made him stagnate, while things around him literally ruin. His focus is on creating his whale music, in fact it becomes obsessed with him. <br /> <br /> Claire is a street-long child who needs to stay. He finds the talent hidden in Des. He also finds that he is accepting a common friend. He learns to trust him for a while. <br /> <br /> These two find love with each other. Not the mind that blows, sex infuses passion, but love, where friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who are injured, they will find trust together.
