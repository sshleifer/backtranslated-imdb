Since musicals are both out of fashion and incredibly expensive to do without all the talents needed to make a contract in the studio, I doubt that we will ever get the real life of Enrico Caruso. But when everything was in place, it was no coincidence that no Hollywood studio was trying to do the task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under the contract. No one else could have done that, I doubt if it will ever be tried again. <br /> <br /> And why should you do it. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been happy with how his song was on the screen. Because his tenor's voice was his life, his reason to be on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that freedoms were taken with his life is modest. Caruso, as a man who depicted him, was a man of great appetite, albeit a lot of self-discipline. He had several relationships with several women and they were two married couples who were not in the film. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording sector is considered almost an afterthought. She is shown in a recording studio once in later life. In fact, he started recording right around the turn of the last century, and with Irish tenor John McCormack RCA Victor made the recording industry what he got. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were at their height, they had to inherit the ticket to see if either of them was living. However, many immigrants from Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and record or three of these men. That's why both legends got what they are. <br /> <br /> What the movie has is some beautiful productions made by Mario Lanza, the taste of what he would have been if he had carried Caruso's discipline. adhere to the opera. The great Caruso won the Oscar for sound recordings and became candidates for costume and design. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, the actual cast album was not received by Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang this in the movie, Lanzal was a big hit. The most enjoyable night of the year helps to popularize even more Carus. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for Enrico Caruso's life, this is not the case. If you are looking for a great artist at your career, then The Caruso should not be missed.
