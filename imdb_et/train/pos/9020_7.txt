Flight Theory is an interesting character lesson from the artist (Branagh), who longs to get rid of boredom and mediocrity, and ultimately a sick patient (Bonham-Carter) in the latest stages of ASL, limited to a wheelchair who wants to make love to a man before his death. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham-Carter expresses her enthusiasm, loyalty, and independence as an ASL patient who is almost completely dependent on her for caring for her. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh, who was sentenced through community service to care for him, complements Helena's magic by creating a sensitive and convincing love story where two people try to find each other before the time runs out.
