Etienne Girardot is just an actor of character - a person that people almost never know by name. He plays the coroner again - one of the only actors in Philo Vance films that played his role more than once. I've seen her twice and loved her every time she was so funny and fresh. This movie is also a good watch because, in addition to Girardot, there are many other wonderful character actors, including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. It is quite impressive cast and they have certainly made the work of leading man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce easier. <br /> <br /> These great characters act as one of the biggest reasons I love these old B movies. Though the mystery itself is rarely so terrible, because the films are very bright and functional, the movies are really satisfying. As far as this film is concerned, Vance plays great on Lowe, but as I said, the mystery itself is a mere afterthought - with foolishness involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can't hypnotize anyone to do something like this - I have training with clinical hypnosis and if I could do something like an evil guy in the movie, I would have done it! Used car dealers and some of my old bosses would have had obvious goals! In general, though not the best Philo Vance movie, it was very good and it's a shame shame Lowe played this role once. Indeed, in addition to William Powell (who played Vancet five times), a series of long and long offspring, such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) who played Vancet. This is a similar problem that also bothered the Bulldog Drummond series - just too many different actors who play the leading man. <br /> <br /> Worth watching and excitement - albeit quite impossible.
