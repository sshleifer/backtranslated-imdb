Without Kirsten Miller, this project does not have to be completed. But the delightful inspiring beauty and talent that Miss Miller would recommend would definitely recommend it. It seems that the other actors played only their strong performance. Wagner's shameless attempt to honor this film was a bit of a disappointment, but his few scenes didn't affect entertainment. Most of the time, my criticism is with a line of writing and plot, a group of talents gathered to save heroic work that should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and incredible. He plays this steadfast relationship between a confident and superior, but never offensive he is actually a structural engineer he claims to be. I wish I had seen it on the big screen, but unfortunately I was happy before it was lost.
