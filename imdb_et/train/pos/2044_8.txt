It is a good little shocking; not a perfect imagination but a dense, competent and disturbing. A great example of a simple idea was the 90-minute script. <br /> <br /> The setting does not require clocks and whistles, long exposure or clear story; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young woman working in Germany, lives in London, waiting for the last pipe waiting for the train. She wakes up to find a place abandoned, but she soon realizes she is far from alone. Someone, or something, is with him and his intentions are completely malicious. <br /> <br /> In fact, he faces a number of other characters who want to survive, including a close work colleague, a homeless couple and a drilled wastewater worker who all test the pace and substance. In the middle of the movie, there is a somewhat uncomfortable shifting when the tension thriller mutates into a gore fest, but not so clumsy to speed up the pace. For those who have weaknesses, this is probably a harassing race; For those who enjoy a bit of good-killed carnivorous chaos, it should hit all the better buttons. <br /> <br /> The film's climax is perhaps less successful than the main part of the movie, but it is a cut-off moment with an unexpected social comment that gives a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some may feel somewhat skinned as a clear explanation of the exact nature and history of the threat facing Kate and his confederates. it wasn't for me. The horror writer should not feel forced to baptize every i and every t, as well as a writer of political thrillers. Here are enough clues to give you a very clear idea of ​​what has brought about this evil existence, making a detailed and decisive solution superfluous. Maintaining a certain sense of secrecy is welcome and reminds us that in this film, driving was always more important than the exact destination. <br /> <br /> My understanding is that the budget for this movie is at least minimal, in which case our British horror applause should be all louder, because at no time is there any impression that the corners are cut off or the effect is unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> If it sounds like your movie, it probably is. Buy a ticket and climb on board.
