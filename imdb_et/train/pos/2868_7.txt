First of all, I have to say that I am Portuguese and it is not common for me to spend time watching Portuguese films, probably one year or not ... <br /> <br /> And the reason is the almost generalized idea between the Portuguese people that national pictures are terrible, really close to the worst! But in the last decade it will surprise me when we get back to the 40's funny when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were the best in the world, such as "Pulsação Zero" or "Sorte Nula", both director Fernando Fragata and some common actors and music. <br /> <br /> It's also good, not the same, because it's not real comedy; In fact, it is officially a drama, a woman's drama has some unexpected funny parts, humorous characters or fun things that happen to them, like a hypothetical trip to the Caribbean just to get. <br /> <br /> Plot works and can surprise us a few times; the actors are good, the places are regular scores; But the truth is that it all makes sense, then we can consider it a nice effort for national cinema, which seems to begin with ashes as a phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese movie it is definitely a better choice, but it remains to be measured.
