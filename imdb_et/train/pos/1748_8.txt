From the beginning I was so excited about this movie. The poster is probably more fun I've ever seen for the movie. I bought one of my dormitories right in September. <br /> <br /> Every element in this movie gathered so beautifully. Often you see the movie with so many penis, gay and racial jokes that critics praise. Carell and the rest of the cast give each nervous joke sensationally. During the film, Carell remains sweet, where she can succeed more in her relationship than the end of the movie you are about to put forward. Supporting cast is brutal, each with problems with itself. <br /> <br /> One of the things in this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes. This makes the movie pleasantly memorable. This film often comes up when the words "chest waxing" and "condoms" are mentioned in the conversation. <br /> <br /> Watching This Theater I was surprised how many older people were watching it. I saw a group of four in the mid-60s where women came. Despite the older audience, this film still fills the whole theater with a laugh. Agency and Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of jokes that Family Guy could see. The film is young enough for young boys and still sweet and smart enough for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie if you're not a fan of sadness or you're just offended. But if you're in the movie, remember that this movie is all good humor. Jokes are not "gay jokes", they are just jokes. And they're funny.
