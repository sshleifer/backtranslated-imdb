I doubt that much of this movie is based on a real story. In the beginning, this is a true story, sort of. I bet the only truth was that there was a former model called Domino. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it starts with Domino, who talks to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino listens to what he knows about the $ 10 million theft. Through the returns, we see that Domino is a child, then a model, and how he became interested in a hunter. He basically talks to two other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They allowed him to join the group. He is tough, can use any weapon and use his good looks if needed. <br /> <br /> They are involved in the scam that Clarmont, bailman, has gone. On the way, the group will start TV shows of reality with Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green. They are kind of hosts and they must have appeared in this desperation. <br /> <br /> I thought this story was fun and had some laughs. Editing didn't bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly weapons and blood. It could have been a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> DAY: Good enough to watch.
