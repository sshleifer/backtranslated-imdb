When I first looked at it, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We looked at it again and I liked it NOW when I last followed it !! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film consists mainly of two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half a gangster and half of what I like. Itching is his sidekick. Charlie is killed by his friend (EI) and sent to heaven. When Charlie goes back to life, it's the beginning of an amazing adventure. My favorite three is Charlie, Itchy, and a little girl named Anne-Marie, who comes a little later. Two: I love the history of this movie. It is imposed during the United States ban. Three: Don Bluth animation (as usual) is great. The backgrounds are also good. Four: This movie has a strange excitement that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs are beautiful. My favorite song begins with "I need Brazil, excitement, excitement" ... <br /> <br /> So look at this cute movie, if you can, you won't be disappointed! :);) :()
