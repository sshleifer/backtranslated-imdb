Hal Hartley's influence on Adrienne Shelly's "I'll take you there" is not clear, but obviously relates to his work (Shelly has acted in two Hartley films). Not only does his film have a very dense narrative, but hyperstylized and extreme characters make strange feelings in very real light. Although this film is not ironic in its entirety (thanks to God), the small and subtle irons that the pepper is a piece of are referring to the bitter truths of love and lost. The beautiful cinematic and seventies soundtrack "I can see you there" is an excellent indie film that does not tend to postmodern irony when it comes to the reality of love and human emotions. <Br /> <br /> The film begins with Bill's life, which falls into pieces. He has not only sold his best friend, Ray's beautiful homeland, but his wife Rose has left to join Ray. Everything washed, Bill slips in his darkness and despair until his sister Lucy (directed by Adrienne Shelly plays) brings him all kinds of surprises: a self-help book and a "date" of a traumatized brother. <br /> Unwanted Bill is trying to refuse, but Bernice's sudden appearance on his door gives him no choice. There is no doubt that Bernice's original superficial behavior and ridiculous hairstyle reduces his ability to "recover" with him. But his pseudo-hippie qualities irritate him so much that he lashes on his first day. And Bernice is so traumatized by his disgusting remarks that he asserts himself to him, forcing him on him. Ultimately, we are not aware ... except perhaps that he is a psycho. (And who is better than playing psychic than Ally Sheedy?) <br /> <br /> Knowing that Bill desperately wants to see Rose, Bernice offers his car, but provided he takes him first. On the way, he continues to hold Bill's prisoner with his weapon (Pinkerton detective, no less). If Bill and Bernice find themselves in Ray's and Rose's home country, of course, if some are passing by, there is anger, resentment, redemption, passion and violence.
