As a lifelong fan of Dickens, I am constantly disappointed in adapting my novels. <br /> <br /> Although his works performed very accurately on human life at every level of Victorian Britain, all of them were a common language of humor that can be both playful and sarcastic when the narrative is dictated. In some ways he was a literary cartoonist and a cartoonist. He may be serious and fun in the same sentence. He hugged pride, the butterfly arrogant, celebrated modesty and loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich√©, but he was a public writer. <br /> <br /> And this is a comedy that's so often absent from its interpretations. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist is dramatized in BBC television in a sequential form. All misery and cruelty is their, but not humor, irony, and the wild snowman. The result is just a dark, depressing experience: a writer instead of a journalist. It's not really Dickens at all. <br /> <br /> Oliver! The interpretation of official mockery is fully interpretable, ranging from glowing gold to a drunken judge. The classic stand-off and Mrs Brownlow, where the law is described as "ass, idiot", would not have been better. Harry Secombe is the perfect choice. <br /> <br /> But dazzling cruelty, country indifference, cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness are all as sure as the Master would have liked <br /> <br /> And then there's a crime. Ron Moody is a rich Jewish garden, while Oliver Reid has the perfect Bill Sykes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is not surprising that Lionel Bart himself, the East of London Jew, takes liberty with Fagin again interpreted him as a benign companion as Dicken's original. In the novel he was completely merciless by sending some of his boys to the gallows to defend himself (although he was also caught and hung). While in the film he has been presented as a terrifying father figure, rather as a charity than a child corrupt, the latter is a long-term anti-Semitic mood. Otherwise, there is very little freedom in the Dickens original. All the most memorable elements are included. Just enough danger and violence is maintained to ensure narrative fidelity while being sensitive to children. Nancy is still dead, Bullseye escapes narrowly, and Bill Sykes gets a faithful graphic result. <br /> <br /> Every song is great, even though they tend to go to Schmaltz. Mark Lester mime her wonderfully. Both her and my favorite scene is where the world lives "who buys". It's schmaltzy, but it's Dickens through and out. <br /> <br /> I could go on. I could praise the great pieces, the contrast between rich and poor. There is a high quality of action from more British ordinary citizens than you could capture. <br /> <br /> I should give it 10 points, but I feel more Scrooge. Soak it with your Christmas dinner. The original is not better realized.
