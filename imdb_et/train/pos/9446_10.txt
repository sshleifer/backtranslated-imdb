James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. When read "Deliverance", it is immediately transported to Deep South's lush trees. When a person looks at the version of John Boorman's film, he understands how accurately he is capturing the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as narration. The characters are fully realized and the images are fantastic. I saw this movie for the first time after college year. I was in a phase where I watched movies that were all released a few years after their birth in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "All Presidential Men"; beautiful movies, all. It was just a group class. It says a lot.
