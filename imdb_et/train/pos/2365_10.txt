Jeff Wincott is not just a hunk, he can hit! This film has some of the best martial arts moves I've seen for a long time. Ok, so maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I would pray to play a ruthless politician. Let us not forget that Wincott has a partner in the film played by martial arts expert / stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So he's not Cynthia Rothrock, who takes care? He's just as good, if not better! (See the end of the movie for your fighting scene, one word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you haven't seen it, you're really missing some great martial arts action.
