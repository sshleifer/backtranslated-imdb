This is one of my favorite films of all time and would recommend it to anyone. In my favorite movie list (mental list, mind) are the only ones who are equal, such as Lord of the Rings, Breathed Away, and Flight Home. <br /> <br /> The main character Jess. At the beginning of the movie, she is a shy girl with a slightly strange background with many friends who are boys as girls. She really sucks you into her life. I definitely can't get any of the main characters of the movie, or blame anyone else for a movie. <br /> <br /> Football was also interesting to see someone I like who has no idea of ​​the rules. The film is never boring. Romance is really cute and didn't make me hard! One thing that really did was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are in India and many films contain many colorful Indian conventions that offer both interesting cultural insights and everything else. Indian people are also fun! In essence, it is a film about selecting and fighting for the desired journey. <br /> <br /> A good movie is becoming my favorite film genre thanks to this movie. They're funny, they refresh and make you well! ^ _ ~
