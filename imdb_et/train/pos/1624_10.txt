The old mill pond is more respectful of "African-American entertainers of the 1930s than all denigrations of the competition (regardless of whether the caricature is Stepin Fetch). In addition to what I have just mentioned, Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill Bojangles, Robinson and Louis Armstrong are also frogs or fish. This Hugh Harmony and Rudolf Ising's Happy Harmonies comic is a very entertaining musical, perfect character. They all sounded as much as the real thing the party thinks they might be. If not, they are definitely very attractive. Even the lazy, unchanging Fetchit characterization becomes an exciting workout when he gets a tiger called "Hold That Tiger". Recommended for fans of 30-year animation and jazz music.
