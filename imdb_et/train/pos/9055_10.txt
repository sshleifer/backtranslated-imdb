It's an amazing movie and all the actors and actors, and very good! Although some actors and actors were not involved in the exhibition, they seemed to have been active since the age of 1! It was funny, tough and just a very good movie. In most parts I just didn't know what was going to happen next! I was like I think it will happen, wait, I think it will happen. All age groups love this movie! In some parts I couldn't finish laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally struck and I couldn't believe what I saw! I'll see this movie again! This is one of those movies where he can't get bored. Every time you see it, it's so tight. I definitely recommend watching this movie!
