I love Monte Carlo and enjoyed this movie thoroughly. I thought everything was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very pleasant, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good when he accused the girl with a golden heart. George Hamilton was a charming and perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a complete jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a very cute performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife. Pleasant ensemble. Lots of talent, smart script, lots of going and beautiful places. Just a nice funny day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is not in your sight.
