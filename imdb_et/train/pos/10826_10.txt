I have rarely appeared in watching a movie with such a warm and happy feeling. I felt like I had been with very good friends and I had a great time! I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Action was great, although I have to mention Bill Nye in particular to give it a perfectly flawless performance. Bill is a great actor and would like to see him more in movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and always love to see them because they give such a strong result. And Billy Connolly, as always, is absolutely proud. It was an excellent ensemble performance for all involved. This refreshing experience to see a well-written, well-functioning and beautiful movie.
