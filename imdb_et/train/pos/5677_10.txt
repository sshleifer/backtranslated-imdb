The third and, in my opinion, the best Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest character in the previous series, but Hugh Laurie's Prince Regent is ridiculous. As a package, quality is quality through and through convincing sets of repertoire, excellent cutting sarcasm and nervous little bits, actresses of "macbeth" and Prince Georges happy luck with the chicken, and there are no words in Dr. Johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Few comedies have been as cunning as they are funny, okay, an odd dirty observation or a line arrives, but it's mostly a scream.
