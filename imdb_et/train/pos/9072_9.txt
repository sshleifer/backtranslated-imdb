I remember this as one of my favorite books as a child and I wanted to read it for some time with my 5 year old daughter. I knew the film was coming out soon so we went to the book to get the book and they gave us a preview the next day! We hurried home and spent the afternoon reading a book so we could compare. There was no need. The only thing between the book and the movie is the name of the main characters, the fact that there is a bet, and a whole bunch of worms. Oh yes, I almost forgot that a child who prepares most of the worms wants to present his masterpieces with a French accent. How children know each other, the number of children involved, the contribution, the number of worms that need to eat, the time it has to eat the worms, how they are cooked, the progress of friendships, the climax scenes, etc. NOT the same. But somehow it didn't destroy my movie. The characters are all enjoyable and the film didn't disappoint me. A cautious word for the parents, it was a moment when you heard that the adults in the room moved their breath, and that was when Billy's little brother talked about his penis as a "weak cock." The embarrassing part came when my daughter asked those sitting around us, "Does anyone know what a great dick is?" lol. This and accidental "seizure" is the same mistake as this movie. My daughter thought she could get worm around worm 3 and 4 (and keep the empty nacho container just in case) but the worm 6 was good. He and I both really enjoyed the movie and I had a great time sharing experiences.
