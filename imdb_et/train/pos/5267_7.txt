Apparently, Ruggero Deodato thought early that his story wouldn't work if he went too seriously, so he decided to put him in the camp. The result is a movie that can be seen as a ridiculous sword and witchcraft epic or a very fun comedy! And I think I'm going to another. The short moments of gore are well done, Paul Brothers mocking the material openly (they even hatch in one scene!), Eva La Rue, like a girl, is a charming, spirited and kind-hearted performance. who stands with "boys". Plus, where else would you see the inside of a dragon that is illuminated like a disco? (***)
