A pretty memorable film of a variety of animals-killing-humans that is similar to "Willard" because it marks an actor characterizing aging (in this case, a step forward to the level of Les Tremayne, who makes the only distinctive performance I've seen by giving it) as a man whose life is out of balance and who then decides to use their animal friends to retaliate exactly to those who have violated him. Yes, it is one of those films where pretty much everyone is despicable, so you rejoice when they die, and in fact the choice of actors, places, etc. cannot give the film a better fucking decadence. <br /> <br /> The Tremayne character is "Snakey Bender" and is definitely the most interesting thing in the movie: an obsolete snake collector, confirmed by John Philip Souza's music. When a local preacher confirms his practice of collecting small animals from local school pupils to feed his snakes, and his friend marries with a stripper (thus disturbing his ritual on Wednesday night), he continues to strike in the process of creating a memorable cluster of cliffs under the cliffs where he scrapes wrecks after their bad owners. One fun game that can be played while watching "Snakes" is making bets that cars land the most far from the rock. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is very cheap and exploitative, but really fun for fans of such movies.
