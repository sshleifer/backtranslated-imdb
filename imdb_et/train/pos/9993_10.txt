The toughest and most funny Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can watch and watch the tape 100 times. I'm laughing at my ** and I'm crying for a few moments. This is really a good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks - it's black! In short - Brooks (billionaire) gets home on the streets for 30 days to defeat his enemy's entire enemy. Reality bites, but in the end - it's about warm relationships between people.
