NASCAR maniac is an interesting film. From 1983 you can see many racing cars. Even difficult racing scenes are so much realistic. But I have to admit that I haven't seen any competition before 1995, because before that they didn't show NASCAR competitions in Germany. <br /> <br /> Fan of Burt Reynolds I am, the film is basically what we are used to see from Reynolds in the 1980s: Burt behind a fast car wheel, like his Bandit films. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must-have. If you only love one of these two things, I also recommend looking at it. If you don't like either NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give it a chance, but keep in mind that this movie was far from winning the Oscar Academy Award. <br /> <br /> This is the typical humor of the 80s. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you will like it.
