A long-term prison, closed for more than 20 years, is reopened and Ethan Sharpe (late, great actor Lane Smith), when he is there, is placed as a guard. As prisoners are put to work, securing the place, they are asked to enter the old space. It triggers a fierce spirit that causes merciless destruction to both the guards and the prisoners; Burke, a reprehensible prisoner (Viggo Mortensen, who shows early role) is a driving force. <br /> <br /> I know this is a brain movie for your atmosphere (it was beaten from an abandoned punishment facility near Rawlins in Wyoming), but it raises this horror to a higher level. It has a great sense of prediction that started right away. Then his director, Renny Harlin, made his fourth director; She got her "Nightmare on Elm Street 4", which led the concert and started her career in mainstream action movies, thrillers and horror films. Chelsea Field as a young woman fighting for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as a tired veteran to convict Cresus, Tom Everett as a troubled con Rabbit, Ivan Kane as outgoing Lasagna, Tommy's "Tiny" Lister as a soft giant Tiny, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton . It is also worth noting that Kane Hodder (like the revenge spirit) is an early-acting credit that helped * play * her play Jason Voorhees' feature film "Friday 13". <br /> <br /> Decent Special Effects Moody Lighting is a polite genre by Mac Ahlberg, spooky music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone, great visions, incredibly gloomy location, and a generous flashy and intense presentation to make it quite fun. It's a nasty, spooky and fun fan of fun. <br /> <br /> 8/10
