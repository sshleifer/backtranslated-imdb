This show is wonderful. It has one of the best writings I've ever seen. It is a great leader of Dvid Trainer who also led the second smart TV series BOY MEETS WORLD. </p> </p> Like three companies, ROSEANNE and the famous COSBY SHOW, it's been on TV for a long time. <br /> <br /> This completely crafted jokes with great performances that you would only dream of is a great show for people who lived in the seventies and for people who didn't. It shows the call for young people and young people. The perfect show.
