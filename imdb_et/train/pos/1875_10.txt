He's on the edge of the loser. He has been counseled by a psychiatrist for treatment and this is the relationship that plays a central role. <br /> <br /> With flash and therapy, the Antwones source and remedy will appear. <br /> <br /> Perfect performances with all the pain. The story is actually the tragedy of a family with emotional and physical torment. All actors provide a convinced and realistic complete blood supply. <br /> <br /> One film's message is the importance of raising children fairly. <br /> <br /> True Antwone deserves success. To barely have suffered as a child, but to rise upwards, it shows a wonderful character. <br /> <br /> And for all those who have suffered such torture but have survived and succeeded, you are all winners. 10 out of 10
