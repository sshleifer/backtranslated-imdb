I first saw this movie when it was broadcast by the BBC in the UK in the 2000s. My prayer Steve Parkhouse saved it to VHS and sent it to me. Until then, I only saw Shaw Bros kung fu movies with these harsh lights (so viewers saw the movements clearly) so it was known to me that I saw something that looked like it was Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong. It was also my first contact with Tsui Hark's films (pronounced, probably "Choy Huk"). In the Hong Kong film?) In the heart of China's GHOST STORY, there is a simple and moving love story that is even more true to Leslie Cheung's outstanding talents (which is a tragic, tragic waste of life) and beauty. and Joey Wongi Elegant. Recognized Joey is gorgeous, but it is his ballet hand gesture that gives him character inaccessible eroticism that is difficult to analyze. And even though Joey is now almost 20 years old (gawd, which is not us?), It is always a permanent image of this actress. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers have said here that the film is simplified and there are no surprises, but they have no fact that this film was based on the famous Chinese stage, written by Pu Songling about 1700! It's a bit like a complaint that Rome and Julia have a predictable end and just copy WEST SIDE STORY. (I just wanted to get it out of my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, China is the most important romantic story of GHOST STORY. He has a great tragedy because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen will never be together. It is about mature because no one of us can mature until we have suffered a lot of damage. It is a sacrifice because the victim is an essential part of true love. And Wu Ma's comedy styles don't hurt a bit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Chinese GHOST STORY trying not to look through the Western culture filter and just get fine.
