Undoubtedly, John Le Carre's novels are obviously a classic film. Peter Egani (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus Czech Intelligence Director), Ray McAnally (Magnus' father-father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus mentor) the processor), along with the rest of the letters, is so perfect and natural that the person responsible for them should have given the award. Even small parts, such as Major Membury, are filled perfectly. It says a lot about the strength of the performances and the character of the novel that, despite Magnus's doubling, Magnus and Axel can't be closer than Jack Brotherhood and US Intelligence to Grant Lederer. I've read this book at least a dozen times, and I watched the movie almost repeatedly and both have continued to attract it. If I had one book that could take the desert, Perfect Spy would be the choice for everyone else.
