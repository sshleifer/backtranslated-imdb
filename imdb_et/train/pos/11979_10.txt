I usually try to look at it every day, and although I've been watching it for the past 4 years, I haven't seen every episode. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is about Danny Tanner, who is the guy who makes the news for sports. His wife is killed in a drunken car accident and asks Jesse, a motorcycle from Elvis Maniac, and owns her hair. Joey, an adult child who does comedy and caricature voices all the time to take care of her three girls, Donna Joe, calls her DJ, Stephinie, the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br They all live under one roof, with no one helping them out. <br /> <br /> Later on, Jesse gets her girlfriend and later married to her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (this is going to happen in the new seasons) This exhibition is fantastic if you like the life of the Zack and Cody suites, that is, Raven, the boy meets the world and designing the woman, you love it. (It will heal in the end season) Look at it, you love it!
