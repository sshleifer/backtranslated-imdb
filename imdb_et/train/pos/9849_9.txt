When I saw the trailers, I just saw the movie. And when I was, I had the feeling that I felt dissatisfied. It was a great movie, don't get me wrong, but I think the big parts that are already on trailers when you catch your drift. It went very fast and ran forward so I was never bored and I enjoyed watching it. Humor was absolutely great. My first exposure to salmon (.. or something like that).
