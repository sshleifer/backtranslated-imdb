I hit this movie late at night / Sunday morning with my brother. We were drinking. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. "Luxurious" ocean liner, which is actually "roll on, roll off" a ferry that has all the doors with sticky stickers that say that the same door is used in another scene - this movie rocks !! Consistency is so bad that you can't help but notice it, it hits you in front of the faces. In the final scenario, he jumps with the ferry with distance. Cut your son and new girlfriend (ship's PR director who knows the kung-fu and was in the police before, but was rejected to make his way - true) on a ship that is going away very quickly from the explosion. ...... Then dad hugs them. HoW ???? Who cares, the magic. There is no redemption function for this movie. The casino has a large bedroom with one casino table. if you chase these crooks, there is only one hidden place, you guessed it. Enter the villain who, instead of checking one table, continue to pick up four fruit pans and a small corner bar (casino corner bar). They walk straight through the only hiding area, allowing our Casper to move around and take them out. <br /> <br /> Take some mates, get some drinks, put this movie and drag it.
