When I was on a Hollywood video, I watched these clearance films and there was DEMONICUS with five bucaroos plus fifty percent! I saw it only once before and couldn't do that great! The second look was much better than the first. The box is so cool and the music is very good. If you haven't seen Demonic yet, I suggest that you do it or if you rented and hated Demonic, give it another chance, because the second view may change your mind. If you saw a copy of Hollywood Video at the price I got for it, don't pass it on because it's a lot! <br /> <br /> Demonicus is a very different but fun movie. it's like watching an interactive video game, playing it with a very small budget and with the players I don't know. We started a video game with a man and a woman, some of whom are in Italy and where there is a cave that looks like a railway road / train tunnel and he says he's not going there and what he's doing? Normal stuff! He goes there and finds many gladiator items and weapons and almost perfectly preserved legendary gladiator named Tyrannous! Where did this Tyrannous sit and how his body was so good and where was the Holy Pot So every cave is with the Caultron Pot? Tyrannous carries his armor, helmet and has a gun or two. He does the strangest thing a person can do, puts a helmet on and takes over the spirit of Tyrannous! From there he walks just to kill all nearby campers to bring back the true Tyrannous. <br /> <br /> I said before my video game. It's hard to explain, but it just seems like it is. Music even sounds like video games. The actor is really terrible. The actors say the things he does, oh he was nuts and fine because his nuts I'm going home! The boy runs and tries to find his girlfriend at night and still works during the day, still looking for a break! <br /> <br /> This movie is a bug, but it's not a classic like a werewolf, but it's fun if you like really low budget bias on movies, it's better to see Demonic!
