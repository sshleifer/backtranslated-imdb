(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure what to think of the movie. Not too many children's films. You should definitely watch with your parent because it involves death and death. But I was surprised that I had a little fun. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed after 81 minutes. (even less without credit) And the trailer can guess that rodent is the main creature. But unfortunately they torture her. Until the end of the movie. These two handles pulled the 2 stars into the movie. But I recommend the movie. Even a sequel. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 7/10
