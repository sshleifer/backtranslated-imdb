Visual creative ethics of unobtrusive style. <br /> <br /> This film may not have the most alternative dramaturgy or the most artistic action. But who dares to say that this film is not art? I am not a supporter of this idea that an important film must be serious, non-commercial, or disturbing me. Even there are many movies that fit the attribute I like. <br /> <br /> Not sure this is one of the movies. What you get is pure, excessive creativity with very positive, childish energy. This film does not reflect reality. Its friendly naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me this would be a nice combination of times! Except for this music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well done. I always liked the cinematography and productions of this movie. This is where Bogus Journey goes far beyond his prequel. The effect is also good, and I think most of them are done without cgi. I generally prefer big old effects for big budget movies. Make sure his "just another Hollywood movie" is a view of some people. But I think it's very charismatic. <br /> <br /> A short word for soundtrack: all bands and orchestral music are great for the movie. There is also a lack of sound design. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get this story from Winger's "station". I love unusual camera work at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is very naive and very imaginative! It's better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - God's wrath. It's absolutely better than kane, apocalypse or chris markers sans soleil ... ... it's even better than Total Recall ... No! Yes and so! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are just the best film ever made. (which is greater self-defense) <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is not a better film. So Bogus Jorney is better. Even Terminator 2 is not a better sequel! This is not!
