There has never been anything like this, it's for sure. This episodic, seemingly superfluous trilogy really makes sense, and as such it is not a film of Groovin 'Gary, Utah's cross-contamination. This is a very self-conscious film about how the filmmaker REAKS Groovin 'Garyle. For Harris, the whole project is clearly an extended and prominent difference between guilt and repentance. She tries to reconcile her sins - yes, Gary tried to commit suicide after her initial doctoral thesis - through corrections, comments, and conventions, restoring Hollywood narrative billboards such as the best friend and defiant happy ending (two different, along with adjusting the Glover version) and using them for personal use . Thus, although it remains a thematic film on gender and differences, it ensures that it is also a film about films - but at a level of almost unprecedented complexity. There's just so much; when talking and talking about this story, Harris is at the right place three times in a row and he misses the chance to do something about it. Extremely moving and as deep as the camp ever gets.
