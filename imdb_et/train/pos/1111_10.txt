It's not "so bad that it's good," it's just fine! For those who do not understand why, you are four years old (in response to some comments ...). Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is self parody, your parody and parody to me. This is the most genius of cinematography. I have this and three prequels sitting on my DVD disc next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything you or I call the standard. I write scripts and this movie opened up to me any genre of comedy we've never seen before. It can only be taken in parts ... to exploit it ... now I'm just trying to reach the minimum of ten lines. My comment ended some time ago. Hopefully this will work now when I present it.
