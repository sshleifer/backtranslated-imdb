James Cagney is known for his harsh and gangster roles, but he has played quite a lot of soft characters during his career. This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical film Cagney stands for. <br /> <br /> Cagney even makes a little song in this and also a lot of dancing. And it must be said that he was not bad. He plays a role with great confidence. Apparently, he had some dancing jobs in his early life before his actor career began to take off, so it wasn't really a strange thing that he also took his career in his musical role. He obviously knows it in a completely different genre when most people are used to seeing him. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who was probably the best and most successful member of the genre. His first 30-year-old musicals set the musical genre quite a lot, and he was also responsible for genre films such as "42nd Street". His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy than anything else. â€œThe 30's musicals were never about this song, something more played on the 40's and later on the musicals, mostly in the MGM studio. <br /> <br /> As usual, it has a light and easy story that is placed in a musical world that is of course predictable and progressing formally. However, it is a fun and easy story that just makes it an interesting movie. So the characters and the actors who represent them. The odd thing about it is that the whole plot of the film's line changes in the end of an abandoned movie when the movie starts with a musical number routine. <br /> <br /> Music moments towards movie ending are also fun and well done, although I'm not too big a fan of myself. There's another young Billy Barty on the musical number. He often played small boys / children / mice and at any early stage in his career, including the movie "Gold Diggers of 1933", a year earlier. <br /> <br /> Recommended early genre movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
