I'm going to movies that talk about talking about animals with care. For every wonderful thing, like Babe, you get equal poverty, like the terrible transformation of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of cats and dogs, you have a great idea that the film does not live up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the fact that wisecracking is a parrot doesn't fill me exactly. But I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And it will succeed in your heart without understanding you. <br /> <br /> Russian housekeeper Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in the laboratory. One day he hears a song coming from the basement. And when he examines, he finds a parrot in his cage, who sings with his little heart. Misha is fascinated by the bird, especially if it turns out that the parrot can not only sing, it can be said. And not some phrases. The parrot you really want to chat with. <br /> <br /> Parrot is called Paulie (expressed by Jay Mohr) and acknowledges a colleague in Misha. I was wondering how this world reached a wise bird in the basement of dust, Misha persuades Paulie to tell her his biography. It all started when she was a child, and taking care of Marie, a five-year-old girl who was spunky. Two of them became feathers to birds (OK, bad!). <br /> <br /> When Marie's parents were worried about their close friendship with the city, they kept her away. And finally, they did it after Marie almost hurt her in the autumn after Paulie's teaching. Desperate for Paulie to reunite with him, Paulie is starting a long journey across America, covering many new owners who travel far behind and even reach the bars. The drill that is! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of many talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 1990s. And although it was not the same for Babe or the success of the boxer, Paulie succeeds quite a few levels and is occasionally striking intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's stand-up style works well for Paulie's part. She never plays that part that is too smug, even if she's a little smart Aleck. Paulie's reputation, but she's also naive. <br /> <br /> Because he has lived with Marie in a rather hidden life when he is taken away, he must take care of himself for the first time. And if he gets into the hands of different owners, they promise Paulie to reunite with Marie, which he believes. Only interrupting these promises from time to time. <br /> <br /> Paulie is a little episodic. This is the result of an eclectic person to whom Paulie comes and how he slowly brings Marie closer. First, he strikes the shop where he receives Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kind woman who teaches her the meaning of ways. He knows Paulie's situation and directs RV all over Marie to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is an occasionally very touching movie. Her productions at Ivyga are some of the best. Paulie's wonderful moments on the shoulders that sang Tom Jones's numbers. How he needs hope is great and some dialogues are quite well written and even thought-provoking: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life that you put in because you think But what Ivy tells me taught, is that you have to live like there may not be later. "<br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy leaves Paulie is the heart of the moment. And the order in which he strives to fly for the first time over the Grand Canyon, growing majestically, is such a beautifully designed scene that will stay with you for hours after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the unfortunate sad moment, there is a lot to laugh at. Paulie falls into a group of parrots in a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The anonymous effects here are really great, because four birds make a completely choreographic dance number. And Paulie even gets romance. What is intermittent when he falls low (played by Mohr). It may be the only complaint I have. As soon as you enjoy one situation, the film moves to Paulie the other. <br /> <br /> The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATMs is funny, but also a bit annoying. I'm surprised that DreamWorks was given the opportunity to add such a scene to children's movies. And Paulie's diamond robbing is very impossible. He has been captured and sent to the laboratory for animal testing, where he has remained since then. <br /> <br /> Finally, the story comes from a lab where Misha promises to help Paulie. Of course they find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such a shocking intensity, I stayed for several minutes with a numbness. Paulie may never have longevity, but I believe it is the same brilliant film. The same laughs. The same flawless effect. And the same surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> Little Pearl.
