In much the same way, Frank Miller and his Sin City used the black-and-white comics to express themselves (and the influence of the film's noir), as did Christian Volckman's Renaissance. <br /> <br /> It's 2054 in Paris. In the natural science tradition, the future is bright, a sparkling sparkle of sparkling wine. It is a jewel in misery, inequality and darkness; light and beautiful on the top, under dark underlays. One of these "bright" people is a kidnapped scholar of a very large and influential global company (Avalon). Known and Effective, Captain Karas (by James Craig, the new James Bond himself) gives him the task. <br /> <br /> The plot and layout are not too original. It is heavily influenced by the film noir, Gibson's Neuromancer and other detective stories with films such as Blade Runner, Sin City, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and Minority Report. There is the main plot surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end. It's not hard to figure out. <br /> <br /> The strength and originality of the film is in its intense visual presentation. Paris has a complex set of levels and levels. It is based on a more primitive industrial infrastructure. When the city rises, its architectural complexity and luminescence. But in this structure, the upper humanity's ideals and behavior are not elevated. Paris has been sophisticated animated and superb black and white. The spirit of the movie is with Sin City (comics), then Sin City, the film with its source material. This is done even more easily because it remains in the same media; animation. Much the same as the scanner In the dark, the story pushed down the visual aspects, so it does. White and dark, black and white create a contrasting atmosphere, as well as visual ambiguity. True and false, black and white can lose all meaning while it is before us. The film proves that black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time. <br /> <br /> By following the spirit of the film, I can be both a critic and a fan. I can love and relax in the same light. This is definitely an experience I recommend to lovers of visual art. So pour the other black and tan, enter the gap and enjoy the ride.
