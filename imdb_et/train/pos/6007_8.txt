If you haven't heard of this movie from Walt Disney Pictures, don't worry about it. It would be categorized as other Disney films for educational purposes such as "Family Planning". <br /> <br /> It was produced with Kotex to teach pre-teens to menstruation, presumably. It only teaches on a superficial level, so it doesn't go to the animation film "Ram's Head" / Reproductive System. <br /> <br /> The film shows "Disney's Wonderful World" elements, such as turning the page and using animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This movie cannot be found, so if you find a movie, good luck and enjoy.
