"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies. I have this movie on DVD! The film discusses the New York widow (Cher), who loves her boyfriend (Danny Aiello), an angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works in a bakery. I'm glad that Cher won the Oscar for this movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also great. The Norman Jewish direction (who led "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is a great movie that everyone can see and laugh at. Must-have! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
