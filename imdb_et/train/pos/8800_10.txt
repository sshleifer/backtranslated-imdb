First, I don't understand why some people find this movie so American. Of course, there are moments when the US is being charged directly, such as Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach, and to some extent Mira Nair. But come, they're not naive charges; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents published by the CIA on Chile confirm this, for example. <br /> <br /> But returning to the movie that I enjoyed most is the different moods we find in it. We find that children are educated to honor all dead people in the event; we find the unfortunate couple that the tragedy of this day is changing; we find ordinary people who have the feelings of humiliating in the shadows of the September 11th events and react differently, with dignity or disappointment; we also find someone in the movie to whom the fall of the towers causes real happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - as powerful as they are or even more - make a consistent mix and help the spectator see how different people around the world responded to the September 11 events. So what we see is a panorama that is much more complicated than white and black, and it can make some people rage; but it is the world we live in and there is no place for manicuristic ideologies, no matter what the presidents or priests can tell us. even the release date of this movie in the United States. It is a shame, because most American people ask why this disaster happened, and this movie can give them clues. This film, very unlike what some people in this forum think, says that everything we do today determines our future and that the mistakes of the past affect how we live today.
