Danis has a Real Life scene where the family competes to see what sex can complete the crossword. The answer to one hint is Murphy's Law: Anything that may go wrong will go wrong. This is exactly what Dan Burns (Steve Carell, Agency) and a local newspaper columnist. Dan is an expert in giving everyday advice, but he realizes that things are not so perfect in themselves. Dan in real life is amazing to capture the irony of their everyday lives and is successful in embracing all of them in comedy, tragedy and beauty. Moreover, this movie is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters all alone ... every daughter in important stages of his life: the first anxiety to try his driving license, who is in the middle of his teenage angst phase, and the youngest who races early away from childhood. Things turn to Dan when he goes to a family meeting in Rhode Island and stumbles over an intriguing woman in a bookstore. <br /> <br /> His name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book that would help her avoid inconvenient situations ... exactly what is saved when they are burned into the Burns Family household. <br /> <br /> When you have seen Steve Carelli's office or Little Miss Sunshine, I know he is incomparable with comic timing and also with an enormously dynamic actor. Steve Carell is fantastic when you try to take away all the family-related emotions: disappointment and sincere sympathy. Both the family and the house itself provide a warm environment for the film, which is in conflict with the internal instability that has arisen throughout the film, and eventually breaks through the very stopping peak. The film has only some predictable results, but at the same time life is made up of irony as well as predictability: what is in itself irony. <br /> <br /> Dan is definitely worth living in real life, only to rejoice at all the funny nuances we often lack in everyday life, and I will probably enjoy it for the second time or even a third. Just "put it on my tab."
