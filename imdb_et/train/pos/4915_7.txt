And a rather unexpected plot line for this era: the city of New Orleans has a plague and only Richard Widmark can stop it! Elia Kazan's brand-related topics: water borders, working men, crowds, refugees, blue collar, backstreet violence - all here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is quite effective as the ice-cold mobster high score, Zero Mostel, like Dom Delouise, was somewhat uncomfortable, but definitely traceable. I liked Barbara Bel Geddes because it's a cool, cool woman - I thought she and Widmark were an incredible couple. <br /> <br /> He always reminds me of the Sinatra face and the intense silent way, and it's like a compliment to something. I would never have heard this movie, and yes, you have to admire Widmark's action. I also liked Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role several times, they make an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The blackout itself is McGuffin, and you have to know that it's not exactly like it was in real life - rather small, at least not? - But I found that it carries the plot nicely. <br /> <br /> Check it out. This is good. *** outta ****
