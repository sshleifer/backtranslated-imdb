I really enjoyed this movie. The action of the adult actors was great, although I found the main game a little stiff. But he was a very new talent. Humor is very sublime and not your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. E.e. Professor Nutty. If you have a brief attention and are accustomed to typical Hollywood things that you probably wouldn't like because it is a bit slower pace. I chose it for Blu-ray and I have to say that the picture quality is top-notch. Probably one of the better-looking Blu-rays I've ever seen. The extras were also cool. They deleted quite a bit, but it is probably good because most deleted scenes didn't add anything.
