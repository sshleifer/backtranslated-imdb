It could be WWE's 2nd best PPV after it was a good surprise! John Cena was a great game where he irritated Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his title in a short sloppy game with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won Benoit & Guerrero over a rather violent table. Jamie Noble had a very good game with Kidman, which was surprising to me. Booker T defeated The Big Show at the competition, at one point, Booker T scissors on the Big Show and sent him directly to the table. In the foolish decision of WWE Christian and Lance Storm, envious anti-Americans won a lot of help from Hogan and Edge from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had an evening where he was full of big spots and RVD was supposed to keep his title in DQ so I was happy to hold the title. Triple H also signed Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little or nothing. And the main event became Rock's first 7-time WWE World Champion who fought with Kurt Angle & Undertaker as well as a triple threat. In general, this is probably WWE's 2nd best PPV in 2002! 7/10
