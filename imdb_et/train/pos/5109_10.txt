I grew up in Houston and was nine when that movie came. As a result, I don't remember anything about the movie. But I remember the feeling that this song "Lookin 'for Love", which hit Gilley and the mechanical bull Johnny Lee, still leads to childhood memories when I hear it. <br /> <br /> But for a few years I saw this movie for the first time as an adult, and all I can say is blown. Some movies have hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can. Uncle Bob's beach house, the chemical industry in Texas City, Gilley's ballroom and Bud and Sissy. And for this reason, he has no wider complaint. But no matter how you feel about land music (I can't stand it despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. For this reason I love it!
