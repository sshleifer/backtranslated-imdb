I loved it, being a fan of the original series, I always thought about what the story would be like - it couldn't make me happy. I also love the fact that besides Eric Stoltz I didn't know one person - it is refreshing, like the BSG. It has brought me a whole new rich talent - you can't wait until the series is aerated. Well done Ronald D. Moore and the team - great work. Special effects, dialogue and action were all on the ground and I felt emotionally connected. I know there are purists who probably disagree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was much better than most of the Sci-Fi stuffs produced in the last decade.
