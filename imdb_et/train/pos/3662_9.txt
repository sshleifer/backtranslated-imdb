It's really a strange movie - and it's not bad. This is a combination of neo-realistic film about homeless and fairy tales. I'm sure some may find this movie a bit too strange, but I loved it. Again, this director repeats the excellent casting of everyday people (not actors) and gets an excellent ensemble-type performance. Although these films are not nearly as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point - it's just very absurd. Ignore the special effects of cheese - after all, it was done in the early 1950s and special effects are not very important anyway (or at least they shouldn't be in the movies). Instead, just sit back and enjoy a very strange and stupid ride. If you are not a general criminal, you have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, since I've first reviewed this movie, I've seen another DeSica-directed movie that's absolute black and what LASTE watches in the US. Although it is not fantasy or light in the spirit of MIRACLE IN MILAN, it is still an excellent film.
