The mask king is a beautifully talked story that puts the sex preferences of the family against men in favor of love and friendship. In the 1930s, during the floods in China, we meet Wang, an elder street performer whose talents are magical and grasping all who know him as a witness. When a famous opera performer sees and then friends with Wang, he invites Wang to join his troupe. At the same time, we learn that Wang's family tradition allows him to only pass on his secrets. Wang learning that Wang is childless is encouraged to find a heir before the magic is lost. Wang to the heart, Wang buys an 8-year-old for his legacy; he taught his new son, Doggie, an ancient silk mask art. Soon Wang will discover the fact about Doggie, which threatens rare and dying art. <br /> <br /> Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the different emotions that accompany it. The story sucks. It's calm and costume simple. All in all, this is an international award-winning art film that cannot help but move and inspire.
