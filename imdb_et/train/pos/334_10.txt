This movie is very simple: "PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: Actors act, they seem to be citizens of this age, 1100 B.C. They perfect the stars. The second reason is that the poem Homere expressed in his poem is well-given to the production. Among other things, the choir's stories give a special atmosphere that makes us an artistic handover. Third reason: restoring the interior is absolutely perfect in the Mediterranean areas where the poem was held. And first and foremost, emotion is a place of assembly. I repeat my appreciation: "PURE MASTERPIECE".
