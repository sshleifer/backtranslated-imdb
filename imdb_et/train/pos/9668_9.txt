This is a small movie, with little signs, a theatrical. And yet he says something about Ireland that you can't find elsewhere. This movie is from Ireland. All this is sad, it is sadness, it's self-deception. Boys, champion Doyle, SP O'Donell, cannon, Senator Doogan's daughter, Gar and above all Madge. I know them. I'm a pub with them or kneeling with them to pray. They are our sad history and they are over us.
