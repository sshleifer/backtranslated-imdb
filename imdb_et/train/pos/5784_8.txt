I've noticed that a lot of people who post "Kerching!" the board hates this exhibition, which I really really surprise. I think this is one of the best British children's shows. It is a shame that it ends because it is very funny (sometimes a bit cheesy) and has big characters. The main character is somewhat similar to Del Boy, though smarter. With his two best friends, he tried to get a million pounds for his mother, starting an online business and picking up the Rudeboy alias. His friends are Seymour (who wants to eat) and Danny (who is simple-minded and comic in nature). Throughout the exhibition, some characters have remained and new ones have come, but it has always been fun and refreshing.
