"Moonstruck" is a cute little movie directed by a great storyteller Norman Jewison (at night, on the Fiddler roof, hurricane). The film is great on many levels. It shows a good slice of Italian culture, is touching romance and (best of all) is a fun comedy. One of the things most liked by the film was the unusual appearance of the actors. Nicolas Cage sees most of the movies odd and Cher ... looks like Cher always looks a little odd. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a fun movie and easy to recommend. <br /> 7.4 out of 10
