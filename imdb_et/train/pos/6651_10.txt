Gandhi, Greater: <br /> <br /> The size of the world is related to people such as Alexanader, the great, Ashoka the Great, that their greatness was lied when more than people were glorified. Gandhi is called great because it is not really big, but human, because I always believe that bringing mankind into us is one where one is great. A man and a person who was willing to sacrifice himself in the struggle against humanity, but not his enemies. Let me now move on to the movie review. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi My Father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi My Dad is a film that is not about Gandhi, but about his son Harilal Gandhi. The son, whose father was one of the greatest people to walk on this land, managed to imagine the story. The story tells the story of a deceptive son who drives a nation. criticism of Gandhi as the failure of his son's father, I would say it was a victim, Gandhi had made his son's father to do justice to his father. <br /> <br /> I wish the essence of this film is dominant not only in India, in the land of Gandhia, but in the hearts of all people in the world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi's real person. Jai price.
