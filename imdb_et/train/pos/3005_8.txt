It is still the benchmark for assessing all the golden ages, and given the limited technology and the dubious ethical standard of the authorities (on-screen), it is well respected by generations of similar experiments from film and television. Fast and furious, with lots of Warner Brothers napkins, and luckily there is no time for love interests, because it makes this a great deal of pain for the violent end. I've never understood why DA had to drive Vance everywhere, I always thought they were at the table. Palette as a detective, especially Girardo, when the doctor is joyfully eccentric and un-PC - when the other murder victim examines, he smells that there were too many people in the world anyway. Of course, William Powell is Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director), which makes the movie what it is - when Powell ever did evil? <br /> <br /> There wasn't really a really good job in finding a dead body and an unconscious dog at the crime scene of the offender army! Best of all, Vance tells us all the sequences of events surrounding the murders - mercy sets of models with fantastic corners of cameras to produce a very modern feel and amazing what has gone before. The only problem is as usual, if the conclusion is not suitable for all the deductive processes that are shown to the full extent, and the somewhat finished end is used; Of course, some of Chani, Moto and others can of course be concluded in this way. But because it happens so fast and is morally suspicious, it doesn't diminish my opinion of the KMC status as a classic! <br /> <br /> All the pictures I've ever seen on KMC are (in the worst case) like watching a goldfish bowl, so if you are interested in wearing it until you are sucked in.
