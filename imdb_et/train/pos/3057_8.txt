Wow I really liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as a quiet beater-man Alex. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and fun. /> Alex, a married man (like his father), with a little boy, goes through a medieval crisis and wants to give up his family business so he gets help from a psychiatrist and at this place he meets young people free of spirit, Sarah, whom he falls in love with. One day, Alex doesn't know what to do if he gets a job to kill him whom he knows. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch it if you like interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
