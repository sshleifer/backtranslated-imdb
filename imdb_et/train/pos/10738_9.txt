SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary on the WTC.2 attacks by French filmmakers in New York to film NYFD activities that have been most affected by this event. / 11 nothing happens that gives the film even more horror than the scenario. On the day of the attacks, it seems to be just another boring day at work, but it will soon change. If one of the filmmakers continues their firefighters, he will film his first countdown, the only first effect. He goes to the WTC with firefighters and goes inside the building. In the case of another flight, people realize that this is not an accident. In the next time, we see firefighters who are going to save as many people as possible, meanwhile, we hear the sounds of beating, the sounds of those who jumped off the tower and fell to the ground, the most depressing moment in the documentary. Then the tower collapses and our French friend must run for his life. listen to him as mad as he comes to the end of the building. Then he gets a huge amount of sandstorm out of it and the screen turns black, he was very happy to survive, and now he can shoot the empty streets of downtown New York. Since this documentary has received so much historical material and because the film was something completely different, this documentary is likely to remain in the memory of everyone. I saw the attacks live at home because I was in the afternoon so it makes it even more realistic to see. 10/10
