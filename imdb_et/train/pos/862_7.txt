Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. If she finds she is overwhelmed at work, she can get Paul to work. Paul is just out of prison and his past is not entirely behind him. Too much talk about a story that has many turns would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how the sound is used for Carla to hear and when she can't - a kind of "hearing point" (like a point of view). The earlier scenes that set it up, as well as the early creation of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than later turns and twists, some of which were somewhat difficult to track and / or stretched. There is also unpleasant violence. Back to the positive side, cinema was very good. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing, but maybe not looking for a movie. Viewed at the San Francisco International Film Festival 4-8.
