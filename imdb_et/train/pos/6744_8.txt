A hot-headed cop accidentally kills a suspicious murder and then covers the crime, but has to deal with the guilty conscience. Andrews and Tierney reunite with Preminger in the film Noir, which is as effective as "Laura", their earlier collaboration. Andrews is a wonderfully cast cop, a good boy who is in an unhappy situation. Action is good, including Malden as a tough police captain and Tully as Tierney's defensive father. The scenario of the large and fruitful scriptwriter Hecht is tense and tense, and Preminger creates an excellent atmosphere.
