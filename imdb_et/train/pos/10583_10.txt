As a result of the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent depression, the American music theater almost completely destroyed it, which was actually the last blow to death in Vaudeville. The behind the curtains had hit both the bad and the front. <br /> <br /> In an effort to stimulate the business and personal economy of the exhibition, the workshop will be staged by James Cagney, a brilliant idea. During the stages, live the relevant prologues for films shown at different cinema houses that are overnight at the old theaters. Some other competitors will get the wind and the race is on. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley movie. This gives James Cagney the chance to show his versatility as a dancer as well as a hard guy. When he retired, Cagney said he could barely bother with some of his straight dramatic films when he sifted his pair and obediently. She wanted her to have some more musicals during her career and would like her to have. <br /> <br /> Of course, the production of these Busby Berkeley extravagans is a logic and reason at the stage of the movie palace. But it's so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell can sing three stories at Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is here, Honeymoon Hotel and Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler, which further strengthens the screen team. Ruby is singing and dancing with Powell in the last two and partnering with James Cagney at my favorite number Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is Cagney's nonsense girl on Friday at the theater. Like Blonde Crazy, she is the real brain in this duos and her quick way of thinking that hampers her from some of the domestic problems she has on her theater. One of Blondell's best roles. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern for both choirs, as on the IMDb pages. John Garfield is briefly seen in Shanghai Lili. At the beginning of the film, the producer takes Guy Kibbee to the Cagney movie, where they show the western coast of B Wayne in the head of John Wayne. Duke's voice is unmistakable. Even more unusual is that a short clip shows him with Frank McHugh, who plays another Cagney assistant at Footlight Parade. I think the brothers Warner played some fun there. I have to believe that the clip was deliberate. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley's surreal at its best.
