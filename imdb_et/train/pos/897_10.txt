I can say I have grown up, watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Soraj creates something that is hard to find. Love and a common family that loves and great. Vivah is a trip for a couple who organizes a marriage that will organize and love marriage. Shahid has done a good job. Anupamji is always brilliant. Amrita Rao gave up on others, although I felt that she was otherwise unsuitable for this role. We have seen him in Ish Vishk and Ab ke bar and Main ho is Na. So give up on a different role that it doesn't use. He has been in the Main Keys Na and the ish vishkis was great, but maybe he could have made a little more of his role. Anyway, Barjatya is a great job. This movie updates the values ​​we forgot. A sweet movie of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it is rewritten, but still a brilliant story that's original. Soraj's films have been great, so we always look for something else. Great work for all the team and everyone. A lovely family movie to enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and love. I'll give 10 to 10.
