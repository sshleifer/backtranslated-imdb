This is much more than the charming story of a medieval man who discovers the pleasures of dance halls (though it is). This is the story of one person who learns to love life again by pushing all the work and money pressure to revive the joy. The bonus of this movie is an exciting overview of contemporary Japan's slowly changing attitudes from everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that make you laugh out loud ... some where you want to get up and tango ... and many others where you just feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to today's Japanese film making for those who may feel that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
