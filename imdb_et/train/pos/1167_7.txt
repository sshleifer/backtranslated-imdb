Alain Delon visits a quick, firm revenge on the ruthless criminal family who worked on the Duccio Tessari thriller "Big Guns" when they inadvertently killed his wife and child. Tessari and screenwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore, "A minute to pray, the second to die" and Franco Verucci's "Ring of Death" take this actress for a mobile attack to the wire. Indeed, "big weapons" are quite predictable, but still qualify as solid entertainment, with many forest and often unexpected killings. Alain Delon "The Godson" is appropriately laconic, as he deals with the deaths of the leaders of migrant families who did not allow him to retire to enjoy life with his son and daughter. Richard Conte's "The Godfather" plays a Sicilian criminal boss who wants to bury the Delon character, but the rest of his nose companions want a dead man dead. Like most criminal thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, "big guns" agree with cinematic morals that crime does not pay. Interestingly, one man who has nothing to do with killing a woman and a hero will survive, while the other will put the hero in extreme prejudice. Tessari doesn't waste another 90-minute shootem. In addition to the mother and son who die in a father's bomb, the worst thing is going on in a car rescue station when a hero's companion is crushed by junk. Obviously, "big weapons" are a rather bloodless breakout, but it has a high body mass for the 1973 mobster melodrama. Only in the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the outstanding morale remains intact. Tessar takes a couple of decent car rides and the death of a train on the train in the tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets. Photography and compositions are excellent.
