This movie had no fun parts, mostly only average funny items, but it also had no parts that were very bad. The worst part was Sidi's voice. His sliding slur was too much for me. After about 5 minutes I was sick of talking to her. In addition to the disturbing voice, the film was good. There were many side jokes that, when you catch them, make the movie much better. It's a good movie for kids. There's enough to keep adults content and enough for kids to entertain. It is definitely a fee to rent if you have children and want to watch them together.
