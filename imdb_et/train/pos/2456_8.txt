When I went to watch this movie, my expectations were very small, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I was looking for a boring service, but in fact, the plot is interesting and well done, the actor was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville who really shows his talent in this movie. and the struggle scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done. <br /> <br /> I think this film deserves a wider audience than it has received. This is a film that can be seen by the whole family - perhaps not the smallest of the children, because it contains some rather tough scenes. A film about love and the problems that may arise when you go against your family's traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very similar to "Bend it like Beckham", but I think this movie will pull it out better.
