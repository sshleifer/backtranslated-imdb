I wish kids movies were still done this way; dark and deep. There was (to become) the formation of a character (and Charlie's image of a dynamic character), plot development, superb animation, emotional engagement, and a rational, relative and consistent theme. If not a handful of singing and dancing routines, you would never have thought it was a child's film, and that's why I give it so high an estimate. This movie is a great movie, not to mention the children's movie. What brings me to the second point: it must be the darkest "child" movie I've seen for some time, it is from 22-year-olds. I would be shocked to see that every child under the age of 8 is not scared in the last half of the film and in the first half, and it all ends with one of the worst endings you will ever encounter ("Jurassic Bark", for those who are " Futurama "fans", and it makes this movie so good. Just because the film at all creates emotions that we usually don't want to feel and expect, a bad movie doesn't make the film bad; in fact it means that it succeeded. Good funny movies should make us laugh; good fear films should scare us; good sad movies should make us sad. My idea is that good movies should MOVE you, not just entertain; this movie changed me. <br /> <br /> This movie is also extremely violent by today's standards for children's films and contains content that today's standards may not be suitable for some children. Parents, I would say it for the first time. I'm not usually saying something like that, but I just saw it yesterday and it was a surprise for me.
