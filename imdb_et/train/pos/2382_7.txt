For a long time, "The Menagerie" was my favorite "Star Trek" episode, although in recent years it has passed "City for Forever". What I preferred about 'Menagerie' was that it was more complicated to Star Trek, with the exciting background that is now on Trek's northwest. I still think that Gene Roddenberry has turned on the original pilot's two-part episode. Although the story 'new' part is largely an excuse for looking at Kirk and another (and us) pilot, the idea that Spock is a warrior is wise. If you like, you can make openings on the plot. For example, considering the talent control capabilities of captains and the condition of Captain Pike, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to his planet? There are other confusing issues about Pike and Commodore Mendez. It's best not to think about the details too hard and just enjoy the ST only in two parts.
