"Most of us live in at least two worlds, in a real world where we are in mercy and in the world, unconscious, in a safe place where we can escape ..." The world of "Maxx" is an exciting world where fantasy and reality are united. Inspired by Sam Kiethi's comic books, "The Maxx" is very loyal to the material, not just the story, but also in a graphic style that looks like the pages of comics. surreal and unique look. But this story is also interesting and fun. In moments it may become too strange, but if you have it inside, it's hard to get out of it. Story and characters are wonderfully advanced. The music goes great with the style of the exhibition and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated exhibitions, it was short. "Maxx" is a black one. This is one of my all-time favorites.
