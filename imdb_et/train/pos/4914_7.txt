The little joy in life is to enter the aisle of old movies during the walk and to choose things just because I haven't seen it. It is a great pleasure to take this movie home from time to time and find a small treasure on my screen. <br /> <br /> Long before Elia Kazan turned into a brand that drew only significant films (not good), it made it better than the average drama. Looking at it, you begin to notice how many decent, good or well-watched scenes have accumulated. Contrary to the fact that his later films, where the drama is great, are desirably great and uncomfortable and scandalous. The companion was finally a computational promoter as director. (um. No thanks) <br /> <br /> His future superfluous clues will only be brought to the plot. The break is coming! But here is the atypical Richard Widmark, who plays a family man in 1951 and avoids most of the excess of this sling; here is barabra bel geddes, his bathos turned down (well, for him); they are a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about major crises and smaller crises. Here is an expertly organized comic interview with the ship's crew; here is a beautiful moment when the chase begins in a corner store and the flock of birds begins to strike. These are small-scale advancements that the film can offer where the viewer can actually recognize life; Something about Hollywood, your greed, is now trying to vigorously avoid. These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. It is a pleasant, humanly filmed, not grotesque, oversubscribed production, which he and others (David Lean) later popularize, whose legacy is still felt as diverse as the Caribbean Pirates and the Moulin Rouge. <br /> <I looked at it twice and I'm fucking when I can tell you what Jack Palance is looking for in the last scenes, but it doesn't seem so important to me as a viewer. It reminds me of No Way Out and Poitier noir Widmark as a villain and Naked City, which you should actually get.
