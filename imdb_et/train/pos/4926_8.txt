Elia Kazan, one of the best theatrical leaders in the country, showed that she was also at home in the movies. In "Panic Streets", Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what comes later, perhaps with his masterpiece "On the Waterfront", although both films only share water settings because they are different visions of different topics. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan was shot in New Orleans. The adaptation of Edna and Edward Anhalt's stories to the film, Daniel Fuchs, is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to visit "The Big Easy". One of the great assets of this film is Joseph MacDonald's superb black-and-white cinematography, showing the best of New Orleans. Alfred Newman's music and Billie Holiday's song are a nice joke. talk more than "broklynese" as perhaps the southern accent that can be heard in this part of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing appears in the movie, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, every time one sees him on the screen. He was so intense! At the same time, this harsh man shows him a gentle touch when he sees that his ill partner, unknown to him, is dead. Blackie, pampering this man by sweating his sweaty face and running through a dying man's greasy hair, giving up. It was also remarkable that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seem to have done their tricks, something refreshing because both participants make it real. Introducing Reed's family at the beginning of the film. We see a family friend painting furniture with his son. Later, she and the woman will talk about how they seem to be unable to agree on what many families have to do on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, who plays a normal person, is not as effective as this actor playing more cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, like a woman, sounds like her suburb woman from Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr. Kazan's leadership and great film.
