This is one of the best bond games I've ever played because: <br /> <br /> The missions are a lot of fun to play because they have a lot of activities that can be very difficult for them sometimes, which makes it even more fun to use the weapons it has really good. The cars in this game are very good, driving is fun. This James bond game has a good story for him. The voice of the participants in this game is really good and it is cool that brosni's breaking in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like they look like in real life, which is really cool. Also the graphics of this game are pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall Score ********* **********
