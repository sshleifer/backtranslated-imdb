Dirty Harry must hunt down a rape victim who casts his revenge, killing his attackers before killing them. Probably the greater punishment would allow them to live after the initial shooting and let them suffer forever as he and his sister are ... Anyway ..... a packed story that is back in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. Andy Drake at the forefront of the main rapist is appropriately whistle and gets punished by the end (of course!). Not a classic film, but better than the others except the original Dirty Harry.
