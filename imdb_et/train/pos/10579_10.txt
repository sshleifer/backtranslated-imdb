An energetic young producer of theater technologists (these staged performances, usually musicals that often went out of the movie's major cinemas in the past few days) must deal with curved competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful love and amateur technology to realize their dream of making their own brand on FOOTLIGHT PARADE. <br /> <br /> Although this movie resembles other Warner musical spectacles, especially GOLDDIGGER movies, this film was of special interest to none other than Jimmy Cagney. He is a miracle, loosely fitting and supple, as strong as any tomcat - a creature he actually imitates a couple of times during the film. Cagney grabs the attention of the viewers and never lets go by speeding up a quick fire dialogue and a bright plot under its charisma and powerful charm. <br /> <br /> The other majority will do their best. Joan Blondell is perfect as a smart mouth, a great affectionate blonde secretary who is with Cagney (the main story - why she didn't give a musical number). Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler play lovers again on stage and outdoors; his dancing compensates for the fact that his singing and acting ability is somewhat lean; Powell continues to exude boy-enthusiasm in his secondary position in his unusual position. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert is a lot of fun when both take Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly appreciates Kibbee as a wealthy woman, a woman who is committed to her beautiful defense. Frank McHugh's choreographed choreographer is a foil suitable for Cagney's wisdom. Herman Bing is a fun musician for his small scene. Mavens watches small Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin and maybe even John Garfield during musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally, Busby is Berkeley, a choreographer nonpareil. During his 1930s, his terpsichoor confectionery was the ultimate example of the cinematographic escapism that the listeners of depression wanted to enjoy. The great joke about Berkeley's work was, of course, that they meant productions as part of the plot. But no theater could master these imagination ever. These are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment that can only be done with a film camera. <br /> <br /> Berkeley's music offerings generally took one of two different approaches, either story or dance; or otherwise amazing geometrically shaped numbers, eye candies that include rich choir girls, camera work, and romantic tunes. The extra-extravagant spasm of FOOTLIGHT PARADE goes with three Berkeley masterpieces: the "Honeymoon Hotel" and its pre-production code that talks about a couple's wedding day; "By Waterfall" - dozens of uneven women, splashing, floating and diving in perfect patterns and designs (close together and see how synchronic effects are achieved); and finally, "Shanghai Lil" - giving the respect to both Cagney and Berkeley talents.
