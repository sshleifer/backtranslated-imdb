Lion King 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. Don't expect the product values ​​of the theater edition, but wait for the highest quality direct video release. and suddenly change tracks and start narrating your story. This is done with frequent comedy breaks. For example, at one particular moment of stress, a home-made commercial jumps and Chagrined Pumba understands that he has been sitting on the remote. These little moments pepper the film and whether you are entertaining or not, depends largely on your sense of humor. If you're particularly disturbed by movies that deliberately remind you of watching a movie, it may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best that they have invested in the Disney DTV line, and is seamlessly integrated with original material. Newer, independent material uses a lot of original artistic style. The voice talents are all well done, though I couldn't think of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many movie jokes are well recognized by the audience as being recycled. for generations, but they are more familiar with knowing the old church's comfortable churches than being annoyingly repetitive. <br /> <br /> Music has made me realize how much I enjoyed and missed the good music that is integrated with the Disney feature. The Dig A Tunnel's toe opening function is great for choreography and fun. Taking Timon and Pumba from the Lion King opening sequence and introducing them to paradise is also fun. The only problem was the repetition of the "Dig A Tunnel" at the end of the movie, the exchange of its words, and the tuning to defeat the defeatist. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty well done, and the elements of the new plot have been made almost perfectly, although the last bit of hydroponics caught some straight lines. The new story does not look good for saccharin or emotionally charged moments and does it better when it uses full comedy. Generally worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, go to it. For penny meat, which is still ready to invest in a good flick, wait until it falls by four or more dollars and immediately rents. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
