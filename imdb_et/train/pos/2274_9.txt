Although I like Kurt Vonnego, I don't particularly care about spy stories and I didn't know that. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actresses, because I saw "Champions Breakfast" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was great, but so was the plot. Political intrigue was relatively little, and much more moral attention was paid: by reading his antisemic radio comments with hidden messages to the Americans, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and, as it turned out, Americans) towards the Jews or Hitler. What carries more weight, serving your country, or an unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? Dilemma is even more prominent because these words are not spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings so well that he does not open, not even in his own memories. An internal conflict of this nature is almost impossible to imagine, but with this excellent exhibition and photography, this film is directed. <br /> <br /> There are other points, such as romantic humor or ironic use of clich√©s (such as white Christmas carol) that make it a real American movie. I recommend it to anyone who is bored with Hollywood spy films.
