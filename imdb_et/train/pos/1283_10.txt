The film revolves around a person who believes that all forms of media are outdated. The idea of ​​an art project is to uncover the ridiculous culture we bath in. Of course, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, Hollywood movies, and many other media. Finally, he finds himself in the weapon he has moved. The film is five years old and rings more every day. This is the best description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It is also one of my 10 best favorite films.
