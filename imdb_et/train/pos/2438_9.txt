It was a pearl. Amazingly works for Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supportive pains. The film highlights not only the history of Ireland and Ireland, but also many communities in the world and many of their communities. With strength and sincerity, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions were for a loving and passionate family. The title "Sharing Love" couldn't take it better. Although it was a real story and happened in Ireland from the age of 50, seeing the whole village life eroding and "pogrom" begin, I remembered Russian history. Intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world, and unfortunately it is deeply hidden in human nature. Just like in the movie, Liam Cunningham's "hate was always under the surface" says. It was interesting to see the moral choices people made in this story. The character of the Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the event was also worthwhile. The story gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. Liam Cunningham's character goes through the whole story of transformation, becoming the man with whom he always wanted to be. Again, acting is the upper limit. The story is fast paced. Irish painting is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
