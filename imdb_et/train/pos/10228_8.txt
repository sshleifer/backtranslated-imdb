Being a giant monster, I saw "Yeti" was an absolute duty, especially after I heard so much. Thanks to the good situation, it was very easy for me to find a copy and I was a happy surprise when I saw that this flick was really, dare say, decent. <br /> <br /> A good thing about what it is, is actually a cheesy giant monster. It will start quite soon, because Yeti is found quite soon and we introduce different signs. They are made up of some fools, some good and a girl who is by far one of the most brilliant beautiful girls in every cheese sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Yeti looks like a long-haired boy right from the original Woodstock concert, and he's not that dear guy, especially after he's got to know something like a funky cage. Godzilla she is not - despite her rude awakening, she doesn't even rob (in fact, she rarely destroys anything from the whole picture), but a little just looks confused when trying to figure things out. Yeti looks good in English (my copy was in English) and he knows who's good guys and bad guys. <br /> <br /> But we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing, and he's pretty much in the movie, and in a typical low-budget way, it looks like he's a lot of a scene and there are even a lot of "fake feet" frames that just stand there. <br /> <br Yes, the special effects are not the biggest, but here are some good ones. The scene where Yeti breaks through the warehouse is doing very well, and in another, he uses the windows of the building as "ladder steps" to climb up from its top - breaking each leg of the window and often shocking the inner people - in a sequence that really looks much, much better than in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" will never leave as low as saying "APE" no. In fact, the only time it approaches a real stupidity is how beautiful the girl is causing the Yeti nipple to stand up and lift her eyebrow in the "oh yeah baby" way. But even this is not so bad and a little even laughs out of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long for such a thing, but surprisingly it's not boring - the story is really good and just watching this great actress on the screen makes the male viewer happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be the top advantage of the giant monster strikes, but it is definitely better than other King Kong '76 blacks like "APE" and "Queen Kong" very far.
