"Stairway to Heaven" is an excellent solution for making a movie, probably never duplicated. I'm doing this "Oz Wizard" and "African Queen", although it's a completely different movie type than the "Queen of Africa". "Stairway to Heaven" is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that I find to be completely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of black and white and colored material - like "Oz", but the importance of contrast goes beyond the simple but beautiful effect of "Oz". With Stairway, the contrast goal and effect can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant aspect of Stairway is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. How could somebody understand a better way to put time out? literally? And then the staircase itself! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination, you agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real pearl.
