this movie must be seen. a real picture of what's happening in the world I've seen in Darwin's nightmare. Look at this! and if you're lucky to open it in your city, be sure to watch it on the big screen instead of the DVD. Writing is sharp and the direction is good enough to go through the idea, though hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing and the rest is good. It's inspiring that John Cusack got this movie and I believe he had to use his money for that. This is a wild, absurd ride that has apparently been done without the necessary resources but succeeds. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher has not shown that this movie says what this movie says.
