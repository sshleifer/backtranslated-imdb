Before that, I watched a lot about this movie. <br /> <br /> First, I was a typical high school senior, in Shakespeare's class, which I didn't even like, much less well understood! Shakespeare wouldn't be more than UNINTELLIGIBLE, without pouring my entire concentration into my almost encrypted games ... encrypted with a very difficult to understand language .... and then I wouldn't get it any more. Second, it was 4 hours long! I've never thought it might be good. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. This film was so masterful, so beautiful that I understood all the languages ​​when it was done. The script was now followed in the movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in the Shakespeare class. And here I was opening my mind and I understood it. When I was almost watching the film, I doubted myself! But look and see ... if it does, and only then will Shakespeare live. So this version of Hamlet showed that Shakespeare is indeed a master who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially for the big budget styles of big cinema (beautiful cinematography and photography), and Brannagh did amazingly and hurt somehow ... I realized what was going on. What was said. The language is fantastic and passionate. This allows for more raw emotions ... if words can't describe anything, maybe the words of Shakespeare may be. <br /> <br /> So far, I admit that the North Star ring (animated, in English) is the biggest film ever made. No movie offers more entertainment. But for the film to be close to that attacking Fist (which Hamlet did - it was close), it is truly amazing .... awe inspiring. It wasn't a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more amazing, it made me appreciate shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. The word is powerful. One of the rare, truly powerful movies out there. <br /> <br /> It will be two hundred trillion stars from infinity letters. Yes Yes. By the way, all your kids out there in Shakespeare class ... forget about it. You're wasting time. You have to look at the performances. Only then will they be given justice.
