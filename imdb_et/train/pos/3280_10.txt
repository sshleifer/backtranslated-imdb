I've ever seen this movie, about ten years ago. I bought a DVD two days ago and after watching it, I think it's even better than I remember. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is much more than just a horror. It had such an amazing emotional level and great characterization. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was great here. It is a pity that he has done nothing else, because he was a wonderful actor. His image of emotion in the whole film was perfect only with the right amount of nuance to get the message, especially when he realized that while Marc was dead, he knew he would be fine. <br /> <br /> Several scenes made me jump (which is rare in today's horror film), especially the bath scene, the scene where Anna's father shared her with a strange radio and a little where her legs broke and crumbled into dust. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great and very moving movie.
