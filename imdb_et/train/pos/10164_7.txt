It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch the chick flick and some about how it ended. I had never heard of it or anyone (except Mike's friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul provide amazing performances. Humor is consistently dry and witty. Paul Rudd plays a lot of friends (which works great) in the character of mike. The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formal (I mean we're not talking about "Apocalypse" right now) But the characters are nice, the story is appealing, the soundtrack, production and direction work well. <br /> <br /> A very good self-conscious movie that deserves much more credit than it gets. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own tastes, but I really don't understand its star reviews.
