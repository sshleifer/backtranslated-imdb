It was life changing, it really was! Man In the Moon is a breathtaking experience to look at. The action was fabulous, the story was great, and it was the perfect start for Reese Witherspoon's career. I don't see how anyone could love this movie. Secure, it's not the best movie ever, though it was close to it, but it was a lot of fun to watch, and I even had one big joke, and a lot of other little laughs. Of course, there were some cry in your heart out of moments too, but this movie was enlightening, and it glows until your day though you need a bit depressed story every now and then. doesn't think this movie won at least one prize, and I can't believe that so small people have seen this site. Watch this movie if you have never touched it.
