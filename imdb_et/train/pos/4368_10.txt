This is a very exciting and romantic film. I've seen it several times and didn't bother with it. Everything is realistic and it's a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I prefer this movie to Braveheart because Braveheart contains so many historical malformations. There are many exciting scenes - watch the Bridge Scen and the latest fencing scene. It's a really good and surprising scene. <br /> <br /> The music is cute ... it really fits the movie. The setting is amazing.
