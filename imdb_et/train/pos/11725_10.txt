I suck free Boob references so I just write a plain (not going) review. I love Elvira, not "I have-shoot-the-pres-just-impress-iodine-grow-fanatical" way, But it's enough to say I think he's rocks. The movie is played as a 50's horror movie just much more fun, look for references to "jumping from ankles" to find out what I mean. What relay shines through the film is Elvira (or it should be kasandra) an absolute charm. I saw this movie for the first time at the age of 8 and saw that it was a unique time since. I really should move around to buy a copy, the video version looks a little worse. If any other film fan wants to send me an email about this, I feel free. <br /> <br /> You will be given by Edie McClurg (chastedy pariah) another great actor who will never get the attention he deserves.
