An excellent example of the magnificent musical by Busby Berkeley produced in the early 1930s. Target audiences should be very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Contrary to his "public enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagney adds sparks and interest to a rather routine tired well-established style and plot. But highlighting the movie is the back of three complicated product keys. First with the conservative "Honeymoon Hotel" number, followed by the eye-catching "By A Waterfall" sequence, followed by the closing "Shanghai Lil" order, Cagney only takes part in the last number that pulls it up on the bar with Ruby Keeler. "Shanghai Lil" with Cagney is a great but a bit amazing and amazing climate change after more exciting and incredible entertainment with "By A Waterfall" choreography. If I were a director, I would have entered the "Shanghai Lili" number in the middle & close "By A Waterfall" that blows the other 2 numbers out of the water, so I'd talk and I think the best 3 numbers. 3 production numbers are icing on the cake and James Cagney's performance is decorated with cakes. A remarkable musical achievement, a 4-star movie, the ultimate music you should watch, you won't be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
