EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me somewhat of Warren Willia) manages an interesting little secret that is moving at a brisk pace and lasts just over an hour. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays an unhappy river who seems to be planning to die (hypnotism, someone?), and suspects have a lot of supportive pains - each from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph , Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. The extra bonus is Nat Pendleton, a dimwit detective - and in addition, you get this art deco ornament for rich home interiors. There must be a set used in many later films. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance that it's not too confusing. It's all suddenly clear to the detective Philo Vance - and then he has the final confrontation with the murderer, which gives the film fifty minutes of shameless change. <br /> <br /> A nice and fun pastime.
