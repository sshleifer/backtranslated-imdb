I give this movie out of 10 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting "guess who" game. However, the film needs more Robin in it. He appeared at the beginning of the film and randomly all over the rest. I've always thought that the new animated series made a very new Robin character, not to mention Knightwing. This film continues this bad tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in a movie as romance would be so unbelievable. This is still a good movie if you are a Batman fan and I would recommend watching it.
