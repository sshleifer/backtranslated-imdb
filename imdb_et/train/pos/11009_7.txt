This film had a stylish approach to camera corners and effective close-ups of interest by director Vincenzo Natal. It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu lead and expand their choice as performers. This film also contained one more imaginative "escape" scene in recent years. The efforts of the director and the actors were combined with an effective thriller. <br /> <br /> Although the film's drawing was twisted, this story went very clearly when the layers of the company's greed and skullduggery became clear. In 1949, George Orwell proposed in his famous novel "1984" that the future be ruled by a totalitarian state that controls ideas and reduces human freedom. It was interesting that this intriguing futuristic film was not controlled and devalued by this country, but rather by the corporate world.
