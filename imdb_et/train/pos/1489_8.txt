In general, the movie is OK. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra's story, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that make me touch. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did a good job. Brilliant. I can say that his actions are almost natural. <br /> <br /> Yet, Nina Simone's song "Ne Me Quitte Pas" is really a "mana" my "bulu" "Roma". <br /> <br /> I love this song. So the song. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded the song. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Yasmin. The film's finished credit makes me touched again. We see how Yasmin really appreciated his parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves the Grand Prix at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 out of 1 stars.
