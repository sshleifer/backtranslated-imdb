A great film about Thaddeus O'Sullivan, featuring big competitions by British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a complex subject and effectively deals with the hopelessness and gloomy atmosphere of Belfast in the 1970s. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify either side of this conflict. On the one hand, this young Catholic father, who is trying to raise his family without worrying about it. On the other hand, it deals with a loyal gang who intends to spread violence. Very interesting and fortunately fun. Don't wait for a laugh. 7 out of 10
