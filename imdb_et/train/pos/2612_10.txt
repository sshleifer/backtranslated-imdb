This is a movie that was very well done. I had heard mixed tests when they were in production and waited for it to be released! Greet the Director and all participants. The supporting contribution gave Eva Mendez what she needed to keep her up. As everyone else says here, the last part of the movie is riveting. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job because she didn't do much work on the film. He has his own career ahead. I was surprised at his results. I enjoyed the movie completely, asked my values ​​in life and priorities, and I am a better person! The movie has a great message. Release it so that everyone can enjoy!
