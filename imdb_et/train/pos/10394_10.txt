A magical journey by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two British cinema TITANS have mixed some fabulous ingredients to create a movie masterpiece! Some of the worst early technicolor, SUBLIME and brilliant Miklos Rozsa musical performance with Sabu's adolescent overflow, Conrad Veidti's theatrical and malicious feces, and June's Dupre's beautiful and beautiful princess, when everything is great. Miles Malleson, who plays Dupre's father, Basra Sultan, also wrote a perfect scenario that is big enough. DO NOT TAKE ONE! Since the above comments have been posted, I have received a recently released DVD and I can honestly say that I do not see this image properly before viewing this DVD version - the clarity and resolution is so accurate and the colors are so bright that I was stunned to watch amazing classics again time and never let the viewer have the charm and joy. Again, you have to see!
