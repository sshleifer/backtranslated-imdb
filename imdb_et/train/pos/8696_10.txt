One of the millenniums of the 1980s, Scenes ... has been concealed with sharp satire and outstanding performances by Arnetia Walker (how he didn't get tons of roles after that) and Wallace Shawni. This is a classical warfare and the delicious sending of people in these classes. Writing is fun and characters, though not subtle, are nuanced. And sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese guy who drives some other "gang" characters), he didn't put "sociological value" because the second review means they should be. The value here is what the film does in a fun and disgraceful way. I found it to be creative, funny and peculiar.
