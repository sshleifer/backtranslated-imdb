When the sidewalk ends it is a pretty good movie noir criminal drama and it is shot well on black and white and on the ground. <br /> <br /> Copper kills accidentally with suspicion of murder and protects himself from covering him and accuses it of another person he does not like, who has committed many crimes in the past. After all, he owns the woman with whom he meets, but who is the lover of his death, but not before he falls in love. <br /> <br /> Cast includes Dana Andrews (while the city is sleeping, Ghost Spirit), Gene Tierney (Laura, Ghost and Mrs Muir), Gary Merrill (mysterious island), Karl Malden (San Francisco streets, Beid Posidon adventure ) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). A good part of everyone. <br /> <br /> When the pavement ends, it is worth checking if you have the opportunity. Great. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
