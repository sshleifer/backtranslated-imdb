Here is the amazing Ronald Coleman, as here are some of his other films. He is literally in every scene and this comic movie is fresh for him, not for him. She is beautiful, witty and very clever, because she keeps pace with her wandering, lovely woman - played well with Anna Lee. The film is based on the French game and brings the best of this farce. Most supportive pains are well known, at least as if on the face, if not the name ... and are perfectly suitable for this very funny movie. Fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as he stays ahead of other characters. His versatile skills can be further appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon", which every movie station must see.
