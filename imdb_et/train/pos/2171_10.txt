True classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the scenario is a strange consistent scene. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Wonder whether this movie is already on the DVD because it has to be seen in the widescreen version. I saw this movie in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and has never forgotten it ever since. I remember that it was one of the first features of Warner, such as cinemas, a process called Warnerscope, which produced very pure cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved the Oscar for their performances. The only thing I can criticize is not like anyone, say Nicholas Ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.
