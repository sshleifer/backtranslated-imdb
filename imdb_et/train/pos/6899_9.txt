Gerard Philipe, who died too young, with an excellent star, jumped on the screen in this funny, funny, cunning laughing comedy with lots of sword guards and knockers. Charmingly loopy your storytelling, impossible to resist. Lovely romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida. The film is remembered with great affection.
