The question whether he likes this version of Ghost Train always depends on one thing and one thing: your reaction to Arthur Askey's performance. <br /> <br /> He tends to steal almost every scene he is in, and not always in good ways. Sometimes you want to just want to get a little bit back or let the plot have a lot of signs and develop (what they do to some extent). But somehow everyone is back to Askey Tommy Gander's character. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like film and even Askey to some extent. It always seems to me that I put it in vcr during the strange hours of early morning when I can't sleep and really can't find the energy to look at something else. In the old b / w movies, there is something that is silent before the dawn that I am tempting.
