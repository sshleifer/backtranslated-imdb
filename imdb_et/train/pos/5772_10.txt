I looked at this example as a child and I loved it! I looked at it when it came to Toni's YEAR back ... Sheesh, I hear so old! I've had to be 13 or 14 when he came ... But in any case he had a big plot of land, and I am one of those girlie girls who watched Sailormon, and I enjoyed it very much. Animation was not the best .... In some parts, it was fun, and it was very flat at first, but it was a good watch, and I found myself breastfeeding day by day. br /> <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic and all-time first. Go to Ryo !!!!
