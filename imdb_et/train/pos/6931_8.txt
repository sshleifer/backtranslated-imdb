By 1955, five years after its release, James Stewart and Anthony Mann finished six more films together, four of them west. Their rapport was obvious from the beginning, and what was meant to be little more than a universal program became a cult and a classic. The fans of the period enjoy the fact that the first ten names of the credit were all more than well-known - and that doesn't count Ray Teali or Anthony Curtiit, later on as Tony. Maybe ten years later, the "psychological" west was well-established, but in 1950 it was rarely thrown into Ahab's mix with Cain and Abel, saying nothing else about the issue, and still offering full credit to the western surface and to all concerned. One can be added to the DVD collection.
