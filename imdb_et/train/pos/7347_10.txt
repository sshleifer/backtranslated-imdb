I'm Ralph Bakshi's forgotten masterpiece of Fire & Ice's old OOP video tape. <br /> <br /> One thing, it's better than any other Conan movie you've ever seen. Of course, this is cheesy, but who cares? It stood the test of time and the only way he started seeing is comparing with modern fantasy pawns like LOTR: FOTR (although I love this movie.) <br /> <br /> Jarol is kidnapped by Fire & Ice after the battle (Ice) subhuman creatures, while the only surviving village survivor he rescues. <br /> <br /> Yes, it doesn't sound like a sister Betty, but that's not the case. It really is to bring an interesting idea from the world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Scenes: Great. They are well handled, have a terrible stop and have a lot of loud noise. Just look at the climatic battle, now it's the end! <br /> <br /> Action and Dialogue: Competent. Really. They are not named for the Oscar, but they are OK and do not get their nerves. <br /> <br /> Animation is pretty good. Shooting with 3D and rotoscope (I THINK), it looks pretty good. Many of the backgrounds are really detailed and well drawn, and although the characters are a little bit 1-dimensional, they're fine. <br /> <br /> Generally this subtle neglected little pearl will attract you more than any "entertainment". 10/10
