SPOILERS <br /> <br /> My friend said THE FOLLOWING MOVIE was the best Cheech and Chong flick and went out to borrow me and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, no pace, really no thing that defines the movie ... but it's funny. And what it is worth, Cheech and Chong show some heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little section I put on the plot, but being the fourth fifth of the movie, nothing happens that usually begins with the story. I'm just saying Cheech's relative is coming up. <br /> <br /> Wasn't there any more fun moments when Chong was drinking Cheech twice? But the cock? Was it Pee-Wee Herman's first film appearance? You should watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to make it fantastic, but the film has a heart and hey, my friend promised me to borrow so it gets 7.
