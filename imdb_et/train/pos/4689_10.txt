I still fully agree with the comments. I remember this documentary as one of the most amazing and informative I've ever seen. As I said earlier, I recall that I started to look, I thought it was just another natural science - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only was the story of the colony incredible, but I remember music as much as part of its complaint. When I remember correctly, it was Native Americn tubes (similar to the One Flew Over Cook slot). I've also been looking for a copy. This should be required when looking at someone, but especially at schools. It should be released again.
