Pretty good movie from Preminger; sometimes a labyrinth because it explores sets and localizations from different perspectives and perspectives, as if it were a natural film by urban artists and how they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially satisfactory because his hero, a good cop with a bad mood, gets into the hot water when he accidentally kills a man with his head plate. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is in the lead if it is Hamlet, and has never been better. The story can be a pure melodrama, but Andrews puts it on the weight and almost raises it to the tragedy. Like her girlfriend, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes a very interesting frog, with his natural warmth, which gives a pleasant contrast to Andrews' coolness; his smiling, friendly-seemingly bad boy seems to be constantly calling his noble, as he is emotionally open, as opposed to a tightly wounded and moral policeman who pursues him. <br /> <br /> There are no major surprises in this movie that seem to be a transition for all involved. For Preminger, this is a meeting with Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney who had reached the top of their career at the time of the film. Supporting casting - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - is understandably more optimistic because they were all on the way. Preminger, like an eternal peaceful observer, lets events evolve without expressing a strong position, since the morally vague end is somewhat disappointing, as the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems to be bigger and archetypal than any film could solve much less. <br /> <br />
