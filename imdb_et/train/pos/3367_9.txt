This movie has a great actor, great photography and a very strong story that really thinks who you are, how you define yourself, how fit, whether you agree to play a role or break it. great comments on these aspects. I want to comment on the official setup of the movie. Basically, it's two people on the roof. The unity of place and time are the 2 main characters and the radio acts as a choir. Many directors have made the tragedies of Greece a movie, many directors have filmed modern stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director has, in my opinion, succeeded so admirably as Ettore Scola to approach the purity and Christmas of the great Greek tragedies. story and official setup. Masterpiece.
