When you look at this movie first, it's hard to know what happened, but it will be clearer when you look at it later. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was great in Bob's role. The character of Lexa Doig was confusing to understand, at first she was struck by Bobi's trap, but I really believe she grounded her to love, though then she had broken her heart. Dean Cain's performance was normal. He gets better with every movie he does. My only question at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby.
