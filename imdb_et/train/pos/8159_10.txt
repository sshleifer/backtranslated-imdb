Okay. This film is pure joy. It has ever had such a violent horror that has been mixed with little effort and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really starts losing his mind and it is enjoyable to follow him. This movie is for some people, though. Do you love it completely or hate it completely. A good movie for renting and watching If you don't do anything else. Also recommended: Psycho III
