I'm not saying that just like Chris Rock's fan, I say this as a person who had little expectations for this film and what was wrong. The first mistake was that everything worked, the end of which everyone saw. The double mistake I found was that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed to be fake. Eventually, this film was sub-par, with Regina King and Mark Addy as the best actor. but I saw this mistake and saw a strong comedy. In the head-up scenario, you can look at the sky, wait, it's better. So for you Chris Rock fans, watch this movie, you can enjoy. He has a good position in this film. <br /> <br /> Total: 10 out of 10
