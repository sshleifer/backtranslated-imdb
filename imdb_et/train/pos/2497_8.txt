Indeed, drug use, warehouse, Matrix-esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a variety of Asian competitions, and a lonely vampire - in the same movie - seem to be a story that could only imagine a Japanese pop-rock star. And that is the "Child of the Moon" and much more. While all these elements coincide with the perfect object of the week's Campy B movie, "Moon Child" pulls it out, but some expected bumps and hitches along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has a sharp, distinctly independent feeling, jumping from one scene to another for a smooth transition, but rather for random jumps, signaling the characters' lives and hardly getting stuck. But the film does not release, but captures the story of friendliness, love, trust, and betrayal, all of which are covered by sugar in the above-mentioned elements of futuristic society, warring gangsters and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE, as a harsh vampire, "Kei" is great in giving the character of depth and balancing Gackt as "Sho" with an orbit that is too keen to interact with Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines with the 'Son' of Vengeful, who gets friends with Shoga with his friends. The story revolves around their characters and their extended friends and family through different life periods and how simple friendship can be so easily mourned and betrayed. <br /> <br /> Although the action is occasionally too unrealistic and special effects appear only to turn off, one thing the film never does is expected to be enormously popular among popular Asian singers. Superstars, like actors, have their drawbacks and so do their characters. The film rarely gets bored and ends up where you should jump a bit. "Moon's Child" is sometimes enjoyable, humorous, and even very touching: it's definitely worth your while!
