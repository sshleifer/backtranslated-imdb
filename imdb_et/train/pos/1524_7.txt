This movie is classic. This is definitely not perfect. While the performance is perfect, the friction in the film is slow as the tortoise of the arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is wrongly directed too sweet and too tender. He shows a fully functioning talent, skill and craft to convincingly play smart, passionate and confident Joan, but unfortunately the director missed it. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite musician. In another game, his dialogue has not been sharper and the lines are no longer musical. However, processing this movie requires you to look at it as a lawyer. This movie is a case and the viewer is a judge. This way you can enjoy this picture. 7/10
