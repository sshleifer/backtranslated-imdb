Canto 1: How Kriemhild died of Siegfried and how King Attila Woos with his Ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlarn: Kriemhild (Margarete Schön) demands his beloved husband, Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow), but his brother King Gunther (Theodor Loos) refuses his request. When King Krashild of King Attila's Huns wore through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlar, he gives him a promise under oath of his king that no one would ever have offended him. Hagen Tronje hides the treasure of Nibelungen at the bottom of the lake. <br /> <br /> Canto 2: How Kriemhild leaves home and how King Attila got it: Kriemhild brings some land from which Siegfried died, and drives to the Huns' Court, where he is welcomed by Attila himself, who promises to defend him by oath . <br /> <br /> Canto 3: How King Attila was besieged by Rome and how Kriemhild called his brothers: When Kriemhild gives the boy a boy, Attila returns to his field and asks Kriemhild what he likes the most. He asks him to invite his brothers to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Tone 4: How Kriemhild Gets Her Brothers: Kriemhild requires Hagen Tronje to lead, but her brothers keep her friend and loyalty again does not accept her wish. <br /> <br /> Tone 5: How the Huns celebrated the summer holiday with Nibelungen: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje, but refuses to be considered holy according to wilderness laws. Kriemhild offers gold to the Humile Hagen Tronje driver. Fighting, and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. <br /> <br /> 6: Nibelungen's Trouble: The Huns are losing battle against Nibelungen, but keep them in the siege of Attila. Kriemhild promises to save his life by delivering Hagen Tronje, but his brother Gunther says that German people are loyal to their friends. <br /> <br /> 7: End of Nibelungen: After Rüdiger von Bechlarn's death, Giselher and Gernot, Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally caught. Kriemhild kills Hagen Tronje, ending his vengeance with the destruction of Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> Siegfried's poetic getting through "Kriemhild's Revenge" also speaks through seven dramatic cantatas. The nature of the first part is a great story of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hatred, revenge, and loyalty. The real scenario, with the perfect display of characters, the excellent performances of the cast masters, and the fantastic direction of Fritz Lang, gave another epic. Margarete Schön is impressive when she is a very different woman if she wants to revenge. Kriemhild's costumes are also very impressive and her action is based on her face and appearance. I was a little disappointed with Attila's reaction to the death of her only son because I found it too passive. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos Parte II: Vingança de Kriemshild" ("Nibelungen Part II: Kriemhild's Revenge")
