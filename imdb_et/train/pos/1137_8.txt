It's very funny. You know how comedy should be. It also looks very good, as the Hollywood Spectacular should. So what else do you want? Howz very good about Sally's fields. He's much better here than anything I've ever seen him, and he looks so damn. This movie is all you need to understand why it is a star. These eyes! Like a quiet movie star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. I was pretending to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend. We would do the thing where you can really see one partner from one eye to another. They do not do this at all when soaping. Great. The eyes are it! (Sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many terrible performances, this fun waiting for everyone to appear again. Kevin Kline has a whole workshop on how to move too much. I understood? Yeah, he's fucking good. So is Robert Downey, Jr., who has since made Slick's Slimy Executive playing career. Cathy Moriarity, though not the most talented actor, is both charismatic and riveting, especially when she is angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, his natural timing, which gives Zing a somewhat steady delivery. OK, no Whoopi Bashing, I hear. <br /> <br /> Then there is hair. The soap bar was made by BIG Hair in the late eighties, so ridiculous doses are like a great character in itself. They become bigger and brilliant, just like you. Yes, we have pictures. <br /> <br /> Soap is better than I thought it would be better if I wanted it. I'm sick of movies saying I should take care of low, independent, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. TV Soap Actors. Soap Dish looks happy just to make me laugh. Thank you.
