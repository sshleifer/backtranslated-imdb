Although time has shown how some effects have been made, there is still a special story of love and adventure. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie before you are shocked at how many filmmakers have been stolen later. I watched it with a friend who was surprised at how much Disney Aladdin was shot. They loved the movie and enjoyed being so coarse for so many other movies and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I have made a movie of ten out of ten that is where a good part of this movie lives because the movie decomposes in the last 15 minutes. Everyone has rushed as they should suddenly end. Until Djinn leaves until the end, it seems to be more of a drawing, then a painting. It doesn't kill the movie, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> Still need to look at anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a big movie.
