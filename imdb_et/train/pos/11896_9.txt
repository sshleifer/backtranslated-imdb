I stumbled over the repetition of this exhibition several years ago and fell in love with it. It has TÃ©a Leon and Holland Taylor and they kept me laughing, for one episode. I think it didn't make it so big and it was canceled after a few seasons, but I believe it was a good run and suggested looking at it ... if there was a chance.
