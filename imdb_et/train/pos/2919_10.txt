I saw the movie twice a week, both times in the cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was packed both at times and for people. From the beginning of the film, when Henry Winkler was "injured" in the football field, the audience was bullied with laughter, a laugh that lasted until the credit. <br /> <br /> For those who love American wrestling, this movie must be ready to see Henry Winkler as you have never seen him before. See also a very famous actor whose brand wrestling is head-to-head! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie and it's family comedy entertainment at its best!
