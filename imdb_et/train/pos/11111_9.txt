The Sopranos are perhaps the most open series you could ever look at. It's smart, it's peculiar, it's funny - and it carries the mafiaan so well that most people can't be seen. The best aspect of this exhibition is the overwhelming realism of the characters in the underground world of New York's criminal families. Most of the time you really do not know whether wise boys can go back or buy lunch. <br /> <br /> Adding to the realistic handling of reality in this exhibition is the depth of their personalities - These are dangerous men, most of these murderers, but God, if you don't love them either. I'm laughing at their quizzes, being torn when they made a mistake in the verdict, and scared of the dignity of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The New Jersey suburban setting is absolutely perfect for the subtitle of this exhibition - people are not always as they seem, and the harsh controversy between humdrum and their seemingly small criminals is even weighing on odds. <br /> <br /> If you haven't done it yet, you should definitely.
