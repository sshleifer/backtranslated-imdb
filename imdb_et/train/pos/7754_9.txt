Any way the wind blows, is the first movie of Tom Barmans (who also knows the rock formation 'dEUS'). The film, made in Antwerp (Belgium), starts from sunny Friday to morning and jumps quite superficially between the events that take ten days of main characters. When the movie ends, you have a lot to think about, as most of the different tracks are open. <br /> <br /> There is a (purely instrumental) soundtrack in the film that robs your socks. In most scenes, music really adds to the overall atmosphere and feeling, making the film hallucinate to watch at certain moments. The main scene of the movie, the party, is very well shot. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use the technique of video clips because his main characters danced recently heard from one of the best sound tracks. <br /> <br /> The scenario is a great thing. Camera corners and colors are very well chosen. "Costumes" are very hot and very "seventies". And I loved (most) acting. <br /> <br /> Most of all, I liked the movie that is absurd, surreal, very dry, or even cynical humor that connects. Without being a comedy (this movie is definitely not a comedy, but rather an alternative work of art), it still manages to listen and sometimes even laugh. <br /> <br /> This is another driver debut that shouldn't be the end. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time. Greeting.
