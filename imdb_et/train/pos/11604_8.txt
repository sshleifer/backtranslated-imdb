In the seemingly endless endeavor to find well-made, well-functioning horror films, it is too rare to find what will even reach the mark in the near future. Needless to say, I was very surprised when I stumbled on a "burner" during a sewer on the United States cable network. The assumption is quite simple. In 1692, the young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most vocal testimony of the alleged witches, leveling the unjust accusations against anyone who earns his dissatisfaction. His self-manipulation is Reverend Parris (Peters), who also acts as the court's guide to witchcraft and satanism. Things become complicated when Ann starts accusing members of the Goode family witchcraft. Salem (1980 or so), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) is about to see her soon before she visits the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in the seventeenth century tries to force him there and next to the building. He continues his stem, while strange phenomena begin to involve him more and more. Soon he seems to be the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, the additional description goes quite well and would give too much. Although the film is not action-oriented and likely to be scarce for many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in many setbacks of films sounds very convincing. Production values ​​are certain, except for some special effects. In a side note, Salem's technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, an official witch. Observers who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric but undervalued horror film can understand it. Writer / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction, and has been known for her work in many "big flaws" films and similar works years ago.
