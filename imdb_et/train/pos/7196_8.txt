"Zorro Fighting Legion" is one of the best serials of the 1930s as a serial product. Made in a period when studios can still carry a lot of light, it's a wall-wall activity across its 12 chapters. ) is trying to fund its new country firmly. To this end, he has arranged for the delivery of rich gold consignments at the local San Mendolita mine. <br /> <br /> Local government councilors on behalf of Don-del-Oro a armored god of gold, who, with the help of the local Yaqui tribe, hopes to be a Mexican ruler. He is opposed to Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery), who is a legion of local people to help Juarez. When Don Franciso is killed by Don-del-Oro men, a strange Don Diego (Reed Hadley) city arrives. Diego aka Zorro takes the legion with his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The symbolic heroine of the piece is Ramon's sister Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon hold a local government advisor. Soon some of the other council members are Don-del-Oro. Firstly, the chairman of the council (Leander de Cordova), the head of military Manuel (John Merton), the chief judge Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? We have an increasingly collapsing rope bridge, a deep gap between the two rocks that only Zorro can jump to safely, and the usual range of explosions, fires and wagons that climb or tilt over the rock. Hats for the beautiful team of the Republic, legendary Yakima Canutt and Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt completes his signature device, which jumps to the runaway horses team and then falls under the coach, which he repeated in other films, including John Ford's "Stagecoach" the same year. <br /> <br /> In any case, Zorro finally recalls the false god Don-del-Oro and restore peace in the valley before driving to sunset in chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Other cast include Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as Don -del-Oro, so men and if you look closely, you can see the bits of future series and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore in bits. "Big" Jim Pierce, by the way, can best be remembered in Tarzan's "Tarzan and Golden Liom" (1927) and his marriage to Joan Burroughs, the daughter of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Greatly enjoyable.
