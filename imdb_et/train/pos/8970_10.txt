I studied this movie a bit and discovered a website that claims it was actually an inner joke about the World of Gay and Lesbians in World War II in Greenwich Village. Regardless of Stewart and Novak, shelters and witches represented this alternative way of life. John Van Druten, who directed the production, was probably gay and very familiar with Greenwich Village. I thought it was ironic because I first saw Bell, a book and a candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade because my parents took me. It was hard to get me a movie that didn't contain horses, rifles or alien monsters and I was going to get bored. But I remember the moment Jimmy Stewart took Kim Novaki at the top of Flatiron's building and threw his hat off when the camera followed that ground. As the brilliant theme of George Duning's love rose, I suddenly felt what he wanted to fall in love with. The first blends of romantic / sexual love left me barely leaving the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only adolescent boy attracted by Kim Novak's amazing direct look. It is ironic that the gay parable was able to trigger mortgage puberty in so many of us. I am now in the late 50s and I was watching the movie again last night and these same feelings were mixed when I looked at the hat touching fifty years later. . .
