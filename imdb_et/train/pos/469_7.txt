The story was quite interesting, but the characters were relatively flat in their thoughts / behavior and sometimes too extreme. More extreme than necessary. I also think something was wrong with casting. John Turtorro is not satisfied with a semi-semi-male-male player, not a Italian player. The motives were not very well described. <br /> <br />
