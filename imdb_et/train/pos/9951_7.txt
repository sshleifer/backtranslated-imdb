If you've ever wondered why they don't make a lot of porn, see Dream Quest. On the one hand, you need to give Armstrong a credit when using this idea and using such a strong casting of adults to name it. On the other hand, it also reveals why most pornstars never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue that combines sex scenes. These people just can't act (and, unfortunately, the story is ridiculous). <br /> <br /> However, I gave it to 7 because it was a nice sample and there didn't seem to be much effort to cut corners. I would also like to see more of these experiments. Maybe one day I see porn and the perfect combination of the plot.
