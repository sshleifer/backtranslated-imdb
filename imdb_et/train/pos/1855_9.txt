Without seeing all the films that appeared in 2002, I can't say it's the best film of the year. I can say that this is the best film I've seen in a year. <br /> <br /> The majority of American films about black people fall from the American attacks on "racial relationships" or clash with the inner ghettos of the city, where each sterotype is a slang in the Ebon language. Antwone Fisher is proud to stand alone in this respect: the race is not appropriate, except for one struggle that may or may not have been caused by a racial blow. <br /> <br /> The Antwone Fisher story is one that should find a resonant empathic person. He is undervalued and thoughtful by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, although apparently using her power to make a film, is mostly on the background and allows the film to feature the Antwone Fisher story. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture generally want to preserve the ghetto of many Americans (and Canadians), this is a film that talks to humanity in all of us. I just hope that the non-black audience will watch this movie for this mankind instead of avoiding it because they feel the film doesn't have any characters or actors with whom they can identify. It would be a sad comment about racial relationships in North America per se. <br /> <br />
