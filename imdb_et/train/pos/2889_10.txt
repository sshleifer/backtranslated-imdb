*** It may not hold this spoiler, but I would be more careful than careless *** I didn't see this movie when I was little. I loved it the first time I saw it with my three-year-old daughter. I can watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Little acting Ilene Woods made an excellent voice for Cinderella during her lifetime; very tempting; very plausible. Music is great for film. Action was great; loved the mouse !! You really "hated" Lady Tremain and graduated; they were just terrible. Cartoonists portrayed corrupt behavior very well. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, especially if you're in love. My daughter has seen the film about 25 times and still at the end.
