I enjoy all the versions of this story, but it's my favorite of all time. George C.Scott gives depth to Scrooge's character, which others don't give. The film shows more why it gets so bitter. The changes that have taken place in Scrooges gradually become evident when confronted with the different ghosts and incidents they show. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best Tiny Tim. He's the right age when somebody is almost a teenager like in other movies. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his baby teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is great like Bob Cratch. He's such a versatile actor. He depicts a man who clearly loves his family. He plays a role as a dignified man, not as a nervous man under Scrooges'thumb, but as a man who puts it nicely on his side, because he has a family who anticipates it. Susannah York and other actors do a good job of bringing characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best gift I've ever seen. He is most often played with a cheerful Santa character. In it, he shows anger with Scrooges' attitudes and indeed turns Scrooge around. <br /> <br /> Costumes and kits really bring Dickens's London life. Great movie.
