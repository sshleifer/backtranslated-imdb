It wasn't quite sure what to expect from this unit, beyond the unified positive comments I've read. It turns out I would never have imagined this movie because it is very close to "Bride's White Hair" being operative and doing fantastic. It walks between a farce, a comedy and just a good old fashion ghost story. There's nothing frightening about it, it's not a topic, it's really mostly a love story about a worshiping man who faces a beautiful ghost who has a lot of trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy who is trying to save the beautiful ghost. It also takes place in ancient China, where wild extreme Kung Fu exhibitions and hell (more or less) occur. Some stop-action ghosts are pretty cool and visual effects are top-notch. I can watch this movie all day because they are very entertaining, great visuals and quite a lot of language. And I look forward to seeing the first stage of this movie. Highly recommended.
