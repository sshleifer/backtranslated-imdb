This is a powerful documentary about domestic violence in Cameroon. Legally, "nurses" are female lawyers and judges who successfully prosecuted spouses in 2004 for the ill-treatment of spouses and took the separation of a woman he wanted through the Muslim Council. It is quite long - about two hours - but it is interesting for individual plaintiffs as well as for defendants and lawyers who successfully represented them in the courtrooms where the judges were chaired. This leaves you with a lot of questions about how this change occurred when it left me. How and when did women take office in Cameroon? Did several of the cases in this film have a significant impact on the treatment of women in general by the spouses? Was the divorce granted to the Muslim court against the express wishes of the spouse, a one-off event? I do not claim that filmmakers could have answered these questions. They made the film two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they did deserves a wide audience.
