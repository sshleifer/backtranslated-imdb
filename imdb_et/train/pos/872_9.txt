Carla works at a real estate developer where she looks remarkably unreliable, unrececiated, and desperate. He's also deaf. <br /> <br /> His boss offers to hire someone to relieve his heavy workload, so he takes the opportunity to secure himself to some man. The help arrives in the form of Paul, a tattooed hoodlum that is fresh from the prison and which does not fit well with the routine of the office environment. <br /> <br /> Between two people, indirect sexual tension arises, and Carla has decided to hold her despite the fact that she does not want to accept the work week. When Carla has been excluded from an important treaty, she negotiated with a slippery colleague who uses Paul's crime to steal the contract. The colleague quickly understands that he is behind the robbery, but when he is against him, Paul's readiness to face the people is comfortable - but this generation is priced. <br /> <br /> Paul is given some mobile scientists to "go over" as a reminder of outstanding debt. He formulates a plan that uses Carla's unique lips reading abilities to rob a gang of violent bank robbers. Now it is Carla's turn to turn to a terrifying world. <br /> <br /> The Fourth Leader of Jacques Audiard's "READ MY LIPS" begins with an intriguing romantic drama between the two marginalized losers to move only the semi-sharp thriller, where their symbiotic shortcomings make them winners. Wires are excellent; convince us convincingly that this odd couple could really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is a nice farce where she tries to move around with her rude and steadfast behavior just to find that she was up to the prison recently. Emmauelle Devos, who plays with Carla, has almost the exclusive ability to go to the frame and proud and back. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as an angry dog ​​who really seems at home when he gets banged or burst, which is likely to kill him. <br /> <br /> Like many French movies, "READ MY LIPS" seems to be nothing before scratching the surface and you will find that it is probably the only reminder of the pump is a sub-block of Paul's favor a lost woman; a device that seems to have been created only to help steer the story into a forceful, clean, tactile impasse. <br /> <br /> It was the 60's French "New Wave", which introduced the concept of "genre" for the first time to make a movie, and I've always felt that any media is somewhat threatened when you use a labeling system to define it, so it's always a pleasure to discover a movie that seems to have gone beyond the genre or better.
