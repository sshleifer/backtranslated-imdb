For a low budget movie, it was very good. I put it well above my middle B movie. Sean and Corinne made this film and they didn't seem to be ashamed of the camera. See Jeanne and Jared come. I didn't think the manufacturers would even consider it, but the locals deserve it. <br /> <br /> I look forward to participating in the film entertainment industry in Sea and Corinne. The character of Seani seemed very genuine and the sexy character of Corinne was quite tough and a point. He joined himself well with the sequences of activities and performed with confidence. It was a great idea that Billy Zane was cast as a smart and funny cable. It is always a pleasure to look at his charisma screen. Chemistry between the character of Zane and Sean was pretty good. The sequences of operations were not cheesy and seemed to unite the whole movie. Of course, there were some shortcomings, but it is a territory. In general, it was a good film, taking into account the budget and the fact that it was made on TV. Sean and Corinne did a good job as they are the beginners of the game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star will be able to take part in entertainment shows. </p> <p> </p>
