I am not usually forced to write a review of the film, but the only comment about this movie so far is quite unfair, so I think it is necessary to share your point of view. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or, as I saw in the theater, saw it, "Fallen") is followed by a lonely Latvian archivist Matiss, who is trying to find out about the woman she wasn't trying to jump out of, as well as her reasons. This is a brief summary of the plot, but this film does not touch the story as much as it has left the man guilty. When an investigative detective tells her, we usually don't worry about taking care of the anonymous faces we go through each day before they die. <br /> <br /> Comparison with Michaelango Antonion and his "Blowup" most likely in abundance in any review you read about "Krisana". The influence of Antonion's philosophical and australian style and "Blowup" story is clear and, in fact, the writer / director Fred Kelemen is an obvious reference to this film in scenes where Matiss tries to find out about a woman who jumped on the bridge or at least the one she thinks. <br /> <br /> The only other person who shares his views on the film will damage the look and sound of the movie "College Film Class". He ignores the budgetary constraints that existentialist Latvian film is likely to face, but the atmosphere of black and white cinematography and surrounding sound can be portrayed at an artistic level by Matiss's loneliness. The background noise of wind and street noise gives a threatening aura and resembles Fellini's film, be it Kelemen's intention. The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money, but this restriction is used for the film's advantage. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" succeeds in character research, with enough humor to keep it from being too serious. It could easily have come into the mystery of the mystery, but it avoids it and becomes an intelligent film of loneliness and guilt. If you are more involved in the plot, this movie and its end may end. Otherwise, take some time to use it. Worth a look.
