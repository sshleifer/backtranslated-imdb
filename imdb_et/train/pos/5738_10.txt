I bought this movie DVD and watched it. The DVD has been broadcast since 2001, and this 1988 film is a very small film. Most people look at it. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and loved it since then. I love the Pittsburgh Open Game (not Baltimore, as another user commented). Puts Pittsburgh as one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I have to say that Nicki's trash with Pitts is very picturesque and interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone else has said, is an excellent and excellent result. DVD is a good transfer without any add-ons, but in widescreen format. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
