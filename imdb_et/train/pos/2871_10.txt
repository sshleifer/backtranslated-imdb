Comment? As my comment is necessary? We're talking about all the masterpieces, all seasons and all generations. This is just the kind of film I still look at with patience. In this, as in other Disney movies, there is some magic. All the characters are in some way "alive" and "real", so the message is easy to understand, even if you don't understand the language (as I didn't realize when I first watched the movie because I was about six years old). Perhaps my English is not so good, but I mostly learned about these films and this is another big dimension of films that are rare today. But there is one great shame. In my own country it is impossible to watch or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyrights, so our children cannot enjoy and learn from such films. So, let's look at this movie again "Once in a Dream" or ...?
