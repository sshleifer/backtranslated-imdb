So I'm at home sliding the canals one night and I meet this man wearing heels and makeup that stands in front of HBO's colorful background. Of course I did a double and decided that I would look a little while. I didn't change the channel until it was ready, it was so incredibly fun. The next time it was turned on, I definitely did it so I could watch it over and over again, and that's one of my favorite views. In the first few minutes you can say that the audience is not quite sure what to think about, but he will win them quickly with his incredible humor and wisdom. While many stand-up comedians seduce my brain, Eddie Izzard is one of the best. Her style is incredibly refreshing, and it's fun to hear jokes about things like history and puberty, when most comedians stay on top of current events. His exhibition later remained with me. I went to Italy during the summer and I was wondering when I was there, "Italians are always on scooters that go" 10 out of 10 "CIAO ...". You won't regret it.
