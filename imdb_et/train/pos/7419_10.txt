Looking at the preview I saw, I went to "Shower", waiting for a sweet little comedy; What I found was deeply touching on the drama of family life that was spoken in some of the most lush pictures I've ever seen. Moreover, the subsequent reflection made me appreciate the sharp cuts in the scenes of the past (in the dry land of northern China and in the high plane of Tibet): does memory often fail? One moment I'm here, next I'm in the past on the terrain, just like this .... <br /> <br /> Not only would I like to strongly recommend this movie. or the three best films I've seen in my 60 years. By the way, a few years ago in the United States, another Asian "comedy" appeared as "Do we dance?" (Japanese). As with "Shower", the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of this film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (though it was full of funny moments). Do distributors have the fear that movies are too important or deep to turn to US viewers?
