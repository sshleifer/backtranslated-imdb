What's wrong with you, if you didn't burn off the cars and jessica's Simpsons hot body, then you're head-screwed. Of course, the film is not a masterpiece, I don't think it was a goal. It was fun and funny, I never saw the example when I was younger, I saw an episode recently, and when I watched the movie, I felt that it was the same atmosphere. The movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it didn't carry me and pulled out like some 2fast 2furious scenes. and jessica simpson is the usual hot, i just want them to have used her in more action sequences. All in all, I had time to hell, watching it and I'd go and see it again and buy it on a DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
