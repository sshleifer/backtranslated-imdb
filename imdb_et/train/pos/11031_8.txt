Sly the best out and outing. It is a wonderfully enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, a solid performance and a stylishly guaranteed Renny Harlins direction. Stallone is rarely interesting in her interesting movies and she definitely sees some of the action models. It was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable genres of the 1990s. As a fan of Stallone, I look back at it with pleasant memories. Lots of great activities and Sly prime action form. Lovers of activity appreciate this movie because it has all the good movies. The film looks good and Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow support great support. ****
