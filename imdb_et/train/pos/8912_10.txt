I've read many comments on this site that criticized The Blob for being cheesy and / or campy. The film has been accused of amateur action and special weak effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience has been the low budget, locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian shorts. Let me tell those overly critical assessors that this film is never so serious. This fact should be reflected in inappropriate theme music, along with foolish words played over the open credit. What it was meant to be, this movie is great. I've seen some recent very small budget projects, the Blair witch project was one of those who has no entertaining value or intelligent thinking behind their plot. BWP was pure stool. Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well-written and thoroughly fun. The style in which the old man comes with the mass between the meteorite and the bundle was wonderfully made and truly creepy. The scene of the doctor's office, where Blob moved slowly under the lining table when it was consumed by the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. The bottom line is, I love this movie. I'm challenging someone out there to take $ 120,000.00, pumped for today's dollar value, and make the film somewhere fun and as successful as Blob. You just can't do that. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading the time to read this review.
