Next to "Star Wars" and "Oz Wizard", this is one of the biggest films ever made. It is a real shame that it is not as well known as the former films (perhaps because it sticks to legends rather than modern or sci-fi settings, and that it is British, which means a smaller movie market) you know it is deserve a reputation. <br /> <br /> Like all big family movies, this child, an adult, or even a teenager who enjoys this movie (I'm currently 18 years old), has to be judged by a classic film. I absolutely adore this movie. It has an extraordinary piece of music by Miklos Rozsa (maybe my favorite classic movie spot) that competes with John Williams' "Star Wars" score, fast but not dazzling pace, beautiful sets, dialogue and color (both kits and cinematography) . won Oscare) and top-notch Oscar winning special effects (some time and some still stunning). And of course, in June, the strange look of Duprez looks like Princess Catherine Zeta-Jones's competitors (she looks like Jones!). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my all time favorite movies (next to Robin Hood's adventures) and it deserves more attention. This is an enchanting adventure all the time, and with Robin Hood it's my desert film that I can watch again and again without being annoying. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (Great)
