It is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - it has almost no dialogue beyond narration; and landscapes and music are excellent for each other. I did not first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox before the friend noted it to me (who also has red hair!) This is almost an old-fashioned child's movie, saying that children today prefer to prefer animations such as Shrek or Toy Story etc, but I feel young people should be made more aware of the beauty and wonder of nature that this film certainly does. Maybe it's not the best film, but definitely a great and relaxing view for all ages - not just for kids.
