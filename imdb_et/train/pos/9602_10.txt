Darius Goes West is a film that depicts the American belief that everything is possible when you make the effort. This wonderful, fun and sometimes heartbreaking movie shows a young man who never waited but longed to see what was outside his lovely Athens city boundaries. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His long-standing friends, Logan, Ben and several other good friends, decided to make Darius a wish. They started small - Ben & Logan's mother started an e-campaign to raise awareness of Darius: Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and raise money for companions to take Darius not only to see the ocean, but also to see them in the great United States. It would say that young college mates managed to reduce hope and awareness of this terrible disease. They realized Darius' dream and then some. They put their lives on hold, showing Darius the love, care and tones, helping Darius see how he can in turn show the same traits to other people with DMD. Darius voluntarily went to the Red Cross - sitting in his chair, collecting money (with his friends) outside the local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams are fulfilled - all we need is hope and a group of college friends who care for you. Give Darius and all the men an Oscar - nobody deserves it any more. Martha Sweeney.
