I just can't believe some comments on this show! The exhibition is just a genius! Of course, it doesn't follow the tried and true, but whether we, as consumers, always want the same things that push us over and over again. Should we not be able to sit back and enjoy some new ones. Style is not as realistic as previous "Scooby Doo" exhibitions, but it shouldn't be. An exhibition titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue", which part of this title says, that the beloved skill of all other renditions would be constantly involved. And nowhere does it say that they solve mysteries and they can't even stand monsters, so why would they be? I'm really glad they put some long-term plot points that work at Scooby-Doo. They still have running jokes, clumsy hi-jinks, swift shelter scenes, standard corridor gag and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I'm glad this exhibition is there because I just love it. I'm even glad that they've been freed for some time from the rest of the team and focused on just two main characters and a duckhead. Of course it is different, it should be. It should make you laugh at the villains and rejoice at the idiotic robots to triumph over all the invading pests, regardless of size. You should get a rolling "Robe-Roo" joke. The whole thing is just put together so well that there is no thing I think it is ANSWER. Writing, actor, animation, all the upper limit. Title music is awesome (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!", When it starts) and background music is just thrilling.
