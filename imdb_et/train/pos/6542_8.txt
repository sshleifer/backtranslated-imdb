Although the target group has passed, I have always had a soft place for YA fiction, so I was naturally intrigued by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery, which involves a long-dead actor, is presented in simple simple words, where young relationships are at risk. Nancy and her friends do not take the threat seriously, so that the young audience members are not disturbed. <br /> <br /> I tell you that the story was very successful, because the final results were pretty serious and meaningful, and Nancy looked and grew up Emma Roberts is great when Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery.
