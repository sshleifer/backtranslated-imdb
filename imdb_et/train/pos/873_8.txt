I watched this film didn't expect much and knew nothing about it. I love it. Very good, dense plot, intriguing hook in the form of ugly, fat, deaf and ex-con, and the pace that kept things rushed. <br /> <br /> A much, much better movie than the same director, De battre mon coeur s, who was bored and unbelievable. was that the ugly, greasy girl was not ugly or fat: sure, sure and far from the usual beautiful but so many character that she took over the screen when she was there. Great. I wish he would have more movies and better than he is in general. I've seen a little bit of Gilles' husband and a bit of mustache, and they both looked like garbage and I've seen all the De battre mon coeur s'est arret√© and that's definitely a garbage. He seems to have a couple coming, so I hold my fingers over.
