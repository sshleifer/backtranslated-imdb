Often laughing out loud, playing sex, family, and Beverly Hills classes milk more from the zip code than it is from Granny and Jed Clampett's days. The plots focus on two drivers who have contributed, one gets a bed for their employer (both single and soon single ladies, quite sexy - Bisset and Woronov). When Manuel wins, a friend pays his debt to a violent Asian street lord - if he loses, he has to play under his friend! <br /> <br /> A lot of dirty dialogue, pretty sick physical humor, etc. But a lot of comedy is just under the surface. Bartel is a memorable member of a very sensual family who arrives in his sexy, teenage brother-in-law for a "mission trip" to Africa during the year. <br /> <br /> Fun fun.
