this movie is just great. if you have the opportunity to see it, you should watch it. Although the film has almost nothing to do with the original 1932, Pacino does a great job when playing Tony Montana. <br /> <br /> Pacino is in a way where he can say anything and just make it sound great. if you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with good words (when you saw it), you should also see Scarface to see the other corner of how the actor tells them. (its pretty sweet) <br /> <br /> Although the film has many activities and the graph moves very quickly over time, keeping the aspect ratio real-time is easy to follow, but always keep your eyes cluttered so as not to lose anything. Personally, I've found that watching this movie looks like three hours seems a breeze, it's really that great. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those films that has worked so well and directed so that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the 80s, but it really makes you out of the bad guys ... " say good night to BAD guy "
