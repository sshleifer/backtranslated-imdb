Fast paced, funny, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always terrible. Blondel admires you with your spirit and energy. It is obvious that this is a censorship film that is decorated in a manuscript, costumes, and how they relate to each other. And bikini before the bikini! It's not forbidden for everyone. I don't understand John Garfield's problem. Is it important whether he is in this movie or not? If he is, his screen is so short that he is basically in proportion. You have to look at it to find him even when he is there. I'm a big Cagney fan but haven't seen it before. I found this Turner classic. I found this because of a wonderful accident. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
