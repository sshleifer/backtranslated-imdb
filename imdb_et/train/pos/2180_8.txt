Louise Brooks gives an excellent result in this well-made French melodrama. He plays a typographer named Lucienne, who, despite being in love with a man named Andrei, dreams of living his position. She sees a chance at Miss Europe's beauty contest, but Andre is furious when she discovers that she has entered, and asks her to retreat. He only tries to withdraw his entry to discover that he has already been selected as Miss France and is now continuing the main competition. <br /> <br /> It's a story of love, loss, and decision. passionate end. The film is very energetically filmed by director Augusto Genina and filmmakers Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The filming style is more about contemporary movies than the "30s Hollywood Staple" and shows Europeans different styles. There are lots of fast cuts and travel techniques that are mostly made with great skill and verve. The high energy in the first third of the movie is diminishing slightly in the middle, but rises again in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performances were very good for all managers, but Louise Brooks is especially memorable. Louise is heavily inclined to her silent screen skills, even though it is a chat room, but because her silent style was surprisingly modern, she is underestimated by the transition to spoken language. The long early scene of the fair was particularly amazing as Louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to pass on her growing misery and alienation, to be trapped in a life she no longer wants. I doubt it has ever been better. <br /> <br /> The film is based on an excellent final, artificially fired, powerful and stylish. It's really some of the best things in the first days of movies. And the tragic story emphasizes only the greater tragedy that it is Louise Brooks's last major role. He was not just a great beauty who looked fantastic in swimwear, he was really a great talent who basically threw it away. We are poorer for this. <br /> <br /> This film is less well known than his German films G.W. Pabst, but I think it's better. I think this team is just better storytelling than Pabst, and while the Prix de Beaut may lack the profound moral complexity of Pabst's films, it's much easier to follow and generally smoother, more targeted work. And it doesn't hurt that Louise's song is made by Edith Piaf. The bottom line, this is the classic Louise Brooks movie that you should look for.
