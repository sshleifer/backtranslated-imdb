Well, what can I say except these people are super in every sense. I like Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this pure Nostalgic series. I have 9 sets of 30 episodes, I didn't know they had done so much, I think it's a big shame they haven't done any more. I want to give these powers to me, imagine being dropped somewhere on my bike and knocking on the cold, then waking up in a special hospital. Later I discover that my body has been improved. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and intercourse, you can't fight these three people because they won you against all kinds of weapons. The music is well written and I think it is a wonderful picture of 3 super-creatures. The capabilities that masters possess are the same as our home dog or cats, better vision, better hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig, and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and smart. When I was a boy, I was very drunk! Now I see why my DVD is. The box is very nice and comes with a free series brochure. I also thought Trymane was a good boss, sure, but he could do things!
