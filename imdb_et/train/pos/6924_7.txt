This tricky west was a milestone in the career of JAMES STEWART after returning to military service, which wanted to change its image to the western effect, which is largely attributed to the influx of Western countries in the 50s because it is very impressive. It wasn't too bad at Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart won the first prize for a "weapon that won the West" but then has to spend the rest of the movie to steal it. SHELLEY WINTERS has a shadowy reputation for having an unpleasant reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is a local bad guy at Dodge City. Whether GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend. And don't you know that TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both quite unknown) are a universal-international film with a few roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence includes the first Indian attack, CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself as a coward who drives off leaving Shelley alone in a horse carriage. Later he redeemed himself, but it is just one turn in which the gun moves from one failed hand to another, but eventually reaches the righteous owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART are a pretty final shootout that is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as in DUEL SUN's relaxing weapons. McNally makes the perfect cable and DAN DURYEA is as deceptive as he played as a gunslinger with little life in the 40s. <br /> <br /> The tightly designed story is extremely well run by Anthony Mann and it is fun to see ROCK HUDSON (credited as a young bull) wearing Indian army and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who throws a longing for the thin and attractive winters of Shelley . over medium story.
