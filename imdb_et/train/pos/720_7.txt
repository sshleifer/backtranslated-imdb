Imagine what kind of school would be like a world like this: kids are one big gang who really has a good music taste and connects with bad directors and teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" takes place in this world. It's like the Ramones record that lives. The characters are all so stupid, innocent and charming as the Ramones songs and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. Gymnasium comedies have really changed over the years to compare a movie like "American Pie" with the 70s classic, where no fun sex is made at all. Since reprocessing is probably in the works, it is likely that the charm of the original will disappear along the way and will be replaced by vulgar, half-joking kitty jokes, as Bill Hicks called them. The main problem, however, is that Ramones can't replace it. They were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even approach their place. So, the best thing to do would be to leave originally unique and charming as it is. Gabba-gabba hei!
