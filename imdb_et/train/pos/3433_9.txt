I saw it for the first time at an external film festival. This is a beautifully stretched nail line that is tied to a plot to release a golden billion from the Estonian Treasury. All of this is fired sharply, from the grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses, but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic States (note: Tallinn looked much less grim in 2003 when I was there). <Br / There's also a lot of humor and romance. I don't want to spoil amazing, but logical surprises, so I'm just saying that the beginning of the movie starts with a big script, and management and performances are top-notch. TALLINN EFFICIENCY is just the fastest and most nervous example of your genre - I put it on RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles before the new OCEAN 11, though (deliberately) not so shiny. RENT OR BUY IT NOW.
