After 7 years of watching this terrible mess called Star Trek Voyager, I felt quite dull. Next Gen and DS9 were bloody good things and Voyager destroyed TV Trek. It was probably opened with the best pilot on the Trek show. The team was really good, as was the selection of some participants. Scott Bakula played a typical first captain in a deep room and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change for all the masters already known. The rest of the team was really nice in their roles and I think they went to the good first season. When the show was canceled prematurely, I was very disappointed. A mirror showed us in the dark what was cast. It is a pity that a movie or television movie was never held. So much back to the story and the foundation of the federation was said, including the beginning of hostilities with Klingons ..........
