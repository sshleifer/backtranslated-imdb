I saw this movie for the first time at a local station on a Sunday afternoon at a horror show in 1969 or 1970. I was a little boy at that time, but I loved it and it wasn't really so scared. I thought it had a cool and very original story. Thinking back, I'm still surprised that it showed T.V. I've been looking for this movie ever since, seeing it again and again, and always loved it. One might think that John Waters would have been idolized by this film. It should not only be a scary movie, but one of the most severe films ever made at that time. And surprisingly, you don't hear that it has a cult that follows a film like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" over the years. It has a cult, but I think it should have become a cult class. As far as I know, it came just before Blood Feast came out, probably making it one of the first "gore" movies. In fact, this film features elements from Hershell Gordon Lewis and the small Russ Meyer, which are cast for good measurement. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend it to anyone who loves trashy, sleazy, black and white horror movies. In the early 60s (I think the date is at the end of 1960).
