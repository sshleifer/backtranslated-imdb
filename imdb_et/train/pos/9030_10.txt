This film hit me by surprise. My friend told me that this movie was a "chick flick". Boy, was he wrong! This movie has a big family complaint without movies like _other_. Jake Gyllenhaal is doing a great job at Homer Hickam's shoes. Supporting cast is also great. <br /> <br /> Science, age, family quarrels, big train scene ... This movie is all. The soundtrack is good, though the score is rather harsh. The music of the 50s captures the film on the edge of greatness. <br /> <br /> DVDs are definitely worth considering in coal. The value of Replay is great - I've seen it several times already.
