Let me set the scene. It's a school holiday and the movies have absolutely nothing. I'm with a friend's decision to see. We are looking for a movie soon and "The Grinch" will appear. We buy tickets that don't know what to expect. What we had was a pleasure boat. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (who may add that this is my No.1 actor around the world) was absolutely great, as Grinch in this Ron Howard's best movie (next to Apollo 13). The way the film was made, the landscape, the actors, the props and the music were just amazing. It really brought this childhood film to life. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the grinchi story. As we all know, Grinch is a terrible person who just doesn't get Christmas. He lives high and has never mixed well with a townhouse. But one little girl is about to change The Grinch's eyes drastically with life and others. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (plays divine new actor Taylor Momsem) will meet Grinch immediately. He tries to break the barrier and help Grinch move and meet the people of the cities. <br /> <br /> All of this movie is a laugh barrel for both women and parents for the whole family. SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
