24 is the best TV show !!!!! This is an incredible television series with incredible proportions, excellent plots and unforgettable characters. And all the first episodes are my best evidence. Because it's just the first episode, just an introduction, and you've been trying to plot and keep going. <br /> <br /> Jack Bauer is a federal agent assigned to Senator David Palmer's defense. He can't trust anyone because CTU people can be involved. And when these events happened to her daughter: Kimberly flees to the house. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode, you want to see more and more. <br /> <br /> It's just the first batch and it's great.
