I was about thirteen when this movie appeared on television. It's much better than most movies since. Martin Sheen is great, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also gives excellent support. Vic Morrow as a villain is great. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "tests with water" on his 34-member Ford (COOL) on a mountainous highway, it's remarkable! <br /> <br /> The end is great. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with this low voice. I think younger generations have more interest in spam coming out today. <br /> <br /> Good taste prevents masses!
