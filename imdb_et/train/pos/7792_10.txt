The crazy sea that Hollywood (and others) continues will be one of those rough diamonds. A small, simple movie that is very entertaining and gives you the feeling that you don't waste an hour and a half of your life. Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I had never been a fan or had noticed him before, but going back and seeing his premature performance convinced me he was very talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie for me in college was a task skeptical, which I even take care of. I thought, "Oh boy, a nice chic flick or a feminist male pool ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing many relevant topics, I simply say, if you haven't seen it, do it yourself and check it out. Sometimes the best underground, live movies are, and that's great.
