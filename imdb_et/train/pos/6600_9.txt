I keep this overview short and sweet ... <br /> <br /> I saw a trailer for that and thought I'd give it a 5-minute whirl and my initial thoughts were "what the hell is that?" But after 10 minutes I was hooked and after 20 years I picked my jaw off the floor. This movie is a great example of how a different film can be, and it is also French. This film is a high-quality eye clip packed in a regular futuristic film room package, catching the movement is a very smart and black-and-white animation that doesn't have gray, although it didn't make it to me at first. at the end of the movie and found that I want every movie to be done like that. I think my deliberation was helped by the great duplication that would have been very easy to destroy if they hadn't kept the participants so much, because many of the people involved in the voice don't know the characters (see only Hong Kong legends in English to see the perfect example ) I gave her 9, although I gave her another 2 because the fresh and new thing seems to be.
