Cusack does his best with David Niven, although I don't know if anyone noticed it. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, this delicious over-saturated wants to be more serious than Austin's powers, but is still a pretty d * mn recycled classic subconscious comedy. <br /> <br /> Hillary Duff makes a version of the sexual Britney spears child dance from Mata Bond. Writers built a little reversal of the Oedipus twist - an interesting choice. <br /> <br /> I never knew how soothing Montel's voice was up to this movie ... I think he has found a voice over the new calling navigation system!
