Robert Stack never lost the best supporting actor for his role as Kyle "Written by the Wind" for Anthony Quinn's 12-minute Lust for Life. Stack plays the great grandmother of the oil grandmother with an alcoholic son. He has lived his life in the shadow of his friend with whom he had grown up, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's husband. Kyle's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is a drunken slut who is in love with Mitch. Their story plays in the famous colors of Douglas Sirk's powerful direction, which dominated the melodrama with some incredible movies, including "Imitation of Life", "Everything in the Sky", "Great Obsession" and many others. br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake - it's a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone will use their role the best, Malone won the best supporting actor Oscar. In other comments, one amazing scene is mentioned, where she dances harshly to music when her father falls and dies on the stairs. We have believed that Marylee is sleeping with everyone, including the one who is pumping gas, because she is in love with Mitch. Mitch doesn't want to do anything to her. She's so lucky in Lucy that she wants Kyle to go to work in Iran for loyalty to avoid temptations. I doubt he would be so eager to get there today, no matter how much love he had. his whole life and Bacall is Mitch's wife, who finds himself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking after a year. Sirk focuses on more volatile supporters. <br /> <br /> Sirk's "Written on the Wind" movie is effective, and the end of the manor house is especially exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film and, although he had many imitators, he never had the same.
