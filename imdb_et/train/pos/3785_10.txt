This movie is very underrated. It is very imaginative, creative and smart. It's just fun, and I think it's the first in the movie. But this film was forgotten when it first came out and for years. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" was also bombed in the box while the first was pretty good and very popular. I think the problem may be that this movie appeared too late for a couple of years. In 1991 Bill and Ted seemed "80s". Although the 80s were only a few years ago at that time, the landscape of children's music and style had changed so radically that gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and Seattle sound. Bill and Ted with their Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses music with their 80s styles seemed so imperfect and very outdated in 91, and I think this is one big reason why the film was bombarded at the cash register. Someone, but surfers still didn't say anything like "great!" and "fake!" "Gremlins 2", which also came out in the early 90s, suffered a similar fate that it was a good film that was bombarded in the box because it was too tied in the 80s. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was much faster, now in the 90s and 00s. 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, but now, in 2002 and 2001, it still looks or looked like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> If only the "Great Adventure", made in 1988, appeared instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was quickly released and released in 1989, it would probably be as wild as first.
