I saved this era back but I could only see it today. I've been sick, so I was watching! I'm so glad I saw it and what I was going to delete my memory for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! It reminded me of a lot of baked green tomatoes at Whistlestop. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. Some people have said that this is a children's film. I disagree - this can be done by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I loved it! There were moments when my spine pricked. The story is different from other movies these days, full of adventure. I just ordered a book from Amazon, can't wait!
