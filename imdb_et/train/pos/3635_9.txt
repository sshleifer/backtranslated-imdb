this is a great Disney flick.it is a story of an aging high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid) who was once on the way to the big leagues as a jug but wore the end of his career. Morris (Quaid) tries big league teams and even makes a list. This is a great family film.it is inspirational but doesn't pour it too thick. Fun and entertaining. as well as kids.it is based on a real story, although i'm sure the filmmakers took the liberty of talking about the story. Quaid is sensational as a title, very convincing. If you are looking for a movie, then the whole family can enjoy it, look no further.
