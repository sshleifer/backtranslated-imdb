Marian Cooper's documentary is absolutely amazing. I saw it today with Turner's classic film channel. I think I can see if I can order a copy of it from the DVD. The film's footage does not seem blurry and unpleasant, as you think of the 1925 B & W's quiet film. The inter-tribal tribal tribes placed in Israel in 1925 leave their desert home and cross the fierce river, men, women, children, animals ... Then up and over the snowy mountain pass through all barefoot. It's a sink or swim and climb or die. Finding grass for your animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man carries a mule who is too sick to climb the mountain. Children in documentary film will see joy and health. They had such a difficult life. I don't know if Iran's nomadic tribes still live like that. You appreciate modern life in the US.
