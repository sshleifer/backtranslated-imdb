This movie, although it is about one of the most favorite themes of Mexican manufacturers: extreme life in our cities is a funny way to put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> The four most important Mexican directors, from recent times, are approaching different types of literature about the history of our city, because it can be a farce or satire that gives us a film that has an overarching theme in our country, but it tells very differently, giving give him freshness. <br /> <br /> When the participants are little known but interpret their paper perfectly, each leader will reflect the stories that our ability has been recognized all over the world to be able to laugh at pain and sadness. Perhaps many people in our country are not happy with the film, but I think people from other countries can find it attractive and share Mexican surrealism.
