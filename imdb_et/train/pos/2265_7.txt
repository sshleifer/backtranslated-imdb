I am a big fan of Vonnegut's work and I love this movie very much, but I wouldn't say it's a "Mother's Day" movie I read. When people say Vonnegut is unclear, two things come to me. One thing is that many of his subjects are very close or even taboo, even though sometimes he has been charged with choosing relatively "light" targets for his satire. This means less every day that is spent on filming. These days, the directors seem to be delighted with breaking taboos and I have great hopes for the now produced "Bluebeard" version. It is amazing to think that an innocent piece, such as Vonneguti's "Titans", would probably have been "R" equivalent to filming it when it was released in the 50s for its violence, language and sexual and thematic content, although it is a tragedy for someone there is still no movie-ready script yet. In the current economic climate, I also hope that some directors will look closely at "Jailbird", "Galapagos" and "Hocus Pocus". <br /> <br /> Another thing is his narrative style, the application of irony to irony of irony, but it makes it funny funny. It seems impossible to point out objectively, and this seems to be the biggest obstacle to making great movies of his great novels, because the small comments of the authors, which read our response to readers, are simply not capable in films without too clumsy techniques like "talkovers". Vonnegut suggested that the filmed versions of his work remained a character, as an author / narrator. According to his credit, "Master Breakfast" (film) tried to keep the comedy and came up with a bit of crop for his pains. Like another turkey made from Vonnegut's novel, "Slapstick" is even more remarkable. <br /> <br /> However, nothing wrong with a director who gives us his subjective interpretation of Vonnegut, and "Mother's Day" is a great example of how, as the other reviewer said, a good director can add such a source to visual poetry. But so much humor is lost that although it is the same plot, it is not really the same novel I read. If it had been, I'd probably have run a few times on the aisles, watching it. For the novice reader, I think that even at the end of the day, forgiveness is forgiven. At the end of the movie, however, it is really fun and I think one of the successes of the film is that it can really leave you feeling you have been watching someone walked between the razor edge and the evil, and the jury is still out. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at you alone and on your own. Technically, there are some small but striking mistakes, especially in continuity, and too often it seems drab and theatrical, but most of the time it gets an acceptable note and sometimes it shows remarkable imagination and ingenuity. Generally speaking, action is high in order, even if the dialogue is a bit blunt according to today's standards. <br /> <br /> He looks pretty good at the "Slaughterhouse 5". quite a lot of "good" in the film Vonneguti there, mostly in his short stories "Harrison Bergeron", "Who am I that time?" versions. and some other things, of course, his very funny but single-shot version of "Happy Birthday Wanda June". Also in the 1970s, "Time and Timbuktu", where Vonnego probably did not like it, was also an interesting piece, although he was involved in its production because he thought he had misinterpreted him. He said he reminded him of the odd surgical experiments done on HG Wells' story "Dr Moreau Island", but for many people this is a great job introduction. <br /> <br /> But if the movies don't do that, you want to go to higher source material, they don't do their job. <br /> <br /> As a man said, more or less, there is a big exhibition inside your head.
