This is above average Jackie Chan, thanks to the fantastic finale and great humor, but not when it is nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool and the movie is fun all the time, plus Jackie Chan is just amazing in this! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had fantastic chemistry and they are both very funny! And I thought the main opponent seemed very dangerous! But duplication was just terrible! The development of the nature of such a thing is higher than average! And the main battle is just awesome! And the benefits Jackie takes are tough! It has a lot of really stupid and funny humor, but it amused me, and at the end it is fun! It's pretty cheap looking, but generally very well done, and although he doesn't have the expected fight from Jackie Chan's flick, it's not enough to look at it, and one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger) are playing rifles and it goes out! It's higher than average with Jackie Chan, thanks to the fantastic finale and great humor. The direction is good. Jackie Chan is doing a good job of preserving camera work, fantastic angles and high speed film. Action is very good!. Jackie Chan is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely pleasant, fun, as usual with some crazy stunts, was a fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, threw this ass and played this wonderful foolish character, was amazing! , I just wanted them to stop copying! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny when Jackie's best friend, he really liked it, is also a great martial artist. The rest is OK. Generally worth a look! *** 5
