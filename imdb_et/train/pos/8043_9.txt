I've heard people saying that this movie is boring, boring. I don't think they're watching the right movie. It's not a prototype movie, thanks to God. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about the beginner and his mentor, which just happens to kill people. In this way, it works very well when Berenger and Zane are terribly (who doesn't let the journey through the film like other roles - he looks like he's acting). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the action to the end - a lot of it was not worthwhile and it was not satisfactory considering the rest of the movie. But look at Zane's face when he panic when Berenger does the black work.
