I participated in this small mini-production when I was at school 8 and my mother bought a video for me. I've ever loved it! When I was younger, these songs and the impressive dances I enjoyed, but since I've watched it while watching my parents, I appreciate more fantastic actress and character. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were great. I can't imagine someone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy, the best sign for me. He put so much on these boys, I think he has such a strong character and the last scene when ... Well, you know ... Always make me cry! Best musical in my opinion all the time. It lasted all the time, it lives for several more years! 11/10!
