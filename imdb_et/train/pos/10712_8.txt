This film is best described or comparable to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton's film). But it's less glamorous and more of your face. And, of course, this is not his father, but his grandfather, who tells stories. <br /> <br /> The film's narrative also moves back and forth (so the story here in IMDbis can be said more than you want before watching the movie). It's funny and interesting enough, though you get one story and you also have dramatic moments. You'll also be surprised here by things you don't expect. A nice little movie that deserves your attention, especially if you like such movies! : o)
