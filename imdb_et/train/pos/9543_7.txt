Japanese cyber-punk movies have never really worked for me, but the few I've seen have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story is about the type of parasites that take over human hosts, control their bodies, make them "necroborg", and cause their fight with each other only to eat each other - probably as a "parasite" to enjoy these parasites. The film revolves around the shy guy and the cape who fall against each other, but whose love relationships are infested with parasites and forced to fight against each other. It becomes a test of human will and parasite control over their physical bodies ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINE is always comparable to TETSUO (like most cyber-punk movies) and good reason. There are certainly thematic parallels, although the films are definitely different. MEATBALL MACHINE has lots of fun, splatter moments, and the creature / borg FX is definitely a high point - a mixture of TETSUO-GWAR, both complex and resourceful. Depending on your taste for these types of films, MEATBALL MACHINE may be your thing. If you enjoy hyperkinetic cyber-punk movies with a healthy dose of spray - that's for you ... 7/10
