Yeah, the dancing thriller of the tap ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. It is demented and campy fun and part of the guignol cycle 60s that leaked in the 70s. The double function released by Burt Reynolds comedy FUZZ is this crazy frightening because it is a lot of fun. Like the combination of LOCUST, MUUDE and BABY JANE, I suggest that any future viewer take the idea that it is almost intended to bow and sit with someone you can bully and elbow. In fact, crush when you look at it ..... with cheap champagne. Again, many 30-year-old film ideas are also mistaken; a time-struggle to get a better life because of bitter and convoluted emotional madness. But it's just crazy. It also reminds me of a lot of BLOODY MAMA, De Niro-Winters, which makes this movie positive.
