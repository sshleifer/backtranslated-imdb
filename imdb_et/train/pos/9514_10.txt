This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is very good at Hanks, Newman and everyone else. Certainly, Jude Law is the best result. Cinematic art is great, editing is just as good and includes a great original score that really fits the mood of the movie. Production design is also a factor in making this movie special. For me, the godfather will win a lot, but fantastic cinematography will win this competition. Definitely the best picture in my book.
