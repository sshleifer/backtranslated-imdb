The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role in his short career in 1981 at ARTHUR, a stunningly funny and intermittent story that creates warm smiles, big stomach laughs, and occasional tears when you're in the right mood. Moore got the best actor for Oscar nomination because Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "drives cars, plays tennis, loves women, but has weekends and he is his boss." Arthur is forced to inherit $ 750 million when he marries a snooty girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), a spoiled daughter of a secret gangster. Things stay sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli), a waitress / fighter actress Queens, who steals ties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the more fun shows of the last 50 years. Late Sir John Gielgud won the best supporting actor for the Oscar for his impeccable appeal, such as Arthur's acid linguistic butler and best friend Hobson, whose outward contempt for Arthur's behavior involves more father feelings. Barney Martin, along with Linda's father, has other funny bets. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was headed by an outstanding comedy by Steve Gordon, the first-time director, who unfortunately died next year. Several years later, there was also a forgotten sequel, but this classics must not be forgotten.
