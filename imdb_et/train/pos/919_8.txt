Having been a fan of Columbo, I was disappointed with "Corky Romano". Although it is definitely a funny movie, the character of Falki's mobile commander was a much-loved lieutenant he played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he uses. After "Corky Romano" I was honestly surprised as well as Peter Falki. HOW, having just seen "Find Christmas Christmas" and its predecessor "Town without Christmas" for the first time in a week, I have to say that "Max", Peter's Falki's pleasant character in both films is certainly as memorable and lovable as "Columbo". Although the parts of the film are quite foreseeable, such scenes do not take any account of the story being played. I also wish I had saved both warm-hearted films, and I recommend them to be a Falki fan, a Christmas nut or just someone who occasionally enjoys a sensitive movie from the week. This movie may also disappear from the television exchanges, so be sure to find "Finding John's Christmas" before it's too late.
