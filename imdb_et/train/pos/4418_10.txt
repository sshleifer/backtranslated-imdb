You saw it at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who did it) later accepted Q&A. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe that this is the first time the director and all the defendants at Harvey Keitel are again at risk and when the attack escapes the script he liked. <br /> <br /> Cinema Paradiso certainly reminds us of the young director's hope of revolutionizing Cuba. But do not expect this to be a revolutionary film, it is a political ambiguity that is perfectly unclear. Many references to the direct love of filmmakers for the history of film (the great "respect of the bicycle thief") and some of the strange scenes that work together are pretentious. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
