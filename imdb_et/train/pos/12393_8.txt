For those who wanted to know how mankind surrounds the red pots that crave me for pomegranate, the Second Renaissance shorts are short. I'm not quite sure why they're split into two parts, especially since they're credited with a DVD (and are they being viewed in a different form, but on a DVD?), But they're informative even if they have some gaps. <br /> <br /> What really makes this first part out of it, the other part and the rest of the animations have parallels that it shows between the robot's uprising and civil rights. Graphic tributes to slavery, fascism, concentration camps, and mass graves have been mixed with oral references to the Million Man March and the Human Complex of Humanity. In fact, these shorts don't really refer to "God", but instead replace "Man's own image". <br /> <br /> When shorts go, "Second Renaissance: Part I" is the most effective way to bring out emotions. It is a sad and disturbing view of humanity's ability to become an "architect of its own destruction". Some of them may have been turned off by some of the concepts that this short hangs out of well-established scientific literature, but then it's mostly what most of the Matrix series have done, and it's been a success for that success. <Br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
