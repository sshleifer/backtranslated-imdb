Matthau and Lemmon are the best in this - everyone else in the movie is big. Dialogue is great and very funny - and the scene where Lemmon's character tries to turn off his nose in a restaurant has always turned me laughing on the floor. Anyone who happened to see such a big deal should not be away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character with such tragic recordings so straight forward, in my opinion, only adds fun. These two big guys made movies together, but that's the best - no doubt.
