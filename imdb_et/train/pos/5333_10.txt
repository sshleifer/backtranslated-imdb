How it hasn't become a cult film I don't know. I think it's unfortunately neglected as a truly brilliant comedy! <br /> <br /> "Runaway car" is trying to bring itself up as a thriller, but acting (good God is bad), style, practical aspects of demonic possession of the car, and baby's evacuation point is not something you can really do but laugh . And laugh. Movies are made for our entertainment and the extent to which they do so may indicate the value of the film. This movie is the peak of entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At one point I got breath and almost suffocated, it is really funny at some point. When the baby was opened from the sunroof in the cabin with a helicopter with a robot pilot, which managed to maintain a steady speed that is identical to the car and completely flat, which meant that the grabbing hook did not cover the roof of the car into pieces I smiled hysterically. But when the child starts to fly in the air, hitting almost the bridge and getting into the tree, tears under my face. <br /> <br /> It also happened to me that the black policeman was the man who played the "Like A Prayer" video of Jesus Madonna. It looks like he gets everywhere.
