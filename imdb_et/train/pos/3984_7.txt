In the course of celebrating the release of Casino Royale, the film featuring the new Bond, starring this director, was directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost finished it a bit boring, but I'm glad I stayed with it. In principle, May (Anne Reid) Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) is a single mother who hardly sees anyone and has not been a boy-boy over the years. Her daughter says she could marry her new boyfriend Darren (of course Daniel Craig). After getting to know each other, May and Darren are a secret matter. And at his age 30-something and a new Bond?! Anyway, they probably want to keep it secret, but May is unfortunate and wonder if Helen will know about it. When he does, Darren gets less than May. In fact, Helen asks her for permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan, who is Toots, Danira Govich Au Pairina, Harry Michell Harryna, Rosie Michell Rosie and Johnny English Oliver Ford Davies Bruce. Very good!
