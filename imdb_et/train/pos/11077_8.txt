First, do not go to Revolver, waiting for another pulling or locking stock, this is a different gangster film. <br /> <br /> I saw the gala on the second night and this movie will definitely share the audience. This is a movie where half of the audience leave thinking. It was terrible and the other half left the thought of what it was? It was cool. I personally like movies that I don't understand, i. Mullholland Drive and the usual suspects so I enjoyed Revolver. <br /> <br /> It was certainly not perfect. I saw a big twist, at least one mile away, at least part of it, and although sometimes the ends are unexplained, Revolver has left many questions that are not explained for any reason. Some scenes, such as animation, and a scene where Sorter goes to the killing (actually one of my favorites), though the fantastic scenes look, just seemed to be there because they were fantastic to watch, not because they fit but there were many good things in the movie. I thought the actor was great for all the major actors, Jason stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (who was a pleasant surprise). This film was definitely my interest, one big, pause, action packed, scene after another. When Ray Liotta was under the table, you can see it well. The script was very well done and the soundtrack, like most Guy Ritchie films, was great. <br /> <br /> Although it was below movies such as Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and ordinary suspects, it was still a fantastic fast paced, psychological, action movie with many turns and tons of scenes that you remember long after the movie ended.
