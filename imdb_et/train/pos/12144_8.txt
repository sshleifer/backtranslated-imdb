I thought it would be a continuation of the original "Shaolin 36th Chamber", but in fact it is a more sincere "sister" for the original. Gordon Liu is still a former hero to learn kung fut to win those irritating Manchus ... but this time it's lighter and more comical. The movie centers are located around a local painting mill, where salaries are reduced by the top 10 new manchurian emperors. Liu plays "Chaot" who can grab the grinder to think he is a shaolin monk with almost magical kung fu skills. But his happiness ends, he has fallen under the scam, and he promises mill workers to go to the Shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them. <br /> <br /> Comedy really begins in a monastery where Chao tries to take on a number of trying experiments. It creates a lot of really funny moments and a lot of great choreography. Continuing the "36th Chamber" tradition, we can see in the monastery all kinds of clean and interesting (and highly hockey) training methods, as well as wooden benches as weapons. "is a mix of kung fu and bamboo scaffold construction. Chaot is not accepted as a Shaolin student, but is built for bamboo scaffolding for the" 10-year restoration "of the monastery. The DVD I bought has a special bamboo scaffolding building and inspiration, directed by Lau Kar It's a lot of hundreds (maybe thousands) of years old handicrafts, and Hong Kong's scaffolding is still built at high heights of bamboo, although the West only uses steel pipes and clips, and as a result of its scaffolding, Chao develops a special style of kung fu. .. when asked what it is, he responds with fun to the "scaffolding kung fu !!" he tried for the first time with the Abbot monastery, and the final confrontation with Manchus is a dazzling number of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties. > From a comedy perspective, I think this is one of the best kung fu genres, as the kung fu film generally stands out ... I recommend it to anyone!
