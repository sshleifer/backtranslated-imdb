I saw this movie some time ago on the film channel (HBO?). I was a Public Enemy, NWA and other early rape fan and saw CB4 in theaters. Anyway, that promo that it was on my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right from the bat I knew it was good (WARNING!) And I was right. Only the parody windows make this movie worthwhile again (My Peanuts), but the overall stream and delivery of the movie was great. You have to love the humor of a rapier (satirist) (probably NWA), some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and NWH. Who can forget Toon Deaf scratching his ass? It's too bad that this movie didn't get it serviced because CB4 had overshadowed their release, but I think it's a much better film. If you know and like the raps of the 90's gangsters, you look and laugh at this movie for a long time. If you don't talk or don't like "rap", you'll enjoy jokes at the expense of the genre.
