The next film by Cheech & Chong (1980) was the second film that celebrated the potty duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. Loving smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building, looking for ways to collect more smoke and just put it all day. But Cheech is the "responsible" one. She has a job and a permanent girlfriend. One day Cheech wants to get her frieze so she tries to get out of Chong. There is another problem, Cheech's brother "Red" (Cheech has another role) in the city and wants to hang with him. Sure he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech pawns Chong and red. What adventures are Chong and Red going into? Will Cheech get her frieze? How Long Does Chong Go Without Smoke? Just check out the CHEECH & CHONG FOLLOWING MOVIE to find out! He got some experience when he did some fresh work at UP IN SMOKE. Funny, but not as good as the first movie. But Cheech and Chong fans enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
