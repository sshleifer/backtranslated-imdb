Bedknobs and Broomsticks, set during World War II, are a fun fantasy adventure for children, starring Angela Lansbury as a trainee who, with the help of three evacuated children and a professor of witchcraft, blocks the Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> Superb ridiculousness, this movie delights children of all ages who have great characters, exciting stories and memorable stories. Lansbury is perfect as an Eglantine, a not-quite-perfect witch who takes three children as a child's adventure, and her three young stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart, and Ian Weighill) are as impressive as Cockney's predators who are helping the nasty brother of the nasty. <br /> <br /> Special effects are somewhat dated, but let's face it, kids don't care too much about these things when they're entertaining. And for entertainment, they are. With some impressive scenes that brilliantly interfere with live action and animation and true movie magic as a hundred Harry Potter, it would be difficult not to enjoy this wonderful cinema elf. In fact, only Portobello Road's rather drawn-out musical number is the perfection of the film, but so much more to enjoy, which can be easily forgiven. <br /> <br /> Moreover, all the films that include British television legend Bruce Forsyth as "Flash" Harry-style spiv is a good rating for me.
