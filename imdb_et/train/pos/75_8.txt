Big Vincent Price has made many fantastic horror films, some of which are the gems of the greatest genres of all time. His greatest achievements were undoubtedly his films in the 1960s, such as Roger Corman's brilliant Poe-cycle (still the biggest horrendous cycle of all time), Michael Reeves's 'Witchfinder General' (1968) or Ubaldo Ragona's 'The Last Man on Earth' (1964). the paramount importance of this brilliant man's career. The films that made the man famous and transformed him into an immortal Horror icon, however, date back to the 50s, when "House of Wax" (1953) celebrated his rise. 1954 The Mad Magician follows a plot of land that is very similar to a successful predecessor. This does not mean, however, that this film is not an original, admirable and absolutely wonderful pearl itself. As the lines above can say, Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and although I personally do not allow myself to leave anything, none of my husband's fans can miss this little pearl. <br /> <br /> Prices are marked by Don Galico (aka Galico Great), an underrated master and inventor of magical equipment whose boss, a buggy businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor). When a boss takes one of Galico's brilliant inventions and gives him his rival, then the great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico clicks and the murderous revenge begins ... <br /> <br /> Do I love Vincent's price when he is revenge? Some of his most famous and greatest films, such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "Blood Theater" (1973), were about absurd and admirable murders of revenge, and this earlier film during Horror's career is another proof that does not take revenge when Vincent Price does it. This film gives Price an excellent eccentric leading role, which, as always, delivers superb performance and delivers 70 minutes of fun and horror for every Horror fan. Another must-see for my fellow citizens.
