This movie is great. As you have often heard, it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike other people, I am obviously not of the opinion that it is frustrating, negative or dismantling Austria as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary: although there are really very difficult scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters are called very bad people, while watching love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls's movie. And that's exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE from other movies that try to show the lives of ordinary people in an intense and realistic way; their friction, desires, the dark side: Seidl is obviously not trying to prove that working class people have a trash! In my opinion, the viewers who have come to this conclusion seem very much to admit that almost no one lives as clean and normal as we would like other people to believe. And every living person has blind and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: An old Viennese man, looking at his old girl who dances "oriental tea" as he calls it. I think everyone who finds this scene does not have a sense of beauty and they should ask themselves what it is, it is a proto-fascist: HUNDSTAGE characters or viewers who are turned off by a 70-year-old female body dancing together all his charms for his lover.
