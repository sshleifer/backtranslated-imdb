I testify that for the first time I looked at Cowgirls, I got Blues, I didn't think it would be very memorable anyway. But now, after seeing this seventh time, I admit it has grown very much. The characters of Sissy, Mrs Jellybean and the Countess have become very wretched. And romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think satirical humor is more than that. Then there is a kick-ass soundtrack with a tremendously talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a bit about Patsy Cline) of his best. I can't think of any film that has "grown me" after Cowgirls is at first glance bad.
