There is nothing that would not like "Odd Couple" and it is not surprising that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are making a huge winning comedy team. But something that Neil Simon has adapted to his stroke stage, so that it seems to be more like a scythe comedy exhibition than a perfect film, is so underdeveloped. I have not seen this game, but we have to assume that the screen version is pretty loyal, because Simon wrote it so mistakes can't be blamed on stage-to-screen customization. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who immediately fall into the ordinary couple when they become roommates, because neither knows the other way - that Simon will never fully. However, a couple of hours are much worse for killing.
