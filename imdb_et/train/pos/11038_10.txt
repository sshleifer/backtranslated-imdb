I was hooked from beginning to end. The big horror stems from the disturbing images and the organic shocks that were created not to jump, but that you go "What f * ck I just saw?" All the other commentators briefly summarized what the film is about, so I do not say what has already been said. I told other people this movie the day after I saw it because it still haunted me. I even had a bad dream after that, and I am a real horror blower that can't be easily exposed like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What gave me bad dreams was what I felt I would do with these men in such cells. What would be my personal horror? my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant. That my friends are what a good nightmare is doing to you! The best part of this movie is that it's fine. This does not mean Bogeymen, which jumps on you, alien invasions or tons of gore. This is the opposite. The fear you create in your mind. The irony of the four characters is that horror does not come from the external power that affirms its power over them. Just ask men one thing they want and they get it ... but not as they imagined. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from a hidden book, but they may end up not wanting it. Sometimes locking in a cell is the best place!
