I loved this movie because I felt so perfect as I imagined that the French colony in Africa had to have been like life in the 50s ("my" generation anyway). But I looked at it at a quiet pace and gloriously ended. In the last 5 minutes of the movie, you have to focus on what's going on. I've never been more impressed with wrapping a film. I remember "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters slept on the couch!
