Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best film ever made ... But it's better than many of you have said. I have still not seen a gay movie on the right. <br /> <br /> Your Americans are used to watching very narrative movies that have a clear start, development and result. But European films are less narrative, but make you think and feel. <br /> <br /> Many of you didn't understand the meaning of the movie. It is not meant to be a simple summer loving film for us, "with commercial characters who" fall in love and live forever ". Summer holidays and beaches are just the background, and this film is aimed at all young boys who are familiar with their sons. <br /> <br /> Maybe some of you didn't understand this movie well because of its 3 parts, which were a setback. These three moments are: - in Pornichet when they meet and love. - After a year and a half with Nantes, Mathieu won't go He tries to commit suicide and Cedric takes him to the hospital. Later he seems to be talking to a psychiatrist to find out why he did it. - The last part is when Mathieu returns to Pornichet, in winter alone ... to think about his life has changed how his life changes and tries to find himself. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some people could not understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed up, but anyway, as I said before in ... it's not a funny movie. If what one wants to see is meat, then we have Belam films. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, which we want to show us, is how cruel can life be for a young boy who is unsure of his feelings and not sure what to do in life. Mathieu only wants to go home and try to live the kind of life he thought he could bring to happiness. But what was initially perfect was not as good as he thought later, and he was worried and I felt he had lost his life. She's gone and she doesn't know what she really wants to do or that makes her happy. Eventually he became depressed and attempted to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, funny? Not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? just some .. but it's not an entertaining movie. There are all the feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, misfortune, pain, depression, loneliness ... I feel like many others in Mathieu's life and problems, and that's what the director wanted to do ... a movie that shows us a boy's life cruel reality. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the best gay-themed movie.
