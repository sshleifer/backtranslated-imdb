I saw Saving Grace right after he came out of the video. Since then, it has become one of my favorites! The plot is not very complicated, but it doesn't take away from entertainment. It is full of comic moments and has a very good quality. The characters are what makes the movie so good. They all have their own distinctive feature that adds humor, the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and the Phyllida Law, jump in the mind. Great action took place all, especially Brenda Blythen. He and Craig Ferguson were great with some funny moments. If you are looking for good comedy, I would definitely recommend this movie!
