It's just funny, look at it !!! <br /> <br /> OK they want 10 lines like this: it's a 50's and 70's werewolf movie fraud. A lot of satire, some political. It looks like an early Clouseau film (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less fat. If you like Naked Guns movies, you would also like it (again less). In fact, humor extends from a mild sexual inspiration (inevitable to teen comedy) to a truly radiant socio-political satire. Changing the Moon High School from the 50s to the 70s is really funny. The order of the changing presidential pictures is great! OK may not be brilliant but still fun. From the Paranoia of the 50's Cold War and from the 70's inflation, there are tons of (historical) cracks. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch the movie if you have a chance!
