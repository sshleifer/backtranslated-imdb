This documentary follows the lives of Mother and Daughter of the Great and Little Edie Beale, who lived in the mid-1970s in the mid-1970s in East Hampton, NY. By the time the filmmakers find them, the mansion is breaking down and women, one of 78 and the other 56, share a messy room. Elder Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin. Originally, the women started out of the building due to their corrupted situation, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could live there. it seems to be the best of mental health, but at other times the movie is hard to watch. "Little" Edie accuses her mother of her current situation and her mother is burning back that Edie was never a success she thought. "Little" Edie often seems trapped in the past, focusing on the choices she made decades ago, and loves to show pictures of her youth, where she was probably a beautiful debut. His mother seems to have left more of his destiny to live in the terrible conditions of the rest of his life. There are definite hints of glamorous life, where both women lead the pictures of a happy family alongside their bed of older Edie. We can see from the house that most of the rooms there are empty, the walls are cracking and decomposing, and "Small" Edie leaves the food in the attic to compete. And of course there are many cats running around. <br /> <br /> This documentary is incredibly sad in your heart. Although neither woman seems to be much in her life, their lively mess is totally terrible. It is not particularly clear whether there is even running water in the house, and you get the impression that their family is basically abandoned. <br /> <br /> The documentary, however, is a miracle and is highly recommended.
