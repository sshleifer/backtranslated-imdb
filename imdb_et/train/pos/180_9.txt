When Gundam0079 became the trilogy of the film, most of us are familiar, much of it was an activity and nothing less. This OVA is the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not an activity, but an emotional one. I think the two main operating sequences are enough for me. After seeing so many gundam series, movies and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civil esquire movie. This movie did this great job. What makes this movie look like is that there are good and bad people on both sides of the war. This made Zeons a more human than original film where they are depicted as the second rise of the evil Nazis. Most people who don't like the anime that I've seen this movie (lol) liked it. So, I would recommend it to many people just for the anti-war story. If you're a fan of Gundam and you haven't seen it, you shouldn't read it; you should look at it right now.
