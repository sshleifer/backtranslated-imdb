At the time of impact, but now better classified as Australian cult film. Humor is widespread, uncomfortable and in the last scene where the BBC studio fire is extinguished by urinating. Contains almost any cliché about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to the "old country," and every cliché that concerns these robbers, stuck, whooping, Tory Britse. For the British, it would be acceptable because of the well-casting of well-known actors and Australians of this generation who can get humor. Americans - forget about it. Language and jokes are in the English dialect and as such is incomprehensible.
