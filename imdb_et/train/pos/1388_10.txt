"day time" is an incredible picture. in some ways it is better than "third kind of close meetings". (I prefer the independent color of the cheese on the big budget line.) The special effects are the roots, but it's a fun part. jim davis provides excellent performance in this movie. this is probably one of the best roles he ever had. the musical result is very good. a story that doesn't make sense. IF YOU WORK ONLY WITH ALL INTRIGATIONS. Like many of the best works of art, "day time" is not afraid to be subtle and vague. "Daily Time" may be a low budget indie movie, but it is not too much to compare it to "existential" European films in the fifties and sixties. (many of which were independent small budget products).
