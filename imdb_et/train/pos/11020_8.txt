This movie is a remarkable, exciting, visually exciting action image that also has many dark humor. It was one of the biggest hits of 1993. This is one of Harlin's best films. Lithgow is a terrible fun villain. Stallone certainly made a short return of this sharp thriller. This is probably Harlin's best filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a sharp anamorphic wide screen (2.35: 1) and an amazing Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has a director's current commentary track with comments from Stallone. The DVD also has a technical team comment. The DVD is behind the scenes, featurette, two deleted scenes, led by an introduction and much more. Don't miss this great movie. Micheal France (Fantastic Four) and actress: Stallone (The Rocky Series) scenario. Based on John Long's premise. Great filmmaker Alex Thomson, B.S.C. (AlienÂ³, demolition worker, legend). Oscar nominated for best sound, best sound editing and best visual effect. Panavision. (**** / *****).
