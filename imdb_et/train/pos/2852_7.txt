This film has a very simple but clever assumption - an unemployed person who is trying to steal a shop assistant, and the shop secretary is trying to get him into action ... the thief goes to the shop secretary right after him. Everywhere the shop secretary is struggling with the low rating of Yakuza chinpiraga (gangster). Behind the previous chase, they are catching Yakuza's eyes, who have been looking for a convenience store. Then the story moves in the form of Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but it is added with the dog. D.A.N.G.A.N. The Runner ("translated" as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is about a chase, and the chase goes on and continues to the point that, at the end of another act, he forgets to forget why he runs and Yakuza don not remember which of the two men he is pursuing nor do they remember why they are driving away from him. <br /> <br /> SABU with the latest movie POSTMAN BLUES is the only thing that all the film is all about, and with action, plenty of physical comedy and dark humor are injected so that the audience is involved. There is no end to stop when three men evaporate and one of the most chaotic Mexican stand-offs you see on a film that looks almost like Sabu paid tribute to TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
