I watched this movie 10 years ago. and watch it on average once a year on the video. it is a timeless type of film because the themes are universal, but the stories and conversation are so personal. it is also one of the few films that will be left out of one credit roll, even though there are only two (very involved) characters in fact. it owes much to hawke and delpy action that make us believe they are really jesse and celine. this is also the first movie I saw mentioning reality TV, and now this phenomenon is rampant! I love how this film just surrounds the audience in your room and makes you think, but maybe you are funny that you are one of those characters. it also made me drive around the train to Europe! I have not met anyone who has been unable to associate this film. maybe it will tell itself, my friends or just the genius of this movie.
