When Paris is Burning, it came back completely. I wasn't the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it would be campy and stupid. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after the film had been around for ten years and I went away and bought it. It brought me back to a fun and exciting time and place. I felt like I knew all the characters personally. The 80s were remarkable and the film hit the nature of gay culture. What a terrible job! I went online and found out what some of the original members are doing now, but I couldn't find them all. If anyone has any information about any cast member, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they will make another documentary. I LOVE IT
