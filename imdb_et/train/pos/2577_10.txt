My dad grew up watching George Reeves as Superman and when I was a little boy he had VHS episodes and allowed me to watch them, including this movie (if you want, in the family), and I loved it. > <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with an oil mine and mole men from the mine who are radioactive and target a city that is deadly, and that is Superman's mission to stop this chaos. > <br /> It's just so wonderful and fun to watch. Old style special effects and sound - the team pulled such beauty with such little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a little boy, and I'm 16 years old, it just shows how timeless and classic these adventures are.
