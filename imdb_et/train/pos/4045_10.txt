I'm so glad I have the opportunity to see this rare pearl of a rare film. I saw it at an independent film festival, so don't wait for it to go to your city. During the movie, I noticed that about 10 people were rising and walking. Too bad for them (here in the south, people don't like to read the subtitle). The film starts slowly, but it is so rich in dialogue that I didn't feel bored. When the action finally arrived, I found myself glued to the screen as if I was a roller-skater. <br /> <br /> I also got the headlines that appeared before the chapters, especially those that introduce characters on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) as face-level bosses. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of "video games / comic book" movies, I welcome it.
