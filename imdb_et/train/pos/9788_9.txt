I was at the same screenwriter conference and saw the movie. I thought the writer - Sue Smith - made a very clear summary of what the film was about. But the film doesn't really need an explanation. I thought the topics were very clear and inspiring. A film about the ability to courage, fear, especially fear and overcome at the expense of parents, and involving life opportunities, is a film that needs to be appreciated and enjoyed. I liked it much more than much mortgaged "Somersault". I also think Mandy62 was a bit uncomfortable for Hugo Weaving. Like your vintage, I should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have recently been weak, but Peaches offers goods. I'm glad I saw it.
