See that Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd are dead girlfriends haunted by a new girlfriend. This is Gabrielle Desperate Housewives and a man who carried Anchorman "Pantheri Cologne". If you are looking for a Golden Globe movie, you have to watch the movies again. But if you're ready to stop the reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, then you've come to the right place. The characters are all funny. They work very well. The real game is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. She is as funny as she was Friends and she was funny and good looking at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did I.
