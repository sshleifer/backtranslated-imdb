Director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of different quality, but most of his films in his home country are undisputed masterpieces. This is a story about alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writers who move with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know she is only interested in meeting a woman's beautiful husband's lover. Meanwhile, the writer is struggling with strange visions - at first, they look like hallucinations that are caused by alcohol abuse, but soon he will realize that he is actually dealing with some kind of perception. Exciting Hitchcock thriller, very original and provocative. I love movies that think they are something, but then you realize that they are something completely different. This is one of those movies; the first half of the thriller and the second half of the almost religious surreal saga. Very erotic, original and cloudy, not for kids or people who go to church on Sundays. Great filmmaking by future director Jan de Bonti. Highly recommended!
