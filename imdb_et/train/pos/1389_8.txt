The Williams family lives on a beach in the middle of a desert. They end up in a significant danger when the place suddenly shrinks into a time format where the past, the present and the future collide wildly chaotic and unpredictable. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film with convincingly mysterious knowledge and gradually makes things happen when strangers, finer and more exciting events occur. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with many dazzling visual images and does a good job of creating a real sense of awe and wonder. Amazingly sincere action from the playground qualifies as another great plus: Jim Davis as cheerful patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheerful wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as Richard, Marcy Lafferty as her lovely wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as cute little girl Jenny and Scott C Kolden, who is Steve. Funky special effects offer an inspired combination of gnarly miniatures, pure stop-motion animation monsters (these creatures include a small spindly hairless man, a large, lumpy, fanged beast and scrawny lizard guy), and naughty matte paintings. Indeed, Richard Band's stabbing full-bodied orchestral performance is really confusing. The trick is also John Arthur Morrill's crisp, sunny cinematography. Fun flick.
