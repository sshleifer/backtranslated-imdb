Xizao is a rare small film. It is simple and unwanted and at the same time emotionally and joyfully rewarding. The story is simple and the subject of old and new collisions is admired in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the film, but it would have fallen if it were not for the great characters and the actors who showed them. <br /> <br /> An aging patriarch, Master Liu, is China's remnant of the day of expansion. He drives a bath in the Old Town. In every bathroom, we have seen jelaousy, unhappy people. Even hardened cynics do not find any mistakes in this great environment. <br /> <br /> Master Liu Er Ming, a son with mental disability, is the second truly powerful character of the film with his modern life brother. The relationships between these three people and the different visitors of the Old Town are amazingly detailed and heart-sensitive, with some scenes offering so much emotion that it is almost visible in movies. <br /> <br /> With Critical Message Mode, this movie was not only censored, but also unreasonably small coverage. It may be a coincidence, but if this caliber movie even on the internet (!) Is practically impossible to find, you can't suspect. <br /> <br /> So help the speech and film world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie and if you have a DVD, if it's one, share the share!
