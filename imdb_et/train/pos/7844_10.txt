I really love this example, it's like reading a book and every chapter leaves you with the wish. You have to think about what's going to happen in the next episode and fight to maintain your friendship over the years. After the end of each episode, your mouth will have a sweet bitter taste, knowing that: One - The exhibition was good, you can't wait for the next episode and it really thinks about what's really going on with your friends for twenty years. And two - the fact that the exhibition is put on a "hiatus" and we don't see it in full. Fox probably doesn't know what they've done, they claim they lose viewers in 18-49 categories, which they probably don't know what people want to see, whether they're getting rid of good shows like "Reunion". However, I have one query that I would like to raise. If they bring back the show and continue for another season, how would it work, because every episode takes place during the year and the story is based on what's going on in 20 years? Your answers are welcome. Bring back Reunion! Bring back Reunion!
