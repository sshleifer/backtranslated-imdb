It is so easy to take cheap pictures on this topic. You know, a hairy man is trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar is doing a great job to make Gerald's real person, someone you care deeply, and feel he's trying to live as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but Geraldine, she sees HOT! And chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who know each other's love and it even happens when they just look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the corporate takeovers of a potentially cheesy submarine line are plausible and you're at the end! At least I did!
