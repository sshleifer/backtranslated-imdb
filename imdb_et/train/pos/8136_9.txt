This movie is a great documentary. This is the result of the rap group, NWH, which consists of the ice-cold, delicious taste and shade deflection, through its unique path to gangster rap rises, low and high rises. Due to the problems of women, egos, policemen and whitey, this group reaches the top of the gangster rapy world, as this film goes to the top of the documentary. I know Everybodies favorite mocumentary is This is a Spinal Tap, a very good reason, but I think if the right mood, this film is just better. The laughs never stop, not even the rap culture. <br /> <br /> I'm a white guy with no interest in rap music, culture, or anything else, but I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote and celebrated this scenario, recorded great potential and is ashamed that I have not seen him since Black Hat's fear. However, I have seen him once more when you have it, and I recommend that you laugh quickly for Black Hat. <br /> <br /> Remember: "Don't shoot to see whites! .... their eyes? Don't let you see the whites." <br /> <br /> Don't and enjoy the movie.
