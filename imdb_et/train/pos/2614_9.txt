Why wasn't it published? I thought it had to be a little garbage because it wasn't. How wrong can a girl be? This movie is literally amazing. It keeps your attention from the beginning and its pace has never slowed down. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie, "episode" as it was (didn't give anything, the trailer saw it.) unacceptable. You chose a pet, you are shocked, you can't go and make a cup of coffee because you have to find out what will happen. Adrenaline rises and you can't watch. For Cudos participants, it is very plausible. And it doesn't stop there, they have a final shock for you. <br /> <br /> It also puts you in question with the reality TV and when you look. And how far are we actually doing that? Last year, Endemol (who makes a big brother) made a TV show in the Netherlands that offers a deadly kidney transplant patient. The exhibition finally revealed that it was a fraud that apparently showed awareness of organ donation, but are we too close for convenience?
