I watched this tape straighten up, looked at it again and laughed twice harder. I strongly recommend this tape to those who do not hate transvestites, but uncomfortable. This shows that transvestite is a feature rather than a whole being. Comedy is not a single issue. This man is great. All comics should strive for their courage, intelligence, and talent.
