had a desire to make the movie for a long time and he did it. It is like it has visualized a dirty and worn laptop that is filled with very little ideas that it has filled and worn for about 10 years. No support for character transformation, no Hollywood ingredients just for life and a bit of magic. speed-balanced comedy vs drama is completely weighted. this film takes you on a journey that has ended before you realize how nice it was. music is great and your eyes are equally happy. The fact that this film is nothing but sketches of people who are mainly concerned with one side of the character makes it very pleasant and surprisingly fun, it's great because it's empty. between the lines it takes. to see or not to see it?
