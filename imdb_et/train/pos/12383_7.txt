Christina Raines plays a beautiful model in New York who is looking for a new apartment and will meet her strange neighbors and reveal the secret building and slowly build up at the end of the film at the very end. This film contains all the elements of a clean plot from the Roman Catholic Church to the devil, to the gate of the gate, to the odd rituals, to the growing conspiracy, and finally to the many talented actors and actors who flood the film. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum Carradine is an old priest. Many of these actors take it - especially Burgess Meredith, who gives a neighbor a small comic / demented performance with a small bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable, like Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some performers have almost anything, like Jose Ferrer, in a grateful role, even if it is something other than a kame. Sentinel is a subtle horror film with many psychological elements and some really terrible scenes. The end of the scene is repulsive and still chilling. I think there is some free birth and violence in the movie, especially the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I don't think so. Also, the father / daughter stuff was a bit too much, but the film generally works and has a victory. Director Michael Winner does a similar job and creates effective tension and frightening movie moments. Carradine scenes are especially effective.
