This film discusses the Irish rebellion in the 1920s and, more specifically, one man's life after he informs his friend of the main money and subsequent consequences. While watching the movie, I got the feeling that you could take the script and only a few small updates to do it again and unfortunately it would still fit into today's events. But you wouldn't have the remake just as good. A great performance from Victor McLaglen (for whom he had earned the Oscar) and a subtle ensemble play that includes most, if not all, actors with Hollywood brooches, most of them recognizable by character actors who are established at the time or just starting out. A very good movie to watch. Highly recommended.
