As it happens to be one of the favorite novels, I was very excited to see the movement. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course there are a few things I could choose, but I think the film is true to the book and was really a good movie. It seems that Stephen King's films are mostly bad, but it is one of the good ones. It's such a dark story that I think I like it .. and better than the dead who live. And anything from animals coming from the grave is quite scary. Once you've seen the movie, we'll make a huge difference and read the book now! This is a well-written screen game, the actors could have done a better job (I only say it to Rachel and Ellie. She was so funny) I liked everyone else a lot and most important to me ... it stuck with the novel.
