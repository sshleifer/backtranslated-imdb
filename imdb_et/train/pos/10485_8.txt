I saw it on television last night and I was quite happy. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that makes your heart warm and warm and feels good in the world (all neighbors pretended they didn't see what grace is doing to help him and protect him - The old policeman is my favorite, although you know that this story is not realistic. <br /> <br /> I loved to act (they all seemed as ordinary, ordinary people who lived in small people). picturesque English coastal city), but the biggest thing in the movie was that spirit and humor! Remember that there are two old ladies in the shop after they had "tea" !! <br /> <br /> Maybe the ending was a bit confusing, but it didn't really prevent me, really enjoying the whole story!
