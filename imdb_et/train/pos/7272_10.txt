Before I start, let me tell you how big this stand-up sound is when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: Cut the mode at the same time (especially the Red Mountain level). So, when you look at this stand-up special, I recommend - no, NOTING that you are doing it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia takes off in extreme locations in San Francisco, California. There he makes absolutely apologies for everyone. <br /> <br /> I am quite grateful to God here for Carlos not doing his thing in which he uses the same fun over and over again. again. He does a tremendous job that makes everyone fun and at the same time honest; I know a few times when I said when Carlos said joke: "Damn, this guy makes a good point!" Then came my game on my television screen because I forgot to play Sonic Adventure I DX: Cut by the director. My bad :) So yes, there's nothing to do about this stand-up. If you have a TiVo or something like this, please do it yourself and register it for a historic hour.
