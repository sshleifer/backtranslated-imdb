I can't say that this movie is disappointing because I read some reviews before watching it and it didn't do as well as I thought it would be. The bar was not so high that the fact that my expectations were met does not speak much. <br /> <br /> Good: New York City. If you live in a city like me, you will feel certain places and realize that the city should be more than just a setting, but one of the main signs. There are truly delicate moments, humorous conversations and a plot twist to the left and right that all keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not positive "they want more" fashion. Certainly good skits / scenes go beyond the bad, but there are a lot of skits that belong to the "in-middle" category, too much in fact, which ultimately leads to the movie. Also, the diversity of New York, though suggesting that many of the city's remote pans have been mentioned throughout the film, has never really been realized or analyzed until the city's justice. For example, many sketches work well for making middle-aged whites. I mean, I know that the city has many of the demographics mentioned, but because of the diversity of parcels and characters in Paris, the Lancaster, PA or somewhere white in New York. It's just disappointing to see that the city made this legacy similar. <br /> <br /> But even after I said that, I'd recommend giving New York, I love you. Who knows, maybe you don't agree with my opinion and maybe you don't. You never know until you see it yourself. This review is not meant to prevent anyone from watching this movie because everyone's opinion of art is different. I'm just giving you a very vague head to wait.
