Yeah, Giorgio, it's a good movie. Yes, Giorgio has a bit of romance, good music, beautiful landscapes, comedy (great food struggle) and some tasty flavors. Every movie buffer would enjoy this movie. Those who need huge special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us now need and then a little escape and how to do it better than a party with eyes, ears, and heart? Must See!
