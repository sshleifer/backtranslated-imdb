Best of the seven Sam Fuller movies I've seen (including the best filmmakers at Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten! This is the most controlled by Fuller. I like it when it's out of control, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. Richard Widmark stands for a handkerchief that steals some of the microfilms that had to go to the communist spies, and Jean Peters plays a woman who wore his boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley, and is forced to find Widmark and get it back. he finds out the feces played by Thelma Ritter, and Widmark and Peters attract each other, which makes Peters loyalty (and the fact that he learns that he is working for the Communists; the things of the Cold War are really interesting). it is not so bad that it damages the film (unlike Fuller's previous movie Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. his best role, but I don't know my career so well that I can definitely say it. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable result. His role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance and his last scene in this film is as touching as anything you find in the cinema. I will never forget it. 10/10.
