Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most amazing and delightful film I've seen over the years. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California, when I remember correctly, where inmates have practiced and performed another Shakespeare game every year for the past 14 years. The film follows the staging of these "Tempest" staged through performance, and in this process we learn these pretty amazing things about the men who are all the most serious crimes. Truth is indeed unfamiliar as fiction - if someone tried to make this story a fictional film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it is real will make it breathtaking - literally; I was out loud when I found out about the crimes of a particularly talented criminal. It's like some Oz loops and more interesting because the characters and their strange stories are real.
