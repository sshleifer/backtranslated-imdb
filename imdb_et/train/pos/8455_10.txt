Having been the youngest of the Gundam Wing series for the first time, I have again reaffirmed my conviction that this series is not only beautifully animated, but that the depth of the plot, gundam design, character and character is masterfully filled. Though the boys first seem to be a band, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can be partly attributed to great art, with individual personalities creating distinct and loving distinctions between characters. Consequently, it is extremely easy to get a specific character. I personally liked Heero because of my stoic personality. While I may be biased by childish sentimentation of this event, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing deals with the deeper issues of war and life (how do we get peace?), While providing actionable battles in large robotic suits that are at least great.
