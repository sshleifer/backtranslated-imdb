Kurosawa, fresh in color, loses sight of her usual issues of truth and reality perception and chooses a depressing image of the Tokyo slums. Kurosawa stretches the style I thought was her antithesis - that is, I feel Kurosawa wanted to make Ozu's picture. Poor pace, poorly designed, this film is rare in this great work. Even though Ikiru was everyday and frustrating, it was still interesting and fast, and while Stray Dog depicted Japanese slums and social poverty without being too heavy hands or bored, did the den also have anything to expect from the content, none of the previous Kurosawa images have redemption properties. <br /> <br /> Warning, this is not a movie Kurosawa should appreciate.
