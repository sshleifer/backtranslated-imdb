Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched the "C'eravamo tanto post" in the summer evening: we liked it, but we didn't love it because we loved the "special day". I believe that Ettore Scola is quite underestimated: we often forget him, perhaps because his latest films were disappointing. And so, last night, we sat down to enjoy my masterpiece and my masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but the most pleasant thing was Loren and Mastroian's chemistry. They are both great actors and the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fanatical fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants another child to receive a prize for big families. Gabriel is just fascist. They spend a special day together, this special day in 1938, when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I don't want to ruin the plot anymore: look for this movie!
