Serious comedy. The film version produced by Ross Hunter of the French game "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americanized "A Rich Rich Woman") is plush, well cast, sometimes funny ... and unfortunately timeless. The wealthy California widow, who seems to have bitten her money, is ridden by her two growing greedy daughters, both of whom fear that Mama Rosie will neglect her legacy. The whole question of a vital but outdated woman who was sent to her holiday home against her will and then needs to be reasonably understood at the hearing is an inconvenient material for the comedy (and David Lowell Rich, the director of her credit, does not overload the image with crass gags or obvious feelings). Some of the humor is a bit wide and does not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the peculiarity of this scenario and never gets a false statement. Sandra Dee is also good when Rosalind's granddaughter and James Farentino are very charming as a young lawyer. There is so much to say about the importance of the elderly and how they spend the rest of their time with "Rosie!" The seriousness of the subject is almost lost in a hurry to the end of the luck. The picture leaves you smiling - and at the same time think about how many older women who were never so happy. *** from ****
