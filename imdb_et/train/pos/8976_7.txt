Starlift is a pleasant and interesting setback for those star musical images that each studio put out during World War II. If you have such characters as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott, etc., and people like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, who offer music. And the plot is not even on the road. <br /> <br /> Which plot is associated with two air force men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, who try to meet the Warner Brothers star Janice rule, using trick that both are from Youngstown, Ohio, and Hagerthy's father was the rule of the dentist, as well as half the city. The plan works too well because Louella Parsons will soon put them in her column. Yes, Louella is also in the movie. He wanted Warner Brothers or Jack Warner to be more than other studio masters because he also used this studio to reveal his Hollywood hotel radio broadcast. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the plot also touched upon Ruth Roman's real efforts to play his own studio and others who show that the military and women are going to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and perform on Travis Air Force, where a lot of this movie was shot. sing / tell Ballad Look Out Stranger, I'm a Texas Ranger assisted and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper looked like he had a very old time joking about his picture. <br /> <br /> This is the oldest cliche when you say they don't make them any longer, but they really don't do it because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under the contract. This is one thing about the death of the old studio system that we can mourn.
