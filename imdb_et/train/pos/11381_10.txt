The best part of American In Paris is at the end of a long ballet, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are a living person of several major artists. Kelly has previously been established as a pavement artist in Paris, so the sequence is a logical end to musical breaking with life and energy, Gershwin's stories and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was his best here - it's a bit different from Singin in the rain, and the whole film's impact on the ballet gives it a definite wow factor. No wonder the queue ended with "It's entertainment" after all the other MGM musical events have passed!
