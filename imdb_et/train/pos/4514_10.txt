I recently watched this movie laughed on Sunday afternoon with some of my friends and we have fun! This movie is a masterpiece of the trash. Try to look at it for this purpose! Of course, this was not expected, but the budget of the actors (and Alberto Tomba is the best), the weak script and the low budget have created strange things about stupidity. Tomba was just out of the alpine race, where he was the dominant technical skier of the 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine world championship season titles. Seriously about the director: No one knows why Damiano Damiani has signed this movie. All other Damon instructions are significant.
