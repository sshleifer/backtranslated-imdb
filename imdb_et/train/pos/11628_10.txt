"I didn't want it to be complicated, Leese. I have to assume she reads it." Fear takes a flight of 30,000 feet in this intense activity. Overnight flight to Miami will soon be a struggle for survival, when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her warrior (Cillian Murphy) is going to use her as part of a plot of chilling murder. If the minutes are left, he will have time in the race to warn potential victims before it is overdue. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love this movie is due to chemistry between two stars. McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my favorite music. For example, airport early scenes play more romantic comedy: two people running with each other .... I got it for two to do that. Especially Murphy's character. Jackson, who seems to be so complicated that he is acting charming and innocent, but he is trying to do his job and make Lisa feel physically and mentally trapped. I mean, in some parts, he seems to be concerned about Lisa. <br /> <br /> Great thrill ride. A lot of the movies I hate to see prequel or sequel, but I really don't want to recall the prequel that would take place with Jackson's view of Lisa. The favorite scene is probably this headbutt scene because it was so unexpected. There was also a nice stone to the famous "pen" scene. When will she move her? McAdam's Lisa was also a nice change where he became a victim of return. I also loved the scene she was sitting at in the catering area and pretending to ask a lady for a food trial. How big was Murphy with all his colds .....
