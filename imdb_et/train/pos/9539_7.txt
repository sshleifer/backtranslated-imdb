For Troma fans or Cyberpunk genre mixed with small blood, this movie is for you! Within this film, a good amount of blood is available, and the effect can be impressive and awesome. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not chained to what we, as now, are waiting for films. <br /> <br /> There are also significant small foreigners I find cute. All in all, it's a good movie for fans of the genre. Films like Tetsuo: Iron Man and Versus are also recommended for this strange Japanese film approach, full of wonderful shades and bloodshed. Of course, you should see this movie already in two.
