"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not on the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it certainly has many great moments. It basically follows the life of Zoraki and Brak, having a normal life and going to a school that lives in the neighborhood of the 50's sitcom. The humor and animation of this exhibition is very much like "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you see in Meatwad), with situations and strange characters. But that's good, he has funny parts. Some songs are great, others are not great, but I like this show. The funniest character is Braki's father. (this is a person, no one knows why)
