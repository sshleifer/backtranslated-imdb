I just saw drugs for years in VH1 and I love it. I think it reflects drug history very well and, most importantly, it is a strong message for all generations. There are wood stocks, the deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It completely covers the timing and development of drug use in America in both good and bad ways. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate its creators, because that is what is needed to play on the TV these days. Waiting for DVD release. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is stunning - a great time!
