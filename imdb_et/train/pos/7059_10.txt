I was surprised and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web, I thought Cinderella 2 (also 3) is a very cute and funny sequel to everyone - kids and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find this and a very informative movie, it shows lessons on how to follow yourself and your heart. I thought it had great animation and voice dialing was great; also Brooke Allison's songs. Since this movie is divided into three setbacks / stories, my favorite of these three is the story of Jaq's becoming a man thanks to Fairy Godmother and his magic.
