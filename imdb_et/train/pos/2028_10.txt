Burlinson and Thornton give this film a great performance with Denneh. Although originally thought to be just love, it really goes deeper. The beauty of nature grabs this movie by placing one of the best I've ever seen. Horse scenes are absolutely fantastic! All horses love this movie! <br /> <br />
