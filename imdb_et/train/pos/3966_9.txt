JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who started working with the agency before being called the FBI, and the story includes dealing with Ku Klux Clan, gangsters of banning time, German and Japanese World War II and the like. years; much better than films made these days. <br /> <br /> It's especially interesting for older viewers who know Washington. In about 20 minutes of the movie --- where James Stewart discovers Vera Miles that he is waiting for his first baby --- the scene was filmed at the Herzog Seafood restaurant on the former Washington Coast, the only film where this historic location is displayed. Soon after taking office, President Kennedy decided that the western part of Washington, 99% black neighborhood, was outstanding and should be dismantled. The decree, which corresponds to its undisputed royalties, the whole region, including the popular beach restaurant, but excluding the 3 historic churches; reduced to crushed stone. The black people who were expelled from their homes were relocated as well as possible without federal aid; Similarly, businesses were just about to finish their business, with few relocations. Restaurant Row was turned into a walkway and Washington had no water line for about 10 years (restaurants, seafood, boats, etc.). For a lifetime resident, the Herzog Restaurant scene was our # 1 reason to see this fine movie again.
