One of the most underrated films I've seen for a long time is Bill & Pred's Bill S. Preston Esqi's second fun adventure. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to watch this movie: First, you see a stupid dialogue, a far-drawn plot, the idea of ​​juveniles. OR .. You see great fallen idiots who find themselves in a too big position for the brain again. Throw Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar into the plot and it will become a big hit movie. Bill and Ted go to the same level of sincerity, only Bill and Ted. It's difficult to balance the fence of the fence, but if you look at the movie as a non-visual screw-ball comedy, but as an adventure with two men who have no business in the adventure, it will change so much.
