Okay, I admit. This is a movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes a beautiful parody for someone who makes James Cagney's parody magically to save. <br /> <br /> Supported by cast-in-all workers and stepping right and doing a great job in 80's comedy. Spamming the 40's gangster films of the 1930s, it continually cracks new ground with very original material. (Well, yes - some of it has been copied, but when that movie was made, it was original and much of it was not copied elsewhere.) Look at Joe Piscopo, who warns people that they are not ______, the signs of one big spell. See how Roman Moronie does things in English that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh. See amazing views, such as pet store owner Johnny Kelly, who use their puppy price tags to gun and dust their kittens. Never look for the biggest "sexual warning" educational film. Look at the most astonishing misrepresentation of the Latin church, while a boy who never bought a class collects parts of the Thompson machine gun. Tracking lines you use in a random conversation in the next decade. Look at Maureen Stapleton, who makes the perfect match for a hard-working mother, a surprise you never see. <br /> <br /> If you see a coat that does not hit your funny bone, be patient - the other will reach 30 seconds or less, and the probability is that you need to stop until you are done on the floor several times. Duckies and bunnies? They too. Watch for fine things - some eyesight eyes may go unnoticed at first sight. <br /> <br /> There are some small bugs - but this is probably the best spoof. Some come close, but none of them are good.
