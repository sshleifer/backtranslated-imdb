Finally, I got a rental of mail order DVDs so I could find the stores that aren't available to me. I chose Souler in the opposite direction because I love Christopher Melon and also small, often ignored movies. <br /> <br /> This is such treatment! Melon has such a charm in this regard. It is easy for him to approach him only if you ever see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this movie, Melon is not turned off, who doesn't let himself relax, who strikes the skis in many ways to find the way of the accident unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Barry (Melon) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and no longer done. I haven't seen Busfield since the 1930s and it was fun to watch. But it was all Chrise movie. Again, I got such a fan game. <br /> <br /> At first, it's a bit slow, I admit. I thought some "setbacks" could have been edited. In general, this film - men or women - rejoices as it is an honest and refreshing attitude to contemporary relationships.
