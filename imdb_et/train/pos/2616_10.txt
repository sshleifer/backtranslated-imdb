Lion King 1/2 is a very lovely story to go with Lion King. It basically follows the original story of Lion King, but with a few twists. The film explains ventilation schemes with different characters. This story is still the original plot. <br /> <br /> As for the queue, Disney is not so big to make values. This is the third part of Lion King (Simba's Pride is another.) It is actually an original idea that still contains the first fun. Timon and Pumbaa travel through an ideal location. After a long and far search, they will find "Hakuna Matata". Then they meet a small lion named Simba and go through many of the things the parents are going through today.
