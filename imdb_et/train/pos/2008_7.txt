Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how the sequel would work, given that they didn't use any original characters. I was quite surprised how it played. As a rule, queues are never as good as the original, with some exceptions. Although it was not a great movie, the writer wrote well that the main themes and vampires were from the first. At first, Jon Bon Jov was a setback but he turned out to be a good Slayer. I doubt someone could first point out James Wood, though ... if you don't produce Buffy! <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a good observation and I would look at it again. <Br /> <br /> Two questions left to me, but ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss kill? We think we just have to leave this imagination.
