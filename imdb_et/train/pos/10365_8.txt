This is a true story of an Australian couple accused of murder when their child is lost. Meryl Streep is great, as always, and manages to keep our interest, even though she plays a character that isn't particularly pleasant. <br /> <br /> The media madness surrounding this incident in Australia resembles Sam Sheppard's murder case in Ohio in the 1950s. These real situations show that the media can actually influence the conduct of a criminal case. I remember well the Cleveland Plain dealer who has a big title saying, "Why isn't Sam Sheppard in prison?". The prosecutor finally ended up with this relentless pressure and she was convicted. Only after years of imprisonment was he released. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell a real story, do it in an interesting way, and make the process an important point. This is one of those movies. Other good films about innocent offenses are "hurricane", "thin blue line" and "breaker". The latter is another Australian film that is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
