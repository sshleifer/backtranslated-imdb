The genius of Pure Orson Welles makes it one of the biggest films. Welles has been moved to a murder conspiracy to be created only in the fall, which he refers to the sarcastic commentary "The Great Mannequin I Am." The plot is so complicated that I still don't know if the victim knew his life was going to be lost. The shootout scene in the carnival of mirrors is one of the most amazing movies. This scene alone is worth the entrance price. This is the only time Rita Hayworth ever played a complex but incredible character. Somebody, but Welles wouldn't have had a nerve cut on her hair and painted her brass blonde. No one should leave this picture.
