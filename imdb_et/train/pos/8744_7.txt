It is a low budget movie with an unknown false and minimal location. The Philippines are replacing Thailand and no one really goes to Hong Kong. The landing of Cathay Pacific jumbo jet at the old airport makes the transition great. This film proves that you do not need to create great films for non-budget or ledger letters. It does not contain any gaffe or excess that is often stumbled by young filmmakers. Strong processing from people who know all aspects of film making and understand compromises between art and ticket office. Great work!
