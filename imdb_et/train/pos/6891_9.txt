"Once upon a time there was a charming land in France. People lived happily. Women were simple and men promised their favorite way: war, the only kings entertainment people could enjoy." This war was a seven-year war and, when it was found that soldiers were more than soldiers, recruiters were recruited to recruit. <br /> <br /> And so, Fanfan (Gerard Philipe), who was hunting for a farmer girl's girlfriend, escaped the marriage, putting himself in Regiment d'Aquitane ... but only believing in his future as predicted by the gypsy that she will win fame and happiness in her Majesty's uniforms and marry her king's daughter. Unfortunately, Adeline (Gina Lollobrigida) is not a gypsy, but a sergeant recruiting a regiment. <br /> <br /> When Fanfan pays for the recruiters, he will save his hand to rescue the ship under attack, who should be inside, but Marquise du Pompadour and ... the daughter of the king. He is now convinced that he will marry high, despite the extremely low cut blouses that Adeline bears. He will soon discover his love for Fanfan. We're in the middle of the movie Fanfan's fate, sword fighter and rogue. From floors, sword fighting on tiles, bumps, romantic getaways and more joyous attacks, you can get away if you can imagine. What Fanfan wouldn't do is unfair and enthusiastic. He is a fast-paced sword player and a fast-talking lover, but with such a naive conviction, his fate and such an optimistic nature, how can we not like him? <br /> <br /> Gerard Philipe was an iconic stage and screen actor (who Francois Truffaut is constantly on Cahiers du Cinema). He did most of his tricks. He was beautiful, sporty, graceful and charismatic. The men admired her and the women dreamed her. He was dead after 36 years, seven years after Fanfan, liver cancer. The whole of France is mourning. Gina Lollobrigida as Adeline owns. It's not these low-cut blouses. He's sharp, passionate, not quite innocent and stupid. <br /> <br /> Fanfan la Tulipe sings with endless satirical action, sharp situations and good character. Not to mention the fun, acerbic dialogue. After Adeline has taken steps to save Fanfan from hanging, she meets the king in her private clients. "Give me your pretty little hand," he says. "But my heart belongs to Fanfan," says Adeline. "Who asks your heart?" says the king, "All I ask is little joy." "I'm the right girl," says Adeline. Says the King: "You owe my respect. You love Fanfan? Then thank you. My capricorn will allow you to show the greatest proof of your love, betraying her after the loyalty you have sworn to her." Now it's smart and funny stuff. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, and the rest of the New Wave gang tended to make popular movies just for entertainment (and they personalized their attacks). Fanfan la Tulipe and its director, Christian-Jacques, were among the main goals. Obviously they stayed at Fanfan's point, which is a very funny satire about the meaninglessness of the army and war. How much better it seemed that it seemed like making movies from nervous movies that only colleagues could appreciate. Thank you very much that some of them, such as Truffaut and Chabrol, grew out of this childish body and realized that a good film is a good film, either masses like this or just cognoscenti. A smart person who enjoys watching movies can understand if the movies are well done. Those who, based on their popularity, attract film, are self-evident than those who read them, who they have never read Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard, eat your heart out. Viva Fanfan!
