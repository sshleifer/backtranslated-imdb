The complaint of such ancient films is that you can see the real moving image of life over 100 years ago. There are many people who leave the factory, all of them now dead and none of them even knew how far the invention goes, what they are going through. I was shocked that one reviewer called this movie as boring as a home video, and at least one other mistakenly identified it as the first movie ever made (this was the first movie with 16 frames per second, not the usual 46 frames) per second). <br /> <br /> Of course, everything you see is a lot of people who leave the building and go to the cinema before they go home, but this is a piece of curiosity for dozens of reasons, not the least that it was the first movie, made by Lumiere's brothers who probably had a stronger impact on cinema development than any other individual or group of individuals in history.
