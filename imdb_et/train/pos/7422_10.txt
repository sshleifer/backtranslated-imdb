Like a long-term Barbra fan, all such postings are biased. This will leave this film classic. It has errors (highlighted in other posts), but gives a glimpse of the time (at the end of the 70s) that is never there again, and it is interesting to look at the opening of the screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand fought hard to make this film himself. I don't think he was ever happy. But it gives her fans a new Barbra (with time) with LIVE song, a young fresh look, and some very hard actors. <br /> <br /> The story is tough, but exciting and keeps your interest everywhere. The "finale" of an expanded single frame is difficult for most non-Barbra fans to sit on, but it talks about the volumes for those who admire her talent. <br /> <br />
