Rated for PG-13 violence, short sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen the police story a couple of times. In my opinion, the police story is Chan's best film from the 1980s. he did it because he didn't like another policeman he was supposed to celebrate with The Protector. I haven't seen a protector so I can't compare it. Operation is not too bad and the plot is pretty good. I don't remember the plot well because I saw this movie some time ago, but what I remember is this movie that has many good activities, tricks and comedy that a good Chani movie needs. If you find a police story and you're a Chani fan then buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Duration: 106 min <br /> <br /> 9/10
