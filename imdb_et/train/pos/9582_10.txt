After growing up in Detroit, MI's shining streets and friends who drove into New York's balls, I fell into a way of living when I was a member of the house. I joined Theiev of Theieves. We adapted the same rules as most houses, but we were professional fraudsters that would increase and commit credit card fraud to get the great jewelry and clothes we wanted. I have even learned how to recognize the granting of controls and driving licenses and their cash in seventeen countries until the jealous queen invited me to a secret service and went to a federal prison. But I learned a lot of these movies from this queen and I suggest you look at it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in Detroit's houses and the criminal activity we promised. In my book, identity schemes are available for sale at Amazon dot com or Identity Schemes dot com. But trust me, it's much better than Burning Paris, because it's 2005.
