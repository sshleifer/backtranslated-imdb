Although this movie is quite old, no matter how many times I watch it, it still makes a laugh. <br /> <br /> One particular quote in the film stands out. <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) pulls out of his office and parks in a disabled place, Danny says partner partner, <br /> <br /> for disabled people. <br /> <br /> Danny answers, "I'm disabled, I'm psychotic." <br /> <br /> This is one of many movie lines you watch as many times. Johnny Dangerously stands among my top five comedy / history games. <br /> <br /> The legendary actor Peter Boyle has been cast as an extra bonus. So watch this movie and like me and many others who have watched it.
