This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film talks about how the characters Jean Paul Tremblay- (Julian) and the exhibition's chief journalist and his friends Rickie and Bubbles play it all that is a real life satirical look at caravan parks and the trash hoods mentioned. . The film tells you why Rickie and Julian start their advanced events in the world of crime. WHY and all the reasons would be spoilers, so I'm not giving real reasons behind these glorious shelters. Their friend and occasional partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and the lack of a movie doesn't affect how you see sit-com a bit. It is a trailer park with a comedy and a bright satire in the capital C, where small times and small-time ideas live, but big dreams. If you are able to watch - buy - steal this program to grab it. You're glad you did. And to my American friends --- It will crush you too. 10 out of 9. Great. TV how the TV should be.
