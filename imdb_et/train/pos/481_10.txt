This is one of the extraordinary cases where the film and the novel underlying it are both great. Perhaps it is because Gorris takes Nabokov's original ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is a view of Luzhin, which values ​​him more than Nabokov's. <br /> <br /> The only thing you don't like about the film is the influence of Valentinov on Luzhin's fate. I can't imagine that Nabokov creates a person similar to Valentinov and has so much influence on the novel's arguments.
