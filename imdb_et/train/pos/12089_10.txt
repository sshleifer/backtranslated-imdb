<br /> <br /> The film, dominated by the cheerful Barbara Steele, was seen when I was seven or eight, and created permanent images of fervent vampire men and women who were looking for blood. Steele is the icon of horror movies and beauty on the other side, and the views have walked to the dead age, which was the night of Romero night masters, uniting them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I don't see the link between this movie and HAUNTING, which is skillful but vague about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is an unintended b-movie that dares you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no such figure for HAUNTING's surplus Claire Bloom. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> No, there's no need to rebuild this movie. This is not only a product of the sixties products, but the percentage of great talented cretans in Hollywood cannot understand the terrorist attack on MACABRE. This formula is based on one overwhelming factor: good writing. Low quality classics such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe films with R. Matheson and Tourneur OUT OF THE PAST share a strong writing in common. It's easy. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put the plot in today's cinematic confusion. In addition, try Hollywood to make some initial changes to the material and stop using the apparently better product of the past.
