In recent weeks, I have been quite fond of Laurence Olivier and discovered this pearl. I have always found that the film is wonderful, where I do not keep my finger on the remote control when nudity rises on its ugly head. <br /> <br /> Lady X's divorce is charming until the last scene, and it must be a real pleasure for viewers in 1938. I just want people today to accept and love true humor instead of the terrible trash bins that now call funny. <br /> <br /> Lady's Divorce X is worth a while.
