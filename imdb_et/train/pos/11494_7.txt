Unborn is a production by Roger Corman and as such it is nasty and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it is full of preggo killings and abortion. Brooke Adams stands for Virginia. He and his wife's field go to some fictional clinic because they can't have children on their own. There they meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen, ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr Meyerling has had a great success in getting couples. (Add a joke here.) Is it because he creates some genetic killer supermutants? This is what Virginia is thinking about when it comes to treating some strange side effects and extreme moods. This is when he starts to take things into his own hands. <br /> <br /> This must get the rest of the details somewhere else, because if I told you all of those goodies, you would have mistakenly put yourself in the Netflix queue too soon. It's a bit slow moving for a while, but when the last third has grown up, all systems are running! Highly recommended by me for your sleep PC violence strengths. 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars.
