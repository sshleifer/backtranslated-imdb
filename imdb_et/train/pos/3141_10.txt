Let's face it: The last season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I've ever enjoyed (mostly I've never found a dry spell for the whole season). But if you show this show in the last season, this is of course so low. This is a completely unfair assessment - because "this 70's exhibition" was a wonderful and fun sitcom of the past era and how the people who lived there were not as different as we are here today. <br /> <br /> Well ... ignoring the 8th season. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace stars like Eric Forman, a teenage horny geek with a permanent love of Donnas (Laura Prepon), a feminist girl next door. Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) play fantastic performances (almost) in every episode. The best is probably Fez, a foreign exchange student who is as spiritual as they can. What is the country? Try to figure it out! For another aspect of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. The group, like Kitty, is both terrifying and sweet, as Mrs Brady meets Marie Barone, while Smith's Red exists mainly to intimidate pogies from everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well with each other as Donna's parents, a chauvinist but a pleasant Bob and a breathless Midge. Tommy Chong has an occasional leo, a stoner who is acting as a Hyde father. <br /> <br /> In addition to anachronistic errors that appear quite often, and sometimes overdue (and this unfortunate season), the "70s" is a terrible exhibition of astonishing writing, on-the-spot directions, and pulsating emotions through every episode. They're all right.
