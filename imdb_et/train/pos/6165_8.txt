Yes, some of the plots are a little tricky to track, and Bill has a tendency to become violent, but in fact it's an amazing show that I don't want to miss. Most episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the actor is pretty good even though I leave Roberta Taylor as inspector for Gina Gold and Todd Carty Gabriel Kent. I admit that I prefer older episodes for newer episodes, and it's a bit shameful that the program is now after the lakeside, because I found it easier to see if it was at 8:00. However, why I like Bill is because not only is it appealing, but the end of the cliffhanger makes the next episode impossible. It is true that this is more melodramatic than it was, but I like this program like a program that doesn't try to take it too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
