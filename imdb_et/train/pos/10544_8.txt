Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and sophisticated ideas I've ever seen when talking about movies. They had only one landscape, a number of actors and a plot. So what made it so special was all the effective direction, the great dialogues and the odd condition that the characters had to deal with the maze like rats. His second film, "Cypher" (2002), was all about this story, but it was not as good as "Cube", but here are the characters like the rats again. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and gets Vincenzo back to his "cube days" by re-locking characters into a very different room where there is no time to play with the players in the experiential rats. But instead of thriller, there was sci-fi (even some billboards and trailers are wrong), "Nothing" is an open and easy comedy that can definitely be called a modern satire about our society and also the intolerant world we live in. Vicenzo amazes us again with a great idea so small. With 2 actresses and a dazzling white scenario, it's all you have the most time and you don't need more. Although "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" confusing, "Nothing" is the opposite, but at the same time desperate. <br /> <br /> This movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, the movie sometimes fails, but its main idea means a lot and compensates for all the mistakes. There is nothing more to say about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience I've had in the movies "Cube".
