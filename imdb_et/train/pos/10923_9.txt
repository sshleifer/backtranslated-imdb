This movie is really good. A plot that works like a puzzle forces the viewer to think and think what happens next. This trick brings many surprises and unexpectedly makes the viewer solve the riddle. Fighting scenes is very good. There are many different fighting styles (though one of the styles was a bit unrealistic for me, but it's just my opinion) and it's an exciting show. The only thing that can be irritating is the actors. A little too feminine (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good in kung-fu films, especially in the 70's and 80's, so "Five Venom" (or other versions of it) is a great choice.
