Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best pictures from ... well ... for a long time. It includes one of the most fun scenes I've seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but all great movies with some funny scenes. The best scene is where Jim is confused by the anchor's voice. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8/10
