First of all, it's really my favorite movie. I don't have to give anyone a description because every ** hole does it. I'm literally obsessed with this virtually bloodless, cheesy, flat effect with a ", boom-stick show", poorly edited, 80's metal horror masterpiece. The director (I heard) had hoped that it would cost a costume so that he could make a sequel and had a FREDDY / JASON type deal. Damn, I wish it had gone that way! Beating the sound track. Action is good. and all the hard fans out there can email and chat for a while. Midgetorgy .... I find YAHOO.
