I first saw the version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. I expected the movie to be seen when it was advertised, and it was more than I expected. I have now bought a DVD and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's a wonderful life," I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" to be one of the best films made. George C. Scott is great and surrounded by a great leader led by Roger Rees! Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has an artistic talent and ability to act to play a role and to keep his character unique. How can someone remember both Patton and Scrooge? Scott does it easily. The direction is marvelous with fine sets, costumes and music that give the film a special feeling of time, place and timing. You just love this movie and put it in your favorites to watch the holiday.
