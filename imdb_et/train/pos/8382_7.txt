If you like mech war games, it's pretty good. Part of it is cheap, but the fight against robots is worth it. I've been enjoying the mechanical warfare for some time and it's a pretty much the only movie I've ever seen, close to the feeling of being one of those huge mechs. If you like families, I like the Mech Warrior Three and four, and if you have Xbox and $ 350 for spare parts. The film is worth at least once. There really are some more movies on the same subject. Less repairs and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
