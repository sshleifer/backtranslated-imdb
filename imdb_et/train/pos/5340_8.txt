Clara Lago is a great film-making character, mainly a film about a Spanish and American girl who moves to Spain with her mother during the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that Mom is going to die home and she is with her grandfather. He also makes many friends and experiences in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is initially unpleasant when they go. The film strikes beautifully, softly painted. Carol wants his father who is a pilot in war, and you may feel that the love sher is for him. Although the war itself is in the back of this film, it surrounds the character's life. I think you like it. See this especially for Clara Lago, who is doing a great job at Carolina. He's definitely one to watch.
