I've seen hundreds of silent movies. Some are always classics (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them is my favorite movie (it may not be the best - but favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at it from IMDb, I noticed that I was laughing right now because the movie was so cute and well done. Marion Davies proved with this film that he had a really great talent and that it was not JUST William Randolph Hearst's mistress. <br /> <br /> The story includes Georgia's smile on Hollywood, assuming he is a fast star! His experience and the interesting lights of the stars of the era make it a true affection for movie fans and must-have!
