After being monitored for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> Not disappointing because I am one of those who die of heavy SMAP fans who have to see all of their work and finally I had to see a so-called hot Goro movie. But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make such a movie. In my honorable self now I'm sure he's making this movie. Nevertheless, they found the perfect person embarrassed, troubled, and half-depressed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Man, I still can't believe he did this movie ... I have to cover my eyes in many parts he doesn't think he really made such a movie .... hahahaha .... <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I watched it. Thank goodness, he's grown up.
