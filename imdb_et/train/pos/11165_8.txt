Four words refer to why this film was made - "He made him wrong". The great commercial success of the Mae West vehicle convinced the studio brass that Gay '90s melodrama was a viable proposition. Here you will be rewarded for a fast moving and well-written romp that will purposefully direct your star personalities. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a little harder to take, but this is Fay Wray, who steals the movie with her commercial girl. With a strong director - as Walsh proves himself - Wray can carry a lot of punch and is completely believable as a subject of affection for Raft and Beery. <br /> <br /> A lot of atmosphere, beautifully designed, it's a forgotten film that deserves to be revived.
