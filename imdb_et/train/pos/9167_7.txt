This is, in my opinion, much better than any of the 1990 versions, but it is still not so good. It seems to have been dated, probably because it is, but it looks good compared to the other BBC's 1980s, like Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this customization makes it much better to customize a book than in each of the twenties and St. John Rivers is at least covered, though not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good than Rochester, but the actor playing Jane is too old. It is certainly possible to adjust this length to a TV that has more than a tennis player.
