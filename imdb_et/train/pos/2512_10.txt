Being a big fan of Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I found out that they made the movie together and did it for their life's mission. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was ready to be brave, but not really for that performance, but I'm happy to say that both of them managed to keep me fascinated and believe that this story will continue. The child of the moon has just the right amount of humor, action, romance, and serious moments of heart. I can't say I'm ever more crazy about the movie and the few moments I offer are admirable, surely proving their skills as actors. Fighting scenes are absolutely stunning and while there are a few moments of uncertainty in the beginning, you will be quick to get a movie and begin to tie characters. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone, especially those who are Gackti and Hyde fans.
