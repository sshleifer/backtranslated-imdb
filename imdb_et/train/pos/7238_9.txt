Little SPOILERS warning !!! Good movie ... Very good movie. And I'm surprised to say that myself because I am not a big vampire fan and director named Deran Seraphian sound usually means bad news. Most of his films are below average activity, such as Death Warrant and Gunmen. It was one of his first films and maybe he would have to continue instead of making a fear film. This movie pulled me very much. Good achievement, the lack of famous actors or a big budget. This is the story that keeps you focused. The fans of the original Dracula were especially pleased. Sarafian illuminates the second aspect of the famous Bram Stoker story and remains fairly loyal and true. It explains the life of Count Roemen Drakula and how he frightened the Turkish army by pushing the corpses in front of his castle. Of course, this reality and the "real story" will stop. Bram Stoker invented blood drinking and things. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the list (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the US and seduces a ton of women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give her that. In general, the good functioning of unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy more sick horror fans and an interesting story. This movie is really unknown and it was hidden in my local video in the dark shelf. But be sure to clean the dust on top of the cover and put it in a videotape. Heck, this is a lot better than Nicole Kidman's film with the same title. These two films have nothing in common, but I blame this movie for stealing from that attention. Look at this ... my humble opinion of dying = 8.5 / 10
