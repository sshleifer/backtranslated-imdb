I have to admit that the only reason I bought this movie was that I am a big fan of Gackt and * a great * Hyde fan. I had been waiting for a good movie with many shots that we say we are fond of a feminine eye, but a little cheesy story. I mean, the synopsis sounded like that. And now that I've just finished this - I feel the need to talk to the world about my shine! Hyde and Gackt both gave heartfelt performances and my eyes are still hot when the crying lasts for the last half of the movie. You made the story and you finally feel for the characters. The element of vampire I love, but which is very easy to exaggerate or destroy the film, wisely mixes with the scene to make it something exotic, normal to this setting, not a story of accidental unnecessary addition. For the first time, I put it on ten 10 ... and then I went back and tried to think about why I didn't give him the last point. Nothing came. That's ten out of ten. After all - I am not much of a criticism - the fact that I am bothered to write in some way a review of whether I really hate a movie or love it. You can tell me where I am with Moon Child.
