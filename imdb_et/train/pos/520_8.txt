My only small-scale film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN is that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is on the test track in the last twenty minutes. And the trial itself, the IMO, is the least interesting part of this interesting fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are perfectly cast as young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY, which provides more viable and reliable performance. The French accent, MARIUS GORING, is a joy (he even gets a note about Technicolor) as a heavenly messenger who was sent back to Niven when his war-time death goes unannounced. Goring has some of the most common features and they offer them nicely. <br /> <br /> Tonight for the first time in TCM tonight, this is, in my opinion, the ultimate example of what a wonderful 1946 film was. Technicolor's photography, which is somewhat weak and not tough, is great and the way in which it shifts to black and white in the celestial sequences is done with great imagination and efficiency. <br /> <br /> Opening is what really draws the viewer into fantasy aspects - and Niven's tense speech to Hunter, when his plane is crashing on the ground, unexpectedly brings a memorable romantic encounter. Really wonderful movie from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
