My Take: uses your familiar plot with fine performances and some real excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. The innocent man has been designed as a plot to kill the President of the United States, the first traitor to the US secret service. When the secret service of his companions acts, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course we know his innocent and the real culprit is right around the corner, but SENTINEL is still happy. At a time when thrillers have been reduced to being too ridiculous and too busy in the sequence of activities, THE SENTINEL is a good lick-back for all those thrillers of old-fashioned political crimes. A well-known plot and a terrific performance will raise the well-known plot. to murder the president. Former colleagues in the secret service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) continue to Harrison when he tries to find out who is behind a possible murder and a secret detective. This brings with it many pursuing scenes that, surprisingly (and fortunately), are never unbelievable. The scenario also offers a suburb that includes Garrison, who has an affair with the first woman (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, it wasn't unnecessary because most of the sub-blocks are for such movies. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.), who is capable of watching the film. While many have criticized it for being "supposed to be a TV movie," I don't have to agree. Agreed, this is not a perfect movie, and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigues, such as the FUTURE, or the episode of the TV series 24 (which is similar to style and star Sutherland), but even so, this film takes its the ground for serious heights and does not even leave smaller details. The performances are terrible (with a top-notch voice, it must even be a numbered script. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, I give it *** 1/2, not perfect, but not far from it. > <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
