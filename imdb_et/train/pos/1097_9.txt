I stopped saying "Mr. Blandings is building his dream house" because the aspect that puts us somewhat in the 21st century is the fact that the black person is a faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit). But besides that, the movie is hoot. This flick has a central class of New York couple Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) who are trying to build a house in Connecticut that this flick has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is his usual sliding himself, while Loy is not quite a woman. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs like Bill Cole, Jimi and Muriel's lawyer, who seem to have more plans than he does. As for the house itself ... during most of the film, you probably feel ambiguous about whether you want to live there. Builders, contractors and others also give a fair share of their laughter. <br /> <br /> All in all, comedy is classic. Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Shary Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
