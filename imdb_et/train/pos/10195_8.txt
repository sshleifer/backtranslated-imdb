Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who are often better than their own and almost always down. He has had many films, either heavy or heroic, and has a strong and strong presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can supply material that sounds ridiculous and goes out of the other actor and is so great. He seems to mean what he says, no matter how clich√©, obvious or stupid, that puts him on Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. That's how WALKING TALL TRILOGY worked so well and the same magic is the FINAL RIGHT. It was a remarkable hit in theater and video in the 1980s, and it has become much more obsolete than many of the best known songs in the era. Making Texas from Europe has a real timeless quality that will not leave you behind the screen. Frankly, I have always enjoyed Greydon Clark's films, which are just as casual as the Clint Eastwood of the 1970s, and that is one of his best. FINAL LAW is one of the gems lost in the late eighties that resemble MAN ON FIRE with its true delicate and violence. I think if they prepare it again with Rock, a whole new audience will love it as much as I do.
