Has the movie ever been more charming than this? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the group of participants seems to really interact and affect each other's lives. The focus is on the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and are not confronted, but who are anonymously connecting pen-pals. But there are also supportive signs and unlike many romantic comedies (including "You have received a letter", the recent "Shop" update) they are not limited to just two support and support for their needs. Everyone gets complicated part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich chocolate. One of the most warm-hearted scenes in film history occurs when almost tragic Frank Morgan is looking for a random and humble person with a Christmas meal. Must See! **** end ****
