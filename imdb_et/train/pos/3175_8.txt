It's nice how this movie pulls you along. I had an honest laugh. Don't make sure it's low on budget because it works for me. Frankly, my wife didn't really go the same way but preferred another type of film. He admitted, however, that it was very creative and well-assembled and probably all on the shoe string. Those characters who are living are strange and worrying, give me something to associate with their world. Just go on and watch who you are. Dreams are what you do about them. Watching this movie for the second and third time, I realized that some hidden moments have passed to me. What can I say, I like it complicated. Anyway it liked it. Hope to see more.
