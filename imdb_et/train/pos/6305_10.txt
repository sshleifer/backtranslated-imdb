Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. Great ensemble cast, close editing and great direction. A capric film that hasn't been beaten in traditional tricks. <br /> <br /> This movie can't be broken much. The tagline says all - 5 men. 1 Safe. There is no brain. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell are amazing. George Clooney must be congratulated for making this pearl. <br /> <br />
