This film is like the 1950s Ettore Scola Brutti sporchi e cattivist. Less sex and less realism, but a story of great humanism and warmth. I wouldn't call it a new realistic picture. It is a very sentimental and fairly fairy tale and probably should be considered a comedy, although it deals with serious issues (like Chaplin or 1930 comedy). A typical italian though, very emotional and hard to resist, except for a stone cold person. Sentimentality is a backlog, although this picture was not a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or Bicycle Thief. But it is a loving and fun comedy with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
