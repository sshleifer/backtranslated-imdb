In this little movie, we have some great characters, but a very small plot. It's nice to watch, because Singleton is doing an excellent job of presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This makes the viewer forget the non-existent reality that this film is supposed to offer. In fact, here we have all possible clich√©s and stereotypes that are higher than soap in relation to cellulose. Definitely not a deep film (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college film.
