I had the privilege of seeing this movie at the Rotterdam National Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200,000 budget movie for Dad and his two sons. The father has a traditional sauna in a traditional Chinese village where local, mostly older men come to relax and bathe. Father is sons: "slowed" son, who lives with him and the son who lives in a great modern city and who has to visit him. This boy looks like a strange and annoying traditional village, a sauna and his "slowed" brother, but it changes the film. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem funny or clich√©, it is not so. With really great performances, especially with the father and the "slowed" son (sorry, I don't know their names) and the great story that the film was touching and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> You have the opportunity to see this movie. This is a great alternative to the mainstream of Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
