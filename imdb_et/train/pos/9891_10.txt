For the first time, I rented this movie several years ago and it was completely astonished. Recently, I felt the strange need to review some of the ways I have enjoyed enormously during my life and decided to give "Erendira" another look. And I'm glad I did because soon I discovered that even the passage of time hasn't shrunk this film. <br /> <br /> The story speaks to a teenage girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in a sense she is similar to Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burns her grandmother's mansion, after which Irene Papase's pretty grandmother's grandmother forces the girl to live prostitution compensation for damage. <br /> <br /> Watching is instantly exciting and convincing - even though it is the main point of prostitution, it is tastefully void of free, free sexual content. The story revolves more on the interactions between the girl and the grandmother and on the various other colorful characters they encounter with their place of residence - which is, in fact, the tough and tumble of the countryside in Mexico. > <br /> The film is very atmospheric, arrestingly mysterious and of decisive dream quality. Sometimes it's strange, but not with David Lynch. It is also worth noting that the film is very allegoric in nature, read the comments of previous viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Often you hear the individual accordions, quiet and melancholic sounds in the background, just adding the right musical accents to bring out the Mexican device . Rural cinematography, many of which are located in the desert, is quite excellent. <br /> <br /> The film is moving at a nice pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after every scene I felt I had to rewind and play back, just because it makes you want to do it. However, it is really convincing. <br /> <br /> Hopefully you will see the movie in the Spanish version, with subtitles. I learned Spanish both at high school and college, and I was happy to understand much of the dialogue. Por ejemplo: "El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba." ("The world is not as big as I thought" - that is a small world.) <br /> <br /> This film reminds me in some way of stumbling a dusty old bottle of old-fashioned wine that is huge after drinking, but you remain sad when you realize that such bottles are no longer.
