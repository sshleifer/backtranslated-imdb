We have to remember that in the 50s the slate was virtually empty for films. Hollywood was switching from patriotic war films, daggers, two reels, and so on. We had a Blackboard Jungle, Waterfront and so on. Some people think it was an improvement. I do not. Who was the mogul who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertaining than some kind of remote therapy. <br /> <br /> It's pip. This is about three sisters who are trying to control the legacy of their dead father. One of them, perhaps the only one who is worthy of redemption, will increase the company's pilot assistance to help him keep the rest of the family at night. He is at the beginning for his bucks, but eventually falls for him. Meanwhile, the rest of the families are sketching romance. The results are predictable. You get everything in this movie. Sexual tension between nurses. Slightly subtle masochism. Hereditary insanity - how it is. We will never be able to meet parents, but they must really be screwed. One or two actors sounded vaguely familiar. Working is so bad that it's hard to believe. It appeared under the umbrella of American Artists under the name of Bel-Air Productions. It was fired in LA and its surroundings mainly at night and probably without permission. The end was so weird that I thought it was a joke. It would have run out of money and the manufacturer decided to wrap it in the middle. <br /> <br /> I can't explain it - not even to me - but I gave it to the pile trash 8/10. I know the term "It's so bad that it's good", but I don't think I ever happened to this phenomenon. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell," but it certainly fits. You could try it if you love movies that seem to have been made in someone's basement.
