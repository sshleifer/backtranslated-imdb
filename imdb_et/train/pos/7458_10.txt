This game is a bomb and it is the 007 game and it should be the biggest hit. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then came Nightfire and it was better, but now it's James Bond's new game. This time this is the third person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the game graphics are out of this house. She even has all the great actors and actors in this game like Pierce Bronsan like James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench as M (forgive me all if I miss it). This game would be your biggest James Bond game. <br /> <br /> I will give this to 10/10
