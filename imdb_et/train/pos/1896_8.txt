Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. My good friend, who worked on the film extra and helped with horses during a recently dead stable scene. If you look quickly, you'll see Frank Graham in the background of a restaurant scene while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in the conversation. Frank was a horse-rider and everyone who knew him missed. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I knew the real life of Arthur Bach. He wasn't quite as prosperous as Arthur, but spent 47 years as a boy in his life. His parents checked their wallets strongly, but his rent and utilities were paid in the basement of Greenwich Village. He spent a lot of time getting his own feelings against different spirits and the public's perspective, as Dudley Moore does. The miracle with Arthur is why nobody worries about wealth. But that's the other side of the equation. My friend was the most charming person you knew. In fact, it was almost forcing to be charming. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish any kind of relationship with the seller. He spent his life as a perfect party guest. This is the concept of a waste facility that was commonly used in the 19th century. <br /> <br /> And that's a waste of Dudley Moore. Unlike my friend Moore, John Gielgud cleaned up after him. It's a full-time job, as we see in Arthur. My friend did not find Liza Minnell, the man Liza Minnelli, because she was gay. Still depicting Moore from Arthur Bach is deadly accurate for me and so real. <br /> <br /> Arthur, the 20th-century debris, is forced to marry another trust fund child, Jill Eikenberry. Because she's not working for a livelihood, the risk of a break is quite real for her. He has only his own Mr Hobson, played by John Gielgud and driver Bitterman, whom Ted Post played to point out his troubles. We should all have such troubles. <br /> <br /> In his nearly a century of life, John Gielgud certainly did a better job than in Arthur's movie and actually Gielgud is known for his productions. Yet the 1981 Oscar was a year of mood. The Academy awarded Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscar for the Golden Pond and Gielgud for the best supporting actor for life-long work. This man was amazing, still on his ship almost to the end. <br /> <br /> So, for Frank Graham, who worked in the film and Jackie Weiss, the real real life of Arthur, I dedicate this review.
