"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers ever made. His relationship with sex and violence make it a film for adults. Brian De Palma proves once again why no other director can tell the story with the camera. He controls many scenes without dialogue and talks a lot about his story, strictly using his visual images and Pino Donnagio's excellent score. The film filmed in Panavision must be visible on the widescreen because De Palma uses the width of his film to tell his story. Cropped, "Dressed To Kill" is hardly the same movie. Solid performances of their cast, excellent direction, and perhaps the best movie spots ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" a must see.
