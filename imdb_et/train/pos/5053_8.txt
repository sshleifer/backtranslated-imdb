Okay, I admit that casting a movie is really strange - some of it is due to the plot, but I still had some problems believing Pierce Brosnan was playing this leadership (though he did really good work). <br /> <br /> It is based on a true story of English who went to live with Canadian Indians at the beginning of the 20th century. He claimed he was mixed with blood in India. In fact, he was so successful and well thought that people came everywhere to hear his lectures and take his trekking tracks - though he was not mixed blood in India and all his knowledge comes from books or fake! The film focuses on what and what happened to the hoax. <br /> <br /> Action and settings were great and I really liked the movie (when I stopped believing in Brosnan). It was not widespread - probably because it was a pretty brain - not a Bond film or a romance - but a very strange movie about a remarkable man.
