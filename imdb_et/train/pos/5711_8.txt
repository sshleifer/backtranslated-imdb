In Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the greatest directors and great pioneers, created a light comedy pearl that is a breakthrough and technically brilliant film that has clearly influenced the following filmmakers such as Marx Brothers, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian. A plot, a spiritual artist who wins a big lottery jackpot, but has to look for a lost ticket all over the city, is basically just a device that supports many wonderful funny comic scenes set by the director's imagination. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things about this movie is that although it is set in the middle of Paris and contains something that is not really impossible, it will achieve a stable and inclusive fairy-tale / fantasy atmosphere where it seems quite natural to people sing as much as they speak, or that the lurking jacket beats football as a game. Another memorable element is that Le Million contains what may be more fun in the movie (O that this blonde-braided soprano!) I laugh if! Ha.) Also joy is casting: Clair has brought together an astonishing group, dramatically different character actors, each of which illustrates the "fateful" type of fatal satirical French, so that the film seems like a set of Daumier's prints. <br /> <br /> Fun takes some time to roll, and I found that these characters are not as emotionally tied as they can even with a mild comedy (as they are in many Lubitsch films, for example). rating. However, these small horrors should not distract from the enthusiastic suggestion. <br /> <br /> Should you see it? About me. It is highly recommended whether you want classic and influential cinema work or just fun comedy.
