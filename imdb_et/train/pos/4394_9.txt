So the neighbor killed the neighbor. Reminds me of Iraq. When I looked at the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) Behind the Horse, I realized why burning this red white and blue piece wouldn't distract me as much as our destruction / indifference to the bill of rights. I'm south and I need to have a historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watching the character of Tobey McGuire learns to respect the dignity of the former slave when he looks at the black and German scalp (his ethnic background)) played in the poker game ..... was interesting. Many twist this movie. A wife forced to her husband shows both lust and strong will, the qualities we are not used to seeing in "respectable Victorian southern bells". some understanding of why my cousin, Copeland Horse-thieving Gang, Inc., the head of Mississippi, was hung up by that time. Homeless men's bands traveled to the countryside, armed. We remind you of Iraq? And how similar are we under the facade of religion and ethnic background? And why the southern regions are fighting for STILL's current civil war. <br /> <br /> Too bad we can't use the same knowledge to handle the country we just invaded and occupied, forcing civil war everywhere. It is Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, and fortunately has the oil to sit on. The wild eyes in Missouri kill Lawrence, Kansas as easily as the rebels with whom we are fighting, without success. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly was the father's respect for the Yankees who moved to Lawrence and set up the school "even before the church was erected. And for that reason they win." Ah ????? I was taught in Birmingham, Alis and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer ... that's why they won. Of course they also had God on their side of LITERALL. As you can see here, the liberated slave shows that he is freeing his mother, which is sold as a slave in Texas. God, what the terrible legacy gave us. <br /> <br /> Getting pretty good, lots of blood and soldiers when the warriors are flying in a fun way (but they haven't heard about the rebels that resemble football games in Alabama). You will also get a real sense of how silly the war was, because bushwackers and jayhawkers will gather their power for another attack. They have lost sight of why they are fighting, and so are we. Just more pointless killing. <br /> <br /> You are also aware that children who come home from Iraq when the bushwacker (ahh, what meanings) are closed to their hands, try to save it, then it is amputated and then dies. So much suffering for such a fool. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic. Now I have to go back to the DVD and get production notes, one of my favorite films. I suspect that this movie has been written by Gore Vidal because the language spoken is one that you would associate with it when you knew history. Dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. Not your usual blood and guts, any way. You see wounded but still active soldiers who are still fighting because they have nothing else to do. You can see the southern radiators who live from the ground stealing indiscriminately. At the same time, you have seen a battle stop at first so that women can evacuate the dangers. When I read the growing number of women and children dying in Iraq, I mean, "Where did we lose our sense of honor as a nation?" I've forgotten why I was looking for this movie and bought it in 20 years, but some books got it. Good reason. Tobey at her best, before Spideyman. Buy a DVD or rent it. And tell me why others praise it, not just the liberals cest moi.
