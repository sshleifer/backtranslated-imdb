I appreciated photography, textures, colors, and often different lighting from one commentary. What I lacked was a unified story. I found it often isolated, poorly edited, and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Chances and subtitles may not have helped. I appreciate all the movies that run away from the Hollywood mold, but it was disappointing. Miss Gillain was luminous and the performances were fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If anyone would like to see another movie with its similarity, try Kate Winslet's "Hideous Kinky".
