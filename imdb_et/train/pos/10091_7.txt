I first watched "Elephant Walk" for about 30 years and hit a similar story with "Rebeccale". As others have said, you have a sweet young thing with a charming and whispering lord of the manor, which is consecrated by the feet, to find your marriage that is threatened by a deeply flawed relative. You have a stumbling and abandoning servant, a crisis that binds the pair or tears them irreversibly leaving, which is surprised by the abundant destruction of the rich farm. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the Elephant Walk is owed. the creepy jungle atmosphere of The Letter, Bette Davis's Triangle of Love, placed on a rubber plantation in Singapore rather than a plant in Sri Lanka. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars and IMDb readers are not much cooler, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never saw love, and Peter Finch does a trustworthy job as a fundamentally good person who can't let his glorious father influence. Dana Andrews - favorite "Laura" and "Our Best Year of Life" - is wasted as Elizabeth's disappointed admirer. The real star is a bungalow, one of the most beautiful decorations in the history of the film.
