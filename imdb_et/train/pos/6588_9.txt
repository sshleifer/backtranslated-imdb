After reviewing several episodes of this series, I have come to the conclusion that television producers are not entirely original. Here is an old fancy standby mode that is brilliantly packaged in the form of a truly original concept - and still can only - do this job. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good! Men's actors are reasonably proficient in their professions. Most symbols are well drawn, the hero and his more than a pleasant side-kick. And most of the episodes are so tasty. What could be wrong? How would the female characters and the cosmetically perfect actors chosen to portray them. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers emphasize the depiction of female characters in this - almost good series - in a way that makes the final product the wrongly placed cheerleader. Why, I ask, why? <br /> <br /> Episodes all fall when a female guest star or repetitive character appears on the screen. These actors are completely unbelievable in their roles and you don't really have to see them to be able to perform their function. A blind person could say. Listen to them to talk. They give their dialogue to the high school with all 16-year-old dramas and effects. Who would believe that these women are doctors, senators, business leaders and doctors? to choose - every time? And, of course, this series suffers. Damage!
