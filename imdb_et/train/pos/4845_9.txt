Hi Playmates. I recently watched this movie for the first time and this is also my first experience with Arthur Askey, I have to admit that this movie has impressed me. As a fan of black and white films, this film is for pimlico, lavender mobile, and Tommy Trinder (who is probably a distant relative), this film highlighted good old-fashioned British humor. I note that there are some who criticized Askey's performance, but I think this time experiment is a beautiful example of making forties comics and adding something to the picture, creating more than just stereotypes that are just stereotypes that seem to both films are now dominant.If you get this movie, I would recommend that you keep it, shame those movies no longer appear on Sunday afternoon. I am also glad that I had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by Arnold Ridley (father of Godfrey's private sector). Thank you
