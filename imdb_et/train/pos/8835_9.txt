A sharp political comment as an age story is what this film is about. It is annoying that it works effectively on both levels. It shouldn't be, but it does. The story of four boys and a girl who grew up in Communist Belgrade in 1953 is warmer. This is what gentlemen refer to the classic cinema. Obviously, in 1953, the dictatorial and fascist environment in which Communist society is often depicted is not so harsh in Belgrade. You can listen to rock and role music, one of the songs played is the title of the song "Hey Babu Riba". However, jeans cannot be bought or certain drugs that are illegal. Unlike the criticism of communist society, this film shows how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as four. A girl with an exile mother in Italy and waiting for her mother and her passport to travel with her, a piano that has been removed from a common sonship, suddenly giving home and quarter to her new companions because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time listening to the music and it is clear that they despise the fascism created by communism when they deal with a fist charlatan with Stalin's tattooed hands. All of these lead to the adoption and remembrance of later measures, when the time goes off, as this film appeared in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A great movie worth seeing over and over again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but it is also a friend."
