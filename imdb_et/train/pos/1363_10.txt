Excellent 90's! Parker Posey is the story of Manhattan's nightlife that requires so much money. Posey delivers amazing results as a librarian and a nightcrawler. It's a good, light movie on Saturday night before leaving. Soundtrack stones, equipment is out of this world, the script is funny and the actors are doing a good job. Redemption Value: If you are trying, you can make this world, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is such a perfect actor: young, fabulous and broke. (You have to watch the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you look at Party Girl, you will definitely have a good time. Enjoy!
