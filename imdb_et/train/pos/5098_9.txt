Even long-term Shirley fans can be surprised "now and forever". The film was filmed at Paramount Studio? not Shirley's parent company, Twentieth Century Fox? In 1934, before Fox manufacturer Darryl Zanuck had successfully improved Shirley's formula (cute songs, cold hearts to melt him, young couples to play him on Amor, happy endings). So "now and forever" falls into the Shirley vehicle category without the standard Shirley story. This is an awkward position for every movie, but this impressive talented cast makes it work. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star like a fun-loving, irresponsible artist Jerry and Toni Day. The only thing this is dedicated to, but the dysfunctional duo seems more angry than being together is separate from each other. If they suddenly land in Jerry's young daughter Penny (Shirley's Temple) in custody, is Toni? and not Penny, as many believe? who persuades Jerry to give up his criminal career. But Jerry slides behind his desk and desperately wants to prove that he can foresee his new family, soon returning to theft and dishonesty. In the usual Shirley device, Penny tries to melt the creamy Felix Evans, who is one of Jerry's consents, but his attempt fails because Evans shows himself to be an artist, and he sends Jerry to help him steal jewels. The following drama, bomb attack, death and sadness make this movie very unusual for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, dancing and only one song sequence (lovely number "The World Has Life"). <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean that Shirley fans should avoid "now and forever." Rather, this traditional Shirley story is more interesting and memorable than many of his other films. But be careful: you should avoid the painted version of this movie and watch it in black and white if you can. The color is bright, harsh and unreal, and in many scenes, Shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blonde. Yikes!
