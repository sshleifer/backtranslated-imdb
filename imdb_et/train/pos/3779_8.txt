I got the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get to another store when I saw it in the shop. It was (I think) as funny as the first, but much more powerful story. It was funny how they had their own personal hell and how they had to die. The funny thing was that they played him in foolish little games like a hint. The only thing I changed is the station and the death that is in the band, but not that it was great.
