Picture Bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it was supposed to be like the Japanese men who were brought to Hawaii in the early 19th century to work as a cane. Most had to plan to return to their home country, but few could ever do it. Equally depicted, the fate of Japanese women, some young as fifteen or sixteen, was sent as a promise to men that they knew only through photographs that were often 10 or 15 years old, or some other younger man. They also did a little hard time in the field, fought against the home government and maintained their dignity. it is ultimately an inspiring and exhilarating story of moral and cultural survival. The bride of the picture is the greatness and admiration of the sweeping nature and landscape that captures the charming beauty and violent harshness of colonial Hawaii. This is an emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarding film.
