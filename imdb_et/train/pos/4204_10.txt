and anyone who watches this movie agrees. This film was aimed at the days when the real significance of the plot, character's credibility and theme was. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter are stealing their attention. Ritter is a top-notch Moe who survives in the NY Bowery section, working close to the NYC police stool. <br /> <br /> The only other film I saw in Peters is "Niagara," and she really proves her ability to act here, with Brooklyn's accent. Widmark is a threatening threat as a hero who has to look at what's right, despite his need for cash. <br /> <br /> Photography is brilliant. Neon, a subway station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing!) The dock where Widmark lives by. The city where "Lightning Louie" is in Chinatown is excellently used; it deals with the city's many flavors and appetites; The political atmosphere of the time is a haunting background. 10/10.
