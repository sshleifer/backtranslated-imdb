Walt Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former juvenile leavers who made one of the most amazing sports history returns, ending almost ten-year retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999. 35. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a brief summary of Morris's childhood, which included several relocations - his father was a military. And even if his family lived in a good football game in Texas, Morris's passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> The childhood segment then jumps to adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) for about 23 years. now is the Big Lake High School Baseball Trainer and Chemistry Teacher (in real life it was Reagan County High School, Big Lake, Texas). It is said that he was trying to pursue a career as a baseball player, but it didn't work. <br /> <br /> The Morris team is fighting and reading them as they give up dreams. They turn the table to him, telling him he should try the Major League team. On several occasions when he brings them to practice, they express the astonishment at the speed he throws. Morris seems to be convincing, but agrees to deal with his players, where they win the district when he tries the Major League team. <br /> <br /> Great Lake Wins District and Ends Transaction Morris Participates in Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Phenomenally he throws 98 miles per hour - faster than he did during his minor league career and at a great speed even for the Major League jug. After trying another team, Morris is offered a contract with Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This leaves him with a difficult decision - stay in your comfortable life or continue your big league dream by passing too much of a minor to make some money and spend a month away from home. And the decision is even more amazing than during his first small race, because he now has a woman and three children. <br /> <br /> The Morris badges with devil rushes start at AA level and move up quickly to AAA level, one level below the Major League baseball. But when the season falls, the likelihood that he will be "invited" to grow will increase. <br /> <br /> Mostly I love this movie. There are a lot of great performances and pleasant signs and it's easy to find yourself in Morris. The film also does a great job of professional baseball at the level of both big and small leagues. And most importantly, it teaches a timeless message about keeping your dreams even when they seem far and almost impossible. <br /> <br /> However, the film has some bugs. Although it is generally accurate, it exaggerates and even prepares some things. See some examples at http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html. In addition, except for one scene where he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris's Christian faith. But given Disney's left-wing zeal, it is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Probably many exaggerations / preparations were made to make the story more dramatic. But a 20-minute documentary about Morris, which is on DVD, contains some information that makes her story more dramatic, but has been omitted from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth to his family in Texas when he was 12 years old, Morris returned 14 times. And his initial small league career ended after four operations, through which he lost half of his left (pitch) shoulder muscles, making the 98-meter hour even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> The story of Jim Morris, it's good not only to watch The Rookie, but also to watch a DVD documentary, look at the above-mentioned link to the film's inaccuracies and probably read Morris's biography, titled "The Rookie". I haven't read the book, but I hope one of those days. <br /> <br /> In general, The Rookie is a very good image of a wonderful story and a powerful testimony to the power of dreams and the triumph of a common person. 8/10
