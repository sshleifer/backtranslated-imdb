I watched this movie three times. Last time I left confused to find a resolution for the plot. Perhaps the plot is not logically inclined. Or maybe these harsh spots are on the plot because Anna's withdrawal from distant events is quite wrong. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who has participated in an unspecified college with a rich family. He had to offer it very expensive, but it seems that they have no family ties at all. He never seems to be a relative with whom he can turn when the consequences of one of his catastrophic decisions come into force. <br /> <br /> Ann shares a passionate evening with her great love for Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). When Harris caresses Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds she is disgusting and disgusting with her behavior. I need to keep something important here. Anni's behavior seems totally inexplicable. Ann renounces her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one Lily's wedding. Despite Anna's rejection of Harris, she continues to hold deep feelings in her deathbed. <br /> <br /> It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was deeply hit by Ann and wanted to marry him. A scene showing their possible meeting a year after Lila's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The film showed Anni's romantic relationship pattern. He had always fallen out with his men and rejected them. This pattern took place with Harris and two spouses. On the other hand, Lila married a man she didn't love, and she stayed with her husband until she died. Perhaps Lila was able to establish a relationship because she refused to marry. <br /> <br /> Then Lila Ross came too comfortably to Ann's bed. Apparently Anni's sister Ann got enough information from Anne about the last short moments to identify and contact Lila. None of these communications appeared. <br /> <br /> I thought Ann had lived in the last few days. How did he promise to buy such a house for his singing career on low income? Ann always seemed one step ahead of the economic disaster, raising her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On the second level, I enjoyed a lot of movie settings and music. The seaside mansion was just so beautiful with a heartbeat. Claire Danes was as bright as the young Ann Grant. She is really a very talented singer. I prefer a lot of her natural brunette to make her in the extremes of the film with her blonde look. If only these irritating CGI firearms go away, I can raise my whole movie with my voice!
