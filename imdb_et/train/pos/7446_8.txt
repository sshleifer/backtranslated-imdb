I can't accept any comments. For the first time I saw a movie on a British TV channel, it was presented as an indie film, and if you take the film at this angle, I think it's all else. I couldn't believe what I saw and got instantly. The plot may be just as bad as the JS exhibition (ie no graph), but the actor is annoyed, it's fun and it's all in the incredible trash. <br /> <br /> He tells America as much as Bully or Ken Park without a drama perspective, but it looks at US society and more specifically what the afternoon television viewers in America (and I believe there are many!) are interested. After all, the neighbors we are talking about are not? <br /> <br /> 100% Fun!
