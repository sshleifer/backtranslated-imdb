Watching David & Bathsheba is a much better way to get a Sunday school Bible lesson. Despite the script, which at times is inadvertently funny, the film is a lot of fun. The studio system had its own bugs, but it didn't save costs when it needed the ultimate production. Peck depicts King David as a passionate but tortured poet who is killing equivalent to sleeping in sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as prophet Nathan gives his usual content of content of content and content. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as the dancer of King Saul and the young Gwen Verdonina. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
