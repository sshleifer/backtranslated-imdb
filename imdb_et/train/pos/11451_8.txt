A very interesting documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mainly of elements made from nature. His works are made of stones, leaves, grass, ice, etc., blown away when the tide comes to the beach or the wind blows in the field. So most of Goldsworthy's works don't really work except photos or movies about what they were. It can now be said that Goldsworthy's works reflect mortality or words about it, but is it not easy to say that what he does is just fine art. And while the artists' stereotype is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people living in dusky urban areas, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, modest, family-oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland (of course , I'm sure these are the same reasons why he's hidden from some people in the art world who found their work fluffy or superficial.
