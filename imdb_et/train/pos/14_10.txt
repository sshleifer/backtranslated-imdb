This film has a special place in my heart, because when I first captured it, I taught adult literacy. It gave me and even a prominent student a very honest look. There are scenes that make you exhaust with unexpected emotions and those who even smile on the face, celebrating the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, with their best work, a young inspiring story by Martha Plimpton and great turns and haunting musical results provide the most enjoyable and rewarding experience.
