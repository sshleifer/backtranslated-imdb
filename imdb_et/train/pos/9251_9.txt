What can I say, Ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl, and as an Italian-American, fan number one in women's beauty I will not forget this movie. <br /> <br /> You know I really don't remember much about the plot, situations or other participants. I only remember dropped dead gorgeous Erika and that this film she looks better than ever, I really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only take care of the nice moments I had been a teenager Brooklyn just meditating on Erika's beauty. <br /> <br /> Well just conclude if you are a Erika Eleniaki beauty fan like I am sure this movie is for you.
