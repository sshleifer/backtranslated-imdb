I have no idea how to describe this movie, and I would also like to give them the same opportunity I had - seeing it without the prior knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it enormously, but I can also say that I hardly understood what was going on when there was actually something to understand first. This is especially enjoyed by David Lynch (tangentially), or especially by fans of Guy Maddin's films, and all fans of the comic book EIGHTBALL are probably aside from joy and wonder (it was as close to all the films I have seen in the mood Dan Clowes creates so effectively). <br /> <br /> One easy note to warn anyone easily offended - this movie would definitely be NC-17. Male full-length nudity fans, however ... hmm, well ... yes. It's a strange nature.
