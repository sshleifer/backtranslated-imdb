The book on which this film is based was great; It took some time to reach Houellebecq's unconventional style, but when I realized the mood behind this article, I completely pulled out of the author's sorrow. In fact, no other book has affected me so much. It may not be a good thing - it explained my personal struggle and made it harder for me to fight myself. Houellebecq's visions are masterfully occupied by Harel, and the hero's apathy and indifference to his rejected world are fully depicted. This is a film that reveals the humble man of today's society in all his horror. Hopefully things will change in the future, but now we have to accept rat races as shown in this movie. This is probably best if Harel or Houellebecq does not re-create such a genius. One is enough for every person.
