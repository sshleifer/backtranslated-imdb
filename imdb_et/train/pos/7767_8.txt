Stack should have received the Academy Award during that time. His crime he didn't do. It's amazing how he humanises a rich, valuable character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone earned a well-earned Academy Award for her score. In fact, everything in this movie is great. <br /> <br /> The plot starts with a taxi, then by plane, then it moves on an emotional journey that keeps your interest. You are offered entertainment! <br /> <br /> But it's just an obvious soap opera. One-dimensional, 100 percent soaper. You might call it the ultimate because it works as thoroughly as the material. Great for action, well-managed, but strictly soap genre. I wouldn't even call it melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Life Imitation"). While not neglecting the great entertainment value of this movie, you can only imagine what this talented cast and director could have achieved with a major theme.
