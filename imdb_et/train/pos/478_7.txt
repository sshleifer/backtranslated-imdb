I am quite surprised that no reviewer has commented on Luzhini's game of quite elemental shock until it was white, to name the opponent just before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a chess expert, Luzhin is shown to be illegal in the game. It is not hard to note between the fast cuts and the back table that after the Luzhin combination that culminated with the Queen's victim, her wagon was still d1 on the black wagon c1 against her king in the h1 corner. Thus, he is unable to play the alleged mating that would be illegal - but he has shown that this is the way to attract the audience.
