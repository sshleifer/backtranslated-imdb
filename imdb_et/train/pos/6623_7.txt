First, this film is painfully beautiful. Someone who works as a lighter / composer in 3D CG films blows me away. Every second I was stunned at what was on the screen. It doesn't make a world fire, but if you like your futuristic Blade Runner-esquire stories (and who doesn't?), Then you're fine. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I felt that the voice worked especially for the movie as a whole. I saw it in cinema in English, but I hope there is a French version that swims around somewhere. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing.
