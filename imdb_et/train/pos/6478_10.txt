Despite being spoken from a British perspective, it is the best World War II. The episodes that can be presented in digestible (if digestible as war may be), such as Laurence Olivier's serious voice, unite witnesses who were forced to live the events of this terrible time. I look forward to appearing on the DVD unexpectedly in the US. Europeans had the opportunity to have a DVD in this year's edition.
