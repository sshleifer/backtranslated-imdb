Fast and easy, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Like some others have mentioned, I'm not at lunch, really don't care about land music and have never worn a cowboy hat. (I've never traveled in a car with a dead body in my car, but I love Goodfellas.) It's just a great movie. The picture ratio is 2.35 and is nicely transferred to the DVD. (VHS was 1.33 in full screen). And yes, definite 5.1 mixing for your joy of watching. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> This is just a big love / hate story that has been placed in Texas with great performances. Travolta is fantastic. "Pulp Fiction" is the best thing he has done. It's been my top 5 for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Check it out! That's 10 !!!!
