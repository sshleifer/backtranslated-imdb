Ladislas Starewicz's curiosity about insects and cinema is a short film about the love triangle between Beetle, the artistic grasshopper and Mrs Beetle. A fairly simple story of adultery from a beetle pair, both trying to stimulate outside marriage, is similar to a biograph or Vitagraph, which is a short time. The story of Starewicz's story is the use of stapled beetles whose hair is straightening by frame. The story is being built as Mr Beetle has caught the camera with the local nightclub dragon jealous of jealousy. When Mr. Beetle arrives home to find his wife in his artistic friend, he is chasing him with anger, but in the end he forgives him and watches the movie. But Mrs Beetle will soon learn about her husband's infidelity, because the film they watch is a jealous grasshopper with Beetle and the dragon. Ms. Beetle shouts with the Beetle umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps through the screen and both arrive in prison after the projector throws fire. Insects are placed in humanized settings, such as a house or nightclub, and are given the characteristics of human jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. Insect labels carry a portfolio, drive cars and even wear shoes, but they also pull their antennas and open and close their almonds as real insects. The novelty of the story does not expose itself even after several views, but both the fluid and the movements move slowly. The action takes place with a complicated detail, but the process loses speed and faster filming. Despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's early puppet products and is highly recommended.
