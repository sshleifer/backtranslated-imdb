If Dick Tracy was black and white, the Pope would not be religious. Giving the film a new color concept, it offers a unique experience in the whole cartoon world, and it is one of the few films that managed to do it with a serious script, a good direction, great performances (Al Pacino is amazing) and most importantly the cinema, the art direction and costume design. Using only the basic colors, the experience is quite different from what we have seen before. It is also quite successful for all the gangster movie genres that have practically died in today's cinema. In general, I see this film as a fresh experiment and originality for a cinema that is increasingly dependent on old and already seen formulas. 7 out of 10
