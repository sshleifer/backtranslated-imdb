For our bilingual children, we bought a DVD "Es war einmal das Leben" (in German) / "Once upon a time ... Living" (in English) because everyone loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" (in German) / "Kord time ... man "(in English) series (our parents saw it as children) and has exceeded even great expectations! The series is very well done, not showing its age, and our kids at different ages really like to watch it. At the same time, they learn things our parents don't know until later. The series includes everything related to organs of the human body, all the senses, blood, infection, antibodies and many more animated 20-25 min. Themes that some people may find "reasonable", such as digestion and reproduction, are covered in a tasteful, discreet, and child-friendly way (the episode of reproduction begins in the area where the child begins to grow), while typical is informative and fun. Children are usually fascinated by how their bodies work and through episodes they understand in the context of their environment. The format of the episodes switches between the outer world (family of 2 children) and the interior of the body. For example, in an episode involving infections, the boy accidentally cuts and the wound becomes infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to it. Similarly, sensory episodes, e.g. hearing, seeing, the connection within the body with the outside world, and the episode of respiratory and oxygen circulation in the blood include the entire life cycle, including (briefly) the origin of oxygen (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best children's programs - I would say that this must be with every family with children!
