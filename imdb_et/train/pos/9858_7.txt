I would not go so far as to want this film because the only problems I have are due to the over-exposure of the plot equipment used in the film - things that are common to every film ever made. It doesn't do it bad, just something I would go far. <br /> <br /> This is a small saccharin, so I could say that most someone who is looking for something a little more in spirit could be disappointed with this kind of movie for kids. <br /> <br /> But it all goes out of the window when this squirrel (it is in all trailers) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that the decision-makers had the wisdom to say that these guys, could you stay a little more squirrel? every time it becomes intolerable. It doesn't record a movie, but you can leave it to say, "at least there was one aspect where I couldn't laugh." And of course, visually it doesn't disappoint, but it's almost given with Pixar flaps. Of all these things, I put it in the bottom ... but it's not bad in itself.
