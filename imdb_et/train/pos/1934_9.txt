I saw The Big Bad Swim at the Temecula Film Festival of 2006, and it was completely in the way I pulled it. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the lives of an adult group. swimming class for various reasons. The humorous idea itself is a class of catalyst for greater change in the lives of students. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the film when it seemed real. Rarely have the ensembles worked so well. I enjoyed the scenes in the classroom enormously, and the drama outside was very amazing. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately he left a very strong feeling like going to school or summer camp - where you can find quick friends, strong ties and discover yourself, but you have to leave too soon My only complaint was that Paula's character was very strong and an unusual introduction that made you want to know a little more about it when it finally came to light. I think you can't meet everyone in the class, though ... <br /> <br /> Besides, I found the film very well rounded and quite enjoyable. See if you have the opportunity.
