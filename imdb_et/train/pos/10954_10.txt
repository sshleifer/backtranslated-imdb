Sarah Silverman is like a completely manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you love Jesus is magic then you will love it. If you didn't, what the hell is with you? I knit for the comedy channel to hit my face. Finally, my life's meaning and "your car smells farts" is my humor. I'm a happy man. The first episode was a hysterical laughter for me and I look forward to next week. It's like fat with South Park. Absolutely outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch while reading the phone book. His delivery is accurate and so funny. He never skips. Come to think, it's not so much material choice. this is some very good stuff by the way, because it is the way it decides to deliver it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thank you, Comedy Channel!
