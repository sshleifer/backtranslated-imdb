If you enjoy John Candy's fine (yes, I said fine) activities and reactions, you won't get such a movie (as "Salvatore DiPasquale" is pronounced "fillum"). The unobtrusive (and uninformed) observer always saw Candy as a broad actor - a great buff. And sometimes he was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But giving the opportunity, he can really be sharp and quite fine. It is too bad when it was poured in so many roles that only showed it to the broad side, because we never see you again. Oh, yes, movie. With "Caddyshack" frequency you can watch "Going Berserk" over and over (I know I have). It's just so good. The plot, though somewhat complicated, is actually quite deep for such a farce. This allows Candy and always underestimated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to hit Candy ... and they hit HARD. Definitely worth a look at anyone who enjoyed SCTV or Candy's second job.
