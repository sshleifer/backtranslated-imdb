I saw this movie last night after the waiting time and age to appear here in Canada (still only for a limited time). It was worth waiting for and then some. I'm a very eager reader of Margaret Laurence and I was glad that this novel became a movie. The film seemed more pleasant than the novel. I liked that Bram Shipley's character was a bit less harsh and that there was a more love story between Hagar and Bram that made many more moving scenes at the end of Bram's life. The damage seemed stronger. Hagar was no longer pleasant to the film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. He was Hagar through and out. Christine Horne was great and has many more good things. His scenes with Cole Hauser were electric. I can go on and on, a total of 9 * 10. Fantastic and can't wait until it appears on the DVD.
