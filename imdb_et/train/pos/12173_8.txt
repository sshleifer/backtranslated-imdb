First of all fast "stick!" to those who say that this movie smells. You can't go to any movie waiting for "Citizen Kane". It was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only mistake in this movie, I don't think there is enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have lived more on it. In addition, the movie is good fun. Selma Blair must eat something. He worries me. But she still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie date or a light Saturday afternoon. Look. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: ** 1/2 Off ****
