Fortunately, nothing was known about this movie, I was curious to record it on TV. And then the tape ended just five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I am glad that I managed to get the majority because it is a really big spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very cold and even bold moments. Given the year of production in 1969, some small lesbian records need to raise some eyebrows. Of course, it won't surprise anyone and these scenes look pretty beautiful. And it's not just because of two George actors. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to have hit every viewer very hard, no wonder, and it certainly hit me. Very effective. Opponents of both sides of the opponents also give the whole story deeper into the usual gap and action. It is not just a heroic war of one victorious one, but showing what is behind a good and bad victory. Well, being a war, mostly bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of Ennio Morricone, it is also black. His work is always great, touching, but never up. And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! We hope they will get this DVD soon so I can collect all my movie and more people get to know this very little known gem.
