I have to say that the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused who was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket. When all the men arrived at the camp, it turned out that there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson but was not. I said where is Bill Paxson? Then there was a boyfriend with a girlfriend. He said he was 21. This was to be the most memorable 20-year meeting of the camp director (Alan Arkin). Later it was the same girl in communication and talked about her camp experiences. It didn't make sense. He would have been one year old. Nevertheless, the film turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was a nice boy who was always tempted. One man was full of narcissus and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-fashioned camp leader who admits he's been in contact with today's youth. The best part was that no adult campers were successful in life. None of them had a great career. It seemed like a very real life. The film was compared to The Big Chill. In some ways it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the start is not promising, the film finally turned out to be good.
