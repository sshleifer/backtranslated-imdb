I was the production accountant for this movie and I have to do it so I am not completely impartial, but if it were terrible, I'd say it. I thought it was a fun movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but in some way there was a lot of laugh. The Bible says laughter is a good medicine, so watching this movie can be beneficial to your health. <br /> <br /> So many of the participants in this picture had not yet reached the top. this movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, is the one who has been much more famous since then. Melanie Mayron was seen as a "Thirty Something" TV show after a week of television. Later, Robert Englund became known as Freddie Krueger, who still dreams of people. One of my personal favorite shows was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was a great comedy actor and a really nice, sincere person. We all had fun working on this exhibition and I think the fun comes through.
