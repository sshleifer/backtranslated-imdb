Ghost Train is a good and fun movie that is typical of better British comedy coolers in the 1930s and 40s. Comedian Arthur Askey antics is not as funny as they once seemed, but it can be overcome by looking at him as a periodic piece or curiosity. <br /> <br /> For low budget wartime production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, efficient and skips. Great fun in the dark (and yes, stormy) at night. Lighten up, take the critic's hat off and enjoy.
