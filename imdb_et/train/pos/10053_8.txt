I have to admit that when I read the description of the genre in Netflix as "Steamy Romance", I was a little skeptical. "Steaming"? In the 1968 film? I was ready for disappointment. And when I realized that it was completely black and white, I knew my erotic hopes had been broken. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong? Not only does this film contain all the elements of evaporative romance - the discovery of the first love, the discovery of the mystery of fear, the sudden unexpected end, but sometimes it was erotic. You will soon forget that it is black and white. Cinematography deserves recognition every year. Two star performances (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they're both in the mid-twenties trying to play school girls. This is 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively investigate such a lesbian love story? Many adult women were still trying to cope with their sexuality. Anyone looking for real teens here is waiting too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was ahead of time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected joy; it still managed to leave much to the imagination, instead of giving us poetic descriptions to add what we showed. As for your straight boys who love lesbian behavior: although it's not all you expect, I don't think you're too disappointed.
