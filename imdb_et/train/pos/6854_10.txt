Big Brian De Palma's intelligent, stylish and convincing thriller is a modern classical class that is firmly in its best films. <br /> <br /> When a strange housewife is brutally murdered by a stranger, the victim's son joins the prostitute to expose the killer. <br /> <br /> Dressed to kill left a strong impression on your daily audience and good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setting and is based on a strong interruption of a compelling mystery. Final and final conclusions are particularly funny. But even more impressive is De Palma's elegant direction, which gives this film not only a tight distance, but a unique and dark atmosphere. Kill is also dressed in a very erotic film, but mostly in a strange way. Pino Donaggio also gives the film a lovely musical score. <br /> <br /> Casting is another strong feature of this movie. Michael Cain makes a terrible psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful because it is a failed housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a streetman is sure. Young young Keith Gordon is also a worthy supporter of the investigative son. <br /> <br /> Many critics criticize De Palma's films for Hitchcock's elements and this film was no exception. But any similarities between Hitchcocks' works and De Palmas can only be seen as good quality, as the "rip-off" of this film would be a humiliating fine thriller. Kill is dressed for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> **** out ****
