Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read is a 1936 feature film "Three Smart Girls" that introduces Deanna Durbin's film to the audience. He also celebrates Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It is a lovely story that three young women who live in Switzerland with their divorced mother and who hear their father (Winninger) will get married again. If he did not see him for ten years and knew that their mother still loved him, they would enter the United States with the help of a housekeeper / babysitter who decided to stop the wedding. Realizing that the planned, called "precious" (Barnes) is nothing more than the help of his mother (Brady) and the gold-plated gold digger, they are organizing the introduction of wealthy counties. It is organized by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls carry him for the real number (Milland). What is confusion. <br /> <br /> This is a delightful film that is not at all vague or too sweet, with some nice shows, especially Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are beautiful and everyone is doing a good job. Of course, the emphasis is on young Durbin, a natural actor and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice as a teenager is much more than an adult - she has no difficulty with high notes as she did later because she put too much weight on the middle voice. She sings a pleasant "Il Bacio" police station. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable things about the film is to see the father playing with Charles Winninger, not wanting his children until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as a gold digger is not so young, but the girls' mother looks up there, so the conclusion was probably an older man looking for a younger, younger, glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was looking for from his daughters. <br /> <br /> The universe gives Durbin a big star - he has taken the final picture in the movie. At that moment, Ray Milland still paid his reward, and it is probably a surprise to fans of the film when he is young and attractive. <br /> <br /> Very fun and, of course, this sequel and greatness for Deanna.
