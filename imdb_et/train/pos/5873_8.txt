It would have been a sure-fire class when they chose John Abraham for ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE. This man is a terrible actor. Be it comedy, drama, tears and the like. She stinks. It seems that Priyadarshan understood it for a while, and quite a lot of him jumped like a monkey to make his solo scenes a little funny. <br /> <br /> He is the only noticeable drawback (there are a couple more tedious tid-bits) of ABSOLUTELY fun movie otherwise. The best comedy that comes in Bollywood after Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, this is a situational comedy that takes place on the shoulder of a glorious scenario and of course Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best result. He should have better candies with the best comedians for each prize function. The AK has always been good in comedy, but it takes it to another level. Body language, facial expressions, and just how he gives each line. This is brilliant performance. The packed theater went a little through the length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for the Bollywood movie here in the US. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not have one "lead" heroine. It stands for 3 incredibly HOT + beautiful girls whom I thought they did a good job. Pretty sure they all make their debut. Paresh Rawal is sure as usual, although his routine will last some time. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self (surprising behavior for every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> In general, it's definitely worth it. I'd say it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and that says a lot. Could it have been even better if they had chosen someone who would be more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
