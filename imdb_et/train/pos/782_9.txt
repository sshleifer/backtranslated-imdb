This is a very moving picture for about forty of the best friends in a small England town. A younger piano teacher has a passionate love and a new beginning when the tragedy strikes and the hearts change forever. Definitely a movie that contains a box with you! Powerful work. This is definitely one of my favorite films. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is his young, beautiful piano trainer and passionate romance. His two jealous "friends" play an immature rush that quickly leads to a tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in one uncomfortable way. Finally, the unexpected surprise brings them together (in my opinion, his forgiveness is not justified).
