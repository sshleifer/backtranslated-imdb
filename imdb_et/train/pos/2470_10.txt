After the initial shock to understand Mr Branaghi's inner filming, I literally shook with excitement that this epic was just in front of me. I was not disappointed. So true Shakespeare and so much more accessible. It blew my mind. I always enjoy seeing Branagh, or rather listening, and it made me wonder ... was this movie dubbed in other countries? It would be like painting a mustache on Mona Lisa.
