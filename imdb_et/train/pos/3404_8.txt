1936 Audiences need to be stunned by what they look at: a full-fledged, beautiful full-length Technicolor film. I can't be sure, but it could have been the first (3-strip). In any case, this DVD still looks beautiful 70 years later. In fact, it's just how good it is, amazing. <br /> <br /> Tissue has to go to director Richard Boleslowski, photography director Virgil Miller, Selznick's international pictures and DVD to MGM Home Entertainment. All of them joined to give us one of the best films of the classic era. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was so-so: in the first half it was great, the second time it stood. Finally, it was a nice message, although many people were not happy with it. I can't say more without breaking things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never saw a better, I don't think, and I certainly didn't play such a soft-hearted character ("Domini Enfilden"). Heartbeats Charles Boyer was a male star and Domini's affection, but some of the smaller characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut like "Batouch"; John Carradine is "Sand Divider"; At least the most memorable was the "Irena" dancer played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there's a face and a dance that you won't forget soon! I've never seen anything like that in thousands of movies. His sight was worth the value of his DVD. Looking at the continuation of his IMDb, he was just four movies, but they were all known movies. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, an actor who really became famous for playing Sherlock Holmes, is here as well as the other Aubrey Smith, the other famous British actor of his day. Schildkraut, by the way, is recognized by the classic film parades as the man who played the arrogant salesman, The Shop Around The Corner, Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> Beautiful direction, photography and color, and Tilly Dance are the things I remember best about a movie that is a lot of good and not so good things that all roll out. If the last half hour had been better - though I admire this end - I would have appreciated it even higher. This is definitely one of the film collectors who want to add their own collection.
