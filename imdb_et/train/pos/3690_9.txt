Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all men the opportunity to love the whole world, but given that the human heart is very small, every human being has a special place he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of today's most prominent leaders when they tried to recognize eternal love for this special place and represent situations in the lives of their people and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, where our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others, take us breathtakingly through Parisian arrondissements, people's feelings, longings and expectations. /> <br /> Always a second quarter, always a moving story of ordinary people looking for love, be it in the car park, art studio, subway station. And Paris je t'aime is about a great deal of love - love for your partner, child, parent, those who meant the world to us, but no longer surrounded by love that needs revival, love for that stranger when your eyes meet or love that just isn't meant ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie is not just about love, but about life, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. And the most important quality is the fact that it is not at all sloppy, but rather warm and hopeful. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9 because its last part shows how some stories can evolve, but not all of them, and that is what I find, and "advancement" does not mean anything specific a reference to the future of the characters. As for everything else, I can only say - exciting. You want to leave everything behind you, escape to Paris and live those little romance yourself.
