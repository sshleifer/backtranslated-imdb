I saw this movie a few months ago in a cable and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was just amazing. She takes care of her character, even if she's clearly wrong, and Neve Campbell gives a report that is undoubtedly the best actor she has seen this year. She is a fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise over her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just crappy when Macy's father and John Ritter are good, because the contraction is stuck in the middle of everything that happens. <br /> <br /> I want this to happen in the theater because I feel it is a movie that should be watched more widely. It's a shame, because it's hell, it's better that most of the new movies are now in the theater. <br /> <br />
