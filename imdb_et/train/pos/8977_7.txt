Like a movie that hardly appreciates 4, but for 1940's movie fans, it's almost a must-see and appreciates 9 as a show show! I was pulled to watch it in the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the colonel responsible for this event. I was surprised by the stunning Doris day. Outside of "Calamity Jane" I have never seen him make a better song than he does here. Randolph Scott is also catchy, even if he doesn't see much of the screen time. It has been a while since I saw the movie, but I was almost certain that Humphrey Bogart was released. So many familiar faces are difficult to follow. If it ever goes to a nearby TV channel, be sure to remember the Doris Day sequence if nothing else! <br /> <br />
