I like the original, and this movie has its ups and downs. Here are just a few: <br /> <br /> Ups: Most of the original voice was returned. <br /> <br /> Downs: I didn't like Timon's voice. I know he made a voice in Simpsons, but this exhibition is just stupid. <br /> <br /> About: We see Simba as a "teenager." <br /> <br /> Downs: They wasted it with slug-slurping between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki who told Timon "Hakuna Matata". <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Pumbaa know about it? <br /> <br /> Ups: Songs again. (some original songs were there, but they were just background music.) Downs: But stupid songs. (One of Timon's solo.) <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a pretty good movie. I recommend it to the fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, then it is likely that you do not like it. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
