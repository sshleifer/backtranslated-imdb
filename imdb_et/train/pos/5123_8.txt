Married, twenty something hick (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston where he learns about life and love in Texas honky-tonk. The face value has this modern love story ... in Texas style. There are cowboy hats, pickups, neon beer signs and references to big belt bandages and rodeos. Music, if not Texas, is Texas, adapted to the talents of the band Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee and Charlie Daniels. And this Texas twang ... "y'all". <br /> <br /> The story and characters are as subtle as the Texas Five-Alarm Chili, made with Jalapeno peppers. It is enough for civilized viewers to interrupt the movie for the benefit of a useful classic, one starring Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman. "Hamlet" it's not. But "Urban Cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and I like it. <br /> <br /> Technically, film is generally good. Dialogue, production design and costumes are realistic; editing is skillful. And both casting and acting are commendable, if not Oscar's worth. I wouldn't have played Travolt in his role, but he does a good job ... ditto Debra Winger. Among other things, Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson are also in the lead. But cinematography seemed weak. The film you watched was grainy and sometimes the reddish / orange tone, the visual feature I have noticed in other films of the same time period, is suffering. <br /> <br /> At first glance, film does not seem to provide any social or political message. But I would say that when "Urban Cowboy" appeared twenty-five years ago, it had quite prophetic consequences. In 1980, the US had all kinds of problems, not less than the hostages of Iran. Many people's minds were pushed around the US, tempted. <br /> <br /> This movie, together with other times, offered something the Americans wanted to see in their political leadership. .. toughness. "Urban Cowboy" is a very natural film. Signs in it may not be the brightest people on Earth. But they are tough! <br /> <br /> All "Urban Cowboy" is intellectual. As a carrier of cultural expression, this 1980 film was one of many that brought the US a new hard era. It began in 1980 with Reagan's election. And this era is still going on, with the president, probably not remembering his intellect, but remembering his toughness and aggressiveness, the features that the Americans seem so firmly as Texans with five-alarm.
