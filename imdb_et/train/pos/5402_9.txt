Hitokiri (which interprets "murder"), a / k "Tenchu", which translates around "divine punishment", shows Hideo Gosha at the top of his form. Don't miss this, or Gosha's other classics, Goyok! Hitokiri is not only one of Gosha's best films, but one of the best "ever made movie" samurai / chambara "and perhaps one of the best Japanese movies ever exported. <br /> <br /> Warn, all the complex Hitokiri plot details may be slightly more difficult for those who are not familiar with Japanese history of the 19th century, yet the human drama is obvious and open to all viewers, and according to Gosha's norm, Hitokiri still gives his traditional theme "loyalty to his lord" and "the right thing." Your favorite theme with such complexity is that it is really _ watching a movie (with Goyokin, of course). <br /> <br /> I think it will break down like this: if you want a simpler, more road-oriented story, you might see Goyok. if you want a more thoughtful, multi-layered (albeit gloomy) drama, look at it. <br /> <br /> (OK, OK, basically the historical background is a massive power group for many different samurai the clans who either (1) work to reform, while retaining the Tokugawa Shogunate and (2) those who are trying to install Emperor Meiji as the supreme leader of Japan, were of course emperors working for "for" Emperor Meiji " "Reforming" in Japan as the force of its clan in the "new world order". Ironically, the entire feudal system was officially canceled as one of the first reforms of the Meiji government. ironically - which makes the whole plot even more sparse.) <br /> <br /> What is different from "Hitokir" from Gosha's other films is Gosha's mature cinematic feeling. Each picture is well thought out and (like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon), each film can still be a composition. Of course this is typical of Gosha. Hitokiri stands out with great backgrounds, including (like Goyokin) with many riveting sea forests. Just look at the opening order and you're hooked! Don't make a mistake, it's not an English period: Hitokiri is extremely violent (doesn't say you weren't warned). <br /> <br /> What else, apart from cool camera work, does Hitokiri do? The performances seem to me a bit thinner in this. Feel Shintaro (celebrity of Zatoich / Hanzo razor) becomes a star in controversial protagonist / antihero, Okada Izo. Feeling able to enter humanity by nature, which seems almost wild animal like a villain. Throughout the film you are never sure if you have taken Okada's character. At the same time, depicting Katsu seems to be an astonishing hunger for Okada and his later pathetic attempts to redeem seem so human that you can't help but feel empathy / compassion. Of course, after seeing Nakadai Tatsuya as a tortured hero "Goyokin", it is very good to see that he plays such a ruthless evil "Hitokiri". He's just perfect, nothing more to say! <br /> <br /> As a final remark, perhaps for more interesting fans than casual fans, don't miss Mishima Yukio's last screen appearance (yes, a closed gay right-hand ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide suicide before the Japanese military crowd he had in 1970. was "kidnapped" in the year and made a film about his life and Paul Schrader. honored (for assassination) Shinbei Tanaka.
