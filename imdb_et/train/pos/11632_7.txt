Reiterates the darkness. With relief ... thriller, which is really exciting! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("The Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates the screen during this nice, classic temporary thriller, famous for the film director Wes Craven ("Scream" films and "Nightmare on Elm Street"). Craven even has one passenger on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this one work is the first 15-20 minutes of realism when we see that McAdams interacts with 4 or 5 people, either a person or a phone. He's natural. When he meets Cillian Murphy (scarecrow "Batman Begins") in what seems to be a case, the movie really flies. Looking at two yuppie-type flirts, while the audience knows that evil is brewing, it's a fascinating filmmaking! The boarding queue is mesmerizing and 30 plus minutes aboard is exceptionally claustrophobic. Craven keeps us in touch with the inclusion of other people and when someone comes to his rescue. <br /> <br /> As with many thrillers, the only hit will be the culmination when the lamb becomes a superhero. An interesting plot device makes us believe that little Rachel has the necessary pent frustration to see, but we can't help. The most overrun scenes include relaxing hotel guests, annoying air travelers, Cillian injuries, and FX hotel. The strength of the film is in the evolution of the character between leaders and in psychological games. Unfortunately, the fine screen veteran Brian Cox is too little used, but in general it is a shorter than average thriller, worth seeing for everyone in the finals.
