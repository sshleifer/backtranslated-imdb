I do not want to bring everyone, repeating what has already been said, but it is one of the best series! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope that it is a good idea for anyone to take it out and start the series again. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD !!!! I hurried down to the store and got a copy and I was happy to say it was as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and horrible character and all the actors were very good. It is a pity that the network did not continue to do so. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it must do it. You don't have to be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young when she was watching television (she's 20), is becoming very interesting and soon a fan. She finds it "very twisted" and enjoyed what she has seen. I can't wait to see episodes that weren't broadcast. <br /> <br /> It shows stones !!!!
