Love this movie too. You saw it when it was the first independent cinema in Frankfurt for the first time in Germany. It was really overcrowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The eroticism of the film struck spectators and discussion with Moritz Boerner, the producer and director, always emphasizing it. In his genre, it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it's an independent film. Three short films worked more on television even before he became a kind of therapist. search, but it is possible.
