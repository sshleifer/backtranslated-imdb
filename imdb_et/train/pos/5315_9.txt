This movie was very, very strange and very funny. All participants are quite real and very strange. The overall "look" of the film was also different, dreamy and bleached, adding only the cosmic, strange, strange skin of the whole room. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, I mean it's not what you would call "mainstream", but that's what I liked about it. Unlike what I have seen before. . . unpredictable, strange rhythms and strange lines in strange places. Children are so heartily buggy (and pimply) that you can't help but know them. In other words, they are far from the "Hollywood" versions of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Everything that makes me good at it.
