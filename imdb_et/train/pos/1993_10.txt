This is Dicken's "Oliver Twist" musical customization. Most of the time, the original story has been preserved, although some sub-blocks (for example, in the summer, which he spent and his half-brother) are left out for the film's flow. The biggest difference between the movie and the story is that at the end of the book, Fagin is hanging - this very different end of the music film. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of musical - one whose style and scope are actually not before or after. Not only songs are often quite song and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a vision. If in some music some people are dancing with a choreographer or maybe even a small group, the numbers often fall into hundreds or even more. This is really an obvious phenomenon and I was lucky enough to see it in the theater when it debuted and it is one of my earliest childhood memories. Having just seen it a few moments ago, I have to say that the film got better over time. Big sets, wonderful acting and singing - this is a special treatment that is not difficult to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie again tonight, I was surprised at how big and feminine Mark Lester's song was for the movie. Well, according to IMDb, his song was a girl and it would be her voice.
