I saw this movie with a special review of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It's so interesting where the man came from. Now he is probably the main independent African filmmaker in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers talking about film-makers who are rooted in culture. The idea of ​​recognizing the diversity and diversity of African issues is that his film is 500 years later, an African issue. But the Idea is not suitable for this form. Showing artistic diversity. The film is all African, but the topic is a human subject that most of us may be involved in. I just love this light comedy. And the Hours of Jake's Kora is just amazing, it's really a gem of an art house.
