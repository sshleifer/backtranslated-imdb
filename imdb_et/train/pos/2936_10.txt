If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we all remember that. But even I was only 4 when he came out. If you haven't seen it yet, rent Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I Spy, Pluto Nash, and all Eddie family comedy movies - then watch it. Hands down, laughing 90% of the time. Other 10% you need to wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> To understand all the jokes you need to look more than once. From the humor of raw humor to kids! (If you have seen it, laugh here) - you love your stuff. If you can, (or is a big fan) try downloading clips from Eddie's actions. The distribution of exhibitions is different if you imagine and still have funny jokes. <br /> <br /> But it's like the "best" of Eddie Murphy's "X-rated" if you want. <Br>> <br /> And all I can say is don't look at Delirious if you don't like comedy, you don't have a sense of humor or no fun. You just laid off this great Eddie Murphy classic and put it on someone. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie got Beverly Hills Cop and became famous for it - Delirious is it.
