Waiting for every new episode, wait again every time! The new look of the scifi created by Stargate SG-1 is a miracle I hope it will never end. Combining the past and the future is a new excitement for me. Season 9 should be an excitement in itself. I want Richard Dean Anderson to appear more often in the new season because I love his dry spirit as much as his temper, the character of his Jack T'Neill. The other characters add their uniqueness to the exhibition, which makes it a winner, in the season after the end of the season. You will cancel this program for the next three years and make a serious mistake. You also need a greater role for Asgard - they are just too cool.
