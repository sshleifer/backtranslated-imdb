An interesting thriller with a detective on Paul Winfield's murder. Paul Winfield was an undervalued actor who pulled out all his roles so easily, it was hard to say that he was even acting. Perhaps the youngest viewers are best known as the "City Confidential" voice / narrator, Winfield finishes his career with so-called film; but as always, Winfield looks like. Care to look. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is well, Erika Eliniak, nice to look at, but she works a lot in the department. While being fair, it is one of his best efforts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Traceable triller that should not be left by the Paul Winfield fan. A decent television film that helps Paul Winfield send to the celluloid sky. What an actor. He misses.
