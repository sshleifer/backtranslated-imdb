I saw this movie for the first time about four years ago and waited for something funny, similar to CB4. I was blown. I was on the floor laughing at my butt this movie is so big. Better than CB4, characters, songs, plot, everything. The highest independent film that Siskel and Egbert gave "Two thumbs up" (and if two old white men understand this flick of humor, you know it's good).
