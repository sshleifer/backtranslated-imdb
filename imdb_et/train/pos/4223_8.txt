The film has a great written story. It contains all the usual Columbo ingredients; Columbus's approach and ties to his suspect, the way mystery is taken care of by him, the Columbo dog, cat and mouse game, which is great in this, and fortunately also good humor, mostly related to Columbo's character. It's all written, even though it doesn't even have a truly original concept. Columbo's hunter's murderer novelist had made Columbo's film more than once before. <br /> <br /> This is also a very well-directed film by James Frawley who later directed 5 Columbo films. 70s and 80s. He gave the film a style and some really great and memorable sequences. This style and approach does not always work well for the Columbo movie, but in the movie that may not be the least due to the film's performance. <br /> <br /> Most of the filmmakers in this movie movie from Columbo were a great famous star or star from the early days of movies. This film marks a rather unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. He did not play a terrible number of films in his career, but some of them are still well known, mainly for his role in "Rosemary's Baby", which also won his Oscar. He had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of action that some people might not like. He earned 4 more Oscar candidates in his career before he won the "Rosemary Baby" in 1969. He also has excellent communication with Peter Falk in his sequences. <br /> <br /> The film is also celebrated by a young GD Spradlin. I say to the young people because I know him about his latest productions despite his career, despite being 57 years old at Columbus. She's still alive, but since 1999 she has retired. <br /> <br /> Even more usual is to insert a Columbo movie. <br /> <br />
