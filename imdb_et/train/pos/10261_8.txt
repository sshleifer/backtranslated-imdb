First of all, it should not be a brilliant and thoughtful film, as many other reviewers compare it. The first review says something that loves someone who doesn't know anything about the cinema of fear, probably the other way around. When you look back at the movie, it wasn't really convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But it really is all it was aimed at, it was meant for the viewers away from the shock value (and all the errors its visuals were much less noticeable in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave this one high score because it reached its goal and, although it wasn't terribly terrible (non-shock), it made me a little sick and carefully paranoid / pessimistic (I didn't do it) Don't trust someone for about a week because I didn't want to wake up and torture)
