I really thought this movie was great. History is not just right, but the style is rich and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blun's Victoria depiction and how she kept her spirit, even though she was forced into her youthful virtual exile. Blunt represents a charismatic and sometimes dogmatic way that Vicotria became famous (perhaps notorious). The romantic elements of the film are so authentic and delicate that when the film ends, you really understand why Vicotria decided to live the rest of his days in mourning Albert. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are also worth mentioning. I appreciated a beautiful score that moves quite wonderfully with the dramatic movement of the story. I also considered the cinematography to be outstanding, some scenes that leave me with the breath they are depicting because of lushness and splendor. <br /> <br /> This year, there have been so few films as beautiful and delicate as this movie and this price is one of the best in 2009!
