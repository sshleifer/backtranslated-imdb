I have been able to see this classics for the first time a couple of weeks ago. After almost 30 years ago, I thought the frightening moments would be quite annoying. The boy was wrong with me. There are some great moments that shed my back. Even the actor was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was great. This makes all copies, eg. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks great. I can't really say it's Carpenter's best because I haven't seen many of her, the only one I remember is Starman (I think she did). Halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre.
