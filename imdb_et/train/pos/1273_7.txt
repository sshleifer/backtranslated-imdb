Easy movie at first, simple movie. It's that endless and pretense clich√©, but most TV movies are that in some way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job as an ex-con / drifter. The marriage between her and the woman she is working on is, in my opinion, a bit puzzled, but I believe that the period of time it is set is believed to be no less. <br /> <br /> Now I saw an edited "tv" version, even when the movie was made and "on TV", I find it a bit too good. But I feel that if I saw the whole piece, I would probably give it the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but still ... a nice job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
