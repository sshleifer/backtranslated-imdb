The opening night of John Cassavetes I completely collapsed. This is her first film I've seen that seems to be larger, so it seems to be more of a mainstream, but it still doesn't feel like she's more than her previous films. This is probably so intense. There is no doubt that there is something cathartic about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> What you have actually done in Cassavets after your career is the ideal idea she has expressed behind the camera during her career as a director. here expressing it in front. The character of Rowlands, the medieval director Myrtle Gordon, is unable to play in his future production, so he monitors the impulse after the impulse, resulting in a stage that seems to be chaos until he finds the right one. This is a boldly abstract assumption. <br /> <br /> This is a film that cannot capture the innate leadership that goes through emotional cleaning. No one understands why Myrtle does a lot of things he does, and it is seen and even depicted as something destructive, but it may be the best for him. It can be purification rather than division. Redemption, cocoon, rebellion, everything culminates in collapse. Cassavetes gives his character a brutal real touch, that is, he says at an early stage that he has nothing in common with his character, but he is quiet, but emotionally corroded that the opposite is true. <br /> <br /> The latest scene, climate change, which Myrtle shares with a character who has been painfully alienated from him, is one of the most interesting, fun, hard and enlightening moments I've ever seen in Film.
