This film is made up of such a great emotion, especially with the outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actresses because she is enthusiastic about making movies and entertaining. This movie wasn't the best when I first looked at it, but after about 3 times I decided it was one of the best films I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and progresses through its lifestyle. He discovers his life with his girlfriend (Diaz) delimma. He undergoes depression and then outflows. This movie went beyond my expectations and is one of Cruise's best movies ever!
