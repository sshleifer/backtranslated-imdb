You sit there for half an hour and look at the story, believing it all, then look at the other story for half an hour, fully exploring ... and then again. Great. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting films of the San Francisco International Film Festival is the documentary. I don't know if - besides Andrew Jareck's "Friedmans the Friedmans" - there has never been anything like Anna Broinowski's "Forbidden Lie $". It contains, reveals, protects, exposes and asks everything from Norma Khour, the author of "Honor Lost", which was recognized and lambed in 2001 by the best seller in Jordan. "What is quite incredible and what makes the film so extraordinary is that this Khour's" exposure "has been made with the full participation of Khouri. For the original part of the film, Khouri presents his story of a friend's friend's assassination of honor to Amman It sounds absolutely unbelievable, convincing. <br /> <br /> Then his story has been unleashed, exposed, especially by plausible and persuasive people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, the researchers there and in Australia where Khouri lived for a while . <br /> <br /> Khouri comes back and denies accusations of successfully taking the wrong detector test in this process, and there is another segment of devastating exposures that is not specified here, as it would reduce the value of the shock ... and then turns to Khouri back and facing charges (not all but important to the book). /> <br /> And Houdin's act continues after a circular round in this heavy-duty struggle, a surprise surprise - and no "happy" in the sense of the resolution. Brilliant.
