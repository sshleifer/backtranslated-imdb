This is a different review. I've seen this movie twice on television and I would like to have a copy of it because it talks about the city of Panama and the beach in winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie Ashley Judd saw and she was great and I've enjoyed all the other things I've seen her. The Sundance reaction also gave me the impression of director Victor Nunez, who has directed and written several films about Florida. This movie tells me and I didn't see anything to compare it to. The plot tells me less than the surroundings. Well, I told you this would be a different review.
