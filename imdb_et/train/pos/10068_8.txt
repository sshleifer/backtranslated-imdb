This movie was great. The sad truth about how culture tends to come into contact with gender. This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie. You have a captain who, in a traditional sense and in his own way, is cheerful, despite being a girl's thing to win her affection and win this one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. It is finally equal to a big happy movie. This film does a good job of showing how a tradition can be, so suddenly that they are ready to die without sharing their secrets. You can see the sides of a culture that has never been seen, which helps to increase the drama that opens up at the end of the picture. Cinema photography is great, especially the sequence of opening parades with all the sparks. Associated with being an Oscar claiming the best foreign film.
