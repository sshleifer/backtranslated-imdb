Alright, before we look, I have to ask: why isn't it listed separately? Maybe it was just a TV show in Italy, but it's a film for international Lamberto Bava fans. In America, this movie is distributed with VHS and DVD either "Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with "demons" except one cast member and the team. But yes, I was personally upset that it was so hard to find on this site what would otherwise be so useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, look at "Ogre". I have seen this trailer on YouTube several times and I found it honestly scary. The film itself (this is the length of the function, so making a movie) has many many strengths and succeeds in intimidating. The last thing I was dissatisfied with, but generally I do not regret buying the DVD before seeing it (available from the Shriek Show). I think the film's origin is explained by the last act. I don't give any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The plot is somewhat familiar: an American horror who rests in an old horror castle with his wife and son to find it exactly for his childhood nightmares. "Glowing" is a weak echo, but it is a different kind of supernatural horror. A woman (Virginia Bryant) is finding more and more evidence that this is the real residence of her nightmares, but her husband does not believe her. Observe the great atmosphere and fear. The Ogre cochlear effect was good, reminding me of the Uncle Frank resurrection from the first Hellraiser. There are also some good shots and a well-made underwater scene. I give them evidence that the film never hit a similar concept in American films, namely "Nightmare on Elm Street". "Ogre" is the original. And the monster itself was scary when it was presented correctly. <br /> <br /> The Shriek Show DVD has an interview with Lamberto Bava, where he is cautious to mention that it is not his classic. Demon Series. He also gives a lot of hope to the real castle where the film was filmed. Indeed, this provision helps a movie a lot. Simon Boswell's music also helps. <br /> <br /> There are many good things here. "Ogre" is not perfect, but it is very worth seeing. Take it less to Lamberto Bava's achievement.
