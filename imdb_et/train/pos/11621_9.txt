I was dull night and Red Eye was and wondered why not. <br /> <br /> Red eye is one of the best films for a long time. <br /> <br /> I thought I was in a movie because it was just so brilliant. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also features two big leading films with Rachel Mcadams like Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy with Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The actors are just brilliant and you know the movie for people. <br /> <br /> Music is just great, it gives you chills and you can feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I just love how the movie was so well done and it's never boring. <br /> <br /> The red eye is just phenomenal. Nothing more or anything else. <br /> <br /> It's a great thriller. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoy the Red Eye so much that I can watch it over and over again. <br /> If you like Red Eye, I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
