I love this series! Many stereotypes that portray Southerrers as hicks are very obvious, but such people exist too often. Also, portraying the South Government's rings is too true, but compassionate characters resemble one of many southern good things. Some things never change and we see good old boys every day! In every southern city, Lucas Buck, who only needs to make calls to make things happen, and the poetic book "po" in the white trash is too familiar. Apart from supernatural elements, everything else can happen very well in the modern south! I think Trinity, SC must be in Barnwell County!
