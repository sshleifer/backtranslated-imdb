Often this pearl, the 1936 invisible Ray, cannot be enjoyed. But you can't forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff, in the harsh and exciting mountainous region of his carpets, is Janos Rukh, a genius science who reads an ancient beam of light to identify events in the great geological past, especially in the crash of a strong radioactive meteor in Africa. His joining is always an elegant Lugosi (a rare hero) studying "astro chemistry". Frances Drake is a cute, young woman; Frank Lawton is a romantic temptation; and the adorable Violet Kemble Cooper is the mother of Rukh, Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story moves quickly in bold episodes where special effects are still beautiful. It also features great features. One Rukh restores his mother's eyes, he asks, "Mom, do you see if you see?" "Yes, I see more clearly than ever. And what I see is intimidating me." Better still, mother Rukh says, "He broke the first science law." I am not alone with my acquaintance because for many years I have been puzzled by what this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely an island material in the desert.
