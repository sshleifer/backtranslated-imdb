The first Tarzan movie was Johnny Weissmuller. The plot has already been assembled so I won't go back in. I just know that the actors playing Jane and Tarzan were born for this role. If you haven't seen this movie and you only have today's Tarzan movies as references .. you are missing out on the actual treatment. It doesn't matter how far we are in making cinema, in the design of makeup ... never playing Tarzan or Johnny Weissmuller. He was and is Tarzan.
