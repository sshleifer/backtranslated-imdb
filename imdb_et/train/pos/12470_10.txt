I just saw this movie on television. <br /> <br /> I've lost my father when I was young, and this movie definitely touched me. <br /> <br /> I feel lost in this little girl Desi felt .. <br /> <br /> Feeling wanted to see her father again. <br /> <br /> wanted to talk to her. br /> <br /> or at least made it possible to say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> and I'm so touched by the letter he was writing back. <br /> <br /> saying his father was reading her letter and sent it back to someone to answer her and buy her a gift, because there is no store in the sky. <br /> <br /> It just lets me feel the miracles.
