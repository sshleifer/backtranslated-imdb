Twisted, bizarre, enchanting and fun! I couldn't laugh at watching this movie. Darren Stein introduces films made with family camcorders from South California in the 1980s. This is an interesting look at the promising filmmaker and his motivation and ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but do we not all watch movies manipulated in some way or another? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was amused that the boys in the movies seemed odd, if possible. Later, Darren comments on his amazing homosexuality and sees it in the hiding tips (great hints!) From an early age. Maybe it was just a warm South California weather, who knows? Like a gay man who grew up in a caring environment, it is nice to see that his parents supported him and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be with his emerging talent behind the lens. <br /> <br /> "Put the camera on me" offers a picture of 80, which is not in business, you remember hair, music and fashion. I am as old as Mr. Stein, so the trip back to the memory card was welcome. The solo-sync dance number is invaluable, complemented by Frankie Goes Hollywood's t-shirt. <br /> <br /> Movies are dealing with dark subjects, child abuse, holocaust, core war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction. Stein's dealing with these topics is interesting to say and have fun watching. <br /> <br /> Watch your first chance!
