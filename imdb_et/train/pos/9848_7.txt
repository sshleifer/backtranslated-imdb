I watched this movie with my child's eyes and I wasn't disappointed. The story is well known that some abandoned orphans must bring their unlikely trio to their parents (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and lazy animal) ... And I don't want to forget to mention the incredible little rage to create his hazen. It made me laugh a lot during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> In short, it works, it's funny and it's "black-it" with their kids (they love it).
