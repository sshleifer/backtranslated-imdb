Whether it's a good movie or not, you have to make such movies, I guess. It reminds me of "I Love Huckabees", an overwhelmingly amazing movie, which Isabelle Huppert is a young man in a muddy pond, a joyous sadistic-masochistic (?? !!!!). I hope the director will continue to cross the border, as if I knew the choices made by Vincenzo Natal, was not always fine (some scenes were the unhappy type of "tarte-à-la-crème" like childish slapst), talking about script and cinematography? "Cube" color was black, "Nothing" is white, surprisingly happier than Natal's former films.
