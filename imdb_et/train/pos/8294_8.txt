This movie has great fighting scenes. Now it is true that the actor is a little harsh. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I would look at Cheesy's film like American beauty. But if you want to see a movie with true martial arts and amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying, air like many movies threw down the matrix now. Then look at it. Now, it is true that the exhibition has two main stars, where the boy shows the role of the powers and the majority of this exhibition in this film. But hey fighting scenes are enough to make Jet Li p ** his pants. And the tricks are worth enough to make Jackie Chan sit and admire.
