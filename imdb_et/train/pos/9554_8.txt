Lock your daughters is one of the best spiritual comedies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It has been misunderstood because it lacks the "social comment" that many day films (1969) have to be successful. <br /> <br /> Characters are the ultimate satires of everyday people, played by all actors. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines as bright as Lord Foppington, a noble, whose hair is too big to fit in the door. <br /> <br /> The plot has the usual 18th century stuff; erroneous identities, corrupted romans, corrupt government officials and jokes at every step. <br /> <br /> This answers questions: What happens when 4 rambunctious, keen party seamen are on vacation in a small British coastal town? And who can do it and how does it all develop? <br /> <br /> Despite being in a bad office, it has great costumes, great music (based on the same Mermaid theater music), great, lively action and obviously authentic sets. <br /> <br /> The fact that it has never been published on VHS or DVD is really a shame because so many bad movies are released every day.
