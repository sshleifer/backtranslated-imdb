After a long hard week at the table, all these serious decisions made this movie a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original broadcast, this movie will take you to an alien's humor and a sci-fi paradise. â€œCaptain Zippo died with Buick's great responsibility. He was a brave man. The impressions of Jack Nicholson appear through this alien's face with dark sunglasses and leather jackets. And always remember to avoid the "death war"! Remember the first rule of this movie - stop the infidelity - sit back and relax - and "Prepare to die on earth!" You must see it yourself.
