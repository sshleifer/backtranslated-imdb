I saw it on television for so long that I don't remember when it was, but it is still one of the most frightening, most alarming movies I've ever seen. At the same time, the woman has a subtle but intense fear of black color at the edge of the frame, which is not quite visible, so you (like a lawyer hero) are not sure if it is just imagination or not. It is also one of the few films that have had to look at me. "Production values" are hanging, good films relate to the director's ability to create an atmosphere using movies, actors, locations / sets, music, attention to detail, and ... imagination. A real pearl.
