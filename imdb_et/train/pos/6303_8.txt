Having heard quite positive comments and seen the trailer, I had to watch this movie. William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present this good. And it happened. All in all, the movie is not funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is classic in my eyes. SPOILER At the end, where they break through the wall to get safe and we see that Rockwell and Washington are just looking fantastic at Jeter. It's as good as a scene at Big Lebowski, where Dude uses his door as a barricade, but forgets the door out! END SPOILER Just go see this movie, you don't have to be disappointed.
