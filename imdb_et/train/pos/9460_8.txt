I loved this story. Somewhere, the poster said that this film had no such families. Maybe it should be there. I thought everything seemed really human and plausible. What is Upper Spirits? What a great music track. Nice and nice, but most importantly, I say two words to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> She really liked the fine depth that touched me. He was indeed a widow who had devoted himself, perhaps too much, to being a good father, denying his own needs. <br /> <br /> Did he act like a deceptive ass? Why, yes, he did it. <br /> <br /> And that's what was perfect for this movie. The actor who played the mark made me believe he was seeing something, and not just ACTING as he felt something, and he gave me what he was, and what he felt denied. <br /> Refused Luck. <br /> <br /> The refusal failed. <br /> <br /> Banning Love. <br /> <br /> Losing love is a painful incredible and many who do it never know something like that again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight out of ten.
