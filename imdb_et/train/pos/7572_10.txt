I just can't believe these games get so much better, but they do it. Unfortunately, I had to rent it for DreamCast, but although I won it, I can't wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games I have to have all of them even when I have beat them many times. I hope they will not end this type of game even when the series has to end. <br /> <br />
