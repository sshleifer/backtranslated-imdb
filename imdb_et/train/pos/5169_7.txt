I saw this movie in the last five or ten minutes in 1998 or 1999 one night when I drank before bed, and really liked what I saw. Since then, I've been on the watch tower, not washed on TV lists, turned through the DVD / VHS shelves in stores, but haven't found recently when I found out that some online stores sold it. Then, being a world-class procrastinator, he still didn't order it. Finally, a few weeks ago, I found a DVD copy of Circuit City in Portland. Then it took only one month after returning home before sitting and watching. <br /> <br /> So what do I mean by a movie? This is good. Not as good as I remembered and hoped, but still worth $ 9.99 paid me. After seeing the whole movie for the first time, I appreciate it as 7/10, which can get 8/10. I must then be less sleepy and have a better sound system to avoid rollback to catch some dialogue.
