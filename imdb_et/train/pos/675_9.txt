David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, quite good) is a lawyer who can better deal with corporate taxation (and suffers from unusual dreams that disturb him when he sees this aboriginal man in the darkness). for those Aborigines who have been accused of murdering one of their own names, Billy. we see that he is trying to steal the stones with ritual paint and is killed when the aboriginal tribe leader Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses "deadly bone" to stop his heart. Meanwhile, turning around David, the strange weather conditions affect Sydney, such as the rain that collides with the hail of contaminated dirt and rock size during the blue sky (without looking at clouds like the one that strikes Central Australian school), not to mention the "deformed" rainbow, divided into (!) groups. As David continues, he finds that he is much closer to the strange events that happen when he could ever understand. One indigenous person named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears to him in a dream with a rock of blood, and he finds that this man is one he represents in the trial! He thinks it is quite possible, after some strange encounters with Charli and his conversations with Chris, that he may be very much attached to the spirit of the name Mulkurul and that his dreams are possible fears that are still ahead. <br /> <br /> Absorbing apocalyptic drama builds this story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. Peter Weir is in charge of the film visually when we see these superfluous images of the possible destruction of civilization, but the most convincing corner of the film is definitely David's journey to find the monumental truth that undoubtedly exposes him when he undoubtedly doubts Charlie and Chris. Help your men out of the criminals they didn't do, and finally find out what he's doing about something catastrophic, what's happening or might happen later.
