This movie shows the peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows people who humiliate other people and are cruel to other nations. This shows that people cannot communicate with or talk to others. <br /> <br /> I've been screened for people who left in the middle because they couldn't watch the movie anymore. And right. Because the movie cannot be viewed and easily viewed. It has a very depressing message and there is no mercy in the film. It's a very cruel movie, not everyone's taste. You can't talk about the enjoyment of this movie. It grabs you in the throat and never let go and finally you feel the breath because of its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend or recommend this movie. You should make your thoughts based on what you said earlier. Note that this is not an ordinary film and it is not everyone's taste.
