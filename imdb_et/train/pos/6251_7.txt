It's not brilliant, groundbreaking, or innovative, but for some reason Dog Days is a very exciting nature training. It's like a bad dose of CRASH heroin, but not really. This is an Austrian film that follows the lives of many depressed, spoiled and irritating people and their abuses. It is annoying, but it has worked very well and it is interesting to look at the little things that these characters do. Certainly not with this weak heart, this very pessimistic film does not end with any conclusion or revelation, but we see the lives of these bad people within two days. Rating: B
