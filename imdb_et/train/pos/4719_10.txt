This movie is why I found this website. I couldn't find this movie anywhere else! I'm so glad we found it here! We've seen it on television before and wanted to find it and buy it desperately, and we have many friends interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it was boring, although I have to say it is NOT. Especially if you're a horse, you love this movie. The horses are fantastic, well trained and the film is well done. Certainly, we buy our home DVD library. We recommend it to our friends. The relationship between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. This is definitely a movie we watch many times.
