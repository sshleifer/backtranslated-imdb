I didn't expect much from this movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised because it was light and funny and very well observed. The central trio of death fighters was surprisingly pleasant when they shared and clowned their drug-driven trip to Wales. Humor was gentle and subtle, as indeed these three characters (witnessing their sympathetic treatment with a small old dampener). The Welsh rural atmosphere was perfectly occupied and the soundtrack was chosen very well. Intelligently and carefully written, pay close attention to detail - I've never seen such a realistic alternative culture depiction - I felt like I was with them. Very light touch and fun - not what you can expect from cyclists and drugs. Joy on all fronts and hard to criticize, though I thought the last two scenes were a bit flat - the film should have ended when leaving Wales. But in general, the film is an unexpected treasure.
