wow! this is a good movie! Action was not good at all, but if you look at some moments of the movie, scroll back and watch it again, it's a genius! At the beginning of the movie, the man walks against his suitcase against three. WOW! I never expected it. Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. I bet the smoker is one of his associates against the three who sold the drugs later. And the geniuses quote, '' Nice tone, I need a pair '' 'of yours ... if you think you can take them.' '.. just Brilliant! And the fight is the best I've seen for a while. Look at the other man he takes when he hits the first boy's head behind the table. WHAT HIT! And in the middle of the movie, one man in the car shot once, then 3 guys fall, he's really good. It costs a lot of men like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that james cahill walks up and down the stairs for 5 minutes and lets jason peters move after the mess. Jason Peters falls off and rolls back when he's dead! I can't say more words about how big this movie is!
