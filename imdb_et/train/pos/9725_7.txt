"How to lose friends and transfer people" is not based on the unreliability of Tiger Woods. This is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book as a journalist covering celebrities. The movie stars Simon Pegg is Sidney Young, a British journalist who works in New York's famous celebrity magazine. The young is restless when he has received all kinds of Shenanigans to dispose of everything around him, so the title of the film. He is terrible, brave and moral. However, for some very strange reason it is somewhat pleasant. With Sidney's friends, he interacts with a journalist, composed by Alison Olsen, who played quite well with Kirsten Dunst. At the same time, Sidney wants to miss Sophie Maes, the actor of sex boys, who plays Fantastic Ms. Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short in terms of functional skill, but on high-mesh material. Sidney comes to all kinds of apple trees to move the journalist ladder in the magazine. These are the top comic moments of the film. I think, however, that Director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straughan may lose some of the viewers and alienated authentic rom-com materials by developing an unreliable romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison; although Team Weidstraughan has otherwise formulated a fun narrative. Pegg put his character on the wire as fun as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges rebuilt the "The Dude" bridges with their mysterious support, as the journalist's mouth presents. But the rest of the film's operation was not worth it. "How to lose friends and transfer people" should not be completely alienated, but you can lose some of your movie friends by advertising it as the ultimate romantic comedy. *** Middle
