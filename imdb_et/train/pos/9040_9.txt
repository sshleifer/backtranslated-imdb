A real healthy American story of teenagers who are interested in starting sports in rural areas of West Virginia after Sputnik was launched in 1957. <br /> <br /> Finally, they can achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, as the leader of the group, is excellent in the role of the title. Laura Linney is quite good as her motivational science teacher, but her southern accent is up. <br /> <br /> Chris Cooper, prime minister, who wants his son to follow his walks, but gradually appear at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so unusual for us is that there's no bed scenes and no fear. This is an American story that is well done. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific perspective, we have a father-son disagreement, a football scholarship to escape a coal mine, and a loving family spirit. <br /> <br /> Why aren't such pictures more recognized during prizes?
