I remember when I saw it for the first time, I smiled so hard that, like many other movies I've seen, the sound didn't come out! Curly is really great in this "singing" opera, I'm surprised she didn't consider a professional singer career because she was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed that it was filmed at the end of Slyoge's Curly career, you could really say she had changed because she had lost weight and was slimmer, her voice deepened, her face wrinkled , although he still pulled out, he looked like fifty years old. It was because he suffered many small strokes before he finished his great career. He still managed to pull him out of his last! <br /> <br /> If you don't mind Curly was really very sick at this point, this is actually one of their most funny shorts. I know I didn't know Curly was really changing because I thought she was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
