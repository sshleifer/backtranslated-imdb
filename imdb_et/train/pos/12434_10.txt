The first film in the proposed series will strike the right balance. It's done with style and class, showing Modesty's beginnings as a refugee and starting to come to power in a criminal world. I think it's a very honest / true image of his character just as writer Peter O'Donnell wrote. Alexandra Staden is a modestly beautiful and wonderful choice. He acts very convincingly as a tough survivor with cool / intelligent / innocent. And the exact signs for Tarantino to choose the role of an unknown actor, which is much more credible to create a new face that creates this part. I'm looking forward to the next movie.
