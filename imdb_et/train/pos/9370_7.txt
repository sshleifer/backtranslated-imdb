I had never seen this movie before, I was wondering if it was an independent film, and I was right, but I decided to do it with good pain. Basically, Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for work and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville JT Walsh), who has been given a large sum of money that has been mistakenly hit by a man who has been hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money and warns Suzannet, and after he makes a counterweight, he decides to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he tracks Michael with a big gun until he gets into Dallas Lyle (Dennis Hopper) in the car. But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle has hit a man he's wrong with, and he's making a quick retreat. She goes back to Suzanne and knowing that they are both in danger, they are planning to leave the city and add another complication to each other. Before they leave, Suzanne requires that they go and steal a large amount of money in the safe. Of course, things do not go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle come to them and Lyle forces them and now binds Wayne to go and get buried. Ultimately, Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne are moving on a moving train, but it's obvious that he cares more about money and he gets what he deserves. Craig Reay also plays Jimina, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart Vice President Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. With the exception of Lame Boyle, the performances are all fine and dandy, and she has a rather good film noir black comedy for the thriller. Very good!
