This movie looked like a classic 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite musician, so when I saw it freely on demand, I had to watch it! He celebrates both Dr. Phibes' films Caroline Munro (he was his wife who died!), Dracula AD 1972, Sinbad's golden trip, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, Spy, who loved me, maniac and sighted. /> <br /> Have those people who are not open on the offshore Christmas and pieces have my thoughts on it ... <br /> <br /> It will open in April on a sunny day, where a lot of kids play a difficult footsteps for a school lover giving her sex in the shower and giving her public humiliation and face in the toilet (all while they're naked!). The coach stops this, but both sides swear revenge. But the cool kids are starting to burn alive. <br /> <br /> Cut the future and its high school reunion, or so they think (bwahahha?). The only ones with invitations were the boy who burned the boy, and the April joke (or, really, the day before the fools, but the fun begins at midnight), but they don't see coincidence and don't talk to school until the evening. Then they finally penetrate the school and start to poison. <br /> <br /> Inside, they find food / drink and a small shrine for everyone, each with their closets and stuff with a Marty (nerd) lock. and Yearbook. They also find an old black janitor / caretaker who spends his time saying, "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I don't want any problems, sir!" and then killed immediately. Pretty meaningless character, but he's still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The film takes out a delicious gory from Alien's book that you just have to see! This is when everyone understands that they are dying, and they will start to scare, except Shirley, who decides that it would be better to have a bath in the bath tub at this time. Of course, it pours blood and acid and his face melts (very cool, remember) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs and Marty kill everything when they wear elbow ... What is their plan? "All we have to do is awake and wait until noon. Marty kills us at noon!" Seriously what he said. Obviously, you can only kill at night. But do they live through the night? Who lives and who dies? And why all the bodies disappear? Rent, buy or steal this great movie! The movie is really very good, full of clich√©s (car starts, DAMMIT!) And just plain fun. Not to mention they are all names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to you all! And not to mention this is Spin Off! The 1989 Cutting Class is the spin-off of this slasher-heritage, and this film begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people who have sex, the guy wants to stop, but the girl is not. "Tell me dirty, Frank!" she screams "Uh ... tits!" "DIRTIER!" "Uh ... tits. F * ck tits. Boobs. F * ck.". It seems to be working for him and at the peak he kills both of them!
