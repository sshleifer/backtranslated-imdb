This movie is very fun. I suggest that you look at it yourself and then check with your friends again. I did last night and it was exciting how well Norma Khouri could pull everything into her world! I felt a bit strange looking at how my friends were going with the same roller skater as I did for the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know, this is a great movie when you spend 2 hours after talking about a movie! <br /> <br /> Once I saw a man almost at the level of Norma Khouri, but not where the ring of the same size was. She fucks a very old Berkeley CA A.A. a group where everyone trusts everyone else. He would only "sponsor" people who looked very good. Who knew he would have stolen more than 100k (in 1987 when it was real money) after he was only one month in town. His victims were very uncertain as they were in their first month or week. He was a big smile and a big smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did for her old neighbor. But I don't want to give away anything. <br /> <br /> I found this one night late in the movie show "Showtim". It is always the greatest experience of film fans to be completely deceived to see something and blow your mind. Just drag your friends to see it and tell them nothing. It's a very entertaining movie, it's moving fast and never bored. <br /> <br /> It should be an international classical class all the time. I believe that all the big movies will eventually rise. Time is great for this movie. I'm just sorry that no one has ever heard of it, in some ways that makes the surprises even better. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were fantastic. They deserved the best documentary film. <br /> <br /> WATCH THE FILM!
