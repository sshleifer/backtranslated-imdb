This wide-ranging drama has everything: top notch, amazing photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films take place in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think it's better for two movies. Jessica Lange gave an incredible result (she should have applied to the Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the worst, despicable signs of film history (called Oscar). John Hurt is great, like Lord Montrose, another unpleasant character. I am always surprised by the incredible amount of characters John Hurt can play. This is a story about money over money between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montros. Rob Roy is a self-made person who does not solve his problems with Montrose if it breaks his sense of respect. Montrose, who got his title, is not honored. And that is basically what this story is; common man's honor and noble corruption. This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to everyone. It has romance, action, a beautiful landscape and an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies.
