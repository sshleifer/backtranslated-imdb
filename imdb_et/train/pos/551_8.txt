Fourth of the five western parts of Anthony Mann made James Stewart, a hard-bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes Seattle from Wyoming to Alaska. He joins Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen), who have sent early to prepare for a boat trip north. <br /> <br /> But first he has to offer unreasonable trajectories, deceive the captains of the riverboats and the charms of the horse, manipulating Ronda's castle (Ruth Roman), who believes that Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future. That's why he hides him on the boat, while the captain is looking for him to kill (and justify) the trajectory. Jeff also has a misfortune when he gets into a stupid judge at Gannon (John McIntire) who heads the city of Skagway in Alaska. Gannon locks Jeff to interrupt his public hangings by running his flock through the city. He fines Jeff for his livestock ownership, and Jeff has to eat right now. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Jeff agrees to deliver Ronda to Dawson for delivery. But it is just a fist that Jeff, Ben and Rube can kick back to Skagway and steal his herd. Of course, Judge Gannon will be aware of this and will be back, but Jeff will be on a rifle while Ben will drive outside Gannon outside the Canadian border. <br /> <br /> After some avalanche and second shoot avoidance, some other Skagway men will eventually reach Dawson, where Jeff will sell his cattle to the highest bidder that just happens to be Ronda, who will then play a new gamble at Dawson. Then Jeff takes his money and buys his claim and starts to tilt the gold. <br /> <br /> But Judge Gannon will come to Dawson to come in and tell Jeff that he will be bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck in Klondike himself. This means that some hired weapons are involved and some other miners' claims are stolen. Jeff and Ben now know that it's time to figure out when the moves are good, leaving Rube to fight for the most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They're just looking to get out of Gannon men because Ben made a mistake in opening his mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is seriously wounded, but it does not save Judge Gannon from his time. A finished shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street quite takes care of it. First of all, Jeff kills two of Gannon's best forces (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). When Ronda warns Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip behind him, Gannon returns him and dies in Jeff. Then Jeff kills Gannon when he hides the tree under the pavement. Revenge has spoken. <br /> <br /> This is another blasting west that is right there from NAKED SPUR and MAN LARAMIE. Why Universal DVD uses over-and-scans printing over TCM instead of widescreen printing is beyond me. You will end William Daniels' lost half of the famous Alberta cinematography. So if you like the well-written 50's westerners, this is the A-list keeper. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
