Recently I had the pleasure of seeing Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival, and I have to say that this is the best film I've seen all year round, and the only movie I've ever felt inspired to write commentary / review. This film was beautifully directed and combined the script with realistic dialogues, superb performance and inspirational message. Ordinary lives gather in an adult swimming class and become extraordinary in celebrating the diversity of life. This is also illustrated by the images made in the first minute of this fascinating film, where we only see the feet and torsos of people of different shapes and sizes entering the water body. This movie is superbly targeted because actors are positioned and placed in exciting scenes that keep your attention and imagination.
