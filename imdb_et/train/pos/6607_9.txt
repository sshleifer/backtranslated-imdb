I'd give almost 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts and sections that randomly control the film's flow / consistency. The story is great and well prepared; you definitely want to look at it quietly to fully understand it. The characters are complex and so is the story, wait for him to be given enough information to stop his head from scratching, this is a movie where everything is finally explained. Animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and movie noir brings a great movie that is nothing else I've seen in animation. It is a black-and-white film and its silent darkness with some scenes, so it's worth watching at a good T.V or plasma. The characters store this movie in their English version, but it would have been more convincing if the French accents emphasized that what is happening in Paris, I enjoyed it more in French with English subtitles. All this is worth buying a DVD or BlueRay if they do! And personally, if you enjoyed this movie, you may also like it; Waking up life and spirit in Shell 2's innocence, it's just a personal recommendation.
