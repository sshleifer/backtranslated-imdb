It was late for this exhibition - I believe it was the first and last episode when it was first watched - and it was blown away by a social comment that is not seen on American television, as "All in the Family." <br /> <br /> It was very surprising that CBS was running it first. <br /> <br /> What is it just to say that the last time CBS had a set, if you know what I mean - it was back in 'Everything in the Family'. The most controversial decision they are trying to resolve today is how many eyes are put on Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a lot of people really, really crazy - let them discover the truth about yourself. And if you want them to pull strings, call and remove artwork - let them discover this truth by listening to their own words spoken from their mouths. <br /> <br /> The people of Aardman have always been ahead of the curve. And this show is no different. Sometimes it got CBS "corporate / social / political / censor radar" to get it on schedule (maybe the "big brass" never saw it until it finally arrived?), But how good was it Merika heard and saw herself - well, you can bet that the message or messenger won't last long. <br /> <br /> Now if only "lost episodes" find their way to Usenet or bit torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
