It was led by Ruggero Deodato, a real icon for many horror fans after he led the half-hearted and infamous Cannibal Holocaust. But don't expect to find a movie that is viewed here, as it turns out to be incredibly customary and plays more like Conan's inspired outing for a young audience. <br /> <br /> Such a description can instantly distract fans of most of Conan's inspired Sword & Sorcery genres, but before you turn your nose on it, it's just that fun! <br /> <br /> Laughs and has two huge and very pleasant heroes David and Peter Paul aka. Barbarian brothers, both of whom seem to have their own characters. <br /> <br /> B-movie favorite Richard Lynch appears as the main cable and is also good at Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Additionally, ladies have been stunned and kept in the right way throughout the movie's duration (staple and much appreciated ingredient in the genre!) <br /> <br /> What can I say - it's just a very fun and easy spiritual genre and i recommend it with all my heart!
