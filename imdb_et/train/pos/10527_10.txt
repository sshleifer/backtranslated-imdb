This is one of the best films I've seen for years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but he's a great Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is excellent as Reverand Elton and Sophie, Emma Thompson's sister, are hysterical like Miss Bates. And look at the gorgeous Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; what a gentleman! Who has said that you need sex and violence in the film has never seen Emma. I think it distinguishes it from so many others - it's stylish. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with your whole family or look for romance for yourself, look no further. Emma is this movie. In a beautiful environment, with a wonderful costume and outstanding pain (have I mentioned the gorgeous Jeremy Northami?) Is Emma the perfect ten!
