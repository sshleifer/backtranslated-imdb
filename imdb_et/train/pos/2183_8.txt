Billy Wilder is a story co-funded and his unpleasant touch is noticeable in this rather original story of ghostwriting songwriters who both work on the burnt music legend Oliver Courtney. Obvious misunderstandings have come out quite quickly, thanks to heaven, and again remain a wise and tiring part with some fine songs (and some still unforgettable), Crosby's more charming, big round Broadway legend by Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant, that provide most of the cynical barbs (Levant is a rare form and his whips are not dated at all). Pleasant surprise and recommended for all genre fans.
