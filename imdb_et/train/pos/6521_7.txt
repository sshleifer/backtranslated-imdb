Considering the time it was done, I found this worthy movie. Although the details may be "dramatic", the whole history was a beautiful plot. In addition, I found striking artists I felt real joy. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a silly shot? I'll leave the rest of the star with you. In secondary casting, this film (as expected from a film made at the end of the thirties) is a much-liked character to the character, but top documents to Andrew Jackson's right hand to Peavey. Perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with nice ships and competent action all the time, I recommend it to someone who has a taste in the camp, or a double piece placed at the American dawn and at a time when great names and top-notch characters were a real pleasure to enjoy.
