Okay, it goes without saying that this movie will only turn to a certain audience; namely stoners and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> Let's say that if you are one of those people, this movie is BLACK. In fact, I think it should be obligatory to sell a copy of it in the main shops to anyone who buys their first bong. With the Holy Grail of Monty Python being geeks and nerds, this is a movie for the Potheads. I saw this movie for the first time ten years ago and I still break every time I watch it. Jokes fit perfectly with the pothead lifestyle, which is much better than in recent days, like the Half-Baked test. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to say; film is a collection of different skits; when movies stop in Los Angeles with their legendary fog. Nevertheless, the film has a very good pace and not at all. Many people cite smoke as C & C's best work, but I have to say that the next movie is better. <br /> <br /> So if you feel an hour and half of your stomach laughs, light up, tune in and let your mind swim =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
