As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) took my younger brother to watch this movie, although secretly I hoped it could be East East II. Trailers looked fun, so I thought I'd give it a go. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but after that I was glued to the screen and it had nothing to do with sitting in front of the cramp-packed audience. The action was fresh and lively, engaging characters and jokes were really funny. The whole audience laughed out every minute. A football fan or a football fan, sport became important to the basic principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the best British comedy I've seen for a long time, dare to say it's better than the East. <br /> <br /> Go nicely, at a beautiful pace, never longer than necessary, and leave nothing to stop, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally busy. Although it is not a characteristically twisted and twisted film, there are some pleasant surprises so things may not always happen the way you think. <br /> <br /> By saying this, there were elements of predictability, but they were used more than a script filler. I think you can end up for the end, depending on your specific wishes for a happy ending. Personally, if I had any other result, I would have written a strongly worded letter to script writers. <br /> <br /> As far as the actors are concerned, I have to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) did the best. I never knew that such people existed, but his reality sometimes with odd concepts has convinced me that they can do it! The award for the most convincing (main characters) will unfortunately be to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but don't get me wrong, even if he offered great results, it's just that someone has to be the best and the worst Kiera, this time you're the one . <br /> <br /> Tip: Don't leave before the credit. When the lights came back, I realized that I shouldn't have seen that movie. My beloved but forgotten ice Junkie had melted in a sweet blue juice. Oh, what I say, it was completely brilliant and I can't recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it and add it to my 3 videos collection. I'm a student. I only bet out if it's really worth it.
