First of all, I loved göta channel 1, it was a lot of classic jokes, including this unhappy man canoe who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, he still acts the same man göta channel 2 movie, but in my opinion his performance is not as funny as it was on the first movie, in fact you don't notice him at all. The thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats, this film has only competition boats, they are sure they are fast, but they don't make waves like big floating manors used in the first movie, I liked the old ones better and these new boats make one of the last scenes ridiculous when a canoe man jumps out of it suddenly to avoid the "big waves" of small fast boats. Really minus. You must agree that we are no longer living in Sweden as in 1974. This film also contains a bit more violence than the first. Though the film was big at all. I'm just focusing on some of the disadvantages I was disappointed with, but the rest of the movie was up to my expectations, so look at it! It's worth the money.
