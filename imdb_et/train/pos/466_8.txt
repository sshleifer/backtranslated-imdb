It was an exceptionally good historical drama. John Turturro is great as a tortured genius of Luzhin and perfectly depicts the manic effect of character as his strange dance. Emily Watson is fine in her support role as a sensitive lover Natalia. <br /> <br /> Gorris and familiar Nabokov troubles, such as "eternal innocence" (ie "Lolita"), are well researched. in this movie. I think I'm going to read the novel now. It was touching and the tragic end and keeping the dry eye was hard. Brilliant movie!
