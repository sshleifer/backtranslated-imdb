You will be forgiven for believing that the head of Helsinki from Finland would not be good at leading an American horror film (especially one that is entirely in a US prison) - look at it to prove yourself wrong! It was produced in the 80s and the film was made for a budget that was better suited for modern DIY TV commercials (which I think someone would notice today, practically everyone is accustomed to $ 100m + budget animated films that dominate the industry mindset!) Being Mr Harlini the first major production and - at least what is today considered a constellation. I still think that most of the Nordic contributions to the film industry as a whole are related to the screening of Stellan Stargaard (not mentioning the overestimated efforts of Mr Bergman) - at least for all female viewers - but this flick really proves that there is a decent outside of the US and Hollywood movie talents to make a movie to watch. Try and watch this movie even if you are not in a horror, IMO, it's definitely worth it!
