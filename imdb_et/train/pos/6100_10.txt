It's really a funny (and sexy) movie - it's not just silly, it's a big deal. This is a movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel connected to the theater with everyone. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival and often found myself loud with everyone else, and some of the serious parts of the movie moved. It's a unique movie from two doctors, and I don't want to give up, but there are some powerful scenes, and really funny - plus the dialogue is great. Wooden Harris character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their roles. If you have the opportunity to see it - go - you will not be disappointed. It's worth it again. Wood Harris deserves a prize.
