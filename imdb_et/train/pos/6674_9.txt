The first thing I thought after watching "Mystery Men" was how would this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so wonderful and funny that it is the status of a bomb against logic. Well, I hope that in the future it will become a cult strike and you can count on me as a fan of youth. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and without leaving too much, this movie makes for the cartoons "Princess Bride" made fairy tales and "Who's the frame of Roger Rabbi?" made classic cartoons. This should give you a more accurate picture of the film's tone, then it was unfortunately signed by the Market Committee (this is one of the cases of the Iron Giant, where the studio had no idea what it had on hand). Rent it the next time you are somewhat amazing. You never listen to BeeGees in the same light.
