First of all, anyone looking for a meaningful "result-oriented" cinema that wraps some social message into meaningful performances and a soul-seeking dialogue spoken by dedicated, emotional, heartfelt people, please leave now. You waste your time and life is short, go see a new Brangelina Jolie movie, enjoy good shouts, go out and buy hybrid cars, or throw away your conflict diamonds if it makes you better and leaves us alone. br /> <br /> Don't let the door go out. POSSIBLE APPROVAL MARK is a B-class minus regional horror pair that a young, TV-friendly cast and a team strikes at the waste of Oklahoma, and as regards astronauts who are exposed to strange radiation effects, wakes up in the hospital and finds that his body is in liquid because he is sitting there feeling like chump. The melting man is played by one of Alex Rebar, who is recognizable during the first four minutes of the movie. But when he recalls the extraordinary special effects of Rick Baker with Oozin, he remembers more of what you might find in spam before you clear all the dirty, viscous lubricants. <br /> <br /> The film has a zero exposure and does not talk about plot points: there are some scenes associated with the types of scientists moving around with an absurd industrial conveyor machine, who are required to describe a couple of mandatory rows of radiation, but the film doesn't really care. It's a nice show and a wonderful one with a clear sense of humor for those who can do it in the stomach - One big laughter comes when a melting man stumbles on a forest for a young girl and is so lost what to do when one of her eyes jumps out. Funny. <br /> <br /> The "hero" of the movie is Burr DeBenning, an exciting character actor in the 1970s and 80s TV show, which was an early model of the Kevin Spacey prototype; slightly twisted, neurotic and one step ahead of the most in the room, even if it looks confused. He appeared just after this film was made in the form of a horror piece of TV-anthology called HOUSE OF THE DEAD (or ALIEN ZONE), which is considered one of the best films ever made in Oklahoma. This is where I suspect this film was made. The dry, frost-resistant western landscapes of the countryside are certainly the same, and the stream that one unhappy voyager chooses in the afternoon of sport seems to be the same as Cameron Mitchell fought for flying aliens' pancakes without having ... sick sense of humor, TV-friendly cast and some pretty annoying gore. I certainly feel at least an aesthetic connection between the three films, as well as LAMBI SILENCE, which is not surprising given that the director Jonathan Demme is part of MELTING MAN. <br /> <br /> In essence, as others have pointed out, this is the plot of the 1950s B movie that has been upgraded to the special effects and inevitable breasts of the 1970s. The film he apparently borrowed is PHANTOM FROM SPACE with Peter Graves as an astronaut who will return after he has been hit by funky radiation effects that put him down for killing. One thing I admire about the film is that the motivation of the fused man is not taken into account. He just goes on a rampage and the movie drama comes from thinking whether he will start to fall into pieces before certain characters fall into his madness. The film's budget is also delightfully low, and every dime spent on it is on the screen, with Rick Baker's disgusting influence that gives the lion's share of whatever it was spent on. <br /> <br /> The sick and nasty fun enjoyed with friends and a lot of beers. Why can't people make such movies? <br /> <br /> 8/10
