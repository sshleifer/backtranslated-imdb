I remember that Balanchine's changes to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last part of the Grossvatertanz (traditional tuning at the end of the party) is repeated several times to give the children dance before the end of their scene. <br /> <br /> 2) The violin solo written but deleted from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty score is interpolated at the end of the party scene and transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship with the growing Christmas tree music that was going to happen soon after. <br /> <br /> 3) The Sugar Plum Fairy Cavalier solo has been eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine has lost Tchaikovsky's excellent result in some way is wrong.
