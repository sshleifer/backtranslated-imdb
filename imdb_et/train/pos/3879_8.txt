A typical Clausen movie, but not typical again. Clausen writes, directs and plays a leading role. It's really a great movie about the normal people who live in a normal life, trying to make the most of it. The 4 main participants were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You believe he's really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a sister who is actually an actress, but it turns out she is the best man who takes care of the old man. <br /> All have problems and those who don't believe are happy. But nothing good is easy, they have to fight to win their life and love.
