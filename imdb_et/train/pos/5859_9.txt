This cool Marvel superhero game pays the right respect while remaining against the comics. Of all Marvel's superheroes that are so flat with poor graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also includes the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. <br /> <br /> As you think Spiderman will do what the spider gets. It does more than spin webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. If he does not use the battle on the net, he will also kick out. Spidey is full of hands when fighting with Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for the captain to America. <br /> <br /> Most levels are difficult, but some require patience. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and ready in less than three hours. If you are a true Marvel superhero fan then this game is for you but does not expect a long game. Better luck "Spiderman 2." My Rating: 9 out of 10.
