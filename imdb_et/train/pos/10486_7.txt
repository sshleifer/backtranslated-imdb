"Saving Grace" is never funny funny, but it gives quite a lot of good laughs and I enjoyed it a lot. Brenda Blethyn is a good actor and does a good job of portraying widow Grace, who is staying with growing marijuana to pay off her big debts. Supporting casting also does a good job. The French actor Tchecky Karyol has a funny little role. The assumption alone is tempting. The idea of ​​a mountain-growing woman and a smoking pot sounds funny. And the film plays wisely with every assumption. There are, of course, some moments, like one where two older women got lost in Grace's marijuana leaves as tea leaves, and they start to draw kindergarten roses in the shop where they work. It was a pointless gag that didn't quite work well. The film's tone is slow and occasionally boring, but I have a laugh to give this English suggestion. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
