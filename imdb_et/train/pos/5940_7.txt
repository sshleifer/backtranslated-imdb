this trailer with a short film is basically a collaboration between Superman and Batman and forms a troubled alliance. Obviously, two characters have very different views on how to deal with crime and which is a punishment. to get along. I'm not going to the intro here. but i'm going to the actors that are amazing. everything is well cast. Two actors who play Superman and Batman are well suited to their characters. did Batman: Dead and Grayson from this short movie, I thought it was the least, but I thought it was well done.
