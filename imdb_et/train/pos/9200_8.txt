I have read countless posts about the game that is so similar to Max Payne when I first played it, when I thought it was a bit of a strange arcade-like game called Max Payne's style (not just bullet - time). So when I played it for a few hours, I realized how fun it was! and how different from "Max Payne", yes, the bullet time is a bit similar, but I think it fits differently in the style of the game. This game is a non-stop action - a mix between shoot'em and fighting games, as fun as Max Payne's big fan, I have to say that the DTR story is not close to Maxi's Payne, the graphics are a bit average and some levels seem the same, but if you want a little more of this "bullet time" then you should definitely have this game.
