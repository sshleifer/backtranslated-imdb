This is a very good, undervalued action / drama / and a little historical film. <br /> <br /> The main story is related to Rob Roy's loan of Â£ 1,000, theft and the problems that his family and indirectly his clans have. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is the amazing villain and character of this story. Brutally cold and when you look at his face, he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and completely evil. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also great, but I think writers used this word. "1 too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie has worked well and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the sword plays very realistic but not too big. is good and you want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> The whole class is just shy.
