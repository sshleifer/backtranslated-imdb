This is one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie was directed by Larry Clark, this story would probably have been shown in the murderer's eyes, and whatever made this man mad.

The only other film I've seen with Erika Christensen is the "Swimming Fan", which made me almost unwilling to watch this movie, but she turned very well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films I've seen that I can cry with. Trust me when I tell you that it doesn't happen very often. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a beautiful movie and it's all too ...
