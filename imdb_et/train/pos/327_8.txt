I've read one comment that marked this movie as "trash" and "waste of time". I think this person got too much of his political panties. <br /> <br /> I just rented a new yellow and blue criteria DVD. <br /> <br /> These films - though hardly big - have at least become a historical interest in the so-called "radical student <br /> <br /> political-social movement". '60s. <br /> <br /> I did not see any image and their notorious reputation, I <br /> <br /> waited for real porn (none.) There is a front <nudity (including still verboten foreskin nudity (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 - Orwelli-X) In the US, but I did not expect movies <br /> <br /> democratic socialist message. <br /> <br /> it happened occasionally <br /> <br /> well. I laugh out loud <br /> <br /> and the director's comment explained that the film has a lot of parody. The first such scene is very realistic, the lead pair in the first copulation picture is clumsy, incorrect, funny and cute. <br /> <br /> The second - which caused most complaints - has been fake <br /> <br /> Cunnilingus and fellatio. And the latter is an angry fight that is plausible. a, <br /> <br /> excerpts from the US testimonial and "diary" comment <br /> <br /> about some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that "blue noses" would not say and led to the principle of "prime interest without social redemption" <br /> <br /> that Luckily still stands. <br /> <br /> Those interested in historical characters will find this black <br /> <br />.
