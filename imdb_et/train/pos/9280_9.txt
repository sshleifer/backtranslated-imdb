In Iran, women are officially banned from sports events for men. In June 2005, Iran's national football team will play an important role against Bahrain in the Azad Stadium for the World Cup qualification. A group of Iranian girls and lovers of football dresses like boys and is trying to successfully enter the stadium where they were arrested. <br /> <br /> Football (and the Flamengo team), beach and movies are my greatest passions; that is why I loved this little pearl for a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi, "White Balloon", "Mirror" and "Ring" shot this movie on the day Iran won Bahrain and qualified for the World Championships in Germany. The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not Available
