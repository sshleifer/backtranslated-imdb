They looked at both parts twice. Enjoy this story and enjoyed seeing Patrick Swayze as a hero. He was very likely to be a hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly Richard Chamberlain's performance. I admit that I would have preferred to see someone other than "Lady in Distress". Alison Doody should stay with modern and not periodic pieces. He had no woman of the 1800s. The rest of the casts were terrible and they followed the drawings very well. I am pleased to see that the participants of this generation are not afraid to try different symbols and are not afraid that they will be viewed as aging. Age is inevitable, but don't hide it. A 50-year-old man can be much more sexy (and Patrick is really sexy), then green young, no matter how beautiful. Hoorah for characters with a big smile.
