During the magic, barbarians and demons have a lot of notorious tyrants named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliane, who lives in the ice class and wants to conquer the fire that King Jerol is ruling, but when her beautiful daughter Princess Teegra is kidnapped by Nekhron's goons, the warrior named Larn must protect her and must hit the Nekhron to take over the world and the kingdom with the help of the avenger called Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> The well-made and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic that Ralph Bakshi's second best movie "American Pop" is number one and "Heavy Traffic" is the third and "Wizards" is fourth. It's definitely better than his "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", art by the famous artist Frank Farzetta, and the animation has a good color and boys have a hottie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere, especially from the new 2-Disc Limited Edition Blue Underground DVD. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "The Black Cauldron", "Dark Crystal", "Conan Barbarian", "Ozi Wizard", "Rock & Rule", "Wizards", "Heavy Metal", "Starchaser: Orini legend, "The fantastic planet", "Princess Mononoke", "Nausicca: The Wind Valley" "Conan The Destroyer", "Willow", "The Princess's Bride", "The Lord of the Rings" (1978), "The Sword of Stone", "Excalibur "," Army of Darkness "," Krull "," Dragonheart "," King Arthur "," Hobbit "," King's Return "(1980)," Conquest "," American Pop "," Jason and Argonauts "," Clash of Titans "," The Last Horn "," NIMH Secret "," Dragon Flight "," Hercules (Disney) "," Legend "," The Chronicles of Narnia "," Harry Potter and the Fire ".
