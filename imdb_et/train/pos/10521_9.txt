Well, I think I'm emotionally attached to this movie because it's the first one I've seen in the cinema more than 10 times ... helping me through my master thesis or rather keeping it working! <Br>> <br /> But if you look at it again for several years (and many movies) later - what this well-designed little pearl is like! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing way, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr Knightley - where does such a man meet? << <sigh> >> The times of Sophie Thompson, when Mrs Bates is a virtuoso acting best (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest is not disappointing - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming - Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson is the perfect "impossible" couple! <br /> <br /> Naturally, costumes and costumes and a beautiful soundtrack for a sensitive, almost Hobbiton-like movie - are a cinematic and artistic decoration, almost a case of visual overload. Very beautiful, but a bit more austerity measures could have given a better time period. But it is good that the film does not take itself too seriously and there are a lot of fun - and some pretty cool edits - that keep it from drowning in the sacrament Merry Old England mode. <br /> <br /> My particular favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful actors and directions here, and the summarizing dance will bring together the relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley just fine. It is a pity that the scene of the final proposal will only last a little too long - cut two frames (I mean exactly what!) And it would have been much more consistent with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Gosh, I just understand (reading the imdb lists) that I've seen Jeremy Northam in at least three movies, even knowing it was him - he seems to have much more than an actor than just being a gentle English conscience! Hmm, I think I have to pay for a video shop visit ... <br /> <br /> Cute movie. Customizing my favorite Jane Austen so far - although Ang Lee's mind and sensitivity is, to put it bluntly, a better film, it's closest to my heart - and I've seen much more! Look at it when you can - and don't be too small for your small drawbacks. <br /> <br />
