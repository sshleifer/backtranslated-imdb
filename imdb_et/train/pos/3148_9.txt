I love this example. Period. I'm not really very long, probably only about six months old, but now it's my favorite show and probably it's been some time. I love all the symbols except if I don't care about Donna. I'm not sure why. I just can't find him funny and I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actor. Besides, I think the rest is pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Eric's parents, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I didn't hate the 8th season completely. I still look at it and it makes me laugh. But if you compare it to exhibitions in earlier seasons, it's not good. Randy is terrible. Finale was decent, nothing wonderful, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave but well. I have the fourth season on DVD and one day I hope I have all eight season DVDs. Some of its most entertaining episodes, in my opinion, were Dine & Dash, Grandmas Dead, Red & Stacey, and Streaking, but I love all the episodes I've seen so far, most of them, I think. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
