In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made television too young, both playing almost the same parts in California. In California, there is no doubt that this has led to their casting in this big-screen movie. writing a book and getting serums into the minds and souls of the killers. In fact, he has planned the most unusual odyssey, he wants to go across the country and visit the killers of several famous serums. But he and Forbes have broken. <br /> <br /> Fate interferes more than financially with Brad Pitt's and Juliette Lewis's odd lunch-type arrivals, who agree to share their gas costs with this country. It turns out that Pitt is an independent killer, and he decides to do some little research into the mind of a person who is fascinated by immorality. <br /> <br /> California is not a typical movie that I usually go to, but it really works and the charisma of Brad Pitt makes it a great job. Pitt is a definition of walking the English Gothic refugee. But better than he is, Juliette Lewis, who again plays those low self-esteem types that she looks good. Look at your scene with Forbes, because she does her hair and Lewis describes her sadness and pathetic life. The Lewis Dialogue and Forbes reactions should be shown in actress classes across the country. <br /> <br /> For those who want their slasher cinemas, they are no better than California.
