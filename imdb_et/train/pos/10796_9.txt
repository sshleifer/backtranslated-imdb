If you are a fan of one or both of Chuck Norris & Judson Mills, this is watching the movie. It's a lot of adventure. It's a great follow-up to the president's man. Chemistry between the three main stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is incredible.My personal opinion.This film with the original has proven so well that the networks should consider turning it into a normal series. recommend this movie to you. If you have seen the president's man: the sand line, but you have not seen the president's man, then let me suggest that you do.
