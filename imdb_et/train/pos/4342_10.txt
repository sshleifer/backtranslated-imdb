This movie didn't surprise me because it got better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote it? Well ... we see how he does ..." Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. I appreciate Colombo. Although I was never a big fan, I've always liked watching Peter Falki. <br /> <br /> The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like I was flying on the wall. They played so well that I was happy to have fun! ... And I wasn't even drinking! <br /> <br /> This movie was so well done that I wanted to get Paul to the right and let him know how much I enjoyed it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted or something like that. <br /> <br /> It was one of those films that I had no idea what it was or what it was or something. It just came and I thought, "Eh, why not? Let's see. If I don't like it - I don't have to look at it ..." ... and I just finished love!
