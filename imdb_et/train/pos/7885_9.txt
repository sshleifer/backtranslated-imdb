First of all, I have to start this remark by saying that I am a huge fan of Nightmare Elm Street. I think it is the greatest horror story ever. Freddy is boogeyman for me! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who tried to be the last chapter, is a strange film. It does not have the same atmosphere as the previous films. Fredd has a lot of screen time. Some think it makes him less intimidating, which I agree with. And that is exactly what I think is the point. This movie exists so we can find out a little better Freddie who he is, who he was, how he could haunt the dreams. For some people it is bad, it is better than we never know, because it is more terrible not to know why evil is bad. Of course, these people, like Rob Zombie, do not like Halloween remake. To truly enjoy it, you need to see things differently. It does not mean a strange man who hides your dream in the bush, waiting for you to frighten hell. It was first and it was fantastic. As the years passed, Freddy killed more people and no one could get rid of him. Now is the time to learn about the evil nature of the psychological aspects of Freddy's terrorist attack. Besides the story of Freddy's past, he liked the atmosphere of the film. There are no more children in Springwood, only crazy adults. Dirty scenes are all great. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially the opening song called 'I'm Awake Now' by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, the ultimate nightmare is a masterpiece of horror and I can't believe it is so underestimated. Maybe it's misunderstood or have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has many frightening moments and also funny moments and lots of fiery! Take something else yourself and you may not be disappointed.
