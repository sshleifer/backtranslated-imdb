My choice for the biggest movie ever was Laughton's "Hunter's Night", which remains excellent in my canon. But it can be replaced by a "shower", the most artistic daoist movie I've seen. This is how caring for others is a way of water flow and the way water gets inspiration and comfort and cleaning and so on. It is the nature of Dao. It is possible to argue that the NOFTH and Shower shower themes are similar and that Lillian Gish represents a cleaner form of Christianity in the former, as sauna handlers represent the purest form of daoism. I do not dispute in any way this interpretation. Both films are visual delights in the idea and image integration. At the same time, the shower presents a non-stylized view of the holiness of everyday life that I give it. I'm reviewing both.
