La Teta i la Luna (Breasts and Moon) describes a 9-10-year-old boy named Tete, who is embedded in breastfeeding in Catalunya. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Luna movies (including Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at this age. Also in Catalonia (in the north-east of Spain) it was a lot of memory in my opinion. This movie shows how beautiful Catalunya, nice people, nice life and especially many non-dense people.
