LAST WAVE is never able to win over the general audience. This is a slow moving but exciting movie for those who agree. An Australian real estate lawyer is asked to take against the five aborigines charged with one of their murders. Soon, all kinds of bearers and items will open, as the man's death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for a white man's court, and quite soon a lawyer has problems distinguishing reality from fantasy. The end of the world seems to be within reach, and he and the Aborigines may know it, but no one else does it. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is here at the top. David Guptil, a familiar face from several other Australian flames and decent actors, is one of five aborigines involved in the trial. LAST WAVE is no longer for everyone but is MAGNOLIA (both happen to be strange things in the sky). Check it slowly on Saturday night.
