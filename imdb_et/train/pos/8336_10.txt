This movie speaks to Albert Einstien's niece and romantic. To get both together, Einstien agrees to help Ed (Hudsucker's Prince Tim Robbins) learn to act more intelligently. It impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstien goes too far and Ed is considered a genius. Hilarity arises. Must not be skipped. Filmed in Mercer County, New Jersey, University of Princeton, Lawrenceville Prep School (Doubling at Princeton University) and also a beautiful vintage gas station in Hopewell.
