2 WORDS: Academy Award. Sufficiently said. This film had everything in it. Comedy to laugh at me, drama to cry and one of the biggest dance scenes for Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. Action was at the top of every independent film. Jeremy Earl was top-notch since he had seen Joan Cusack's show. His lines were filled with dynamic precision and most recently shown by a very younger Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next highlight of Denzel Washington as the line "My bus! It's .... Gone" This was the real turning point of the movie. My grandmother loved it so much that I bought her on a DVD and suggested it to my friends. This will bring tears to your eyes and heat when you see a white Tony Donato and an African American Nathan Davis bond. Through a thick (hiding on the knife point) and thin (Nathan gives Tony's clues to women) a new dynamic duo has arrived and they are ready to conquer Hollywood.
