This filmed "Ancient Mariner Rime" presentation is the most beautiful and interesting presentation of Coleridge's poem. The striking cinematography with a collection of two centuries of effort illustrating the epic poem of 1798 by world-renowned artists and the splendid narrative of Michael Redgrave is great to see this great visual work. <br /> <br Television era is such a work that is an invaluable tool to invite both young and adults to explore and learn the value of great poetry. To my knowledge, such work is indeed rare; this is regrettable. As a student of world literature and a former college professor and academic advisor, I feel that more great epic poems such as Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner's Rime" should be "translated". Although I am not a filmmaker, but an avid reader of classical literature, I am happy to recommend making this fine without reservation.
