The idea is a very smart title that has a serious sense of language in the film. But it is so small that you don't know how to read it! Do these men make full-blown comedy or something else. A small dialogue that the film is not very gentle and adds to the film's power. When all the sound was turned off from the movie, it does not really take away from the film. Physical activities or art of displaying are so strong that they carry the whole story independently. First of all, I say this as part of the "black" film festival. After watching the movie, I was so impressed. But then I asked myself what's next? Where does anyone else see this job? There is no common art application here without purpose. In design, you see intent from beginning to end. The use of African music as a style of casting all seems to be planned and the reason. The development of the characters is amazing. I think this is the strongest aspect of the film; The characters are easy to define within 2 minutes of a 6 minute real movie. board.
