The first thing I have to say is that I have Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins), who tries to find her sister. His sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family hasn't heard anything. There's Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) who tells her exactly where her sister is and makes a bid to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. She doesn't work for money because she just wants help and has a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes his adventures into novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's fun, it's packed, it's just great. I think it's a cult film with a very small cult. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws out a few lining that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as a girl and a sidekick. John Hurt, a man who has been bleeding in his belly, is in Alien, playing a devilish, perverse wool that just adds fun. In many ways, this film is similar to Indiana Jones, in some ways similar to James Bond's films. Maybe it should have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever it is, it's a very enjoyable movie.
