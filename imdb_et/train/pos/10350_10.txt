I believe they are telling the truth all the time. Faith doesn't trust anything in nature ... They went through hell. These poor boys were too young to understand what was going on around them. But rumors still need to be heard. They are also losing their little sister. I don't think this case went so long. Just as the jury did not see the truth, even if it knew them. I know this family and if I could tell them I hate what I hated them, I would. I don't know what they went through, I don't even imagine. After watching the movie, I was in tears and had to check my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should watch it.
