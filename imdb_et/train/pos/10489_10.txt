This light-hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value. Sometimes it becomes quite hysterically funny, but if you have not spent any time, you will be out of comedy when it breaks. <br /> <br /> The number of characters is well connected and quite credible in their roles. How Grace will meet a girlfriend of her dead spouses. She's a real lady. And my favorite is the Grace white pimp suit she wears. <br /> <br /> I recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who will rejoice underfeed or want to see something else.
