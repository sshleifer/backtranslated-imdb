Unlike some of the commentators here, you are not driving a class war and not seeing other people who are quite successful, extroverted, bohemian (not terribly in English) and not terribly English. as a result, this is not a bad film that is closer to the cinema of the euro than the imitation of ordinary shiny American crap ... I believe that the minimum sound and low cost camera is a conscious decision, not bad film making, I defend it, the film is not worse as a result , and it makes the light enlighten, some of whom are really good (Kate Hardie - I think it's her name because the sarcastic drunk is on the ground) one exception is David Baddiel, who should never be allowed serious things! It's easy, and we don't go into such anatomical relationships in that country, but if you don't have real friends to go to a party if you could do worse than sit back and watch it.
