This film seems like a film project. Like filmmakers, they chose a social part that lacked experience and could work. But the characters are sort of involved and naive. Despite this amateurish feeling, the film is effective. It is like a cross-section of life with neighboring children who try to understand or cultivate their honest sexual feelings. The shame raised by the great parent, of course, generated by this generation, is related to sexuality. This will provide some predictable but well done conflict. Probably the most pleasant way for the main character to grow in a slightly more romantic relationship was by perceiving a greater depth of sexual feelings. Good clock, but nothing interfering.
