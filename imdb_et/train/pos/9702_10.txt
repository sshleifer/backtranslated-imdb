The city of Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The characters would be just wrong and too distracting, but fantastically brilliant writing means it works and it works very well. Most people feel some signs of touching others, but hopefully no one with extreme people like Tubbs and Edward knows the strangers in the local store hate owners or obsession with Paul, who treats "dole scum" a lot of contempt. It was just some strange residents. TV work consists of three series and a specialty of Christmas. There are references to many horror films, such as witches. There is a film on the selection of later works, the apocalypse of gentlemen, which I do not say much but highly recommend. All in all, the gentleman is a fun comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly large characters. I'd definitely say it's worth checking out if you don't regret it!
