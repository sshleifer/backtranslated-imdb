Steve Carell once again celebrates easy romantic film choices, family and pressure. Judging by the plot and cover art of the film, I waited for a firm comedy, a lot of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I think I was wrong. Of course, the film had some comedy, but it seemed to me that there was much more light, and Steve Carell once again had a great result. The film itself deals with real observations and it was a strong element I found. But at the end it seemed a bit hasty and predictable. Outside, the cinema was excellent, the action was great, and the message was obvious, but still very important. Although it fell to an old, flat and predictable end. I think different choices were made at the end of the film (maybe bad, even), this film would get better advertising. Still a fun movie.
