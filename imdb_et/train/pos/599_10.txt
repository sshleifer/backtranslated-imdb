I enjoyed this movie thoroughly because it was genuine sincerity. Writing was top-notch. James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone play Davy, but Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this movement was Raul Julia, who gave the depth to Santa Anna, who was a vain and complicated person who led Mexico in troubled times. <br /> <br /> While some may think that the film was slow, he hit the battle, a lot of tedium, followed by a few hours of terrible fear. <br /> <br /> What is most impressive about this movie is that it made you think about the cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. I think there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you know the politics of time.
