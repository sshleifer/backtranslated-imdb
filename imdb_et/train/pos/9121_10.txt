SPOILERS USED FOR ISSUING OBSERVATIONS <br /> <br /> Twenty years since 1984, this film talks about Prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that collects Prince's last 10 years of musical output, which means you took the best two songs of your last 10 albums with one fantastic album! <br /> <br /> Scene plays like this. Prince travels after playing one song in his dressing room, and the club owner enters the dressing room to delight the prince in the 90s for falling from grace and displaying albums, which only the heaviest fans could withstand and support his artistic work. <br /> <br /> Club owner - "You don't offer them like you used to. The only person digging your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! How about musical pressure, which makes the prince even worse when he captures Apollonia on the ground in two separate scenes! It gave me the chills that it was not the only scene women who were wrongly treated in this movie. <br /> <br /> I am all about having a comedy between Morris Day and Jerome Benton because these two stole every scene they were in. But what was a funny woman throwing in the trash? It was plain nasty! Another nasty bit was Prince's father's critical area, which was well thought out by the Minneapolis police, making Prince even more beautiful! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is a fun movie because it is the soundtrack for Prince's songs, increasing its value by 110%. But then again, the film gives another theory of the Prince and his music, because the film tells us that Prince's greatest movie song is written by Wendy, Lisa and Princes, who beat his musical father! <br /> <br /> Are Prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that the prince stole all his best songs from his father when he found his father's music sheets in written songs? Perhaps Prince began to run out of steam in the 90s because he went out of his parents' ideas ??? ........... Hmmmm .....
