I love newer episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the story where Kate fell for the principal. I want to know what happens to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the family. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandad. I've always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it's a credit to his behavior that I never think of him in this series of James Garner or Rockford, and I believe him completely as Kate's father. This family is both real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written and dealt with in the series was so funny and sad and always very sensitive and lovingly treated. But in general it is a very funny show with lots of laugh and fun.
