The "Protocol" is a hit-and-miss image starring Goldie Hawn as a effervescent cocktail packer who, one evening, saves the murder attempt of visiting Arabic life. She becomes a celebrity immediately and gets a new job for the US government. Are the power corridors in our country's capital ever the same? Hawn is great as usual, though "protocol" is not as funny as his best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (Four)
