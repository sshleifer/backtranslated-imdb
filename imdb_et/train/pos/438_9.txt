Rainy, ugly late winter in England in the early 1920s ... <br /> <br /> --- where there are still sorrows and many young widows and disabled veterinarians about the great killing of men and the killer of their women - - Now known as I World War ... <br /> <br /> Four women share this small sunny mountain of Italian castle; one young widow who drowns in her sadness with a frantic party, two women who rediscover her husband, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends ... <br /> <br /> These four women come together with two spouses and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "makeover" for one big April holiday in the early 1920s in Italy. <br /> <br /> NOTE to filmmakers who want to. Explore this movie about how mood and beauty can talk. (Probably not a movie for many men ...) <br /> <br /> NOTE. Gather coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls on a somewhat harsh winter day ... Spring has come ... Enchanted April promises you!
