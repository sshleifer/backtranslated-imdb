Cinderella is a beautiful film with beautiful songs. In fact, it is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are amazingly depicted. You can see Cinderella's stepping-off and her stepmom cruelty, Cinderella's sweetness. Mice are also funny and sweet. <br /> <br /> I think they exchanged a little bit, but I think it's the best. It's such a nice movie, and I don't think anyone can stand it deep. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 8/10. I don't think it's the best Disney movie. But it's a sure classic.
