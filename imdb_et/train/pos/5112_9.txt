This movie has everything, action, fighting, dancing, bull riding, music, beautiful girls. This film is an autologous look at Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. A lot of oil money, lots of women and lots of good shades. Too bad they are all gone now. The film is just another boy who meets the girl, the boy loses the girl, the boy gets back to the girl, but it is redeemed by actors and music. The film has no better music, including American Graffiti. This is a movie that I watch over and over and never get tired. Every time I watch it, I'm young again, and it's time to go out honestly. The only reason I only gave it to 9 is that the film's zero cannot be judged, I don't feel you should appreciate 10.
