This film is a journey through the mind of a scriptwriter in his paradoxical philosophy. He will ever study the illusory question "who am I" and "what am I?" It is a bold and thoughtful company. There are beautiful pictures, dream-inspired, paradoxes similar to Escher, that resemble hand-drawing, or rather self-extinction. More and more, we follow the writer in his torture about what to say and film, we see him calling his wife who left for Peru, leaving him to care for his child. he is so absorbed in his dilemma that he hardly looks toward the child. His wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him to go to the last route until he erases himself. Taking pictures of pleasing and destructive images, the story is mainly philosophical. This is the Maya, the census world, of the veils. But the paradox of the film is that it needs a lot of talk and thinking to prove that thinking should end. For more than two hours with provocative beauty and fast philosophy, the film made me a quiet or shorter film. If it was the goal of the maker, he managed to do well.
