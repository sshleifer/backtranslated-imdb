I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old alone in the cellar of my parent on Saturday night. "Chiller Theater" showed this regularly scary feature that I looked religiously young. Now I have seen many old horror films thanks to Chiller Theater, but no one has ever seized me like "Danse Macabre", "a blood castle". I'm now 51, and just last year I managed to find a relatively new, high quality DVD edition with this wonderfully disgraceful supernatural classic, having thought I'd never see it again. I've been watching it four more times and it doesn't seem like tired. <br /> <br /> They are no longer making such horror films. Haunted catacombs and faded cemeteries just don't work in color as they did on a black and white day. Anyway, it is Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, deliciously shady, twilight, haunting castle kits, restless spirits that restore their death ... and the vicious ironic end. <br /> <br /> IMO, it's right there with Robert Wise's "The Haunting", "Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr) and the newer "The Others".
