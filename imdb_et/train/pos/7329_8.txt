I really enjoyed this movie. Humor was sometimes a little missing, but I enjoyed how this story moves between a dramatic and a serious film. This is the only other film where I saw Verdone's action (the other was "Un sacco bello"), and I see why the Italians find him tiring, but he thinks he played his role as a loving father. One of my drawbacks in this movie was that I knew it was happening in Italy - somewhere in the middle or in the south, I think, but I felt that the place was not represented. This film could have been in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehl ... I think movies always have a great place to associate viewers. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you'll enjoy it. It's not Fellini or Rossell - it's neither realism nor neorealism. This is a comic story that has serious moments that could really happen to us.
