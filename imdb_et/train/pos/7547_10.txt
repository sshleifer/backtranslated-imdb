Cat Soup seems to be a very casual animation film at first. The best way I've been able to explain is that it's quite acidic. Although it is not entirely random. The story speaks to a young cat's son, Nyata, and his sister Nyaka. Nyaako is very sick and dies, but Nyatta sees his soul dying and can get it. The story is their quest to bring Nyaako to life. <br /> <br /> Although much of the content of this movie seems totally random, it is not. Most of this is a symbol of life, death and rebirth. You can also see other stories like Hansel and Gretal. This strangely cute short film is an interesting story full of deeper meaning than what you see on the screen.
