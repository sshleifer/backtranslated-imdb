This is one of those movies that you think and return after watching it after a month of watching. The actor is prominent in the starring of two children (usually I hate movies with a small child). Bill Paxton is awesome, his directors debut is even better when I was waiting for an actor whose most memorable line is "Game over, man! Game over!" (from "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the dichotomy of the scenes where the actors play the family and when they do their "work." It really makes the movie credible and memorable. <br /> <br /> Hold on, Bill. I'm still waiting for the movies I really love!
