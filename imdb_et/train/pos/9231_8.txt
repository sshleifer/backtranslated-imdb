FLAVIA HERETIC is a strange entry in the genre of nuns - equal parts of sleaze, feminist journey and "history" when we follow Flavia on her strange journey. <br /> <br /> We will start with a Flavia monastery. He is not too happy that he does not believe in the dominant "rule" and masculinity of all his men, and flees from the monastery with his Jewish salary, Abraham. They are both caught in the end and Flavia is returned to the monastery where he joins another incredible nun to accelerate the Muslim invasion. Flavia hangs out with Muslims who take over the monastery and get a strange scene with nuns. Finally, the expulsion of Muslims and Flavia as a Christian scammer is being punished in another brutal scene ... <br /> <br /> It has quite a few things I want to see in the 1970s. - Some good holes, including nipple removal and nice leg skinning, some decent nudity, including the necessary full-front and decent story. I say this sorta pulled a few points, but it is not enough to be really bored with it. I would definitely recommend it for nunsploit / 70s exploitation fans ... 8/10
