this movie was just brilliant, cast, located in landscapes, story, direction, for everyone, the part they played, and you could just imagine that there is, Robert Redford is an amazing actor and now the same director, Norman's father came from the same Scottish Island like me, so I loved the fact that the film had a real connection, the sharp comments of the movie were great, it was just brilliant, so much so that I bought the movie as soon as it was published for retail and we would recommend it to everyone to watch and fly was amazing, really finished at the end it was so sad and you know what they say when you shout on a movie that has to be good, and it was definitely congratulations to the two little boys who played the part of Norman and Paul, they were just brilliant, kids is often excluded from the list of praise because the stars that play all of them are such a big profile for the whole movie, but these kids are amazing and should be praised for what they have done, don't you think? the whole story was so cute because it was true and there was someone's life that was shared with all of us.
