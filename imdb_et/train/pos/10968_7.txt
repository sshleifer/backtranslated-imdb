The gray gardens were tempting and crazy and you couldn't really look away. It was so strange and funny and sad and sick, and no word can be described. Move Gray Gardens to being odd. I learned from this film that I read my Uncle John's great bathroom reader, the bathroom reader at the institute, and it was worth letting him watch the movie and rent it. This film talks about the most eccentric people that could ever be filmed. You should look at this in your favorite Edie outfit, which is certainly curtains. When I get old, I just want to be like Big Edie pulling my nose towards normal and society.
