"How to lose friends and alienated people" is fun, with the same name as Toby Young's memory. It is also a great title to help meet the IMDb review line requirements! The main task is the same as the dramatic book of certain incidents, but the romantic plot is added and the end is definitely in Hollywood. Simon Pegg, despite playing a really irritating person, is his usual pleasant and funny with himself and pretty much carries the film. Strangely enough, just a few years ago, he was just a TV sitcom man and now rubs with Hollywood names. There's a good supportive cast and it's fun, easy to watch - such a guy "Ugly Betty" but funny.
