Made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often. <br /> <br /> We open a quiet little French village, scanning the roofs of sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. In a serious investigation, the story of two men from two neighboring men, allegedly friends, who chose two numbers for the lottery is discussed. <br /> <br /> The star of our picture has its number and its friend. When he asks his friend, he would share half the dough when his ticket is a winning number, says his friend right away. Actually, H.E. double hockey sticks no! This is how it behaves. <br /> <br /> So if our man discovers that he has won a ticket and that it has disappeared, he will not be fooled by his own fault. Everyone is for himself, looking for this ticket, something like the predecessor of the "Great Competition". Although all of this is a setback, I was always knotted and got a little bit of all this tiny thing that showed me a money-for-money movie. Check out Le Million today!
