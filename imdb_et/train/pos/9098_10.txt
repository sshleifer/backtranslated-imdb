Domestic imports were a great film. I laughed all the time. It was funny so many levels from crazy outfits to fun situations. Operation was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and everyone else did a great job. Because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer, there are no clich√©s that are expected from other comedies that were such relief. It was unique and interesting and you love symbols and a warm-hearted story. I heard it was based on a real story? If so, it's fun (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.
