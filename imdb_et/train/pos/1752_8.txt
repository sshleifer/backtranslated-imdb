SPOILERS Sex huh? It is one of the main parts of human life. But will we ever take it seriously? People always want more, even those who get it every day, and if you're unhappy, there are potential changes in life (creation). Ironically, people all say that we all have sex at a younger and younger age (despite the Victorians getting married and the children in their teens) so that for those who reach the point like virgins, it must be getting harder. On Steve Carelli's first big screen, he plays a man who has got 40 without control. The overall picture of the film and its principle is not funny when we treat countless bones and extreme sex-related incidents, not to mention the embarrassment of the "Eurotrash" episode. It is therefore a pleasant surprise that for all the inappropriate, unsuccessful jokes, there are an incredible number of people who hit the mark and leave the audience in hysterics. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a nice man with good work and pleasant temperament. At the same time, he obviously takes life too seriously and, after being called into the poker game as a fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. At the age of 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for a number of reasons, but mostly regrettable, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) offer Andy with one goal. To take her out of her misery and put her in front. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about Anchorman was just a matter of time before Steve Carell got his lead. Impressively, the "40-year-old virgin" is not disappointing. By showing a hopeless, shy virgin to perfection, Carell is a revelation as she grows more and more confidently as the tips begin to help. <br /> <br /> Carell is not alone in his presentation. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener are all great for love. Rudd is a personal favorite as a love affair with David who breaks down several times and shares the best scene with Rogen, as two argue for homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise about this movie is that so many jokes hit the mark, but in fact it's the smart way to head it on the head of the message. Obviously designed for conservative America, the entire tone of the film evolves from a simple sexual conquest to one of the most safe sex and abstinence. It is not necessary for a virgin to have sex to have her life complete, she just needs trust and true love. Wonderful message for preaching and the remarkable improvement you expect at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is strange to see a raw comedy that is always funny and well-behaved, but a low look, "40-year-old virgin" is just that. Also throw a well meaningful message and you're well on the way to top-notch comedy. Surprising pleasure.
