I only saw it recently, but I had known about it for several years and its title has always been interested in it. It is now part of my favorite film. It's hard to describe the incredible topics discovered by Maysles, but it all works great. It has so many memorable pictures and moments where you feel you are in a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and its characters. Like filmmakers would have created an audience and pulled us into the eccentric Beales, a strange world of a real aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found that I wish I could be away from cooking my corn on my bedside table. It is the air of sorrow that passes through. Once upon a time, a fallen family from being submissive. Money had gone, but their air and grace remained, as well as their beauty. It pulled me from the first frame and long after the movie ended. I was wondering if I walked along East Hampton Beach, maybe I can still hear the old Edie's voice and see a little Edie dance in a window behind a smooth thick hanger. Unforgettable.
