He once again proved his amazing versatility, John Turturro plays an introspective Russian male genius that prepares for a return tournament, and creates unlikely relationships with a female colleague (Emily Watson) at an Italian hotel in the 1920s. They fall in love with his social mountaineering mum (Geraldine James). A great love story that shocking can make this brain visible. But, despite its beginning, Nabakov's story, it is certainly not. Romantic elements and a sense of time and place beat psychological analysis. John Turturro, having appeared in "Barton Fink", "O brother, where are you?" "The Big Lebowski" proves that he does not depend on Coen Brose films to affirm his reputation.
