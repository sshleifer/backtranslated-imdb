I liked this movie. I remember reading it many times as a child and I was happy to see that a book was made of the book. <br /> <br /> I was a boy and a girl, children aged 11 and 8, kids. talk about the girl to see the movie. But happily at the end, he was glad he saw it and even said he wanted to buy it from the DVD as soon as it came out. <br /> <br /> There were some great ridiculous moments and the film wasn't so "brutal" when I thought it would be ... tho it was quite high at a high o-meter ... > <br /> The only thing I can not understand is that they had to be "dilly" there, which Woody did for his personal part ... that was the only shocking moment for me (and you heard that adults listen audibly at this moment in the movie) ... I have no idea why it was put in the movie; it didn't add anything to the actual movie except this shock / impact factor ... other than a pretty good movie. Glad to see Pepsi girl grow up.
