Now she has a name, identity, some memories and a lost girl. All he wanted was to disappear, but still they followed him and destroyed the world he barely built. Now he wants some explanation and a ride to the people as he does. Yes, Jason Bourne is back and this time he is here with revenge. <br /> <br /> OK, this movie is not the world's most complicated script, but its subject matter is very smart and smart. ask serious questions about our society. Of course, like every Hollywood movie since the late 90s, "The Bourne Suprematy" is a super-hero story. Jason Bourne is a Captain-American project-like person who has gone completely wrong. In the first film, the hero discovered his abilities and accepted them in another. Now he is fighting against what he thinks evil when his close person is killed (his girlfriend "Suprematys"). It's all part of the super-hero story, including the real (realistic but still impressive): superfighting. <br /> <br /> And it is interesting that the evil that he is fighting all over the world (there are no limits in Bourne films, characters fly from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), like the American enemy at the age of 24, who believes he fights for it, his country hides him completely. Funny, how "mad patriots" are now enemies of the paranoiac Hollywood stories N.1. <br /> <br /> Besides all these interesting themes, the film is not perfect: Nickie Parson's feminine character is now completely useless, and the direction is quite unequal for dialogue scenes. But all that is not really important is the movie "The Bourne Ultimatum". And the action scenes are quite impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here talks about "Waterloo Scene" and "Tangier Tracking" and everyone's right. I especially liked the fight in Tangier, which reminds me of my exaggeration and madness in Tsui Hark's works. Visually invented scenes, lots of intelligent activities and a good discussion of American contemporary topics: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is definitely the best movie in the series and a very interesting and original action.
