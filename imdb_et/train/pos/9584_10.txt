Yes, these movies are tops. Don't recommend it any more. Gay or verse is a great document for anyone who likes film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never boring. Great access. A film that has been made passionately and interested in the subject. Some shows and just amazing. If you find this movie only in VHS, it is still very worth it. Great. 10 out of 10 I saw some of this doco about ten years ago and did not understand what I was looking at. The interviews show the egos of those performers who are like the boxers who are trying to get out of the ghetto very well. The filmmaker was probably the first timer to accomplish. Cool. Follow it.
