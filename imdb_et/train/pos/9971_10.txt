This movie was great, I thought the original was quiet mediocre. But it got all the ingredients, the factory in 1970 with Hemi Challenger's 4-speed transmission, which really shows that mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in the Chrysler sky every time Kowalski floored this large block of Hemi and he did so much :)
