As a result of the stylish adventure of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted are in danger of the future, because the evil Chuck De Nomolos will send two evil robots hidden on Bill and Ted land to kill a man Bill and Tedi. change the future. <br /> <br /> In great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves stand out to provide delightful humor to this successive audience. While the first lacked sharpness, Bogus Journey still has a great pair of quotes and dialogue from the leading couple, not to mention William Sadler's funny performance that brings a deeply humorous side to a deep face. Watch the sequences of games that are the best movie in the whole movie, but one of the many great techniques used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is still full of humor, this movie has a more dramatic film, the stakes are more serious and the situations are more risky. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a great dimension and another pleasant feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, where hell and heaven are strongly symbolic and appear on the plot. The fantasy genre is still on the ground, using this amazing time-consuming machine, albeit somewhat confused with timing, and objects and situations that are placed before it occurs now, as is apparent in the last couple. The first clock I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy because I appreciated the jokes and the story more, and while the jokes and plots are not as strong as his predecessor, Bogus Journey has good enough motives, jokes and a pretty permanent plot to make it a benevolent family movie.
