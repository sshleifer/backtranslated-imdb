this movie is a masterpiece story about a young woman during the war and it really happens, not just like the movie, but it's a great story, i was impressed by this movie, the actor and the story where i know the movie because it's a real story, it's Giff feels like I was there and I'm sorry for the rector that Maruschka Detmers is playing because he wants to end life here. I recommend everyone to see this movie, the special and the young, to learn from this movie. This movie can be compared to the real story of a movie soldier orange or some other world war.
