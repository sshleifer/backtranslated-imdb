I looked out of it, but when I bought the Blue Underground kit right now, because it's a limited edition, I just matched it to my schedule - mainly because Bakshi American POP (1981) just appeared on Italian television late at night (see my movie review below)! <br /> <br /> In any case, I found the movie a pretty good sword and magic animated epic that has particularly impressive backgrounds (quite uncomfortable rotoscoped characters were so less) where they found a derivative score. Again, the plot was not exactly original, but it was undoubtedly well developed for the level of minors and the leading characters - especially interesting is the puzzled ice star Nekron and the enigmatic warrior Darkwolf; but the hero and heroine are quite uncomfortable stereotypes - but Bakshi and Frazetta are represented by girls as blessed (his bra can be cut off on any other side) and semi-solid (his tiny panties are forever the loss of his ass! and it definitely gives this front side (which includes Darkwolf especially wildness), the final showdown, though short, is also well handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls attack villains lair inside the cave. <br /> <br /> In the long run, except above said Frazetta backdrops, the main complaint for this film, is now my nostalgia factor, as it transported me back to my childhood days, not only watching movies like CONAN BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982), but also animated TV series like BLACKSTAR ( 1981-82) and HE-MAN AND UNIVERSITY MASTERS (1983-85). <br /> <br /> What Pu goes with the accompanying "FIRE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> A vintage feature film in sword-witch animation film, available only through the printing of VHS printed by Ralph Baksh's own property ! It goes into detail on the technique of the rotoscope and also shows a number of real-time operations (in the studio) of the script segments, which are then monitored, mixed with the background and filmed. However, having watched several scenes that show the art of animation (such as Disney Tins and Looney Tunes), it doesn't make a very convincing piece ...
