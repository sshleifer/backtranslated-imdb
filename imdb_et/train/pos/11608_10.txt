This is a great movie. Reading other comments, I see that I'm not the only one who tears. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction, made an end to heart and memorable. With less actors, his last scene would have seemed like a trick and funny. It would never be possible to think that this film was made with a limited and limited budget. Cinematography is fantastic and has many great names. The script is so wonderful, I see why they all wanted it to be. When you look at the long, long credit list at the end, you can see that half of Hawaii stepped in to make this movie and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood for the whole movie. My only "complaint" is that I almost didn't want to end the movie.
