Nowadays it is rare to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting at short doses throughout the film (eg Big Fat Greek Weddings; Me, Myself & Irene). In this movie, there were only a few unnecessarily demented jokes, not something unpleasantly stupid. All around, it was a lovely movie with nice characters. I thought the ending was a bit steep. They seem to have had to end this series of worlds to get a real ribbon. There was little desire for action, but it was a story. If I had known that it was Farrelly's brothers, I would have assumed that it was a garbage trash and didn't follow it, but it seems that even they can accidentally make a movie. For them it is good, I hope they will pull the rest of their way and start to make good films.
