On November 15, 1959, they twice murdered Mr and Mrs confusion and their teenage son and daughter. After a little police investigation, two men were detained and sentenced. Cold Blood (1967) is headed by Richard Brooks. The film does not have a great job of talking about the terrible events that actually happened. Robert Blake is great as Perry. He is now free but we still do not know the truth.Whatever it may be, he is still a very good actor.Scott Wilson does a remarkable job like Hickock.John Forsythe is terrible as Alvin Dewey.Paul Stewart is very good when Jensen .Jeff Corey is wonderful as Hickock. We deal with Charles McGraw who plays Tex Smith. John McLiam depicts Herbert Clutter, Ruth Storey is his wife Bonnie, Brenda Currin is the daughter of Nancy and Paul Hough is the son of Kenyon. Each of them is a great job. This is pretty big when Perry wants to hunt for gold in Mexico and tells Hickock: Remember Bogart Sierra Madre's treasure? "And Blake was the boy in this movie! And this is a fun moment for those who give the boy and his grandfather a ride to collect the bottles and make them pay back. These darker moments are the strangest. A modest sequence, where you see the murders, is extremely frightening.If Perry goes to kill the girl, Nancy last and says, "Oh, please, don't ..." Human brutality, it is impossible to explain. Then hanging scene.First, go to Hickock and then Perry first talking to the minister. In the last picture of the movie, we see that Perry strikes the end of the rope. Certainly movies and books can try these crooks. Especially Perry's character is someone you could excuse. his mother and father, who he hates, but still loves. family, with cold blood. How do you understand these people?
