Lately, a lot of nonsense has come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Friend, sending me movies now and again as a surprise, it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> I turned it on and couldn't stop viewing, it's drama, but odd. Imagine if there was superpower in Rome, like Shakepear. It is at the same time sad and poetic. Hollywood should know the new Russian cinema, they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. It simply takes a simple assumption and tells a story without speculation. It's like an Asian movie with a dark Russian twist. Allowed it is not perfect, but nothing ever. You know what power is, but it has never been explained or fully completed. It becomes second to the emotion of the story. I don't want to see the remake, it's too cool, as it is, the Hollywood system would be as usual. Action is the upper limit everywhere. Control and camera operation are much higher than there are. Tissue to all involved and I turn to this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you find i, look at it.
