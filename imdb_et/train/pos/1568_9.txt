Catscratch is the best thing to get out of Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show just doesn't like Maori and PI. some people love it and they are all aussies. At first glance I admit that it seems a bit of crude oil, but it is growing tremendously for you. Also, in order to correct something that another critic has said, In_Correct (Tv.com) says "Does that mean you're gay now?" he says, "Does that mean you're gay, owww?" This is his phrase. I think Mr. Blik is more fun than the Peww-Wewwi playhouse. <br /> <br /> First, I admit that the early episode was a little good. But after a while the episodes became big! And just when that series was found, it is surreal, ... ... Nickelodeon cancels it! and adults. These exhibitions include the animated series by Mr. Bean, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (at times) and Invader Zim. All of them must be too good, except CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. <br /> <br /> I like the famous last episode where Gordon fights the duck. <Br /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD with lots of documents behind audio commentaries and scenes, including the latest episode. <br /> <br /> But of course I would like to see if the show has returned to the air. Wake NICK! <br /> <br /> I would like to have all the gag closing credits on the internet list. That would be nice.
