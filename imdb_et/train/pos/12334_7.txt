Does anyone know where this movie was shot? The climate aerial scene is beautiful. It looks like England. The Ivy apartment building looks like a Brill building with its exciting lifts. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl is listed as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I was blinking, but I never saw her. Perhaps he was a husband's lawyer, but again I do not remember the character of the film except that I mentioned it as a phone call. Maybe he was in aviation? Or a dance hall? Did anyone notice him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 when he made a movie.
