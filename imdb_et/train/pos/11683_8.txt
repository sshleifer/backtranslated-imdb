I liked the episode that was a big surprise because of the bad reputation he felt he had acquired. From a pure written perspective, the "16mm shrine" is an absolute treatment with a fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of Sterling. I especially liked the episode of philosophical indulgents, dealing with issues of existence and reality, balancing it more with psychological issues such as denial, pride and desire. The "sixteen millimeter shrine" is an episode of how these ideas, based on unwillingness to embrace change, may seem to alienate a person from a constantly changing world. It is also a great example of the brain Twilight Zone; one that explores the mind, not the world outside it. All these elements come together very well to create a provocative and incredibly interesting 25 minutes of thought. <br /> <br /> The episode, however, is not without the errors that were mainly in the Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt Lupino was not convincing around the world, but a few scenes that could be considered memorable. This is, of course, an absolute shame, considering how well Sterling has written his character. Besides, Leisen didn't seem to know what most of her characters would do, sometimes when they were around the set, doing something aside, which probably explains why Lupino's bad things were half the time. Fortunately, Balsam is doing a good job of covering a lot of weak spots, helping to show on stage at least from an exemplary perspective. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, if you are a fan of classical film and brain science literature, it should not be as bad as it is sometimes prescribed. In addition to the aforementioned article, the episode also has fantastic photography (it still amazes me that the exhibition looks almost fifty years later!) In general, the "sixteen millimeter shrine" is a great episode and, above all, it is one that thinks about you.
