Unexpectedly, we see short comments from IMDb filmmakers. Perhaps this is because this light dark comedy attracts and enjoys without depth, or are we missing? I would look at it again if I had some incentive. <br /> <br /> So what happens? In French, is "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Fate? Perhaps this is the culmination of a series of random events. We all have them (called life), but when you look at it, you start to feel that "casual" can be more "fatal". <br /> <br /> This movie may be as insignificant as tapping some of the lettuce pages on the back of the truck or the main one, because it is based on the great viability of stubborn stoning. All these incidents cause other events that ... well get the picture? Dominoid. Multiply them by 30 characters and an average of 6 times, and you really need to stretch your imagination to accept the remote control of this scenario. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like that. But then this is the magical world of cinema. We recognize that it is fun to see how a writer / director combines a story that reflects the lives of their French citizens. If you have a couple of hours and are looking for a mad escape, here is the place to do it. Or, if you have recovered from surgery and do not go anyway, it will involve you as your stitches improve. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" doesn't win the prize, but it should develop a cult. Things from strangers have happened. <br /> <br /> Soren Kierkegaard is devoted to the following: "Life can only be understood upside down, but it has to be continued." If you look at the details in many of your life experiences (meeting your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last car accident), you will find a host of seemingly random events leading to it. <br /> <br /> This is the answer! I forgot to bring an existentialist to explain "Happenstance".
