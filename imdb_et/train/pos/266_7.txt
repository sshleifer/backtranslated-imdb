This story was never among my favorites in Christie's work, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. The motif of the mouse was somewhat superfluous, the story was a story, although more emphasis was put on 'past crime'. The pupils were all pretty much as I imagined them, although it was a pity that they were not a cosmopolitan bunch - that is, thirty-three times it didn't! I thought there were some very bold risks in filming; perhaps this is because I have not read the book long ago, but it seemed to me quite obvious who the murderer was about to appear in some revealing frame quite early. <br /> <br /> Humor was in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works, but I found it quite difficult in this episode (although I smiled at the "Lemon only" line). All in all, however, there is a definite entry into the series, though not one of the best.
