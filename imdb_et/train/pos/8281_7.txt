I was very excited about the first scene. "I can say it's going to be fantastic!" I was thinking. The action was so good, I felt like I was interrupted by the lives of these peoples. Music was also very disturbing. The plot's start was a steep event, and then went on (one hour) to an irreversible fate. Building was slow, but I personally like this thing when the silent tension persists and doesn't get off the track before it is ready to pay. <br /> <br /> So everything goes well and then fireworks start and you know before, the credit is rolling. "WHAT? !!!" everything that I and my cinema partner could say. If you understand the director's intentions, it is a blunt idea (for those who have already seen the film, see a very exciting and fun interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com), but I can't say it wasn't quite right. <br /> <br /> It could have been solved in as little as ten minutes of material before the climax. In any case, it's too bad. These ten minutes could have made all the differences in the world. (But for you, who does not write or make movies, you should know that editing the arc of the story with the right timing is a huge pain in the back, and I certainly do not make this criticism on a pedestal!) <br /> <br /> Wendigo feels to me this is a masterpiece that was abandoned before its completion. But on the hay, I'd take over a well-cooked dog-pouch that is over-compensated by too many digital effects (like most of those horror movies from those days). <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some monster scenes left me confused if I should be afraid or laugh. I don't know how to explain it, but Monty Python knew this monster in his extraordinary monster forms. While this may seem like a terrible criticism of a horror movie - I don't know, it still worked somewhat curved for me. I never look at deer horns the same way! :)
