I had to be just 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was necessary for the whole family, I believe in Sun. nights. The recurring gags were opening Robi's closet (he had to use a gauge or cursor to place the other closet in the right place and do some other things, finally knocking the place, then open his door) and take out a new shirt (he opened a new dress with a shirt at the beginning of the episode) For the package and the rest of the performance, one pin was found on the other, which he did not miss when unpacking the shirt, the timing was all, and the pins got a lot of laughter. He thought and came out with a "semipermeable membrane" or osmosis that made him say he was great. (you had to be there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why did they not continue from their POV series when Wally gave up (she was afraid she had written, but it was too late). I saw somewhere that the 1st TV wedding (big any) was on Tiny Tim Carson's show. Horsecock. It was Rob and Nancy (did I ever have hats for her) and I remember it made the TV Guide covers and got in the press in all the magazines. The Travel Broadcasting Museum in NYC a year ago was disappointing because they had very few episodes and may now disappear. I still remember wonderful and I wish I was a little older.
