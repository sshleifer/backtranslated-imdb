This is a slow motion. No action. No madness. There are no sudden surprises. If you can't see a movie about two people who just talk and walk, the story that develops slowly to the end and the love-loved romance doesn't waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in dialogue, masterful storytelling, thinking provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life, this is your film. I suggest you watch this movie when you are the most attentive, because the tempo of the movie, the music and the general tone can force you. It's really fantastic. I really mean it. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are occasionally irritating, but fortunately, these two chemistry actors make it very natural, warm and gentle. They act and know each other from the beginning, so you feel intruder. <br /> <br /> In your conversations, you have great comments on many topics that give you thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too varied for these young stars, but I can underestimate their intelligence. However, it didn't destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple, which, in my opinion, gives the film its charm and ultimately its power. <br /> <br /> LOW: The movie's stream is slow. The dialogue is exciting. The story builds gently, systematically and in substance. Building a finale is satisfactory and ultimately cost effective.
