Never looked at this 1971 movie and it was a great production and wonderful animation created by Walt Disney Studios. Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price) played a prominent role as a woman who had taken a witch training course and was a trainee who started flying on a snowboard and had little difficulty. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to travel to different parts of the world. But Eglantine was left out of his final exams as a witch. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine to this witch course and was trying to help her find the solution. Eglanin has his own madness and that means stopping the Nazis from escaping from England. Great for family entertainment and we need more such movies today.
