I saw this movie back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and 14 of those movies I saw there would be my # 3 movie. I was originally interested in seeing it be of Swedish origin, by many of my ancestors in the Norrland region of Sweden where it was filmed. I also grew up in an underground forest area in America, where many small towns were like setting up this movie. Enjoy watching more movies in rural areas like SÃ¥ som i himmelen. It was a very good movie and I'm sure a very tough film that pulls up with the pain of this big ensemble, but director Kay Pollock pulled it out almost twenty years later. Helen Sjoholm was a fantastic performer during her debut and I look forward to seeing her on the big screen. I liked Michael Nyqvist in leading this circular story. I would highly recommend this movie and rate it to 9.0 on a scale of 10.
