Broadway and filmmaker-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary Baby) create this 1977 film in a masterpiece. He celebrates Gena Rowlands, John Cassavets, Ben Gazzar, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and Peter Falck. Prerequisite for the film: In the age of aging and the film actor (Gena Rowlands) re-evaluates her life after she tries to get an autograph in an authorship accident. The film has a slow and dark, desperate, frightening quality. It has a 60-year cinematic look and it even reminded me of a Polanski Rosemary baby without a supernatural horror. Fear here is what every successful actor is - he is getting older and he is becoming useless in his career. Moreover, he feels that he has lived a life that has no true spirituality, humanity and values. He has lived only for his career - he has no children, no charity, etc. The gradual disintegration of his film is the meat. It breaks down. He's in a crisis. Gena Rowlands gets into a really tortured character and works in part quite well. He is a terrible actor, and this 70-year-old film is a refreshing contrast to the frequent violent films or catastrophic films or adventure pylons in the period. It is a film that has a lot of deeper emotions, but has a cold and cynical feeling, as Cassavets criticizes the main films and actors of the 70s. Whether this or that film is a product of the 70's that was cynical in many respects - Nixon's Fraud, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not great and this film is not well known, it is a very tough film with haunting moods. Kudos underestimated and late for Cassavete, who died in the late 80s.
