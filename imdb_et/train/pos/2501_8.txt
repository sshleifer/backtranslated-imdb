I'm a fan of both actors / singers, especially Gackt, and when I first discover this movie and look at the trailer, I think it's a silly one. After a long waiting period I finally looked at it and here is my comment. I think everyone knows this and doesn't talk about it, rather than having my first applause to act, in general, that Japanese films are not brilliant and acting. is just wonderful and got into it, especially Gackt reflects his characters' emotions and changes quite well, I like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous, as in HYDE's part, his actor is good but he deliberately wants to be in the actor's background, according to his character , during the whole movie. I didn't like some cinematography, especially lighting and some colors, but because of the small budget it still has great moments, but the real jewel of the movie is the story. it is a good thing for me and the film's friendship is really well developed and sometimes touching, on the other hand, the story points to a cruel world that is not guaranteed by any life and with some memorable death scenes, it reflects this topic on visions. An interesting note, this movie is similar to an excellent vampire movie Interwiew with a vampire, which is played by the most beautiful (not beautiful, beautiful) actors of American cinema, in fact Moon Child can somehow be considered Interwiew, but still original. The only problem that MoonChild is sometimes a bit slow, I'm a fan of Japanese film and used to it, but MoonChild doesn't have some useless scenes or characters. But all this, sometimes this movie is very good and emotional, like the duo / singers duo I hope to see my other movies in the future, and I recommend it to anyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance movies 8/10
