In Plymouth, Massachusetts, this is a private camp site that has been around since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents' site since 1965, and my two brothers have sites there. <br /> <br /> (It has no direct link to the movie, I don't like it.) <br /> <br /> I spent the summer at Blueberry Hill when I was five years old when I was eighteen, and that's for people like me, to whom this movie is talking: those in the forest in the group camp, as my story says, "a good and happy place". If you have never experienced a lifestyle, then India will probably disappear; do not worry. It is not a fast pace, it has no quick cuts, the plots are not the least twisted, it has no explosions, such a dramatic tension as it is, it is easy, there are no A participants, there is no quick fire to show when wise scriptwriters are (except perhaps the killer line of Kimberley Williams on how his fiance should not "refuse his toys." more than the godfather is slasher flick just because he has a lot of screen gore. <br /> <br /> But the Indian summer is the opposite of the godfather when you have experienced a lifestyle, watch this movie, read more, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a 9/10 film.
