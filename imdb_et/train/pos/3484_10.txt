It's just the best movie of all time! Sorry, Hollywood! I've seen it in the early 70's as soon as it appeared on Bulgarian TV, and I loved it right away (then I was 14). 25 years later I bought it on a videotape and a few months ago it appeared on a DVD in Bulgaria. I live with this movie for 35 years and so are all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time, and he loved it right away (and this is a generation that grew up to watch virtually only Hollywood movies and not speak or understand Russian at all!). What makes Danelia a masterpiece so special? It's hard to say because it's hard to describe what beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie tens of times with the same enjoyment as it was for the first time. I don't remember any other movies, no matter how many millions it costs or how big it was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
