Mardi Gras: Made in China provides an excellent and complicated link between popular culture, nudity, and globalization by making and throwing beads. I saw this movie at the Boston International Film Festival, and I was looking forward to a dry introduction to globalization, but what I got was a raging visual display that showed shocking material from both China and the United States. The eye-opening film is humorous, thorough, serious, not patronizing, and leaves your desire for more credit. It's worth comparing to Murderball - it's just so well done. Young female workers in China have different views and the owner is amazingly open to this discipline. During the carnival, the highlighters are highlighted, but only because this wonderful film offers a deep context in the Chinese factory without narration. Bravo filmmaker to enter and finish a movie! I would never have thought about the relationship between beads, China and New Orleans; Now I am thinking of the human connection between almost every object, but also globalization, inequality and fun. What is even more important is that I can feel these connections without a film, unlike the other films of globalization I've seen.
