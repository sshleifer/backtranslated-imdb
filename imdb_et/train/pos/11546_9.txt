First View: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> A very impressive scenario and comedic show and timing in this movie. It is 40 years old that he has not lost his power. These Simon have a great overview of the nature and relationships of people and how to create true comedy in unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comics. Neil Simon was inspired by real events in his life to write the film the film is based on. <br /> <br /> One of the best written and acting Hollywood comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> Only 2 Academy Awards: "Best Custom Scenario" and "Best Movie Editing" were surprisingly nominated. Hollywood rarely gives comedies, no matter how well they are done.
