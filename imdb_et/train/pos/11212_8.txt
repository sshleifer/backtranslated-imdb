This picture appeared in 1975 and was the second in a series of three parts of Sheriff Buford Pusser's life. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last one we saw at Sheriff Pusser put him in the hospital and his wife who was killed on Sunday morning while robbed. After Pusser's recovery, he goes for a man who killed his wife. Is Pusser able to take revenge for what he is or whether the people are trying to take him out of promotion. The only thing that worries me about this picture is that it was a real story. How could you leave the city in such a crime, but do nothing about it. Because this image had a real name I didn't know, I can't give it to 10 adult stars, but I can give it 8
