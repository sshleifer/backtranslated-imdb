In my opinion, this film, despite being a mistake (which I claim to be few *), is the ultimate masterpiece and a great and glorious work of art. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bakshi is here to create a totally beautiful movie and showcase his tremendous talent and versatility as an animated film director. He doesn't get 1 / 100s of credits he deserves to save an adult audience with animation art. If it weren't for Mr Bakshi, I don't think the animation would have survived the Disney attack. Moreover, with the Lord of the Rings, he has not only created a beautiful animated film, but has created a completely new form of art - unfortunately, it has never gone completely out of the ground. <br /> <br /> Most people complain about the use of rotoscopy in a movie (using live action images that are used as background images and are often animated using a variety of techniques that appear to be tiny amounts of toning for inflatable animation). But I feel that people who complain about it can't just accept an out-of-art art form. No, it's not a Disney animation. No, it's not a living activity. No, it's not "cheating" - it's a new, exciting and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so fresh and so new that she feels like a fantastic story like "Lord of the Rings". Bakshi's pioneering way of bringing life to the life of the Central Earth is very dark and mysterious, especially the darker of Tolkien's creatures, especially the Nazgul, is realized in such a way that traditional animation or lively action has failed in the Peter S. Beagle scenario (based very little, as I understand it, in the early draft of Chris Conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkien's works. Whenever possible, she uses dialogue directly from the novel and feels at home in the world that Bakshi has created. There are many cuts made to the first book and 3/4 to one 2-hour 15-minute movie, but there are very few changes in nature. There are some holes that would have been nice to accomplish: the narcissism of narcissus, the gifts of Galway in the battles of Huorns, but again with time constraints (already the longest animated feature) historically, they are certainly understandable (although it makes no sense how they could be explained in the sequel). <br /> <br /> There is also Leonard Rosenman (who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (whose result is clearly based on his LotR work)). It's bombastic and cruel and I dare say perfect. It is the triumph of its orchestra, but when it comes to the pictures of the film, it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection. So far, many people are out of the ordinary price of the Hollywood Land. <br /> <br /> Voice actors are wonderful. Particularly noteworthy is that John Hurt is Aragorn, who just penetrates into the nature of Strider. <br /> <br /> Character design is also wonderfully unique, though not often for everyone's taste. But remember that the task of the Adaptation Director is to show you what he is depicting, not what you have imagined, and so Aragorn will be realized with a distinctive Native American, and Boromir will appear in a Viking-inspired garment. This is probably not what you imagined, but I can only praise Mr Bakshi for showing us what he saw. It may also be noted that he spent a lot of time with Priscilla Tolkien to develop the supply of film characters. <br /> <br /> One more distant word - the flight to the Ford sequence - is, in my opinion, one of the finest beautiful sequences ever captured by celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down and his mastery is clearly demonstrated by the incredible tension that can build. Bakshi's artistic capability and Tolkien's incredible work protection in this order is a surprising top that is still equal. <br /> <br /> The recent DVD edition (2001) from Warner Brothers is very lacking. Although we can offer our eternal thanks to the movie being finally available in the widescreen format, the package is not a must. If the brilliant would have been the director's comment, we would have been able to see the 20 minutes of material removed for the theater challenge. Another nice addition could have been the collection of live movie material that was later animated. The DVD also has a terrific voice command at the end of the movie, leaving the simple voice command that took place in the last frame of the movie. This version is plastered and poorly melted to the right musical climax. <br /> <br /> Of course, the greatest tragedy is that the sequel was never made. We can never see Bakshi's interpretation of Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, Doom's Gulf, Eowyn's Battle of Witch King, or Gandhal's confrontation with him. We can never confront Bakshi Denethor or Palatir or the graveyard. It's a disgrace that we have to finally accept Peter Jackson's glitz and glitter Hollywood, a version of these films from these later events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but I think even this is better than the cinema version. <br /> <br /> David
