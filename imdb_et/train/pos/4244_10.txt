This film has slipped through the cracks of film history. This is much better than some other New York movies of the same era, such as "French Connection" or "Pelham 1-2-3". There is a sharp reality in this film that can effectively use humor to draw further. It is related to the beginning to the end and is not obsolete, as in the above two examples. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman turns the bravura performance "Batman" and it is a disgrace in his career as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon's parks drive and come like "Shaft", a strange choice first. But this is the back side of this earlier effort, and it was as close to its facial mechanism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not available on DVD or VHS in the United States. Common artists really have a gem in their hands and it is a shame that they do nothing about it.
