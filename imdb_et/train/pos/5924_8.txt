Woah! Can I say about this movie. Personally, I am one of those people who love cats, so it would have been the big side of the film, but I loved the way every cat's cats got their revenge. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause, who played Charles Brady very very irresistible, I think the lust became better while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> One thing I was disappointed with. I looked at Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, her kissing is O.K. Sleepwalkers, but really bad compared to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I don't know if it's because Krause and the combs have a great chemistry, or maybe it's a bit more, it was the only disappointment in the movie, but I think it was Brian Krause in their tight jeans that he wore in the movie. <br /> <br /> When you use Brian Kraus to see Holly Marie Combs' heavenly wife and her son's father as a big surprise to this film, she was not like a corner boy. Although now, when I think about it, it would be nice to see that Krause's character on Charmed has taken over evil so that he was something like he was in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I must also say that music was a big movie in it too!
