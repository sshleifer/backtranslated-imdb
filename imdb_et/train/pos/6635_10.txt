What can I say about the first movie ever? <br /> <br /> You can't rate it because it shouldn't be entertaining. But if you need to evaluate it, you should give it 10. It's stunning to see moving pictures from 1895. It was one of the most important films in history. I don't know how it was one of the people who ever saw the first movie! <br /> <br />
