Gentleman Jim is another legend printing event where Errol Flynn plays a legendary boxer as a striking but charismatic social climber who barely relaxes. It's just as pointless to look for historical accuracy as it is in the Flyni Light Brigade charge - it's a slim hockey where all the stops are pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly large scale and giving Raoul Walsh a lively direction to a true sense of energy. Flynn is still at the height of his mandate (you don't think he would have a light heart attack during production), Alexis Smith was a beautiful romantic sparring partner and an eternal conjuncture Alan Hale with a good action, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes the sidekick commitment this time. even the pirate galleon of Flynn's earlier films makes somewhat spot-on in the dome!
