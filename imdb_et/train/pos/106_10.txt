The first von Trier movie I ever saw was breaking the waves. Of course a beautiful movie, but it is definitely in the shadow of Europe. Europa talks about a young German-American who wants to experience Germany right after the Second World War. He takes the work that his uncle has arranged for him as a fountain. Because of his work, he travels almost completely to destroyed Germany, meeting the killers and hunting with former Nazi party members. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle has reduced his consciousness by focusing on the work he has as a train cleaner. The coincidence is dealt with by the main actor in the bombing and terrorist group, called "werewolves", which puts him under pressure to help them place bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer takes a scene from the scene when a person tries to put the viewer into hypnosis and then reads that you wake up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe !!
