I love this beautiful movie for every frame. It concerns ordinary people, people we all know who suffer a little in their lives and who have some luggage. Just like we all. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe life into their images and are all great, but Harris is particularly heartbreaking and therefore very real. You would swear that he really is a driver who drinks, so he doesn't have to know anything. Baker also has gentle moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers to one scene, she seems to have never been given flowers before and probably not. Very worth.
