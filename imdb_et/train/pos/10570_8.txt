It's hard to say what's up, James Cagney's magic and energy, or the opening of three big show-ups at Busby Berkeley. I'll give him a hit, with Footlight Parade, one of the funniest and fastest of thirty music. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds a moderately good story. <br /> <br /> What is a story? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney) who produces musicals and who is now almost doing business when the speakers take over. Before starting the film, he begins a performance offering live musical entertainment. He gets the idea of ​​making bigger and more of them by moving them across the country. He is the ball of fire and ideas and he needs all the ideas he can get to produce these things effortlessly. But the rival attacks him and steals his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his wise cracker secretary, loves him, but he is too busy; black-and-white, girl with round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants to dance; his wife rises, saying that he will not separate him after all; blonde gold digger puts his hooks in; his partners cheat on him ... my gosh, what's next? It can all sound a lot to digest, but everything happens fast, Cagney bouncing, dragging, sliding, grabbing, barking, and sometimes - up to the last number when he's singing and dancing - doing a step or two just to show how it is done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "putting the show, gang", we have "We need to build three shows three days so that the doors are locked and we start practicing." These three superprologists have 40 choirs, spectacular effects, and that means a rich deal, forty Kent units in luxurious movie theaters ... the whole Apollo movie house circuit! Ending threatens, the legs hurt, but all those empty costumes that are in hostile costumes (including Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour; you can quickly see Sothern, but Lamour is more general), stay informed, dancing your hearts, strangling and bothering and remarkably delightfully. <br /> <br /> And the curtains will rise, because every Prologue will be presented one after another in separate film houses, where the Apollo Circle owner decides if he will do the evening, whether he will save Chester's skin or not. The first task is the "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler with a 9-minute product number, which has a lot of healthy joy, brides and grooms (some may even get married), bedrooms and beds. and doors marked "Do Not Disturb". <br /> <br /> Then go to the next theater and 11 minutes "By the Waterfall", which was probably worrying about the bankruptcy of Warner Brothers' accountants. This number is so big - dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, grottoes with large waterplanes, a giant pool - you never think there was depression. Berkeley pulls out all of her tricks - synchronization, human patterns, legs and hands, doing all the exact things - and she does it in water with lots of underwater photos. Girls are a sure game. They come in their eyes with a smile of water and still catch their mark. The whole thing must be incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has a couple of quick pictures in the water, is the only one who looks a little cautious. <br /> <br /> And finally, 11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler "Shanghai Lil", where there are all kinds of bar girls and their customers. . Cagney and Keeler dance at the bar, dancing on the table, Cagney fights. It looks like fifty or sixty marching marines fleeing back and forth, rifles are thrown and caught. Then ... this is true ... Franklin Roosevelt and NRA eagle human image forms. It may be the only Hollywood musical piece that has ever been in Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a sexy Chinese prostitute. <br /> <br /> It's entertainment, people. It's great! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester's prologues get a big deal and Nan gets Chester. The film is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so appealing when she seriously pulls her taps in her hands, what you want her to help. Joan Blondell makes us forget a lot of Hollywood women who could have been more beautiful but had much less spirit and personality. However, the film belongs to Cagney, who grabs it and shakes it, and to Berkeley, who has never had too much.
