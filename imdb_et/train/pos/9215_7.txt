What does the Marquis de Sade do for Egyptian archeology and mermaid worship? Tobe Hooper is trying to answer this question in one strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archeology father in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie gets stuck with a mysterious whore (and a blatant lesbian) who serves Daddy's side. Dad is sent back to the site where he finds a grave that seems to be a mermaid. Genie meets the Marquis de Sade descendant and falls to the hunky Egyptian (offering the hottest scenes in the movie). Eventually, Genie finds that he must be a victim, and a protracted and bloody climax. Surrounded by this story, there is a film that contains the Marquis de Sade in prison, says Genie about seeing. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is a great Marquis and his successor. Her ability to act has always been alongside her makeup requirements, so she is allowed to shine here. His best results are still "Killer Tongue" if you haven't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest, including the young Genie, is beautiful and average. However, the script is problematic. You'll quickly find out that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary, except when the filmmakers had access to a cool set. The Mermaid cult, which eventually saves Genie, makes no sense. Whoever the mermaid has never been explained and its relationship with Christianity (which is inside the film) is nothing. The film is very Christian because the archaeologist is a Bible shooter but loves a local prostitute. There are many scenes of intimidation and violence, but Chooper probably had little idea of ​​what the scriptwriters were trying to say. I know I have no idea. Why do I recommend this movie? It's weird. There's an extended sex scene. For women, hunky Egyptian rides the horse completely naked. Englund is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This movie is full of them. It's like Roger Corman, who has a bigger budget. Knowing that Hooper is somehow "crocodile", it's pretty sad. "Night Terrors" is not perfect, but definitely worthy of an outstanding, unpleasant look. content, sexual references and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
