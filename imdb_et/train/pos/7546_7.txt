CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" type kittens who start a bizarre journey through a life where something can happen and do it. This short-term spiritual Asia does not use dialogue to replace the word "balloons". It is not possible to describe this demented comic only to say that you can see it yourself. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Disconnections and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery as well as sudden death and sudden neglect are common issues. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable picture of the elephant, which consists of the water that kitties swim through and in, as well as rides. But as with virtually anything else in this movie, it is silly, picaresque interlude will soon be terrible.
