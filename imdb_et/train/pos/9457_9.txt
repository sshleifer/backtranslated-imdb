How can you just summarize how it feels and right and touching this movie? For several weeks, it went off the shelf on the DVD at any time - after seeing Steve Carrell earlier, I didn't want to wrestle my thinking process - so I looked and missed it until I finally grabbed this "What the hell!" Attitude! And when I was surprised! I just wish I had bought it before. Having watched it three times in two days, I still smiled at the image of a widow struggling with three daughters who miss what is missing after her beloved wife, who is therefore an intriguing woman. deep and interesting (dare to say it?), throws the light of a lifetime that makes him realize he is what he has been looking for. <br /> <br /> This woman, who is her brother's girlfriend, makes it difficult - which depicts Dan comically shy and cordially astonished by seeing her "someone special" that brings both fun and enjoyment to the lives of both her family and her brothers. You just get to know him. <br /> <br /> When the dark day comes with Ruthie Draper - this is a turning point for Marie's estimate Dan !! The vision he repeats in commenting on her doesn't like Ruthie - Heavenly Green-Eyed Monster! An absolutely fun scene launch when two pairs compete on the dance floor! This order is one of the most well-designed, because Dan is getting rid of Marie. <br /> <br /> Other intestinal scenes - Dan begins to return from a book and handbag that faces his brothers to describe what just happened .... When Dan's face falls, it brings a sharp breath! <br /> <br /> Her youngest daughter, Lilly, who today celebrates her love for Suzanne, her late husband, brings little cordial warmth and little bang as Dan understands what she has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays guitar at the talent show and sings, his voice breaks a bit as he sings. ... absolute pearl! <br /> <br /> Late reception of her daughter's movie ... they all love their dad and want to see her happily, don't let her deny her love for Marie; Dani's despair is not to leave his daughters unsuccessful because he is their stone, their certainty ... and tell him so much more than just a few words. <br /> <br /> I could go ahead, but I leave it now - maybe come back and add more comments in the near future ... but I'll finish by saying .... <br /> <br /> .. if you want to watch a movie it's just so damn good with comedy twists to ease the drama that never knows forced or crass, which is a real idea of ​​a person who discovers a new life - not just a woman but also her extended family , look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 well-designed film experiences that have been awarded to Sondre Lerche. ensemble productions.
