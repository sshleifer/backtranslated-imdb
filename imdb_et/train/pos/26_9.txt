When I was a kid, I watched it several times and I remember the "Happy Cat" song quite often. All the songs are great and really memorable, unlike many of the childish musicals where the songs are simply drawn. The scenes and costumes are plentiful and the acting is very well done, which is not surprising given the cast. Christopher Walken is very catlike and doesn't need a foolish make-up or cat costume to make the viewer believe she is a cat. And Jason Connery is as cute as the shy and uncomfortable mill son Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and brave Princess Vera. This is a really fun, enjoyable, full-length movie where, unlike most fairy tales, the characters are given a personality. Some of my favorite items are when Puss makes Corin's pretense that he is drowning; on the ball, when everyone starts to dance the country's dance, because it's "all the rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, dances on the table (she's a pretty good dancer!); and when Vera talks to Corin about all the things she was young, as you pretended she was a grandson daughter. I recommend this film to both children and parents who love magic and fairy tales. And this is actually a movie that can be viewed together because it doesn't help the adults along the wall.
