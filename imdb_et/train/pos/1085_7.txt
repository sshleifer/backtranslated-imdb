This movie was quite a comedy about Murphy's law in home and construction. If such a film was undoubtedly made today, the family would be dysfunctional. Since it is set in the simplest forties, we get what should be the typical family of the era. Grant, of course, perfectly mixes comedic and dramatic elements and works with more than competent support, as Loy and Douglas emphasize. Their shenanigans have a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
