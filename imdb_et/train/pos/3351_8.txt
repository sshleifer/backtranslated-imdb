Very good west.It was the first time the writer Richard Wilson directed the film, also it was the first Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It is a pleasure to see a very young and beautiful Angie Dickinson as a salon girl. Robert Mitchum comes to a city dominated by laws and hired as a cityman, but people are worried that he will go too far, as well as the damage he makes to urban businesses. The 1959 story "Warlock" contains some similarities. This movie keeps you at a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge.
