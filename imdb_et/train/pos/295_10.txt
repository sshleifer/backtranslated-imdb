Bogdonovich's (mostly) sort of classic film is unlike almost any other. A film with a fairy tale, but having a real landing thanks to the use of authentic Manhattan locations and "real" geography, may be the best place to shoot in NYC I've ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be great and the whole ensemble is a group that you really want to exist to spend time with. One of the few romantic comedies in the last 20 years, which doesn't seem to be anything else, is Bogdanovich's fruitful career after his best work was really done ("saint jack", "finally ...", "noise").
