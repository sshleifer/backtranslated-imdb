I'm from Romania, I'm trying to speak English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and is my first time. Look at it at least 30 times and you'll see it for years. It's all the little things I like about the film, it's very touching to make me cry. Shows many things about twisted love and questions about love and reality and real things that are different to people. It happens to me that it is the most important thing for me, love, the human soul, its inner nature and what I see in this film. Perhaps for me this is much more than a movie, it is my proof that it can really exist and that you make the most of every moment you live with your soul mates. It's a long way from reality to sci-fi, but what if. What if all the capitalism disappeared and the economy fell, would it fall? We would all be worried about other issues and my point is that in your death bed there is no greater thing you remember than wealth, not adventure, not the countries you visit and the people who remember you. But true friends and your true love and hope that after death are all divine perfect and people would be good and caring more. Watch this movie and probably it will guide you through your life like me :) Hail from Romania
