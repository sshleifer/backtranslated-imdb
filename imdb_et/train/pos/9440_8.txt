"Deliverance" is one of the best exploits coming out of this marvelous decade of the 1970s, with so many other exploits. <br /> <br /> A group of friends is on a canoe trip by the river. to the south, and they become the victims of a bunch of unbearable mountain ranges trying to ruin their lives a lot. It's awesome. <br /> <br /> We are being treated for anal rape, brutal beating, bow and arrow killing, shooting, fracture, etc. Like the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" of 1974, to say "it is plausible to be immature. It would never and can never happen, even in the dark age of 1972." Fulfillment is a very entertaining ride and full of packs. In the early 1970s, this is a huge number of exploits, and it (supposedly) sits on this stack with its excellent, excellent cinematography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 , kids.
