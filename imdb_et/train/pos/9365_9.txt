I saw it last night. I was completely blown up how much better this film was when I was waiting. Not many movies can combine dark comedy and the current drama of events and do not have to separate it from the conclusion. <br /> <br /> I don't worry about relocating the plot too much, because I think the less you know about this movie, the better it will be. But I say Adam Sandler's presentation was really refreshing and real. He was funny and much more fun than most of his latest comedies. Don Cheadle was credible as always. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny, like Borat or Billy Madison, but it's a good pace in this respect. I'd say 90% of the audience laughed at most of the movie. The movie's mid-term slows down the drama of things and really does a good job of linking it all together. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really cool when playing all black friend / White Friend they chose to just ignore and focus on themselves.
