Don't wait for the "truth" image. But the accounts of the veterans of these Iraqi and Afghan soldiers require thoughtful consideration. The main strength of the film is that it vividly represents the words and wounds of the vets and their post-war efforts to restore a certain normality and functionality in their lives. <br /> <br /> My big film criticism is twofold: it is one-sided and advocates anti-war activity, but nothing else to improve the serious shortcomings of military and veteran affairs to help those who do it. suffered and still suffer from the trauma of war. These are not deadly flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> As a veteran myself, I know that the terrible aftermath of the war is real, and these young men and women are very good at expressing it. These veterinarians are vividly describing the physical and mental pain and embarrassment experienced by most veterans and what ordinary people need to understand, because ALL the horrors of wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
