I saw Insomniac's nightmare for the first time, and I have to say I found it pretty good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you will love it. Open the movie in her mind or is it? Acting from everyone else is a bit hurrying and trembling, and some scenes can be cut, but it finally works. DVDs are as big as movies, if not larger for Dom fans. It has tons of honest moments from the set, extracts and a big interview with the director. Anyone who has made an independent film, loves to look at Tess (director), Domi and all the others in a very small personalized set, trying to show off that little trippy horrible movie. It was quite enjoyable and I am happy to collect it.
