I heard about Eddie Izzard but would never have seen her. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw that he was one night in HBO last summer, I put it on, without knowing how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. He's better than ever with Robin Williams. Has full control over the audience; when he does "Englebert is dead - he is not", routine, the audience does not know what to finally think about. God as James Mason is also an inspired touch and his version of the Python Spanish Inquisition by the Church of England - "Cake or Death"? is invaluable. My jaws were painful laughing at the show. We cleaned the TV lists several months after we could see her again, and we were happy when she next recorded her. If you have the opportunity to see this example, cancel all and record it, you won't be disappointed.
