Although the plot was sometimes somewhat delicate, and in a hurry at the end, as if the director had staged his time and had to hurry and end the story, it was generally a very good -Cable-TV genre for Made-For-Backwoods. <br /> <br /> But Mariana Klaveno, an actor playing babysitter, was great! I hope to see him more in the countryside. The music was also well done, gaining all possible dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think of "JAWS") type of music-based tensions. <br /> <br /> I don't think I want to look at "Even if the kids are sleeping," but if I did, it would focus on the talented Klaveno results.
