Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an impressive cinema. It's as good as he ever gave. Pacino is an American Olivier. And that's a good political thriller. No good guys or bad guys. But the system has a meaningless impact on people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance appealing - the funeral of a dead child is gratifyingly powerful --- the film has a fast paced, sharp realism that improves fine performances without the use of tricks. This spectacular portrait of metropolitan politics also provides two hours of superb movie viewing without excessive violence, warmth of the sex or rainwater. There is a murder. There are bad people. But they are effectively reaching beyond the line. Such a movie restores my imprisoned faith in Hollywood. I don't give a lot of tens. It's worth it!
