This is a warm and funny movie that is much like Almodovar's works. Of course, this is a 10-year-old boy who breastfeeds milk, but the style is so playful that I don't understand the readers who found it sick or perverted (but would I let my 10-year-old son play less sure!) . <br /> <br /> Spanish cinema is often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without knowing voyeurism or gift. I think that if we look at the same kind of North European type, then the result would be much better. <br /> <br /> This liberal attitude is also seen in the fun character of Fartman Maurice. When her lover tells her, â€œMost people are embarrassed by dazzling. You'll get it into an art form. '
