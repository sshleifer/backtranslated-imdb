There are four prisoners in prison: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud and his wife betrayed it; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his serviceman, retarded by Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six-month-old sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac) who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an ancient magazine hidden in a cell wall opening. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use their content to escape from prison when they find the truth about Danver's fate. "Maléfique" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French low budget horror film. The story is practically in the same place, there is no cliché and keeps the viewer in the last scene. I'm a big fan of French cinema, usually a story of romance, drama, and police, but I noticed recently that I have seen good French horror films like "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Bad Badges")
