This is another film based on the ultra-hung porn star, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also based on his life. Maybe someone will make a movie about Tommy Byron's life. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not very well said. There are many Law & Order episodes that have more revolutions than Wonderland, and the director does not get the case in any way. Val Kilmer has two problems - he's not nearly as Holmes is (and there are no prostheses at present, unlike Boogie Nights), and he's much better than Mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not introduce any pleasant individual among the cast. Racist, immature undergraduates with whom he hangs, or his wife, and the police can't describe much. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is Eric Bogosian, who talks to Paris Hilton about "getting lost". <br /> <br /> Having said all this, anyone who is interested in the porn industry in the 1980s or real crimes should not be left behind.
