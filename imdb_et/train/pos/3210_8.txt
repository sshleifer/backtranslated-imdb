SOLDIER is not as bad as many have done. I found that on this film, Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers have such sacred, cynical humor. The lack of dialogue and the top action is intentional and adds to the comic book atmosphere. <br /> <br /> One special trivia bite that stands out for me - Todd has a number of space campaign campaigns on tattooing. d on her chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. The Tannhauser Gate is mentioned for the unforgettable ones mentioned in Roy Batty's elegant latest lines, Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could have fought with the android soldiers like Roy, it is said to be the least. Maybe the scriptwriter David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I give it to 3 out of 5.
