Probably the best manufacturers who ever release Corp., this little horror swallows the attention of the first. Director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes it, and more importantly, he knows how to realize his full shock potential on the screen. Placing a plot and fascinating characters is not just the world! Almost all operations take place at night or in the middle of a sticking, spreading fog. This cool atmosphere is complemented by Wisbar's ingenious direction and the full-blown performances he has drawn from all his players. Lovely Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, stubborn, but vulnerable. Robert Barrat offers his usual nonsense, a straightforward portrait of a local bigwig, although it is hard to believe that a friendly, handsome man playing his son is no other than the later dullsville writer / director Blake Edwards.
