Of course, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's last production was filmed. But colleagues from IMDB come in, this movie is definitely one of the 30's masterpieces! That's 10. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw in the New York Museum of Modern Art in about 1970 (I was a teenager). Expensive viewing with such poverty scenes, masterfully photographed, often exciting and always interesting, was the best way to make MGM. What the viewers felt when they glanced at the attack of roses, the man-made mansion, the terrible poverty and the splendor of wealth. Last week, the Academy's people watching the awards had a glimpse of "Elder" Oscar winner Luise Rainer. How big to see an actor who allegedly gave one of the most masterful, strange history events by choosing a celebration. <br /> <br /> Ok, so he shouldn't have won a year ago (Great Ziegfeld), but don't blame Luise. The speakers were only ten years old when it was released and its dialogue was limited. But like Olan, his visual and vocal are memorable. <br /> <br /> Great in size and touching what more lover could want!
