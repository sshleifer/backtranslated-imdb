The Noni Hazlehurst Tournament Tournament (which won its AFI Prize) is at least equal to its effort at FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for interested parties, Alice Garner Noni appears as a child and Michael Caton (the most well-known PILLA) is a bearded painter. (It is also interesting that Hazlehurst is currently the BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS lifestyle program, and Caton has a number of real estate-type programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc.) This film reaffirms the crowd's belief that Noni was allegedly Australia's top female actor in 1980 early in the middle of the 1930s to mid - century. Rating: 79/100.
