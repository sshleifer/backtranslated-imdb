I never thought about it, but my friend said the first thing she thought when she heard the title "Midnight Cowboy" was gay porn. At that point, everything I was aware of was a reference to the episode of "Seinfeld", where Jerry tried Kramer to Florida on this bus and all Kramer sufferers and nosebleeds. <br /> <br /> The film was wonderful and surprisingly amazing and not all pee pessimistic like some movies I don't even remember because they're all nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot consisted essentially of naive cowboy Joe Buck. In New York, who is trying to be a hustler (male prostitute, basically), I thought it was easy to make a choice, just to hit the brick hard when a woman arrives at HIM, loading her for a sexual encounter. <br /> Then he will meet Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "Ratso" for all and lovely gay men who are always entertaining him. You think he is stupid, but lovable (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly, he and Joe's friends and film are so cute and cordial, looking at them more friendly and kind. Rizzo shows that he is really sad, a merciful man who is very sick and very depressed and self-conscious, hates naming "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida where he thinks life is much better and all his problems are solved and he learns to be a chef and be famous there. <br /> <br /> It is warm from the heart, watching Joe do everything he can to get them down to Florida with lots of fun moments (like Ratso is trying to steal food on that hip-hop and wife, who says, "Gee, well , you know, it's free. You don't have to steal it. "and he says," Well, if it's free, I'm not the steal "it" and the classic moment that is totally uneven and unplanned, where Hoffman is almost taxi hits and shouts "Hey, I'm here! I go here!") and the actress is so plausible, I never believe Joe Buck would grow up into an outstanding and respected actor Jon Voight and Ratso Rizzo would grow up to be legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman. it's not the first time they've been working together in leadership, but chemistry is so thick and intense. <br /> <br /> Then it's a sad part, which I think is quite redundant to call it "frustrating." disintegrates throughout the film, can barely walk, barely eat, cough a lot, sick and arrives on a bus stop in Florida. He suffers badly and only miles away from Miami, eventually dying on the bus. The bus driver assures everyone that nothing is wrong and continues. Sad, but not in a way that would make you go home and cry and mope unhappy as if you had lost your dog for 13 years. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie. And the soundtrack is pretty much composed of "All Calls" played at the time of the movie. Strange move, but great because the song is good and fits perfectly with the film's tone. Go see it, it's nice to go buy it
