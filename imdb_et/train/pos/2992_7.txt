It seems that even the director does not like this film, but I think he is a bit tough. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not perfect, but there are some atmospheric pictures and the story is good enough to interest you. <br /> <br /> It is hitting what seems to be a pretty beautiful village that adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies filmed in England I've just seen the last movie of these leaders, 'The Fucking Board', which looks pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> Movies for me so all that comes is worth our attention and it's not as bad as you think
