I really liked "Doctor Mordrid". It is a low budget movie that can be for some, but I have no problem with it. I admire this further, bearing in mind that it is more entertaining than what Hollywood throws out every year. Too bad it didn't bring the theater; I don't know anyone else, but I would have seen it in theaters. "Doctor Mordrid" is a very entertaining fiction that almost anyone can enjoy, especially if they are sci-fi like me. I don't see why this is an R-rated movie; only one f-word is spoken and there is no bad scenes or no blood. An timeless competition between the witches Anton and Kabbal (Anton wanted to use his abilities to save humanity, while Kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the story a fascination, while the mythical figure gave the story itself. Basically, it's a movie that's easy to watch. But in this movie, one unintentionally funny thing is: seeing Jeffrey Combs, who keeps a straight face wearing a silly blue cover and suit. It makes me laugh every time I see it. But I land ... Anyway, the actor is great; the main protagonists (Anton and his friend Samantha) are very fond of; Anton is sensible and welcoming and Samantha is friendly. In addition, the settings were excellent. The second dimension floating island was very cool; however, we only have a double glance at this; it would have been nice to see more scenes here. The main provision was also very clean; Anton's apartment is very spacious and has some cool devices, especially the tracking system he uses to track world events. He even has a pet crib that he keeps in his apartment Edgar. In general, it's a great movie; it was fun to watch, and the main participants felt a lot of feelings in their roles. If you find anywhere where rentals are "Doctor Mordrid" then you need to rent it (or buy it in my case. It was definitely well spent money)! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 stars ten. <br /> <br />
