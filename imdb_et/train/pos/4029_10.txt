I have no words to describe how good this film is. Only a genius such as Amrita Pritam could have written the depiction of such a real partition days. The film was haunted by me for several days. <br /> <br /> Urmila was in her life in this movie. He put his life on the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did not play his role as Rashid. It is hard to imagine anyone other than the two who make the role of Puroo and Rashid. The Punjab costumes were so natural that Urmila and Manoj saw the natural Punjab in Mussalma. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did a fabulous job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job for Trilok. <br /> <br /> Some scenes you just can't get out of your mind. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it brings eyes to the eye. The climax is just a killer. I was waiting for a tragic ending, but fortunately it was fun. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc.
