It was a great movie with many problems. It was about race and class issues. But it had a message about knowing and taking responsibility for itself. This movie was very deep, giving this message to you and only to your fate. It also showed that knowing yourself and your satisfaction with who you are is the only way you ever fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I believe that this movie made this great show. The participants I thought were able to convey each character perfectly. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. With just a glimpse, you don't see how deep the movie is, but look at the film's accentuating meaning.
