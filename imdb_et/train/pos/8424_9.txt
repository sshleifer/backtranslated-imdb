This is my busy live project by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of South Park. The exhibition was canceled after one season, not because of bad ratings (it actually got good reviews), but because it was very expensive. is quite funny from the average TV-TV channel. It is also a political satire. Now, it's not nearly as good as South Park, but it's a very funny sitcom and also a pretty good political satire. The man who plays is my hell. If you find an exhibition, check it out. There's a lot of laughter that was needed! <br /> <br /> 9/10
