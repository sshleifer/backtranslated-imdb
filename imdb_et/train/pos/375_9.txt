it was one of the most mobile movies I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I first looked at it and when it is on TV, my eyes are glued. The actress and the plot are amazing. it seems so true to reality and touches so many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama.
