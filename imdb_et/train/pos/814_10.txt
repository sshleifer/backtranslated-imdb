Thanks to Kevin Smith, the geeks are running around, saying that Jedi's return is not good because it's nice to look. And oh no! Muppets are involved! It makes it bad! Everyone liked Jedi's return until someone in Kevin Smith's movie made a negative comment on it. Now people are suddenly waiting for you, as you have some illness, if you mention how much you like. This film is so much better than anything Kevin Smith ever thought was that it was my way of thinking that a person would even think about denouncing it. This movie is fun! It's as fantastic as I remember when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! He's not right! <br /> <br /> And that Ewok song ended! I bet people don't even enjoy "Ewoks: Endor's Battle" !!!! I'll put you all down!
