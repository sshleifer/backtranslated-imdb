This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and Jackie said in an interview that this is also her favorite. It includes some incredible tricks and jaw falling sequences, as well as very funny scenes. This film was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used the parts of Rapid Fire and was raised in Tangos and Cash, which used some of the scenes that opened. <br /> <br /> Jackie is playing police in Hong Kong. The story jumps right into a fantastic ride through a bright city and continues as Jackie slips down the hill and jumps on a moving bus to catch the evil Ku (who is one of the biggest crooks in every Jackie Chan movie). very funny scenes when Jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girlfriend, played by Maggie Chung. His job is to protect the Ku secretary, who has enough information to take him off, but even this causes a lot of trouble. Jackie is absolutely the best here. The last fight scene in the mall is my favorite fighting scene for everyone - the period. It was the most intense fight I've ever seen with Jackie and tends to slip under the hollow, in the middle of exploding lights. All in all, he was one of his biggest stunts he'd ever done and left his hands on the skin. He was happy that he was not under an electric shock, because the person responsible for the stunts used a higher tension instead of a lower voltage. At the end of this movie you can say that he did not hold back and did not own the cadres. So many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie so that no one would have secured them anymore - Jackie had to take responsibility. There are no gimmicks, wires or stand-ins - it's all true-life activities that you can watch. This is an activity that made him a phenomenon that he is and this is a film that amazes people for 100 years. If you haven't seen this movie and are a Jackie Chan fan or action in general, give yourself the treatment and watch this movie. It's really sensational.
