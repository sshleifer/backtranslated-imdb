Gus Van Sant has made great films. I'm really a fan. <br /> <br /> But I can't help but feel that Tom Robbins' book "Even the Cowgirls Get the Blues" brain edge will be lost on the big screen when translated. Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant alone are incredible visionaries and talent towers. Ultimately, though, it just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> It wasn't that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive. It's just that our imagination is much more powerful when reading such a book. We are taken away for another time and place, and sometimes we think the worst and / or the best, and it adds the entire book to the skateboarder because it appears exactly according to the author's accuracy. However, movies can be left with one of the smallest imaginative and emotional rolls, reducing the overall experience. That's what I believe it happened here. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading the book!
