This film has a clear story that is quite unusual for the musical genre. "Cats", "Opera Phantom" and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber may be metaphorical, as they are based on literary works. The story of "Biarkan Bintang Menar" (BBM) concerns the interpersonal environment, especially the relationship between the people of Indonesia. Despite the fact that the film is based on a "supposed" fairy tale, it is actually a "child" fantasy for Indonesian adults. The dance series are not perfect, but the songs show how the Indonesians express themselves. I think the choreographer should look into Indonesian dance, because he was not surprised by the fact that the development of Indonesian dance tends to be more western. Dancers are in some ways inconvenient and not synchronized with songs and / or music. However, I love this movie and consider it a new Indonesian film genre that I hope to improve in the future.
