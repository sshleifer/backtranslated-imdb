It's a wonderful movie in many ways. Everyone in my family liked it. The animation is great and it easily demonstrates that there are many manufacturers who create films that are both visually brilliant and everything from the Disney studio. <br /> <br /> One difference from the usual Disney price is that this Dreamworks movie does not contain a somewhat wise side-bending comedy. And there are no unexpected moments in which characters are captured by songs. I'm sure the scene at the beginning of the movie will not appear on Disney's picture: Birth of the Spirit. But it is done tastefully and it is not offensive at all. "Spirit" was the great breath of fresh air. Don't do me wrong. For years I have loved Disney and I will continue with it. "Spirit" is another example of a great animated price. As soon as it was over, my kids wanted to see it again. I had the same feeling. I recommend it thoroughly.
