I saw this movie for the first time in France a year earlier. It came and little fanfare came, but I enjoyed the beauty of landscape photography and fascinating natural beauty. (The story, though nice, is really casual. If you really thought about it, most of what's happening is not happening in real life.) I saw it again today, in these countries, on DVD. Again, I gather that its distribution is very limited. The blockers had only one copy of it and I never remember it in the Cleveland Art Houses. <br /> <br /> While watching my TV, photography is not so breathtaking, although it is still very beautiful. Natural video footage is still exciting. The story of a relationship between a 10-year-old child and a fox is more convincing for the second time than you know where it goes. <br /> <br /> But as I said, the story is random. This is a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like wildlife film, it's interesting.
