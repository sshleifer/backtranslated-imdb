this is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time. I recently saw this movie again and it's still my memory. Many of the films we watched when we were younger do not seem to look at them later in life. The film is actually an excellent 80-year example of the type of films made. Keaton is his best, all the actors did a great job and Ron Howard was very good at stopping the story instead. The pace of the movie is fast, with a few slow spots and 80's of cars being too funny. From the 1980s onwards, I loved to see the foolish mood again. The film is a great movie for all comedy students and 80's film students.
