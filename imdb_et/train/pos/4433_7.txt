Story: On the island of Texel, photographer Bob, who takes a photo for the magazine, meets mysterious Kathleen. His free spirit and lust of life is intrigued by Bob, who soon suffered from traumatic experience. But his life is not as easy as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob gets into a dangerous network. Can Kathleen be able to win her trust? <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story develops nicely, although it will be a little bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character was psychology ‚Äùwould have been developed a little more. Why do these people do what they do? What motivates their choices? This gives me the depth of the film and something to think about. The story never reaches an emotional climax, though the characters justify it. So you don't know these symbols at a deeper level. Actors do a good job and play in a very natural and "credible way", but I think it would have been better for the film if Kathleen had played as a younger actress because the naivety of this character does not work for a woman for adults. The camera's work is great, and the island has some great wildlife shots. I'll give the movie 7/10.
