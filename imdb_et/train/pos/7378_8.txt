After watching this movie last night at Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was first made in this film. Here we have many elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is a source of supernatural source. Instead of being stunned, we have a haunting studio and strange pictures on the film. In fact, the strange images appear on the film immediately remind the video tape cursed at RINGU. The only thing missing was an obsession with water running through Nakata's later films. The final scenes are quite cold, slightly wrapped in Murnau, which opens the door by itself and the ghost reminds me of entering the room immediately <br /> <br /> NOSFERATU. A freezing film that makes thinking go through.
