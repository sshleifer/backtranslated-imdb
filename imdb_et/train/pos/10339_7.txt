I saw this Afro Promol, a collection of African-American film collections. It seemed what it was; extremely trendy "nervous" comedy, where a dense black man realizes that his son is gay. It seems that Redd Foxx's (RF) husband has left him with his brother who works with him in a "shop" in Phoenix. He has taken a bus to visit his son Norman in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> So when RF arrives, Norman, who is wearing something other than short-blue bikini shorts, gets his water from the bottom of the door. Norman tries to buy time by making his older father on the 60th floor of the stairs trying to awaken Norman's lover who consistently refuses to resurrect. That was exactly where I wrote, "Why doesn't he wake up?" when maybe he does, and me and my friend's jaws fell for the first time several times when we were presented with our first glimpse of blue eyes, rotating hair from Garson, Norman's white lover who just "was the most faaaaaabulous dream ?? "Garson is a flaming queen who can ONLY be imagined since 1976.> <br /> Norman tells his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit. Garson goes with Waylon flowers and Madam responds when Norman calls . <br /> <br /> So RF is trying to reach his wife in Mexico. When he is on the phone, Garson has to wrap his dress and RF binds him. With a break in the 70s, the soul meant music that he raised his dawn revelation (but it sounded more than we hear the very special path of the Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> His first impulse is "I'll kill him. I'll kill him. "Then RF goes for a long walk, where he travels through all the thoughts that may be confusing parents, for example" maybe we'll train him too soon. "His thoughts are all due to what he sees in his walk, for example, a heavy truck driver who appears just like he thinks what makes a real man, surprisingly he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. It has to be said that this is about eight more books about homosexuality when my parents bought it. directly to the park bench and reads all of them! <br /> <br /> RF then hires Audrey, a six-foot Amazon prostitute (in this amazing fur) played by Cleopatra Jones Tamara Dobson, she hired Norman to try heterosexuality, but this piss Norman and storms out to stay with your friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then Garson comes over and offers the night RF. I'm the mother of a story that keeps Pilipinosa from irrational prejudice because "she was a thundered luau." They take part in Wayon's and Madam's long performance, which culminates with Mr Ping's violent head until her hair comes loose. Once again, the mouth was agape. <br /> <br /> So it doesn't seem to know it, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together! You see, ordinary older black men just have to see mega-queen entertainment to come around for all the gay worlds they offer! It's really that easy! It still does not prevent the "rape!" when Garson awakens him from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you think. WHAT IS THE BASIS OF NORMAN AND GARSON? They don't seem to have a report, and Norman has no punishment for Garson's strike, and even when he comes around, he never protects Garson and doesn't talk about their relationship. There was some sweetly delightful touch like RF that buys all those books on homosexuality - and sitting on a park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something about homosexuality, not just run or make friends with friends. <br /> <br /> Moreover, this is just what it feels like: a little remnant of a past era, a time when some gays thought that when straight people were just sitting and looking at the hit of the marionettes, we can all learn to love each other and Understand! And because of the total naivety of this thing, extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue are just as outdated and offer a lot of discussion about how things have become gays over the last 30 years. I think the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay female friends are desperately in love and are ready to drink them to sleep and convert them. <br /> <br /> ------ Hi, look at Cinema de Merde, my website for bad and cheesy movies (some good movies were thrown).
