I saw this movie recently. Two hours later my head grabbed my head. The plot was so terrible, the jokes were so bad, but what I didn't expect was: <br /> <br /> 1. 2 scenes before and after the movie with Pat and Jay (which caused more than enough laughter) <br /> <br /> 2. It's a story through the windscreen that destroyed the evil one. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and I even had a disclamer on my copy that says you don't like a movie to send a certificate to HBO. When I did, it was the date you had to get in January of the year 1991 (which also caused trouble).
