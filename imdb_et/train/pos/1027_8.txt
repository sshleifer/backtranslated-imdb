I'm not very good at writing comments so I just spray my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I loved it at the beginning of the series. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was great. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. It seemed that Davis was the fifth most important person. Not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) stayed at the end of the seventh season and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series dropped sharply. I don't know if this is because Hammond was more important to realize or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series **** turned. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, but were fantastic. For the first time, the film "Stargate" seemed mediocre, but it turned out to be a brilliant tuning for a series, even if it was not the original goal. I suggest you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you get it the second time, believe me) and then watch the rest of the series for the last three seasons is not nearly as good as the first seven, but that doesn't mean that they are not good. It just means that they have been damaged in the first seven seasons when you have finished this series. <br /> <br /> Once you've finished this series, be sure to follow the spin off series, Stargate: Atlantis. This is the successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT 7-18-08: I just found that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. This is a big loss.
