I stumbled randomly on this series. After half an episode I was hooked. American Gothic was a dark, strange series of Gary Cole as a mysterious, probably evil Sheriff Buck, trying to control his illegal son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by Gary Cole's unhappy sheriff and I was even more impressed by Lucas Black. Lucas Black's Caleb was able to stand with Sheriff Buck, one of the most frightening signs for TV series. I have rarely seen a child's actress as much presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you weren't happy to see Lucas in the American Gothic style, look at him in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a remarkable example of many ambiguities and mysteries that have never been explained in the short term.
