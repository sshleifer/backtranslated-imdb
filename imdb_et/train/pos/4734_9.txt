I'm a big fan of Jet Li! He's the best star of HK in life ... and that's why - This movie shook! I saw it in a video store and, as it was in the mainstream of the mainstream of the video shop, I didn't register my presence first and had to look twice. I knew right now what I would rent. My only feature (I thought it was) is that it was dubbed (AAARGh) and not subtitled. Elsewis, the original / strange / cool plot of the movie, and with full action, made it one of the best films of Jet Li ... although they all belong to this category.
