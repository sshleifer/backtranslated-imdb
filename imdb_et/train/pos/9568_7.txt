Some comments on IMDb have compared dogs' bite dogs to classic 90's Cat III movies, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very amazing, this Pou-Soi Cheang movie is not a pretty butterfly, gentle, or sensational teen in this comparison. However, it is still a punch that makes it worth it, especially if your thing is sharp, hard-working. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays Pang, a man hit by Cambodia, who travels to Hong Kong to murder a judge's wife; Sam Lee is Wai, a ruthless policeman who has decided to track him down, no matter what it is. As Wai closed his target, Pang stops to escape his escape until he meets Yue, a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape the abuse of his life. <br /> <br /> A harsh harsh cinematic art, amazing sound, amazing score and Chen and Lee (as well as Pei Pei's newcomer to Pang's love), a solid show, Dog Bite Dog is one of the fans of hyper-violence in Asia (think Chan-wook) Park's Revenge Trilogy). Stabbings, shootings, ruthless beating: everything happens on a regular basis in this movie and is caught insecurely directed by Cheang. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a story that is meant to be an unhappy ending for everyone involved, and certainly enough that all of this movie will all die (rather nasty death). Unfortunately, the tragic and tragedy between the (unintentional) comedy, and at its last moments, the dog's biting dog is exceedingly ridiculous in the dramatic final scene of Pang and Wai in the battle when pregnant Yue looks. Finally, after all three have suffered, the wounded Pang with DIY Ceasarean (now dead) is Yue, giving his baby moments before he dies himself. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not be a "classic" Hong Kong meat, its gentle OTT action and stylish visuals, it's still worth it.
