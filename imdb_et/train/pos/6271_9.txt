I liked this movie. It was pretty cool. It's all: cars, shooting weapons, fighting and even a symbolic girl. It doesn't look like any of these things except cars. A little shooting, a little bit of struggle, a bit of scent and a car with LOT, near the end of a big run. It can be said that jumping is impractical, but it is possible with our good friends at IMDB, so the film is not as bad as people paint it. It has a certain quality and I liked it. In fact, I loved the movie. And I didn't have to turn off my brains to see it. I didn't always think "Is that possible?" or tramp like it. 9 in 10.
