One of the best parts of Sundance is watching movies, which would almost certainly not be missed. If you are not a true devotee of an art house, you probably won't try documentaries. Only a handful to get a recognizable breakdown. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic product group in Luther Lucket's LaGrange correction complex in Kentucky. Each year, the group presents prisoners to the Shakespeare game. Director Hank Rogerson and his team follow the troupe, as roles are selected, interpreted, tried, and ultimately fulfilled. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with an exciting revelation for those who haven't lived in prison. Regardless of the labels we know about them (convicted, offender, murderer, etc.), we soon began to appreciate these men and think as thinking about the person. The Tempest was probably the game for the year of filming, focusing on forgiveness and redemption. Participants grasp the relevance of the games to their lives, find patterns and parallels with their characters and drama. <br /> <br /> For the best documentary, like a book, we hope that we will experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare's bars were a personal revelation for me. "A bold new world with such beings."
