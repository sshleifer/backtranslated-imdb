Although it was not without his mistakes, it was a drama that was shown during Easter. It reminded us of our spiritual life and showed that we often hide our deepest suffering and experience behind our facades. There was so much fun in the drama, especially for young teens who gave the drama a better musical addition than a bad sound score in the background. The show was great and Timothy Spall was great again. The climax was very satisfactory when it was rather simplified. Timothy Spall's "shooting" of her long-term dead woman's suicide was plausible and well reflected the feelings of despair in her self-inflicted teenage girl. The resolution between Graffiti's boy and Muslim was gratifying, but less plausible. An excellent drama that left himself and my husband cutting that evening was well spent. Congratulations!
