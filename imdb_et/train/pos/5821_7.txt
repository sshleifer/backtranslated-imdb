I was quite surprised to read honestly some comments on this work. Some people were looking for a plot? When this video appeared over a decade ago, I watched what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It has no plot or central story. It is a rather long-lasting artistic anthology of videos, all of which are made intelligently or creatively. Michael Jackson can be a freak today, but it was the man who gave us Thriller (which many considered the greatest music video of all time) and set trends for Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker, he and his filmmakers and artists collaborated again with his music and dance performances to create vividly entertaining things that included Claymation, special effects, lively performances, and even an independent parody ("Badder" sequence). And for those who know what Joe Pesci did there, this video came before he became the household and was one of his most memorable performances on film. And IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal Order (choreographic section) wins something else that Michael Jackson did up to that point!
