I didn't have much expectations in the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan has a very different role. She has slipped the slippery Armani's ridiculous look and pays off, showing she is a great actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play great each other for a long time with one of their best friends. Humor is dark, Brosnani, Kinnear and Hope Davis' performances are great, the story about friendship is interfering with this element and you have a great movie. This is probably one of the best comedies of friends for a long time. This is a movie that definitely shows that we can expect great things in Bondan's post-Bond era.
