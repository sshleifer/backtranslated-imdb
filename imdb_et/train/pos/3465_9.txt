I sat down to watch this movie very scary and little hope. I didn't think this movie could deal with its subject. But it was completely and then some. First, I have to say that Jared Harris did an exceptional job with John Lennon. Sometimes Harris seemed to direct Lennon. This similarity was often unpleasant, and he clearly studied Lennon's motives and vocal effects. Aiden Quinn was pretty good as McCartney, wearing a striking resemblance to Maccas, though he sometimes traveled with his Scouse accent. Of course, this was a pure fantasy, but sometimes I felt that I saw it open at the key. Particularly moving roofing as McCartney told Lennon, which he had never heard of as a child - that he was worthy and important, and he could never be his fault that his parents were his abandoned. I also enjoyed the scene of the park, where their couple danced absolutely to give up the reggae band. <br /> <br /> My one complaint would be: I'm not so sure that John was as gentle as he was depicted in the film at this stage of his life. He had settled quite well with his domestic situation and was actually quite friendly when he turned to fans. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when his assassin first turned to the autograph on the day of his assassination. <br /> <br /> In most cases, this film helped to stir those feelings again. John was a little longer. I'm pretty sure the Beatles would have come back at some stage. And I'm pretty sure Lennon and McCartney are friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I look at it over and over again. <br /> <br />
