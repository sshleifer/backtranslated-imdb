It is just a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are actually what they think. I don't know if my video has a scene, but it never shows how the dogs came out of the well. It also shows the instinct of survival of animals and the ability to follow. Put people in the same position and the helicopters would be out. Because if the original text is corrected by the remake, the removal of the first voice command. Only the use of animals in such a movie can work because the use of people should have hit the story, making it a murder, proving that the animals are more interesting than the people
