I was looking at the first series with enthusiasm, but I wondered if I'd be back after a long break. But I tuned in to the 2nd episode and I was put together again. It's really a great TV; groundbreaking things like mission: impossible back in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded and expanding as the series continues, they change as they adapt - some more easily than others - to their new environment, but they remain wisely in nature and yet more than possible compassion for someone you would not have thought you might ever regret if you really crush something. I hope you have been waiting for many years to come - and I don't think so much if I never get answers to all the secrets!
