"Seven Pounds" speaks of Will Smith's exciting performance and the story that draws your heartbeat harder than the rock guitar solo, "Seven Pounds" travels past the director's The Pursuit of Happiness. . Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino, because some of her films can be missed in the unexpected way if the actor added to the project is not that high. Too bad that I thought Will Smith's scheme was built up early when I put two and two together when he called his suicide on the first scene and scene when Rosario Dawson's character was introduced to incurable hearts But I think the writer / director did the right choice that put societies on (booklets are the first and last scene), so it is a source of urgency and tension. a movie to gradually find out how exactly a man can get to this ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between the character of Smith and Dawson flourish and evolve, knowing in the back of the mind always what was for those failed two One of my friends with whom I saw the movie thinking that the character of Smith could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic, if at the other time in the presence of his seven chosen persons he may be tough and frightening, and if he alone he got his full weight too much and it will completely break down. This is quite versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget that this is a crash scene reactivation, which was really amazing about music-related cinematography. Put it on your list.
