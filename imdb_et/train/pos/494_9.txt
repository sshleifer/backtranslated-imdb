This is the start of a new and exciting Star Trek series. It has a "down-to-earth" glove that feels darker and less "plaggse". <br /> <br /> You need more time to develop characters, but they have the potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (with all Star Trek series) is that they represent such a grim picture of equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture of everything else. (Earth has finished war, famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> There are two women here, the sub-command T'Pol, who is vulcan and communication staff Hoshi, who is a human. Hoshi is quite funny and T'Pol is "vulcan babe". <br /> <br /> Some team members feel a bit American (as opposed to the international feel of the TNG team) but generate interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> Very good pilot for a very good series.
