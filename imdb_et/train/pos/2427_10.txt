This is really a great unknown film.Perfect dialogue without typical clich√©s. This film was based on the actor's talent and it was pulled out. It was even a bit of comedy for it, but it was not redundant. If life is what criminal drama should be, not typical special effect garbage with sex thrown.I especially loved its interracial aspects. <br /> <br /> Now the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was a great career in violence. It's a disgrace that she is only allowed to show her talent in her movie. Titus Welliver was fabulous, like Fishburne's junky brother. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already flavored film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat-free monkey / drug lord.I loved his action from "New York King". But the best deeds in this movie came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were in pairs. <br /> <br /> Once in a lifetime, you're sure he's a keeper. **** 1/2 * *****.
