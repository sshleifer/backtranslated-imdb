The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After the exciting two sets we get the final installment. Here's my job: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) for those who know everything. He's been too long. This time it ends. <br /> <br /> Bourne's ultimatum has a large plot, fantastic writing, fantastic direction, intercourse and some of the best summer activities. Matt Damon still has his best results. He has an uneasy assassination and swelling. <br /> <br /> Here are some smart humor and some subtle intercourse. For certain events, you will either laugh (in good ways) or rejoice. (or both) I heard a lot of smart smiles and a lot of fascination in the theater. Audience loved it. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum offers everything nicely in a gift package. All the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion, the best film this summer. <br /> <br /> Last word: excellent conclusion. The best of trilogy. This is how to make movie thrillers in the summer. I love Bourne's trilogy.
