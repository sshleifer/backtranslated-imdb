I, the boy in the heart, which means I love cartoons, still! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, he was my favorite. I thought a man, it was great "new" on TVs and when my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember looking at him when I was younger," and I'm like "Father, Bugs wasn't when you were younger So I think he's definitely more than one generation, maybe 3. I love this example, which is great for kids and adults, OK, all that is very funny, me and my husband, both in our 20s, when we love to look at the views, and we don't mind repetitions. This exhibition brings back many memories, happy. I also love Christmas with Tweety like Tiny Tim, that's cute. I can't choose my favorite Looney Toons character because they have changed over the years. When I was little, of course, it was Bugs and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always loved her. In fact, I have to say that everything is my favorite. this is a great show for all ages, very funny, voice action is incredible, the only mistake is that unfortunately s ee ended, two decades ago, but repetitions are great!
