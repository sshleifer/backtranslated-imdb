Two witches are fighting in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal), who is trying to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs Anton Mordrid), who is trying to save it. "Doctor Mordrid" is an enjoyable fantasy price that offers a lot of Cheese is pretty stupid and the drill is completely missing, but the film is very short and entertaining. So if you have enough time to kill, give it one look. My rating: 7 out of 10.
