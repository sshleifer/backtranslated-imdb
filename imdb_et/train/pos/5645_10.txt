I purchased a DVD based on my other interests based on Amazon.com's recommendation. They hit the nail with the head. I remember looking at it when it was on television, but I was always thinking about what happened to it. Ten years later, it's the same as watching it for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb's Temple and Gary Cole Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, although they are somewhat competitors. The head (Caleb) and the evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck) are almost represented. I have never really understood what Lucas was supposed to be, but it is enough to say that he has some special powers that nothing the Holy did. He can call phones, write, or even cause a person to change his emotions. Nonetheless, there are some episodes where he actually gets a good boy. All in all, this is a great series that, like many other people, I mean (I.E. Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV, but some names) was canceled before their time. Steven King's The Dead Zone seems to be the only thing in the genre that seems to be the case. There is nothing more to watch on TV. This is because everything that deals with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be pulled out of the TV immediately. So, in the meantime, I just buy DVD sets and watch exhibitions that should still be on television, but that were captured by television using religious stationery so we can look at "quality" like a family man and an American father and a Simpsons (what a bunch of crap that is ).
