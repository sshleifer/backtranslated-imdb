I rented "still crazy" instead. When I described the Hardcore logo to a video store, he said it sounded like Crazy. So I rented it. I was disappointed? Yes, yes, because Still Crazy focuses on a classical band rather than a punk band, but that's OK. Still, Crazy talks about Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke down in the 1970s to the top of their popularity at a big rock festival. Twenty years later, the band members try to earn a living and are offered the chance to play a concert on the twentieth anniversary of this festival. They accept the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis, building on the European process. This results in some fairly funny hinkies and all the marks go through fine changes. When you watch this movie, you feel like a carefully edited documentary as a participant. And it's not bad at all.
