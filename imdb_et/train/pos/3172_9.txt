Debut? Wow-Cross-Eyed is just one of the most enjoyable films I watched last year, making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is a writer's debut. I mean - I signed up for IMDb to find more films from this writer ... because Cross Eyed has this unique signature - you want to see what else this writer could say. These days it is rare to see a movie that is well-written, well-managed, well-edited, and well-functioning. For me, Cross Eyed includes what movies should be like - combining the best of all film elements to create a clever, artistic and brilliant story. Please, please.
