Okay, let's be honest. this is a godly film. The plot (as it is) is terrible, worse. But the film was made for one reason and for one reason, just like all those horrible Mario Lanza movies ... just to hear the star's voice, in this case Pavarotti's main. Okay, so maybe the Lanza movies were an excuse for hitting the women, but this film is about listening to Luciano. It's just worth watching the movie. The great opera star, who is stuck with herself, faces her fears, finds humility and love along the way, and also affirms many hit numbers. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have been harmed at many levels. I'm Italian. I'm a big fan of Pavarotti (is something about Pavarotti that isn't big, including his fan base?). And when I first saw this movie, I went through myself, seeing the height and depth of life and love for the first time. As terrible as this movie is, beautiful voice and memories are enough to breathe deep into life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's terrible and terrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it is all about. So I give this film a high rating in the hope that someone who has never heard of Pavarotti will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he is now gone. Like Italian food that you haven't tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, like Luciano's lover or the future Pavarotti peep.
