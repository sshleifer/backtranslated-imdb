I've seen almost all Miyazaki movies and they are all beautiful and enchanting. But it rises over the rest. This film impressed me. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta and their sweet, caring friends. They made a movie for me. Of course, the animation is also great and the music saves the feelings of the film perfectly. But the characters are the bright point of this film: they are so well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Let me explain now: I'm really talking about the Japanese language (under English). Although the English dub is good (mostly), it is simply compared to the original language version. Votes are better, dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and listening to) the movie as it was originally.
