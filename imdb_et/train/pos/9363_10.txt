This movie was amazing, it's a movie where you watch it and not the actor watching other movies you watch other film director / writer. Sandler did a good job working outside his comfort zone, and always good Cheadle did a great job. This movie is great for a mature intelligent audience. Action was fantastic and can only be overcome by writing and managing a movie. This film focuses on real Americans, past generations, stereotypes or racism, just for people who have come together and understood the true meaning of life. This film deals with loss and coping. Instead of choosing psychiatry, he defines it not as someone who magically heals you, but rather needs to speak his feeling to an impartial person you don't trust, but rather guide you through your thoughts. This movie is amazing!
