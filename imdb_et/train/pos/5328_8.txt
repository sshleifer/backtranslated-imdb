I remember it first on television. I couldn't believe TVNZ promised it! I had to own it! A lot of humor is lost on non-NZs, but let it go! <br /> <br /> Since the back of the Y series is Matt and Chris have moved on to bigger and better things. NZ's biggest bold curator Randy Campbell has often appeared in the British TV Balls of Steel. Yes, he still f ^ @ ks up all his tricks because he's too drunk. <br /> <br /> "House Band" Deja Voodoo has released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band includes the back of the Y team and a few such songs as "I'll give you one of my beers (but I've only got 6)" and "You weren't even born in the 80s" to continue your humor <br /> <br /> Southwest also had his full-length feature film "The Devil Made Me Do It", which will be released in early 2008 at NZ. <br /> <br /> All up, If you can't find these guys funny, just get F% ^ K OFF!
