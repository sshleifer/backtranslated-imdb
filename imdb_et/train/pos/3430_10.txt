I tried to sift it at the Sundance Film Festival and was over Awe over the absolute power of this film. It is a study of the psychological effects of our brave soldiers who join the military in the hope that they will defend and serve our country with respect and care for our government. The film describes the psychological changes taking place in the boot camp, as soldiers become "killers in their own country" and get into war and after they return home. It also has the effect of killing the human psyche. It gives respect to soldiers and never criticizes soldiers unlike other films, but criticizes a system that is not prepared to take care of all the physical and psychological needs of returned veterinarians. This film is powerful, moving, emotional and thought-provoking. It is a call for arms support to support our troops not only by purchasing stickers and driving parades, but actually listening to them, and contributing to changes in their health and well-being after slaughter. <br /> <br /> Best Film Festival So far **** / ****
