I must say that higher education is one of the three most viewed films. It is a brilliant cast and equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life at university can be. There are 3 main stories, skinheads, African Americans and homosexuals. I was interested in all the stories, but what got me the most was the story of Kristen that fought his feelings against another girl. The end was great. I am still crying after 25 times the film. I would have given this movie to 11, but I have to solve the 10/10.
