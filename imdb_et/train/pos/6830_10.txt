Many of the comments here explain the story and signs of "Opening Night" in detail so I don't. I want to add my comment to believe that film is a great confirmation of life. <br /> <br /> At first, Myrtle Gordon recalls how easy it was to act when he was 17 when he was young and energy and knew he knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile, thinking about her life and even if she can even live. The tragic accident causes a personal crisis that almost transcends him. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour, he once again discovered the power of his art and reaffirmed himself ("I want to bury his bastard," he says of his husband, Maurice.) It seems almost sadistic that the director of Myrtle prevents people from helping him when he hopelessly drunk into the first performance. He knows, however, that he must have the courage to do it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics don't know if this triumph is just a temporary break down to Myrtle. opening night ‚Äù- she opens like a flower to new ways of living and acting, she sees the way forward. It's tremendously mobile. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is great. The movie is great. Thank you, Mr Cassavete, wherever you you are.
