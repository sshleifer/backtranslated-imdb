I looked at it as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it disturbs me how it has no distributor in the UK. In fact, this is not the case because this film is all that Hollywood film is not - original, creative, peculiar and humorous. It seems that today no one really wants to see this type of film, because it is not in the simplest way in line with the general conventions that most young viewers are looking for in the film. <br /> <br /> hasn't written an age review for IMDb, but he felt inclined to give this film a special reputation, even if it was between my 30-minute break between classes! Basically, this is nothing, because the two main characters get into the world of their emptiness through hatred of the world. Here is a glimpse of how the director keeps interest through most of the running times with only two characters and that the only mass-en-scene consists of half the house and a large white empty space. This is largely due to the actors' perfect performances, both of which offer some great laugh, but at the same time they can add an important emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I love to write some more, but I am quite limited in time. However, I encourage anyone and everyone to try this movie. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a single and well-executed fashion with good performances, a strong script, a nice sound design and (quite) an impressive visual design that creates a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame that few people know anything.
