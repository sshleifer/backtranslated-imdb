This film may not put the Catholic Church in the best light, but tells a story based on real events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is all nice and rosy. Sometimes people and groups do things that at that time seem to be right, but they do not seem to be retrospectively as they ever did. "Sharing Love" tells the story of the family, yes it contains religion, but in fact it is the story of the family and the ability of that family to stay together, whatever they are thrown into. This film is also based on real events, which does not mean that this story, the scene by event, is true, but if you look at the news of this period, it would be possible to see that neither church led the incident that helped the family. Both churches are at fault, the Catholic Church forced such a regulation to be forced upon the family first and not to respond to the accompanying violence and the Protestant Church to tell her that she should simply obey her husband and her priest and not fight. In this case, let both families go down. I believe that the film is doing a good job of fighting both in the church and in the family. It does not change the shape or form of the Catholic Church in any way, but on the contrary, it shows how one incident can change the ideas of this religion and how one person can reach much more than just himself.
