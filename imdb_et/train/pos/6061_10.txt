I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and that's something about a documentary. Musical results, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you would expect from Imax production. Although it has been done for these big Imax theaters, it seems wonderful and sounds in my home system. In fact, it would make your system a demo for an ideal DVD. <br /> <br /> The theme is also so exciting. It's related to Mario Andetti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racing car in history because he is the only person to win the CART Championship, F1 Championship, Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two very important cars for father and son. The first car has been found in chicken co-operation and turns out to be the first thing Mario ever drove, and we follow the restoration to glowing fullness. The second car is a new racing car from Michael and we follow this form by cutting through the race season. Imax gives you just the right magic to make your car construction fun and exciting. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of the Michael Amoretti team at the time of the film, tells the movie. His anecdotes and witticism, drawn over many years as an owner and leader, provide a lot of production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is racing. Increase the volume here! Some riding has over 200 mph and a musical score that draws you to the screen so you don't forget the experience. Wow! <br /> <br /> The ultimate magical element is the humanity of Andrett's family. This racing world god Mario Andretti is a loving father who proudly watches his son's career. They work together so well that every father and son should see it. You can say that they are close families. I wish we all had this experience.
