I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, but four things really stand out: Sam Raim's perfect comic timing and performance as a campfire (?) Man, Alan Arkin's excellent character for camp owner and best for cinema. The beautiful golden tones of the external images draw me to the film like sunset at sunset, which pulls me into my summer memory. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and mood feel very natural and credible. Some reviewers criticize the absence of a "deeper" script. For me, that is the lack of this film. The characters and their problems seem real and that is why I care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all parts come together to create a whole that is right.
