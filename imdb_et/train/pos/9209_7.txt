ATTENTION: ***** Works **** just forget ***, which is a little bit ** ** Lace <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) makes peace in the West when he meets a group of men who treat a woman. Being a gentleman, he naturally enters and stops, and kills the disgusting son of the enforcer. It is just the beginning of all the weapons that blaze the battle to the end, which will only become one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star that has never been able to do with me. Maybe I discovered him too late and after the second movie I saw with him last Monday, The Human Shield, it was another Dud (ha ha). But I have a thing for Westerners, being movies that just download me for a different time and place and offer real entertaining entertainment, and Dudikoff has chosen one of his best scripts, like his movies. <br /> <br /> The film hits some of the low points in the form of a nervous paddle that sounds like empty Marlon Brando and some are generally acting on some pains, and the mandatory cheap search kits. But if for some strange reason your life would depend on watching a Dudikoff movie, it would be one of your best choices. ***
