Although the soundtrack is a bit outdated, this story is more relevant in the US than ever before. Not only with blue collar jobs, but with all jobs that US companies outsource while government profits and America suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss is Emory, a steel worker who works with the same work his father did for 35 years. His wife is well represented by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family with two children when Emory loses her job. The factory is closed under the pretext of misuse, but there is also bullying and cheaper wages, where they can pay one steel worker for one month (outsourcing) what they should pay to Strauss / Emory a day. Do not forget that these men are all good loyal employees who have the values ​​and they strive for the best for their family. . It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes move between Emor and his father. Emory hopes her local union will be able to reopen the mill as they allow it. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother Lee already sees a letter on the wall. Stainless steel (Ohio) did not leave jobs and they have to move on. But where can they move in the US? Where Is It Better For A Blue Collar Worker? <br /> <br /> At the end, there is a triumphant scene where Emory and his team fill the charger with steel products. The guard allows them to do it as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and has empathy. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, good news is a difficult time here in America. Something that must be personally influenced by little care. 8/10
