There is no such thing as a perfect murder. A third Columbo knows that .Ken Franklin, the other side of the Detective Stories Team, doesn't know it. He kills his partner, Jim Ferris, who was planning to solo. Columbo takes a picture and asks Mr Franklin any questions. And he returns to another question. Kolumbo: The murder of the book (1971) is led by young Steven Spielberg before his celebration day. Steven Bochco wrote it. Columbo has a fantastic character with its dirty appearance. It's hard to believe that this man could solve any crime. But he can.Everyone and each of them! Peter Falk is one and only person in the world who could portray this character. So don't remake, please. This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the murderer and Martin Milner plays the victim. victim's wife Joanna Ferris. There is something pleasant about the scenes between Columbo and him. How he makes an omelette and everything.Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. It actually met with a tragic fate when he died after murder as he does here. I've been a Columbo fan since childhood and I still enjoy watching them. For many years it was a break that they didn't show Columbo's stories, but now he's back. Back to one more question.
