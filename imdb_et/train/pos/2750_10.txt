This is a movie that the US does not do. This is why people rent foreign films. This is a great story of how one person, even if he or she has retreated, can make a reason for an empty person. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people who are mentally challenged suffer in their lives and show them very realistically (I think). Since this film is in the classic form of foreign films, it is the end of the bittersweet, but it only makes it a better film.
