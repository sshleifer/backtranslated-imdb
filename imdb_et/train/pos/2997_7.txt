William Powell is Philo Vance's "Kennel Murder Case", a 1933 film featuring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. The dog show where Philo has entered his Scottish Terrier is a mystery of a room with too many suspects locked. Mystery is very clever and abandonment is as complex as interesting. As the talks are still quite young, the camera's work is a bit static, but Michael Curtiz is doing a good job of directing it. <br /> <br /> Support cast is great; the whole cast brings the film up. Many actors have played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played it the most (five times) and has the most appropriate role - very relaxed but at the same time serious. It was done before the "thin man" grabbed him for a big stardom - he had spent about 12 years at the time, starting his career in 1912 at the age of 20. \ t A remarkable man, a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable Actress who lived almost 92. We are so happy that his movies are available on DVD and TCM today. "Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and fun movie - don't miss it.
