I thought it was one of the best queues I've seen for a while. Sometimes I felt like I wanted someone to die, killing Stanley's irritating signs was great. It was such a well-made film that you were so happy and so dead. My only problem was in some scene that seemed like someone who had a camera at home filming it and it was weird. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion, and in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Great movie.
