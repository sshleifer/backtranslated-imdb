<br /> <br /> Lily Mars is a movie genre that unfortunately seems to have disappeared from the studio system. Now that you know my prejudice, here are some reasons why this movie is different. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the main piece - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin), the Hollywood story is the real stock of this period, writers exchange her subject a little more than usually. Although Lily gets her big break when the star finishes, she is not successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to play a small role in the game. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) <br /> <br /> 3. The supporting part includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truly wonderful, as is Fay Bainter (director's mother John Thornway (Van Heflin)). Separate supportive performance goes to Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, a one-time actor who turned to theater custodian. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth checking out. One of those films designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
