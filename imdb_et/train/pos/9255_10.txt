If you want fun humor with fine humor, you will enjoy this flick. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why anyone wouldn't like it. Take it for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to get your head confused and laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and owns it - Better than any Baywatch episode - and shows dexterity subtle humor. It is too bad that he has not had much opportunity to expand it. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger fits perfectly with his "true navy" role and William McNamara is working hard as a hustler. <br /> <br /> Take Hopper's foot in the invasion of "this cherry cherry" and you have a movie that keeps my attention and kept me laughing. I bought it as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain candy.
