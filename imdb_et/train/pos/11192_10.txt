I've transplanted this movie many times in college, and every time I show it, the number of people watching me exponentially increases ... besides the virgins, someone I've already shown that she needs to see it again! It takes a while, but in the end the whole room is screaming, shouting, screaming, repeating the scenes, repeating the dialogue, and just being totally and completely invaded by the film experience, which is Pia Zadora in "The Lonely Lady"! badly written, terribly acting TRASH scene is thrown to you for all sorts of attacks that are the same as the hardest thing I have (little statement, friends). For me, nothing compares to 2 U, Pia ... and I don't think I I am the only one who has ever felt that way!
