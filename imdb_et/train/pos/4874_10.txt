Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. The coral comedy that was full of landmarks, furious rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed at what the party! Music is everywhere and also shooting, animals, crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, all colorfully visual only for entertainment. Clean cinema in essence. Great experience. And one is especially grateful because good comedies are so rare and so wonderful. Well, this is one, and if you liked Kusturica's previous movies, you love it, though like any comedy, it's a chemical reaction and you have to be in that mood.
