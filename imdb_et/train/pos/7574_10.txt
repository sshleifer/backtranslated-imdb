This is one of the best series in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape). The player has a very good story where you play as Claire Redfield looking for her brother Chris Redfield (Who you probably know from the original Resident Evil) It's as scary as another Resident Evil and contains much more cuts. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** out ***** letters (Rating based on a comparison of other video games)
