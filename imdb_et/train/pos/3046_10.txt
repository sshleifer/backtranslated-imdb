All good movies "inspire" some directly to the video player. I was afraid the "Gladiator" wasn't really such a good movie because I didn't see any movies that had something similar to the new shelves of exhibitions in Rome for months. Then I noticed the last offer of Full Moon, Demonicus. I'm a Full Moon Puppetmaster series and Blood Dolls fan, but never seen any of their non-killer dolls. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus crowns what happens to campers in the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds the cave with old gladiator items and feels forced to remove the helmet from the body and try it. He becomes overwhelming and, as a demonic gladiator, as Tyrannus, he is forced to kill his friends to revive the dead body of true Tyrannus. budget. Sometimes there was editing and direction so amateur that I swear I was looking at the Blair witch project. Attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of the Monty Python sketch. Weapons, though apparently real, really look like plastic-y. It literally looks like a movie group with friends on a weekend with a digital video camera. There's nothing wrong with this movie, just don't rent this technical masterpiece while waiting. It seems that attempts have been made to investigate the script, because even though Tyrannus does not really work like a gladiator, he speaks at least of Latin. <br /> <br /> Really enjoyed this movie. Maybe not as much as a killer doll, but Full Moon still gives! The only thing I was disappointed about was not at the end of Full Moon Videozone!
