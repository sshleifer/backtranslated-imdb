John Waters (Happy Birthday, John!) You did something far from the deliberately harsh things he usually did when he made a parody of this celebrity / art world. Edward Furlong plays the character of the title, a Baltimore working class teenager who loves taking pictures. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work, he offers him a great break he accepts. But if he finds it big, he has to review everything. <br /> <br /> Pecker basically looks at how he loses his friends and normal lives when he gets famous. The thing we could expect, but with Waters, is always some of the things that shock us (you know them when you see them). I definitely recommend it. Also starring Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
