Although I liked a better city, I really liked it. I'm a new comer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I had heard of them, I had never seen anything with them. The first thing I saw was Singin in the Rain, which made me a fan of Gene. I think it's better. But I thought this movie was good and like all the movies, there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book this is a fantastic movie and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I haven't seen them yet. Take me to Ballgame. But I'm stuck with my weapons, saying I really enjoyed it and I love it!
