This is a very fun movie that follows the trial process of NY's Macbeth production. Although in our modern world there is much to say about power, jealousy and ambition (MacBet themes), the film works best if it doesn't take itself too seriously. Recognized actors, such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury, play a nice role in the key roles, but highlighting for me was a fun scene where Banquo (John Elsen) "murdered". Probably an entertaining movie for theater participants, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
