This film could have been a silent movie; this is definitely one feeling. I was extremely happy to see this very rare version of the movie. Extase is a symphony of love and transcends all language versions. French, the ultimate romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. Young Hedy Lamarr lights up on the screen, in a movie that is somehow almost like sexual fantasy; but definitely far from pornography. The technical characteristics may be low in crude oil; but it does not diminish the magic spell that this film expresses. Many early cinema lovers love this movie for sure.
