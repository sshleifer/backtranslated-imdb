As the B films go, it was above average (I warn the reader now that I can reveal some basic elements of the plot or other parts of the film, although I try to minimize such a tendency). When queues usually go, it was absolutely fantastic (despite the "cookie cutter" approach to try to copy certain elements from the original text. Despite this sometimes tedious tendency, it seemed that this particular film worked when the viewer could separate his attention from the comparison with the original scanners). <br /> <br /> The film was similar to the "Superman" series, with a description of the main character in his early childhood and in relations with his parents (who seemed modeled on the same basis as Kents "Superman" stories) and the morally pure hero of the extraordinary powers at an early age, etc. Suitable children, adolescents and / or adults were a topic that reminded me of movies such as "Real Genius" and (superficially) "Doctor Mordrid" and hit a particularly strong chord. <br /> <br /> The film had a positive message and was fun to watch. I found some insights and precision (in terms of depicting certain aspects of paranormal experiences) interesting and even deeply touching. These moments appeared from time to time in all of the great formula-based schemes and free sex (uality, when the sexual elements were tastefully made) and the violence that makes B-movies (or Shakespearian's performances on this issue!) So much fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It must be for all comic books, Sci-fi, "remote viewing" enthusiasts and horror fans! With the right exposure in the right circle, the film with the original scanner can be fairly cultured.
