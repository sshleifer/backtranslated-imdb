WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergey Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (vote: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> 21 Capturing and Lacking "STRANGELOVE" Century <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? who wrote the script Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser? stars as a glaring hit man named Brand Hauser, who is burnt, but decides to follow one final task by fusing the Middle East oil minister Omar Sharif (yes, not Omar Sharif, but you can laugh at that toning that he drew) Former US Vice President (Aykroyd, Cusack's old "Grosse Pointe Blank", who makes Dick Cheney manqu√© here) involving Brand to act in the shadow of trade Show a producer in the mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) to a private company in Tamerlane (read: ). <br /> <br /> When Brian's journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) appears, Brandi is confronted with the current state of clarity and finally falls in love with her. At the same time, Tamerlane supports the unlikely association of Eastern European teenagers with Yonica Babyyeah (surprisingly decent Duff, who celebrates his fame through the cheek) and the son of the country's leader idiot. <br /> <br /> The following is a bold test of the 21st century black comedy "DR. STRANGELOVE", but unfortunately all the intense and ambitious goals have more shortcomings than the hit of this broad experiment in the middle of a political message (unfair war after ordering American capitalism, check !) <br /> <br /> When Cusack riffles his Martin Blank from the above-mentioned "Pointe", he adds black black women (he makes Tabasco sauce to take the edge), the rest plays (except the sister) Joan, who is a rebellion as a high-tech tool by Hauser and has one of the most funny jokes in the film: "My Mass Communication Skills Finally Cost You". <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the Iraq War this year at 180 degrees in a different "Grace Is Gone" and here while admiring the pace and rhythms of the film, it is mostly for the first time filmmaker Joshua Seftel that the director's debut here (and this is noticeable) is out of the question perhaps a well-choreographed struggle Hauser participates in the Babyyeah idiotic groom. /> <br /> Still a misguided failure of a nice experiment; maybe the next time Cusack doesn't try so hard and let the war idiot talk for himself, rather than making a heavy lift.
