This difficult, often violent western leadership of the Peckinpah / Leone tradition has been surprisingly led by Andrew V. McLaglen, whose former Westerners (especially those who played John Wayne) were mostly in the John Ford mode. It is both surprisingly traditional (good guys / bad guys) and incredible timeliness. <br /> <br /> Heston is a former captain of the Arizona Territorial Police who has retired a year ago. Remedies turned into a reform-based sheriff (Michael Parks) and found ways to take over cars, telegraphs, telephones and railways in the early years of the 20th century. But soon he will face the threat of his past - the Coburn, that he put off the train for more than ten years, killing four guards. Coburn's wife was killed in the next shootout. and so Coburn is through the most nasty revenge. This includes the kidnapping of Heston's daughter (Hershey) and finally her rape. The result is tense and violent behavior between the mountains and deserts of southern Arizona. Heston and Coburn and the rape involving Hershey and the two Coburn gangs (Quade, Paull) are probably as questionable as the similar scenes from STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE. But this does not diminish too much the psychological approach of the film to the Western genre. McLaglen is able to deal with the bloody story with great effort, and acting as an aging lawyer at Heston was probably the best he ever had in his 1970s films. Coburn makes it particularly difficult with cold blood, and both Parks and Chris Mitchum (like Hershey's planned spouse) are also making good turns. The music here comes from Jerry Goldsmith's results for 100 RIFLES and the 1966 STAGECOACH remake, but it still works. <br /> <br /> Intelligently filmed completely in the south-east of Arizona and using the old Tucson kit THE LAST HARD MEN, Fox will soon have to release VHS and / or DVD. It's west, which deserves something less.
