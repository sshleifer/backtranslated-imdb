I saw this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year and it was just overwhelmed. It's a rich, warm novel to bring to the screen, worked beautifully and well targeted. More than anything, he reminded me of David Leani's films, both his ability to handle a complex story and his ability to create powerful scenes that affect you at many different levels. The best movie I've seen for years.
