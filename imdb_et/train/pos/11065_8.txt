This comedy, which has a lot of pain and sadness, succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films in this genre where there are more prominent actors trying to get to the hard mix that is not close to its depth and penetration. This is certainly because the extraordinary casting of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy with great performances seems so spontaneous that the reality of these characters quickly grabs your interests and emotions and keeps them on the film. At first, it seems to be a wall and a harebire, but it is gradually learned that these two rather pathetic injured people are trying desperately and unintentionally to heal themselves, even if they are terrible. Rogers' consciences and anxious visions are so beautiful that someone knows them when they are watching them. You care about these two pleasant but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it is suspicious and everyone is hanging with a weak emotional yarn. Hopefully, viewers will see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, as this film proves their merit as very successful participants beyond doubt.
