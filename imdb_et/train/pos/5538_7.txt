A couple (Janet and Richard) go to the forest near a giant sex. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes the couple they think is an abandoned farmhouse. Soon a couple of escaped convicts will appear, and after an inevitable delay, they will bring Janet to rape and lock Richard into the nest. one of the ever underestimated horror movies. It is one of the sick and twisted in the early 70s. What's more, I found it quite enchanting and beautiful in this perverted tone. I love CAGED TERROR. Music will definitely help the film's personality and beauty. I found that the movie is pretty scary. <br /> <br /> The defects are mainly related to the film, which means that the film is rather slow and inclined. Although I didn't know that it was the beauty and difference of the movie, I think it is the most people. Action is neither too good nor a dialogue, at least in the early scene. This film takes a little more patience than usual, and it's not really for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a good movie. Not the biggest horror movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely fun. It's not the easiest to find. You can find this in the USED section of many stores when you look hard enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a trash fan, it's definitely worth it.
