I was lucky enough to see this movie several years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of movies since, but I've never forgotten it. Although Sinatra played a not very pleasant character, she was great in this role. Many people seem to think that he did not really reach his own role "From here to eternity", but I think he was Conchos great. Another role in my role is the role of William Conrad. I don't see or hear her before that movie. Conrad plays a big part in this movie. I remember her deep and gravel voice and she uses it beautifully to refine a few words she threatens, which sets her character tone. I also remember the music that both introduces Conrad and seems to surround her whenever she appears. The great movie and my only disappointment was that I never have the chance to see it again. It seems to have disappeared from the earth. I see in the headlines that it says the film is black and white, but when I saw it in full color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
