I've been waiting for this movie to be seen for a long time and finally I could see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Perhaps because I expected this movie too much and that is why I was a little disappointed. I wasn't the best movie in Korea, but it's really worth it. <br /> <br /> The theme was nice and the movie will make you look bored even though it's long. But there are gaps in the movie and jump from one point to another. But Jeon Do-Yeon's behavior is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in early cinema history and I think this film would not be as nice as it would be if it was a leading role.
