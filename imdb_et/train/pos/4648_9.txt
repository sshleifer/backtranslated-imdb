A fun, memorable, confusing, brilliant film. Reminds me of Bunueli L'Age D'Or or Jodorowski Holy Mountain - many wonderful signs that suck and seek ..... what is it? I laughed almost all the way while keeping the peripheral eye around an astonished and occasionally terrible audience. Entertain and pass through, from start to courage and poisoned to the end when it was the end. I just want to remember every detail. It sometimes haunts me. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I only have the most positive memories of this movie. Since it doesn't seem to be available at home and look, I think I'll have to wait a few more years for Crispin Glover to have his Big Slide Show (and "What? ... I saw this movie in Atlanta almost immediately after when he was involved in a rather devastating car accident, so I was a little disappointed at that time, which was perhaps a very good state of mind to look at prophetic talking arthropods and slowdowns ... superhero costumes and adorable glover in their appropriate silver-Q, small blemishes get out of the floor like a wonderful DADAist wet dream. <br /> <br /> Is this a statement of life as we know it? Of course, everyone presumes that art is just that. I think the truth is more obvious in absenteeism and negativity What you don't tell us is what we have to conclude, but it's much better than the lies that other people eat for us every day. More than 5,000 movies like "Titanic" rather than "WHAT IS IT?" or "Sleep less in Seattle "(shudder, gag, groan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr Glover (plus a fun guy to watch on the screen or in his big slideshow) - smart, funny, peculiar and extremely hot. Make more movies, write more books, keep a nightmare alive.
