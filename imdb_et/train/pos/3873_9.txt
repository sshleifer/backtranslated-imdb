This movie is light, funny and beautifully filmed. The flash is absolutely excellent and the colors convincingly remind Vermeer's land. <br /> <br /> It is a sentimental comedy in its best way, like the US and French standards, and supposedly better than English. <br /> <br /> Each character touches and the interpretation is perfect. Isabelle Blais is great, Sylvie Moreau is better than Catherine's series, Stéphane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in her strange role and Geneviève Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> Continue the lesson before finding a negative comment about this movie, so give it a chance and add your own review.
