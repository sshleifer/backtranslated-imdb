For me, the question of life and death is just that - just the best film ever made. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, it moves in class. It is a stimulating, thought-provoking, post-war mirror of the world and relations between peoples. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is just stunning and the effect of monochrome and Technicolor blending on different worlds is seamlessly accepted. Characters and plot development are almost perfect, and attention to detail is greatly enhanced by credible fantasy. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch a movie - and I've been watching it a lot - it never touches me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It is just as fresh today as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I were allowed to keep and watch only one movie, it would be a matter of life and death.
