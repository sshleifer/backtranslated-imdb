The problem of depicting real life is that the performance can be good, but it does not work if the audience does not believe that the actor is a person. This is the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln": Henry Fonda gives a great result, but I had a hard time believing that Abraham Lincoln was as soft as Fonda depicted him. <br /> <br /> This is essentially the forefront of Abraham Licoln, a young courtroom drama. Was it a real story or not, I do not know, but if it is not, why say it uses Lincoln as a central character? But don't forget. In the film, Lincoln protects two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't really have much, and as a result, it looks pretty empty. I wanted more story and character development. The length of the movie is 100 minutes, but it doesn't recognize it. There are some small scenes that characterize Lincoln and the flourishing relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> The actor is good around, but as I said, Fonda works as a performance but not Abraham Lincoln. I just don't think the real Lincoln was such a soft call. True, he has a great voice when he needs it, for example, if he persuades a drunken lynch mob to admit an accused trial, but the Fonda depicts Lincoln too much. Other performances are certain, especially Alice Brady as the accused mother Abigail Clay. She's a nice lady we really know. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; we see why Lincoln wanted to help him. But even then there is not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> It's a nice watch, but not classic.
