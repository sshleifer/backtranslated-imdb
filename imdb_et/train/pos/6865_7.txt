With the current trend of humor, this film is the grandfather of all of them. Although some humor is dated, every skit is shocked, repelled or makes you laugh out loud. The most memorable is the commentary on sex games and, of course, VD advertising. It doesn't always work, but it pays off when it is. I'll give it 7.
