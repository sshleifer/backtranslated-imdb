I've seen all of Robert Redford's staged films and recognized his love for the American people and the earth. Through this river, Redford Montana travels to the lyrical romance and visual glory of the high rocks, as if it were a painter from the 19th century Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film loves visual and word text by Norman Maclean and the admirable camera work of Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Rev. MacLean, a man whose educational methods include both fishing and the Bible, Brenda Blythen, mother and her sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt, create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems. teenage sons grow up and later complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are completely believable as brothers, whose love for catching and interconnecting them forever. The relationship between men, father and sons, brothers and their women with the outside world is that the river passes through the vein of narration through the river, which is missing from so many Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes these relationships special is what Redford gives to the language in dialogue. This is a literary script that is beautiful to hear and unforgettable when it comes with the magnificent Montana rivers and mountains. The words and settings are equal to the production that rises to their material. While the idea of ​​flying from fishing may seem like a strange device in the middle of the story, it's not that unlikely in the Redford Leadership Group. Considering the material, the Redford ode is worth the time and life again and again.
