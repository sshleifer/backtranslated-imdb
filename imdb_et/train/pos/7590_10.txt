I don't care if you want my comment or not, but I think you who write that the movie is not good .. you're so obsessed with Hollywood movies that you can't see how good it is to film I'm not Jay Chou fan but i like his game and not only his ... and maybe you think the idea doesn't make much sense and maybe you think it's not that interesting, but deeply there is more than action in movies more than love and passion and tears are more in the world than the US and it's good :) really good. And it costs a lot, so please do not criticize the participants to whom the directors you do not know how difficult they are to work for you so that you can be happy for the fifteenth time to thank them :)
