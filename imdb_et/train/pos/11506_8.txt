"Kolchak" was a TV series that really didn't fit into any category. Partly horror, part of comedy, some social awareness and what we have is something I think people were not prepared for. In fact, it is a shame because I started to look at these examples in the Chiller network (I never saw the originals), realized how different and interesting it really was. Starring Darren Mcgavin as a Kolchak International News Reporter and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the exhibition followed a Chicago news reporter who mostly became a part of the story when he was looking for the horrors of a windy city that would fall at night. Macgavin's charm really proves the exhibition. A somewhat silly boy who always wear the same suit can't help him but love him. His jokes are great, and his and skeptical editor, Oakland, is a lot of fun back and forth. <br /> <br /> Stories are usually pretty good and the actor is very good. The 70s were not a big * period for special effects, and this exhibition suffers from it, but if you stop belief, that is a fun series that was before that time.
