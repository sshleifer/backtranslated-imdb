The film belongs to Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a few actionable stories with many standard elements. Well-filmed, well-edited, well-performing secondary roles. That's it and more. I agree with those who say, "The film marks the excitement of youthful inspiration." <br /> <br /> Kile is a pleasant reminder that achievement can come from ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
