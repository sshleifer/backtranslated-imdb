Finally, I saw this movie today after renting a Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that this is wildly original. Yes, maybe the characters were not fully realized, but this is not one of those films. Rather, we are treated with the eye of the director, his vision of what the story is about. And it doesn't stop there. And frankly, I didn't want that. I believe that Sabu had to be influenced by "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" and "Run, Lola, Run" directors. But I absolutely loved how three members see a beautiful woman on the street to distract them instantly. I really need to see this director's second job because this movie really interested me. If you want to get to know culture, sturm und drang, go elsewhere. If you want to laugh, camera movement and criminal fun, look here.
