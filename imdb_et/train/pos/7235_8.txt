"The girl is stupid" is a kind of half comedy, a half-cubic look for a movie company in the mid-1910s. We get a glimpse into life in an early film studio where we experience a set, run through the scene, handle the work of adorable film fanatics, even lunch in the community. We also have little known kinematic facts - for example, did you know that the "film" participants often do not know the plot of the image in which they work? "<br /> <br /> This movie is essentially a movie star Kenneth Driscoll, who discovers and romanticises the young man she has appeared when she discovers she's painting in the country. I believe the 30-minute version I watched was shortened, accompanied by Cecil B. De Mille's "The Cheat." It is a very reliable film - easy to watch with a great selection of extras. It includes some of the best illustrated titles I've ever added to a quiet movie.
