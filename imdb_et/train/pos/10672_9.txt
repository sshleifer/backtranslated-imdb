Anyone who has seen this film and reviewed it badly will refer to this review by Roger Ebert. He is one of the industry's most respected critics and gave him 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. It may not be perfect or spectacular, but I enjoyed it. Chorus Line is not so much a story because it's a group of stories about Broadway's hopes of life. I read comments where people said that it took too much time for Zachi and Cassie. This is the wrong view. This is another story with all the other stories about Broadway's hope. What people do not understand is that the dancers of Broadway exhibitions go through the same things that a normal person goes through. And this is, in my opinion, the whole point of the exhibition. It is not only about presenting the talents of these special dancers, but about giving us some things to think about life in general. This is a life study as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star looks at this movie with a great sense of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> It's a great musical. It has slow points, and sometimes it blends at some pace, but I enjoyed it in general. Take a closer look at the movie and maybe you will understand what I'm talking about.
