I think I always felt that Hotel du Nord was connected to the studio, the movement of people's cars and the camera was just too smooth and smooth to be filmed on the spot. But there is no problem - Marcel Carne is still much underrated. The plot sometimes looks a bit dirty, as if they were as they passed, but because it is unpredictable, it pays attention to the bitter end. Money shots, when two lovers are alone in their room, are exhausted with somewhat extraordinary dialogue, but it is all so cute that any failure is acceptable. Do these two young people symbolize the hopelessness of cancer in pre-war France or just idiots? Suicide attacks are quite common; if suicide is young and healthy with their lives, before they see themselves smoothly, would you think something other than that they were just fools? <br /> <br /> Arletty played part of the prostitute - she kept her zip on her dress anyway! I've only seen a couple of movies with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention in the pimp on HDN - my problem is low: every time I see his face, I mean Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> A remarkably atmospheric, well-functioning and captured film with so many events that it needs a few views to make it all happen. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful pair; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier on his 2nd film was a small fun part as a gay man. In conclusion: wonderful.
