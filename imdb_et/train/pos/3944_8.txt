This little movie had long been on my "keeper" list. Do people realize that the medical practitioner at the turn of the century was actually treated for both stressed, menopausal, emotionally abused women and mentally retarded women !! At that time, all divine sacred Christian attitudes were deadly to explore the true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace the suffering souls, not to mention what the acceptance of our humanity means. Can you really imagine (according to today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were forbidden because she recognized women as emotions and emotional responses as great as men? Think about it! The sensitivity of this film remains with me, and I give the director the recognition of catching it through the eyes.
