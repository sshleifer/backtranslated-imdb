What happens if someone has so much social anxiety that they no longer work? How can one man alone? As a daily mess, what do we have to do to be a part of society, too much, what happens? Frownland examines these issues. Definitely Bronstein's original debut. The tone is strange and claustrophobic because we reach the man's name, Keith, which is so confusing that he hardly forms the right sentence. We follow her when she tries to contact people and work every day. Most of us are known to such people - people who say "excuse" too much or "I appreciate it" if there is nothing to evaluate. So we know there are such people, but why should someone make a movie about them? Well, because his interesting and Bronstein and leader actor Dore Mann are doing an excellent job. This film is about the same commercial as the movie. Some friends filmed it for a few years when they saved money. It was shot at 16mm and the scratched film appearance is a beautifully low budget. Without distributors, it can be hard to find, I think it has been a random screening of last year. Hopefully this will be on the DVD at some point. I saw it at a quiet movie theater in LA. There were 10 people among the audience, including Crispin Glover, when it tells you how strange this film is. Highly recommended.
