If you still remember that in the summer when you had the first kiss, the first boyfriend or the first puppy to love, this movie is for you! OK, so this movie can never win an Oscar, but I dominated it ... ... there are some things in the movie that can just go on your head if you are not part of culture ... kids have brought grandma who is both a mother and a father, the youngest son is cast and bathed in the Bustelo tin (sooo Dominican!), Judy is harassed by the neighbors' men, going to church and illuminating the prayer candle ... the shine of the film was in these small details. True, it was not to draw all the works of cinematographic extravagant, but it was not meant to be NOR, it was meant to be a learning tool for those who want to learn Latin culture (hint: make new friends). More in the movie, sweet, faux-cumentery, this movie kept it real without taking it too seriously. Like the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien", it was just a boy's birthday story. I recommend it (especialmente si eres Dominicano!) = O)
