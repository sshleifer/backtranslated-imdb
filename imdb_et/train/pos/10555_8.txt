The premise of this film has been calling my imagination for some time. We've all heard about it or read it in some text. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What would you do if the whole world suddenly lost sight of the eyes? In fact, the last part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew, with two space mates living in a house in the middle of the road system. Andrew is at least a nervous wreck and Dave is considered one of the greatest losers in society. This alone is the main reason why these two guys are doing so well, because they just have one another to turn to when they need solace. Just up to ... <br /> <br /> There have been many and many problems since the beginning of the movie. Both are involved in crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and just dare not go out of the house. Dave has failed at his workplace and his colleagues do not treat him well and with the respect he deserves. The number of these problems is growing until the day they inevitably face and deal with it. It is too much for them and they want everyone to go away ... And of course it happens. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew in a world where nothing is. . First of all, they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the environmental problems of this madness, but later they find they can do whatever they want, because they seem to be the only ones who are still there. > <br /> Nothing contains incredibly small light - in fact only Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) are in the film after the first couple of films. Clearly, in order to pull it out, the cast task must be more than a task, because in a world where nothing exists, there is nothing that could disturb the viewer in any way. Vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable number of close-ups to make it more interesting and it really works quite well. The photographer's director Derek Rogers also has a nice way of tempting the audience, leaving the visual information busy, especially when the character sees something and reacts to it, but we don't see it right away. <br /> <br Obviously, it can't be an event-specific movie and it's not. Much of the activity takes place outside your house as they move in emptiness. And there are some of the most fun scenes there, especially when Andrew discovers a candy bar. <br /> <br /> Now you might think, "How's nothing out?" Well, it really looks like something. The whole world is not white ... white, no matter where you look. This is the weakness of this movie ... After an hour or less it is quite boring to look at and there must be events to make sure it is more interesting to watch. Thanks to God, there are some. For example, at times when two boys can't really jump on something because of their qualities, as if something was done ... tofu (as Andrew claims). It's fun to see how they can instantly use something to their little society's gods. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the movie is the set ... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this movie, the house where these two men live is so unnaturally fun to watch, but it seems right that the two live in such a place. All in all, product design is undoubtedly one of the most powerful aspects of this movie that really makes watching a movie ... <br /> <br /> But the best part of a movie is acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller look like professional actors, both of whom are. The camera is on the other side of every movie and, as mentioned earlier, there are almost no props in the movie, they are really in the bare stages. A lot of character development and some decent one-off liners, smart dialogue (sometimes fun to fool), it all works for it - and it really changes the film from a low budget region to a well-crafted craft. > <br /> We talk a little about visual effects because they are definitely worth it. Nothing includes a digital visual effect and a prosthesis equivalent to any modern horror movie. The movie has a rather scary dream, and although The Drews has milked this scene, it's still fun to watch. One of the best visual effects in the film is at the end, where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their abilities in this environment - they have the ability to want everything, so what if they can do it the other way and things appear? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and well-lit film, it really helps to understand that they are probably dead (it is actually one of their theories), but "Nothing" is a comedy and it slowly destroys its theory. We don't know where they are or what happened to them. We don't know if they will ever come out because the movie ends before we see something like that. By the way, the end is not as good as it could have been. It is quite easy to predict what will happen, but writers have thought of some incidents that make it a little more interesting and eventually quite satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Take "Hollow" Man, "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Epoch" and many other movies and you have "Nothing." It's really amalgam of different styles, no other movie yet (at least what I know) People who remember the original comment on their DVD disc remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he found the story of Cube, talking about him and Andr√© Bijelic, being in the same room and both in this extremely dim room without having come out of hope, "Nothing" could be a very good version of a cubic version, and that's almost the same as one of the Cube preforms. <br /> <br /> What can I say? liked "Nothing", this is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are very well made with tons of smart ideas, I still feel that the film has nothing and I have problems knowing exactly what it is ... Maybe when we have " something 2 ", I can answer this question id not as good as i expected it. <br /> <br /> Final rating: 7.5 / 10
