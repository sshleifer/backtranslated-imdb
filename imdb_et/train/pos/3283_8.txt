As a surreal lover (in art and film), I was delighted to discover this film at IFC. This is definitely a keeper. Most other comments tell the general plot (not all the right ones), so I'm not worried about getting anyone involved. The main thing is the alternative world concept brought by Ana's upcoming illness, and the way he can associate someone else after he is both "alone" and finally with his family, which I believe is at least a little restless. It can only be called a horror film because it has scary scenes, but it is a fantasy (little hint of "age arriving" just because Ana is a pre-teen who hates boys). I strongly recommend it to those who value their imagination.
