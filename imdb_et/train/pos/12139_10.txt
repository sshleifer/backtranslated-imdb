This movie, although it is over 70 years old, is still a very moving, strong film. Bette Davis, like a slutty, cruel Cockney Writer, Mildred, is completely plausible. Tracking his actions is still enchanting. He makes the viewer absolutely bad for him and regret him at the same time. Leslie Howard's result as a weak, obsessed Phillip Carey is not so strong, but I don't see how any actor could resist her Davis performance. He looks at the landscape in every scene where he is, showing it completely. This is a film that sealed her start and she won the Academy Award but lost. It was shocking that day of unwanted pregnancy, multi-sex partners, and Mildred's witch language, so it's a somewhat dated, but still a great movie. Just to see a scene where Mildred tells Phillip what he really thinks about him ("Sa cad, you dirty pig ....") is still one of the biggest shows I've seen on the film.
