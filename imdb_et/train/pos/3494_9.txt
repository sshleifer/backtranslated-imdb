What it is, "Victor Raising" is about as perfect as the movie gets. No matter how brilliant from young authors or just one of those lucky mixes where everything was clicked (probably every one of them), this simple little urban first love of the city slides with its young characters at a depth that you can almost read in their minds. The film begins with a "street" strong taste, but works in the Latino family affair and then focuses on a story that talks about young people's insecurity and a deeply natural desire to love you. In my experience, this has not been done so little (daughters, beginners, etc.). Critics praise, but not for everyone, it is recommended that "raising Victor Vargas" is intended for indie lovers and realists with rich human stories. (A)
