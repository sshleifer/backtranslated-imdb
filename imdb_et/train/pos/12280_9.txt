This is one of the few films I've seen in the theater twice. I love this movie about my atmosphere and the life of this tragic hero, Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but gets the chance to redeem. Isn't that a comforting idea? <br /> <br /> When I first looked at it, I thought the film would have ended after I won the election - I didn't know the book. So the boy was wrong when the dramatic climax was still coming! I was literally consecrated because of the power of the last half hour of the film. Many people don't know this movie completely. I don't understand that this is one bit. Maybe those who read the book are - as is often the case with the adaptations of the novel screen - just disappointed that so many things have remained unnoticed, invisible, inexplicable. But as a movie that talks about the story - family story, human rise and fall, woman's deep compassion, strength of love and hatred (and conservatism) - this film is just great! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is excellent - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So definitely one of the movies that cinema invented!
