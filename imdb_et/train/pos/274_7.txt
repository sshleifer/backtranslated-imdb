I watch the most movies that Nick Mancuso has, because frankly, I love this man, although he is usually cast at his age (a long-time fan should note that he is blonde for some reason). This is a relatively familiar film about the plot (but most of the movies these days aren't quite original), but Rick Roberts is an attractive husband, Martha MacIsaac is the same daughter and daughter, and Mitzi Kapture does a good job when it was his goal, be angry and sometimes quite difficult. Nick has still got that he can show both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot takes place outside the screen - such as motivation, past behaviors, good times and bad times - and things that are obvious to the characters do not give the public at all (i mean). The final scene leaves everything you want in the "category", but at all, I can't say I care a lot about any label. That was what it was - a reasonably fun way to spend the afternoon - and I still like Nick.
