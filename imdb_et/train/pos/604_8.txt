According to the birthday of this century, Saura brought together an unprecedented wealth from the Spanish performing arts community to create the most important love song for her homeland. The twelve "impression" packages are presented without a narrative in a tough environment, allowing each performance to explode before the Saura camera. The creative use of large flats and mirrors in the complete set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection, adds a famous dramatic effect to the diverse range of songs, dances and instrumental performances. Albeniz's photos appear again throughout the program, combining the passion for music with this great creator. Saura encompasses all Spaniards on their stage from the beautiful elegance of old flamenco dancers to children in traditional costumes who are dancing with their teachers.
