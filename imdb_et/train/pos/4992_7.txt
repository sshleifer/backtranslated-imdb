I find it difficult to take Loretta Young, too worried about her appearance and too wrong. But in this lyrical romance of Frank Borzage, and while playing patsy with a low self-esteem, he puts Spencer Tracy too much at ease, and is direct and honest and irresistible. This is a strange little movie that was mostly played in the courtyard of one room in Hooverville, unusually in front of depression, but romantic and ideal. Tracy, who plays a gentle, hard-to-take "normal man" who is a terrific chauvinist and bully of today's standards, softens the hard edge of his character and makes him almost tempting. Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as she should have) have good support and Jo Swerling's scenario is modest and effective. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always loved true love and youth in lyrical neighborhoods. You want to hit her and tell her character wisely, she's too good for this boy, but she's so harsh and convincing when you look at your story satisfactorily.
