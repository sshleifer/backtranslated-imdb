"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before I married, just last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I was looking for after being married because we promised to give a copy to my priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes reality is not that fiction. For all those who wrote that "Don Camillo" is not in real life, I would recommend them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> I would recommend everyone to see this movie before and after I do! Day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
