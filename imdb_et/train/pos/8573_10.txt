From "101 Dalmatians of 1996", Cruella De Vilit, the London Metropolitan Police (God Bless), was arrested to try to steal and kill 101 puppies - Dalmatians. All covered with mud and hay, he spent the next 4 years "tin can". Now, four years later, he was unfortunately released from prison. I say it's about 28 years - dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 2000 Disney decided to release the classical film's successful live version and is therefore called "102 Dalmatians". There's a 102-year-old Dalmatian added to the family (I think Oddball is that name, I should know it because it was recently shown on television recently) and the puppy had no places !!!!! Also, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) has escaped again, she wanted a bigger, better coat - it was again from puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> This song especially enjoyed the song. I'm sure everyone loves the "Atomic Dog" song in the 70s or so. And now, we hear a little about this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is such a big movie that I still mean - when there are "103 DALMATIANS? ??" LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
