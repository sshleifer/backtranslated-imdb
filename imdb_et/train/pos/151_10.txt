The film is intended to influence the audience, and this film was unspeakable to me. A highly photographed and well-functioning dialogue approaching poetry involves film lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and fraud. It tells an intense web that did not leave my eyes on the screen until the closing credit. The story is sweeping. This leads the public to the human attack left behind by the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzon are two young actors who command the screen. Supporting players are perfectly cast and authentic. Sets, lighting, scenery and cinematography are wonderful. I love photography.
