I started studying about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that hits you on this issue is a refreshing format that is similar to many other realities that are still very fun. Donald Trump is also an excellent exhibitor and a major judge. The electoral struggle with intelligent people with good looks is also chosen by competitors. But the best show is in New York. Mark Burnett may be in a lot of trouble during his time, but his handling of cinematography is great because he makes NYC a character in itself. Jazz music with some great camera work makes New York impressive. <br /> <br /> The apprentice always makes his third live show all the time (The Amazing Race is No. 1). But like this amazing competition, this exhibition is always the most moderately observable. If you look at it for a while, then the originality of the exhibition will soon wear out (the same thing as TAR) .Star World, the broadcasters of that country, made it up during the show. The first three seasons were shown sequentially, then in 2 years the next two seasons were shown that kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> Finally, you love this example, especially the first 2 seasons. However, if you watch the viewing continuously, it will take away its charm and FAST.
