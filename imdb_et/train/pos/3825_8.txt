A young woman is killed by her husband's home town after an accident. She barely bothered in this small town, but shortly thereafter she will lose her little boy's robbery and all the hopes ... It can lead to all kinds of conventional post-film plots: finding a new partner and finally being happy; or depressed to fight and eventually kill ... He tries to kill himself, but not after serious fighting with God. He trusts God to find that God seems to forgive everyone, even a killer. Well, I should be careful about God, the film does not mean anything against God. The way the film works is quite interesting: not from a woman's point of view or from God's point of view (in this way, much grass will grow, clouds fly, I think). Rather, it is a third-party sight, the film allows us to perceive and explain nothing. <br /> <br /> Film wouldn't be as interesting as there was only a woman there. There's the man who's around the woman and probably falls in love with her, but in her own way. He is a funny man like a clown, which I should say who shamelessly hangs around our heroine. The combination of the two, a tense, always crying and throwing woman, and a man who smiles and talks stupidly, gets a good balance of emotions: something absurdly wrong or too annoying. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
