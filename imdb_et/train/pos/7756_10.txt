I'm not sure if this is some sort of masterpiece or just a sloppy fluff that is enhanced by performances and images. Regardless, I'm sure I loved it. With amazingly twisted, delicate, intertwined stories, delicious blind performances by Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, it's a lively, harsh color that's all captured, it's a high-end trash and it's a lot of fun. Not to mention the amusingly cunning and thinly reflected sexual subtypes that go through the film, always threatening to escape from the picture but never. I would lie if I said that the entertaining value of the film does not contribute to my love, but inadvertently (or?) Behind the comedy is some strange art and I really dug it. I could really get into this melodrama.
