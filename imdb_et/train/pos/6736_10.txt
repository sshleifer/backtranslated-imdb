Riding Giants is a brilliant documentary that dives deep into one of the most underrated sports in the world and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only Stacy Peralta can capture. All from the structure, the players, the amazing film material, even the style in which it was filmed, only strengthened the beauty and power of surfing. Of all the surfing films I've seen (Endless Summer, Billabong Odyssey, and Step Into Liquid), it was the most consistent and relevant. Starting from the early days of surfing (a short history lesson) that lasted all the way to Laird's infamous ride, Horseback Riders go beyond sporting mind, heart and soul as none of these documentaries. How does it do? Giving us the whole story, from beginning to end, without fixing or jerking off the waves of the wave. <br /> <br /> To start this movie, it was structurally sound. In other movies I've seen about surfing, you can sometimes find a new person jumping on to a new person, a wave of a wave, event events, without knowing why or who? Riding Giants, we have very small cast veterans and beginners. This allows you to really go deeper in everyone's mind. Also, instead of just riding a wave, we are given more history and more personal understanding of the world than before. That's what really attracted me to this movie. I had the impression that instead of showing all these big waves (because it is a big wave movie), we listen to stories and see what these surfers had to overcome to get to these waves. I loved information about "beach sums" or surfing father. I'm still on the floor by the amazing stories of Greg Noll and his early adventure into the deep blue. Then, to see him personally, talking about what was happening in his mind, only more fuel was added to the fire. The simple structure that Peralta followed, allowed me to observe and walk more with the knowledge of sports than with any previous film. Peralta shows so much emotion and passion that you can't help but be surprised at what these brave people have done and where the sport goes. <br /> <br /> Add an intense and creative cinematic and perfect film to an immature structure. Using the techniques I last saw "Kid staying in the picture", the riders create huge scenes that almost seem to jump out of the screen. Though it is not 3D, it is a flat dimension that when you place two images on top of each other. In this movie, it worked. It created more depth for the scenes and really did not only bring the value of the shock (the man's waves were great), but also the risk of these guys constantly facing. If it broke differently or they maneuvered wrong, they would kill the waves. Some died, but it didn't stop the sport. It only created more excitement and more passion to do better. This is the love of the ocean and sport that leads me to my last point. <br /> <br /> The human element. So many of my previous adventures in the world of surfing documents left me with beautiful waves, but very few people. The films knew that people were watching waves, so that it would mainly be wave and wave waves and perhaps a short second per person. This movie was the exact opposite. Peralta created this masterpiece, giving us more waves, but devoted so much attention to the surfers and the immortal question why they do it every day. What pulls through those thoughts that push them forward, and the bonds that make up there in the blue yonder. After watching this movie, I felt that I knew not only about surfing the big wave, but also about the emotional aspect of sport. It wasn't developed for other movies and pushed Riding Giants to a completely new personal level. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was great. I've never seen so much passion, dedication, and love packed in a structurally sound film. From the beginning to the end I was impressed. I would be very happy if this film won this year's Oscar for the best documentary film and would see a new rebirth in the surfing world and open more of this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** ** at the end *****
