I think it's a nice movie; I think this is a very novel movie through landscapes and the atmosphere; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is the result, not the goal); I think it is very natural; I think it's humane; I think it was interesting; I think the actors never made me thinking ... waw lame act (they are not Sean Connory & co) or a movie blocker, they are like a movie ... a normal ppl that can work ...; I think the film came to its intention; I think it made me feel (or feel it again :)); I think I'm not objective, <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... that I know.
