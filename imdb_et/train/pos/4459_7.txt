For films like "Anchors Aweigh", there are few who have as many Academy awards as happy hour warming. 1945 was an undeniable year for a good film or they still suffered from Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" that they wrote something, starting with the A-election to get the best picture to satisfy the musical image that is a loyal public. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for her role as "Singin in the Rain" instead of being present, there was something wrong behind the back of the MGM, and of course, this studio and Hollywood's own rush is the best behavior of its studio, which is convenient for those in the world The brilliant talent of the gene and Frank Sinatra is definitely an enjoyable farce, despite the need for more people to preview music, so there would be no need for an up-and-coming audience. could have eliminated all the charming scenes of Kathryn Grayson. Until the "Kiss Me Kate" was seen, it might be necessary for non-opera enthusiasts to watch their films remotely. <br /> <br /> Town, then maybe the happy sailors did not have to leave the shore with Jose Iturbi listening and hit the piano with all the heartfelt Susie's move. are happy to get a screen test in MGM's golden studio. Few are even happier. Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson's successful screen tests are not regrettable, but it makes the constant non-opera enthusiast hope that the pink slip will be given to both. <br /> <br /> But for all, the perfect talent is a good shape and a higher-than-average grade, thrown into a light but fun-filled naval story intertwined with young ambitious naval boys who are good at breaking the morale. Anchors at least do not doubt the choice of the wrong MGM movie. The direction keeps up when the majority carries the story of cute color art. When someone strikes music or a song, the film makes them happy. <br /> <br /> The natural rise of the movie is Gene Kelly's cartoon adventures in fantasyland. It's a well-earned masterpiece, Kelly's career number, and it's nice to know that she thought about it when Fred Astaire started dancing on walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It is not exactly threefold, rainbow, pure chocolate, chocolate plate, cream and sundae shared with cherry and banana, but it is a square solid piece of sugar that melts at the end of the mouth somehow and, despite the guilt, it's still nice feeling. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
