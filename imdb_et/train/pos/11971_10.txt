I think the comments about the show are too exaggerated. When a person watches TV shows, what is he watching? It is a pleasure to look at the exhibition unless it is a critic or a person who analyzes the story. But most of us are not so and look at exhibitions to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal showroom for viewing after a hard day in the office / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a completely hypothetical family. If any such family existed in the real world, it would be a role model. But this is a TV show, not a real family, and there is nothing wrong with portraying a hypothetical family on television. The mere fact that the show may take so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, no matter what the comments were later. <br /> <br /> Another good example of this show is that every person in the age of age not only enjoys watching it, but takes back a message that is a baby. These Jesse talks with Michelle are extremely touching if one doesn't think it is childish. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that after watching the full house of each exhibition, your heart is rarely satisfied with other exhibitions.
