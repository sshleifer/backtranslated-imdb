Just saw this movie in thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and got this flick at South Beach in Washington's Cinema Theater. In 1969 I thought where it is! was a very good movie. Now, for almost forty years, it's not as good as it was. Times have changed and this film is now a tired old hash of the intergenerational war. However, it did a place in time, which is just memory. It is very interesting to see fashion fashion, old Vegas, thin Don Rickles, chain smoking and hip opening song. The actor was decent, the script was somewhat outdated, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is, it may not be for you, but for me it was still a fun and fun travel memory.
