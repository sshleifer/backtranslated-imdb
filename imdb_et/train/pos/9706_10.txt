The gentleman is one of the most funny, strange, darkest and unforgettable comedies of our time. So much, it paved the way for more comedies, many of which have copied style but have never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike all other sketches, gentleman's types are all loosely connected. First they all live in the fictional city of Royston Vasey, at the back of Northern England. <br /> <br /> The first characters who welcome newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad, allegedly the owners of the local store, so far away that most people don't know it. Other strangers include: the Denton family with obsession with hygiene, cleanliness, and toad; Hillary Briss, who sells special but fortunately unknown brand meat; Pauline, a rescue officer with sharp tongue and even sharper pencils; Mr. Chinnery, a friendly vet and threatens all four-legged things; Geoff Tipps, a plastic salesman who has a witch's sense of humor, often involving weapons, electric pipes, and. . . . . . . PLUMS !!!!! Despite the fact that comedy is in the heart, the gentleman's league often crosses the genres, but it never seems to have corrupted or ripen other people's material. There are a number of horrors, such as the loss of a hiker, a pair of quiet twins, an obsessive circus owner, and unexpected nosebleeds. Even more striking are the moments when the series takes more tone and the above characters, such as Pauline and Geoff, are shown in a more sympathetic, vulnerable light. Customizing a movie is its best demonstration, but some fans may decide that they are local. <br /> <br /> Equally underestimated, the third series also takes a different route. a storyline that leads to one conclusion that includes a plastic bag and a runaway theater company. Although many fans may not have the first two in the film or the third series, they are definitely a sign of how ingenious the gentleman is, and how to be afraid to explore new areas. <br /> <br /> In short, the gentlemen's story is definitely worth it because, as the greeting signs say, 'NEVER CONTINUE!
