It's hard to see - as the previous reviewer says. It's amazing, given the terrible movies that came right after World War II - especially the "release" of Dachau. It is clear that in the midst of the war we knew exactly what was going on with the Jews. The "transport" series is lively, almost as it is based on the actual newspaper (the Nazis wanted to register their cruelty). Knox as Nazis are great. He charts the Nazi career. This graph is especially true when it contradicts other German reactions, initially laughing at Hitler, then incredible and ultimately helpless. This contrast, however, allows us to believe the anti-Nazi attitude of a young Nazi officer. This happened when there were several attempts at Hitler, especially at the Staffenberg site that appeared on the film. A strong film that effectively utilizes setbacks, precisely predicting the tracks of Nuremberg and others that would occur after the end of the war.
