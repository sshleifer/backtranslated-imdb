This movie is pretty funny, but I give her that, at least, I tried to do something to characterize my principles. The movie has some great moments and there are some great moments in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The aircraft attack sequence is probably the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think you really like the idea of ​​the lengthy veteran going to his veteran. Of course, this is not all well done, but the assumption is not at all bad. <br /> <br /> Tom
