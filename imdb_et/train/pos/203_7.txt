Those Simon's Sunshine Boys who play Walter Matthau and George Burns are funny comedy about the strange bond of life and its shortness, but laughter is always a bitter taste. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) from two great theater comedies that have now diminished due to the inability of the harsh and incessantly old age can only feel anger and blue. Willy has never given up and continues to work while Al is tired of the players and has left her daughter with her home. In the old days, the couple was really funny and harmonious, but the scene was a constant quarrel and quarrel, and eleven years after they broke, they didn't talk to each other. Now that they work, they have to go back together to make one of his best old sketches for the comedy TV show. Meetings are explosive and free from old issues? Neil Simon's scenario tells the story of solid corrosion, and melancholy and blue, which are overwhelming with many gags and laughter, gave a good combination thanks to the great couple Walter Matthu (best academician) and George Burns (Won Academy Award for Best Support). Both actors are very believable and real, and their harmony seems almost the same as they actually work together throughout this time, and that property doesn't cover them. The film is also very relevant for all its consuming reality, when the story is narrative and how the report, Love-Heat, which binds the two participants, is a completely real part of a strange, but at the same time, normally understandable life. My rate is 7.
