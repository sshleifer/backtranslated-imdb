The super-comedy series of the 1990s (two series in total), which suffered UK ratings due to poor scheduling. If you're against comedies like Minder, even the best new comedies will fight to get the signal. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I got out of a series of episodes and followed it with enthusiasm. I mentioned it to friends and family at that time, but everyone seemed to be watching something else. Very, very depressing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot about it. <br /> <br /> Then I watched it on the internet and found that the ultra-fan was trying to get both series out on its own. <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
