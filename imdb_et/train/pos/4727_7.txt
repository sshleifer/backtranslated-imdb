I was pleasantly surprised that I really liked this movie. Witty Writing (some of the "inside" jokes I got, others I don't - maybe thanks to the actors who talk to each other), great actors (especially John Cassini), great hot, interesting and unique leadership. I rented it to watch Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed that he was in such a short period of time, blinking and losing him!), But found the movie to be a lot of fun. I'll look at it again before I get back to Netflix. I think the actors and the actors who want to do this will enjoy the movie in depth. The ending is somewhat welcome, but I wish they had done something else (and more positive). Too bad that the movie didn't get better except for the "festival" on the market. I offer it to all who love acting faith.
