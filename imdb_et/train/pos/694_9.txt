The insomniac nightmare is the story of a man penetrating into madness. Because of chronic insomnia, Jack carries hallucinations; causes him to try and determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We will find some interesting things about Jack in the end and think that by the end of the movie we will be "happy after Hollywood ends. Wrong. This is where New York is sleeping. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (writer and director) is himself a good film on Insomniac's Nightmare. A talented filmmaker and writer (he made this film right after graduation from high school), he has real potential and will be traceable in the future. <br /> <br /> With this short film I was constantly uncomfortable; Between music, a gloomy landscape and a realistic portrayal of insomniac by Dominic Monaghan (like Jack), I desperately wanted it off sometimes just to escape from it.
