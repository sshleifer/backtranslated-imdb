I read the Schneebaum book (the same title as this movie) when it was first published, and it was deeply expressed by its ability to see through many different ways (the people of its own and those of Amazon, with whom he lived and loved), that the way of living a decent life. His later books were not so powerful, but showed his continued effort. His description of his sexual relations with tribal men was more timid before the beginning of the 1960s, but his honesty and openness in this regard were welcome. This film gives a great strangeness and generosity to a man, but also gives a glimpse of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive concept in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men penetrate into traditional societies. Nonetheless, Schneebaum himself has moved to a sort of higher innocence, suggesting that mankind can be saved from its destructiveness.
