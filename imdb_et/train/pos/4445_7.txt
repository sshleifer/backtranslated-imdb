This early Sirk-melodrama, a black and white photographed, is a small film, but still shows the miracle of a German director to enhance a tired story similar to art. Founded in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck is a woman who has sinned by abandoning her small town spouse and family to attract the Chicago stage. She never met her ambitions and pulled back the city she left in her daughter's letter, telling her she liked the theater (producing high school, that is). In the old town, he returns with a little thought and has to deal with his hostile daughter, the amazed (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and his former lover. The plot is nothing new, but Sirk creates himself extraordinarily, creating meaningful compositions, each frame has been cautiously taken care of and immeasurably assisted by Stanwyck as his leading lady. It's sharp for 76 minutes, and it's just as good as the material doesn't really have to walk.
