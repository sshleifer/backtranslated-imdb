I saw it on the big screen and encapsulated it. Queen Victoria's younger years are a mystery and a perfect description of how a young girl was pushed into one of the world's greatest roles. </p>, history and attention to detail are beyond this world. Emily Blunt is ideal for Victoria. Funny how her mother plays Elizabeth 1 and William IV plays Prince Albert! This contemplation Victoria shows she was a rebellious young woman - I'm sure she would have been on the Jeremey Kyle Show if it had been, "My mom and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." <br /> <br /> Great part of British and Commonwealth history.
