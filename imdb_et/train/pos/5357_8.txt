This comic book movie is funny, has a nice pace and a great futuristic style. Writer Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arn a lot of lines to issue: "Send me a copy," after signing the contract and bringing the pen back to the lawyers; "What pain in your neck," carving a barbed wire after a kidney disease; "He had to share," after slicing his body between the legs; and finally, as Killian slips through his face-bearing stand, Arnie concludes, "Now, what hit the spot." Funny, bears some resemblance to all the reminiscences, another sci-fi flick starring Schwarzenegger.
