Fighting actors find that the best way to break Hollywood is to start the race. But what makes Break a Leg a real pearl is the sardonic look in the struggle (and not so) for the LA actress. It brings us to this world effortlessly with irony and spirit. Monika Mitchell also has a polished look and a very adept direction. Break a Leg is one of the rare independent films that does not damage the value of its production at any level. Writing is a tight, first-rate dialogue. Cassini is an actress actor and the role really shows her talents. The climatic scene between him and Rene Garcia is a classical classic and can be one of the slowest Hollywood scenes. I saw it in an advanced screening and all audiences in the audience laughed uncontrollably and started laughing after that.
