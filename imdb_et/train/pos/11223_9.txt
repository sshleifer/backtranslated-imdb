Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon are proud of the gaming world. The different movements with the wrist had to learn because throwing craps is a skill and in itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. Like cynical, as we are today, I was expecting the "good girl" to cry instead of her friends instead of her grave. Especially with his remarks on "his best friend's funeral" when he first meets Matt. And then, of course, you expect Matt to kill a boy who threw a battery of acid on Mr. Allen's face, blinding him (an interesting role for Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! another end of Hollywood ends, but the writing is so wonderful that the actor made so carefully that you are blissfully aware. <br /> <br /> And music is out of this world. Bring us back to the 50s when our "native passions" were first released from Ray Charles and Bo Diddley's music. Even a little racism, rare in his ugly head in Chicago, but in a club called "Biloxi" with the Confederation flag, supporting racist remarks. I look at it again, just listening to music. Good to have the soundtrack to FACTOTUM so I can listen to it in the car. Look at both together and see how Matt matures ... both play bar room signs. NOTING that he has a bar at Paramount HOtel in NYC, he probably has a great opportunity to do his studies. Great actor, just coming to him. She shows subtly nuances of performances ... good and bad characters. His "young boy out of the farm" is an excellent research that is particularly embarrassing for his bass-hound eyes. He also loves convincingly. Because she was a teenager with Diane Lane in many movies, I don't know how it ... loves the actor with whom you grew up. Adds conviction, I say it.
