There is not much to say about this movie .... it's crude, but fun. <br /> <br /> Plot Overview (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> Two losers Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), invented a new game by playing basketball using baseball rules. When the game becomes a big success, with the help of the billionaires, they form a professional baseball club where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change the city. The Coop & Remer team, Milwaukee Beers, is the only team to stand by the big changes in rules that the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) owner wants to create. <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Action is pretty good because there aren't many big stars in this movie. Although I'm not a big fan of "Southpark", Parker and Stone are doing a good job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie that I can't name them all. It will never let it happen, and they will not try to become more serious to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And the favorite direction of this movie: The Soundtrack. That's great. I especially like "Reil Big Fish" "Take me on" and "Beer". Very underestimated. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a raw, but very funny film. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" by Johnston
