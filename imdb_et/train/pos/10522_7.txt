This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is inventive, sometimes crossing the border with a trick, but definitely avoids the trap to look like boring TV soap in costumes, given that the whole story is dialogue-based. <br /> <br /> Operation is competent. Because of her character, Mrs Paltrow is aside, but the required distance from other characters is accompanied by much less appropriate separation from her own actions. In other words, he does not seem to care enough about the results of his own results. Some of the supporting pains are guilty of over-regulation - a very style that is judged on stage, but in movies. Personally, I had problems accepting Alan Cumming with Mr Elton - without his own guilt, except that he left the impression of a "High Life" gay trolley that it is now difficult to receive him. . Completing the prizes goes to Toni Collette, who is able to heat up, and Jeremy Northam, who puts his character on the right level.
