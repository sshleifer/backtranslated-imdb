Well this movie was probobly one of the more fun scary movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you just have to laugh, and the actors, saying, say he's not gibson. But Gary Browning, who is a police officer, is so damn bad, he's good. I don't know how he does the movie himself. Killer movie.
