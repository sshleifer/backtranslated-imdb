I first read Pearl S Buck's excellent novel in my ninth grade history class, and I enjoyed all of its exciting pages. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood got it and given that it was done in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Certain things have to be accepted: In 1937, there was no question of the Asian Hollywood movie. This makes the final product somewhat more interesting than being able to use a more authentic look. <br /> <br /> By overcoming this obstacle, the leading producer, Irving Thalberg, and director Sidney Franklin (others) struggled to choose a great and stellar sign. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was, at that time, an actor at the top of his mandate and could have almost anything he thought. When you are out of make-up (it's good, but no one really wants to make a mistake in Chinese), she's all about the best of her work. <br /> <br /> Then there is Luise Rainer. As a result of the Oscar struggle, the star of the Vienna actor won last year's spectacular production, leading to the O-Lan plum, despite the lack of Hollywood experience. Her performance won her second consecutive Oscar, for the first time ever in history. <br /> <br /> A lot of criticism has been finished with Rainer's performance and his Oscar won here. He has been called wood and one note. There is little truth in this. While it is said, it is only necessary to return to the book. For Rainer, though not Chinese, O-lan played pretty much as Buck wrote; it is actually a great performance and one of the best transmissions from the book I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the rest, it was MGM. They had Hollywood's biggest list of star and character characteristics and a big budget to pay for the best, and finally they got the best. <br /> <br /> The film softens Wang Lung's marriage to O-lan somewhat. In the novel, according to prosperity, the flesh is lustful, and he receives the spouse, the movement that destroys his wife, but his feelings as a woman do not touch him. In the film, Wang Lung returns to his wife when he was dead. The two pearls he had taken for his years knowing too late that he was his true love. <br /> <br /> Corny, yeah. But that's Hollywood. Taking into account the obstacles that were against them, opening a film might scream. However, despite the noticeable lack of actual Asians, this film has surprisingly worn out after seventy-three years. In fact, the most amazing thing about this movie is how good it is if it was such a disaster.
