This film was not just one of John Ford's personal favorites, but also numbered directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among their high-profile admirers. Ironically, I have just caught up with Criterion's recent 2-disc set after he'd brought a few original texts on Italian television a few years ago and a few times on television in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film celebrated Ford's first nine collaboration with Henry Fond and is also an example for Ford's popular Americana wine. The beautifully and figuratively rather poetic work, the court sequences (and possible revelations) in his second half still offer a wall, besides giving the appalling character Donald Meek a memorable flesh prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Fonda is, of course, perfectly cast as an experienced, inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was supposed to become president; Fonda continues to portray other fictional politicians in the film - especially Franklin J. Schaffner's THE BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and now it is surprising to know that he was reluctant to play Lincoln's role because he thought it was "Like God Playing"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note here that Ford had previously dealt with Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in the SHARK ISLAND PRISONER (1936), which is a great but perhaps little-known pearl, which has fortunately been released as a Special Edition DVD The UK's Criterion stand-in, Eureka's Masters Of Cinema label. In addition, I have two more Abraham Lincoln films in my DVD collection, which I am still watching and both were run by DW Griffith - NATION BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) I just didn't get a lot of movies I've never seen before I watched, I would have gladly given them a spin based on my very satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
