Von Trier once explained how he saw such a strong participation in his films by placing his film world in the middle of a real world and imaginary world. Just as viewers think we look at the "real" story, but actually manipulate it thoroughly, often with the film acting as a distraction (dancer dark) or painful (idiots / idiototics). Of course, the Dogme films only acted as a tool of this theory (in addition to the attention to the center of Von Trier). <br /> <br /> The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to be in balance with all other people, but soon becomes the victim of what others have created in the past. The idealist must inevitably reject society in order to remain idealistic and become a terrorist. Humanity is corrupted and purity only leads to (self) destruction. (These elements were also very wide in waves and dancers in the dark.) The film also features cynical (even humorous) bases concerning the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br As a technical achievement, the film is perfectly designed: shifted colors, screen covers, actions on various coating materials (soon as the mayor as the most interesting). In this movie we can see how good the Von Trier handle is a technical tool. In his later works, he seems to be abandoning it (as if he is no longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily accessible).
