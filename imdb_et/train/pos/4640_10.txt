This is one of the best films I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen a premiere in Tel Aviv, Israel in summer 2006, exactly when the last war has started). people who cause wars are interesting to me for a long time and it doesn't matter who-boys and girls, straight and gays, Jews and Arabs ... I've seen the bubble three times and it's still surprising and exciting for me - every sign reminds me of one of the many people I know and the difference between them, for example, between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The last time I saw it was my friend who is a Christian in Arabic, and it was on the Independence Day of Israel (the most symbolic I could! How ironic) and ... cried at the end !!! - If he's been touched and it wasn't embarrassing, everyone touches it Bubble!
