I've seen it and I like Melissa playing its part well. It was actually plausible. My brother saw it with my sister and I and when I told my sister I forgot that it was based on a real story (I had seen it a few years ago). And both my sister and I were like that anyway I thought that someone knew what the murder was or was, who was really involved because I want to prove it to her. I love lifetime movies, especially those that are true, or just those that teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something this week, but I don't remember where some help would be welcome.
