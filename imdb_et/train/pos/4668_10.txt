This film has now appeared on digital television at least once a month, I looked at it a dozen or more times, and it doesn't let me feel more joy. If it were tomorrow, I'd look at it again. This is the artistic art that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two grand actresses, can create, helped in no way with the excellent supporting trio of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Not forgetting others in small roles. <br /> <br /> Just talking about ex-con, lovely emezzler, is fighting and succeeding with the new era of technology, ie computers, and finding affection in the process. Even if it is unlikely, even incredible, language (cheek), there are no characters. There is no violence, no sex, not a bad language, and not a terrible method that is so common today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers on how to make great exhibitions and almost nothing except outstanding talents.
