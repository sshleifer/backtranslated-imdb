Have you ever wondered how far one movie can go? <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia consistently explores Harry Russo's extreme world. <br /> <br /> Harry is an aggravating writer, killer and drug addict who doesn't have to destroy anything between those who stand between him and madness. Harry starts his ventriloquist dummy rubber because of demonic voices to kill him. Director Ron Atkins Becomes The First Worst Story Ever To Be Filmed <br /> <br /> The only other film I saw in a similar way would be the second episode titled Schizophrenia Necromancer <br /> > It's a very low budget movie and it's not for everyone, but if you're looking for something annoying, different and terrible, it would be a good choice. <br /> <br /> DON'T HAVE ALL SHORT-TERM HORROR (like shouting). <br /> <br /> Viewers' discretion is recommended
