Who ever found the story is one sick person. I rented it for our dream party and all six of us worried because we are all in the classroom and we know a couple of actors from the class. In addition to all those who cried all night in the horror, I had nice nightmares. I thought my god, when I got to pee in the bathroom, I have to drill or something. I couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this terrible horror film. I also thought why all the girls in this movie are topless, but are we not one of the boys' units? You should make a horror movie where the killer is a girl and chopping units. I look at it over and over again. Call it hard or soft or something stupid. I only give this movie for 9 because you were fresh to me.
