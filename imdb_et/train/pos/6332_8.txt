This movie is good for TV. I like it because I'm a huge fan of catastrophic movies, although it's a family movie. The accuracy of the movie from the book is half and half. They got the names of the characters to the right, but there were no storm robbers, a car scene related to Hatch's family running away from the tornado. accompanied by Dan Hatch and his friend who traveled to the police officer for safety. and Dan and his friend are both 12 years old. That's all I mean. In general, it was a good movie, though it would be a bit more accurate for the book. Did you know that the book is based on a real story about tornadoes that destroyed a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
