The director of this 1939 film, John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti, speak of a fictional story of young lawyers Abraham Lincoln, his attempts (literally) and his afflictions. This is a sentimental film that is pretty well done, but hardly breathtaking. Henry Fonda's casting as Lincoln seems to be a mistake, because although the actor had the right doleful for that part, even several inches of makeup and the wrong nose, he was too beautiful to be honest Abe, who was famous at home. This is a good test of the Fund, which is nothing, if not sincere, but its failure throws the entire film out. The support cast is, however, excellent, including Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. However, Ford is too harsh when dealing with Lincoln, who is simply a shy saint, and in the last scene the film goes over the top.
