What happens to washing rock-n-roll stars in the late 1990s? They launch a return / reunion. At least this is a member of Strange Fruit's 70th Stage Rock Group. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) is a condom vending machine concession when he runs to the promoter's son at a famous music festival. It was at the 70's festivals that Strange Fruit broke down. The 70s are "retro" and the time is wide for the wave. He is giving up the band's other members. <br /> <br /> Part of what broke up from the band was the death and replacement of Keith, the lead singer and the brilliant songwriter. The band was known for their lifestyle and now they are all back in the workgroup they came from. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was the mystery and the secret) is sliding, the bass player is the roofer and their singer is still a rocker. Although he has a great mansion, he is forced to sell it because his fortune has not lasted. The driver guitarist Brian is dead, so the young substitute is hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> The band is somewhat reluctant to meet again. When they give up their day-to-day work, they start practicing and their manager approaches their label about re-publishing their albums. But he wants them to start the tour again. And so they hit the club around Europe. The club scene is not kind to these overweight, old and old valves. <br /> <br /> It's really a movie. All the old conflicts are recovering, the Keith and Brian numbers fluctuate. They are all hanging together because they are all looking for a second chance to the size they previously ignored. And again they discover some interpersonal chemistry that made the play so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Still crazy about Spinal Tap II, it is gradually becoming a more dramatically focused film that follows band members' relationships. Although it is still a very funny movie, it is a developing character who is fighting the death of Brian and Keith and his own personal demons that make the film work.
