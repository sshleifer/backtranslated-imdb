Delirious, close to a plot of less mood piece and if it is more LSD inspired than fuck, then we have to remember when it was made! After a surprising opening of the SM (which is not even what it seems) we move with soft focus and dream or imagination or remember? Many literary and cinematographic references, and indeed this is Franco's film, which Lang himself praised. Beautiful and mesmerizing film opens at a peaceful pace, but every time it is rich. A rare film that goes in. Old Jess did when he tried. Also fine central performances including Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I haven't even mentioned Lisbon places - ah!
