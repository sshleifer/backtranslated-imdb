NB! Spoilers inside. This great movie is "a lot" so many things, all successfully: sci-fi time, unstable psychology, dystopian society, what-real-syndrome, gradual damage to religious systems, global bioterrorism and the love story that comes up <br /> <br /> Story the consequences of twisted timelines interfere with the burden of hot discussions - are familiar with the discussions on this site; or as an extreme, see the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Whew! This temporal emphasis is mainly on the glorious plot from the excellent work of writers David and Janet Peoples, not to mention Chris Marker's "La Jetee" inspiration. Undoubtedly, this is one of the most successful and exciting times ever created. But there are many other levels here. <br /> <br /> The real genius of the movie is to focus on the disgusting side-effect of time travel in the sense of James Cole (Bruce Willis, doing his best career) here). Is his journey running from a gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to a gradually unished victim? and back. Other large-scale stories are increasingly emphasized by James and Dr. Personal story of Kathryn Railly (wonderful Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous shifting / contradictory position of these two characters. For me, it's all in the hotel room. By this point, James? once caught in an insecure decision? now there is doubt about his reality; while Dr. Railly? cool and rational scientist? Finally, James's evidence has absorbed a convincing belief in his terrible predictions. His despair to reach James and go on a mission shows how far he has come. <br /> <br /> Gilliam makes us look after these stars, especially through the stress of her life. The balance between the emotional roller skates and the sci-fi puzzle / thriller is subtle. And the breaking of the aerodrome is intense with the heartbeat because we see that it comes so clearly through James' dreams. Is this right after James has decided to give up all the confusion? and is fighting your madness more than ever? that he returns to the record and does what is necessary for humanity. See Jose and the gun? (Just before that, the references to Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and the identity / confusion are excellent.) This is a film that comes between people who are thinking; not only does it last under repeated views, it also requires them. "Twelve Monkey" is intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny and tense. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is great, especially Brad Pitt steals all his scenes and shows great flexibility like Jeffery Goines, crazy and spoiled, but never survives. And David Morse is Dr. Peters (interestingly, how the film just leaves an evil motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the biggest awards belong to Terry Gilliam, crossing here - just barely - his outstanding "Brazil". (Of course, there are many parallels, especially a lonely fighter who tries to escape from his crumbling surroundings: lunacy inside, without lunacy.) The frame of each of these films is its unique stamp and tone. Music is also terrible. <br /> <br /> This is a great achievement of the nineties, a real favorite and definitely a long time.
