I had seen Lady with red hair when it appeared and did not remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, despite its real logic, the game on this screen is stupid and incredible. The actual value of the image is cast. The best supporters of the 30's and 40's always give the undervalued Miriam Hopkins a delicate, intelligent work and Claude Rains's excellent, remarkable performance, which, as usual, is the best thing. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he's in Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Maybe Lady with Red Hair contains her best movies. See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
