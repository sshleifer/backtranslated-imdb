A wonderful romance comedy about a dramatic Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man with whom she is happy (Danny Aiello) until she falls against her strong, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is sharp, with plenty of large lines, the actress is wonderful, the accents (I have been told) are perfect letter and cinematography is beautiful. New York has never been so good on the screen. The main thing to see is Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they are both fantastic and richly deserved Oscars they got. Beautiful, funny movie. Must See!
