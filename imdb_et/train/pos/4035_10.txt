In short ... amazing. <br /> <br /> Initially, I was not very good at seeing Pinjar, because I thought it would be another movie that would take over the partition and show bias towards India and Pakistan. I was so wrong. Pinjar is a close, emotional and intelligent film with no apparent drawbacks. I watched it after watching it. It stayed so long in my mind; Themes, pain, loss, emotion - everything was so real. <br /> <br /> This is really a masterpiece that is rarely seen in Bollywood today. It has no prejudices or prejudices and has given the partition a human story. No country here is good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinema is excellent and the music is melodic, meaningful (thanks to the Gulzar Sahiba) and haunted. Everything from the movie was amazing ... and the actor just took my breath away. Everything was completely cast. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly wonderful movie, don't look any further. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. AMAZING can't describe how good it is.
