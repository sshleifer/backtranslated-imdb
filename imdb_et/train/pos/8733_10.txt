When I bought my Toy Story tape when it appeared in the theater, I saw what the Toy Story creators said. As soon as I saw that I knew it was a good feature! I was right! The life of a mistake like Toy Story is a great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim rhino Beetle, written by Brad Garrett and Hemlich Caterpillar, as expressed by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when the Slim walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) raises Hemlich, trying to displace Bird and Hemlich. How about a nice tasty worm on the sticks and Slim is like I'm going! I'm going to snap! I just died laughing at this scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think Bug's life is my favorite Pixar, though I know many people consider it the worst Pixar movie! I don't know how you could hate Pixar! I think they're all pretty good movies! Good work on PIXAR!
