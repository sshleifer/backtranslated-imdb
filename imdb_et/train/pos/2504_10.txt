When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was this film was an anime rather than a movie. The reason is that it is accompanied by vampires that make incredible tricks. Stunts are very similar when the Matrix moves as it moves too fast for balls and jumps very far. Another reason I am good at the film is that the wonderful faces of the anime they do during the movie. The way Gackt makes his visuals, or just as they do, is very large. I think it's a very good movie. ^ _ ^ The action of this movie is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hydest 10). ^ _ ~ If you are Gackti and Hyde fans, you have to see it.
