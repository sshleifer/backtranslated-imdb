Most people know Paul Verhoeven as a director of many good (and bad) sci-fi movies in Hollywood. But long before he wanted generic thrillers in his home country. The story is the basic premise of femme fatale, nothing new or tempting. Verhoeven thinks he can do it better by adding a series of dream sequences that are used to simply advance a predictable plot instead of defining our main character and situation. The scenario was confident, the dialogue helps to fool the effects of the fun story. What really made the movie at least good was a terrible act. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as a "tortured artist" and supporters were also very good. Jan De Bonti also adds at least some life to a cinematic film, helping at least make Verhoeven as a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
