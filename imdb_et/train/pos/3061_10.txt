This movie shows the ensemble's work that every film wants. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play a man and a woman) are positive cooling, discussing a "family business" as a grocery store or dry cleaning. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also terrible. They play each other as members of a top-notch theater group who realize that a quality product requires every actor to support others independently. And finally, is Sammy (David Dorfman). What a wonderful performance for a child ... and what a surprised similarity to Ullman whose son he is playing! <br /> <br /> We are treated as a unique story in "panic" and it is a rare form of nonsense today. The dialogue is sharp and intelligent, and with this relatively short film it is still capable of generating a full range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, to be shocked, to be scared, to be sad, to awaken, to be angry and to love. It's not a movie that will leave you happy, but when it's over, you're more than happy knowing you've spent the last ninety minutes of work that is good. <br /> <br /> More of us would go to theaters when we are treated with high-quality prices. When will the powers in Hollywood awake? This is a real shame if something that does not succeed is not passed over to festivals and households with a successful cable.
