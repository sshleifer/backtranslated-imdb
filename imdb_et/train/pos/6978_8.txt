Well, I have to say I'm waiting for it to come. <br /> <br /> I'm not trying to spoil it and quite a few people have spoken very well about the pilot. On the other hand, I am not quite sure that I understand detectors who claim to be BSG fans and not as a pilot. <br /> <br /> What are they waiting for? The background is set 50 years before the BSG, when we are there, and we are helping Cylon's birth, see the life of Adama's family (have we already known about BSG), we will have a deeper explanation of Caprican's population and its perception of other colonies and potentially God the origin of God's convictions and the unique God faith of Cylon. <br /> <br /> I don't think the special effect or space opera is as big as in the previous series, I switch between the two, though I know Caprica strengthens BSG. <br /> <br This is a promising start for 1h30, I also believe it will put pressure on scenarios as well as BSG. I look forward to the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we are learning much more. <br /> <br /> Watching a DVD's deleted scene gives more brain to chew your brain. <br /> <br /> I look forward to January 2010
