This movie is my favorite among foreign films, some others are Amilee and my life as a dog. The similarity with these films, such as so many big external films, is that it takes a daily slice of life and makes it a deep heart to lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, who is bored with life and the life of her marriage, the beautiful Japanese woman looks out of the dance studio window. At the same time as he takes his train, he has amazed him. But is it just her beauty, far-sighted, or the connection that they both discover they share? <br /> <br /> Have our dancing characters with memorable characters who have to deal with the painful reality, crossing them through the world of dance. Violation of traditional forms and stereotypes of Japanese society threatens all happiness and finds that joy is not too far away. This is one of those films that is both magical and meaningful and in itself goes beyond everyday life, showing the true magic and wonders that life can have.
