Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary about New York firefighters. What they got was the only film in the World Trade Center on September 11th. <br /> <br /> Having worked with James Hanlon's ladder company, Jules went with the captain to check and repair the gas leak, while Gédéon stayed at the fire when something interesting happened. An airplane that flew low over the city, confused Jules and led the camera for a second before the plane crashed. <br /> <br /> Jules asked the captain to follow him in the towers. The first thing he saw was two people, a fire he refused to film. He stayed there for several hours, filming the reactions of the firefighters and other persons in it. <br /> <br /> Brothers Naude made sure the film wasn't too violent, grizzly, and gory. But the language of the firefighters is a bit coarse and CBS showed a lot of balls that he continued without censoring. Brothers Naudet interfered with the film material they filmed with one-off interviews so firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions in their crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a movie with a similar title, most DVD sales money goes to 9/11 related charities. Very well done, emotional, moving and completely political propaganda is still the best documentary.
