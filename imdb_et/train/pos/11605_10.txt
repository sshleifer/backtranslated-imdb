The biggest reason I had to see this movie was that it marked Susan Swift, an outstanding and too subconscious actor. Time movies usually don't interest me or nervousness, but this movie was exciting and creepy. It didn't rely on extraordinary special effects, and it didn't focus so much on the journey that the viewer disappears and confuses. It was really a creative film that was considered simple and focused on great action.
