This movie was very good. If you are the one who loves watching horror films, I recommend it. The action was very good, though I thought that the actor playing with Julie could have felt more emotions behind her lines. Allan was very good and I thought the cinema was amazing. I was on the edge of the seat, while my friends worried and shouted. It was, in my view, a complete success and it should have come to the big screen. I'll give her two thumbs up! I would definitely say that if you haven't seen it yet, let it go. If you have seen it and do not like to go and see it again, there are parts that were completely unreal. I also liked how many movies were filmed and school school.
