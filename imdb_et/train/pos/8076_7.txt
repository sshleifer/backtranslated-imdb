The family has about two families who have each other's blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is the underworld, operating from Bangkok. She has a family in India. Once she kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, she also has a family (brother, wife, and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother, is revenge for his brother's death. For the same reason, he kidnaps the family of Viren Sahay. <br /> <br /> The film has one turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The other side of the film is entirely in it, where the expression is more pronounced than its dialogues. The insignificant role of Akshay has made him equal to Amitabh. I didn't understand what Bhumika Chawala did in this movie. <br /> <br /> The script contained some open dots; like; Amitabh has been shown to be the city's most sought after criminal who is still traveling in the city for free. The kidnapping of his family also seemed vague. How can such a large donor family not have a security cover?
