My lasting love for the Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped her launch her puberty in 1965 in Thunderball, has led me to quite unusual places. The case, the British curiosity since 1959, "Carlton-Browne F.O.", which has one of Lucianna's earlier roles. He plays in this princess, although the picture is actually an exhibition of the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, both of which were definitely on this point. In this cute, often very funny movie, we learn about the islands of Madeira, which had been a British colony until 1916, and then forgot. Forty-three years later, it becomes the focus of global attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered, and His Majesty sends Carlton-Browne, a worshiper of the Foreign Ministry. Terry-Thomas supports this part nicely, as do the sellers in the role of Prime Minister Amphibulos of his small country. (It was the second film of the 1954 sellers, associated with a small country that fits the world and, of course, the "Mouse that yelled".) Ian Bannen steals the show almost like the King of the Gaillardia Suave and my girl Lucianna is as tempting as she may be its minor role. The film shows a lot of dry humor, although there are some stomach laughs that have been (for example, reception at Gaillardia airport, and especially that May Day-style parade of Gaillardia). And the salesman's prime minister with his cracked English and seemingly persistent sweat stains is another memorable character in this great actor pantheon. Regardless of the occasional or two unclear, rigid upper lip of the British, I found this picture to be a modest entertainment and it is well presented on this crisp-looking Anchor Bay DVD.
