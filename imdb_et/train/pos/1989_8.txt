I admit that Oliver doesn't like it! as a young child - it's long and the story is a bit slow due to just musical numbers. As a teenager, I discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself. Instead of thinking about this adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of the classic story. Adaptation is at best, but if you look musical, there's no story there. <br /> <br /> Music is the core of this movie, and the overwhelming majority of it is star and very memorable. Most or most of the participants participated in the musical stage version and it shows in their performances - and I consider it a plus. Performances are all "older" styles that are typical of many older movies and they are very fun. The exception is a child who plays Oliver, whose work seemed to look cute and stay away from the actual performers. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed is also doing a fantastic job of maintaining a threatening screen presence as a threatening Bill Sykes. Even Sykes' dog Bullseye puts great performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals despise it, as do those who take musicals too seriously. The displacement of wrong historical details or the exaggerated phase-type error that acts against bad behavior destroys someone's pleasure. Just sit back and have fun - it's much better to remember that as a music, it's a loosely arranged fantasy, not a rigorous customization.
