This particular short topic by Joe McDoakes was obviously inspired by all of Star Warner Brothers' remarkable thanksgiving, one of your all-time war-time moral enhancers. In this, Eddie Cantor played both himself and the comedy who would like to break into the movies except for his similarity with Cantor. <br /> <br /> George O'Hanlon, who played McDoakes shorts, is both himself and McDoakes, who are just trying to break the film. Like its happy stars, there are some Warner Brothers contract players who have a free walk through this movie. <br /> <br /> O'Hanlon has sent a small line of role to the First World War movie by the middle-man, but Direct McDoakes gets the message. The poor guy is so nervous with such a big moment, he starts thinking about how to offer his line. Maybe it sounds like a real movie star that would help. <br /> <br /> 86 will later be the director of Ralph Sanford and patient Clyde Cook's irritation who will play British cockney soldiers who find poverty in the film business. McDoakes. It deserves this very fun short theme put up for the Oscar to find out what will happen to O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
