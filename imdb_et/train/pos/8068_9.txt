Watching this movie from start to finish without breaking at some point, would require almost faith, because you have to say "it's old", "it's classic", "be kind", not because the movie is so bad, but that's why it's the best. It's a dated movie. It's also classic when it's faded. I'm not trying to laugh at people at all and I get more than a little irritated when others do it. Entertainment for the informer feels a bit like worshiping idiots when he moves his orange juice as a whole tablecloth. Yes, one says to himself, he is an idiot, and when he is on his own, he is also a savant. The same goes for the informant, which is sometimes very terrible, but still has great photography, fine action, wonderful scores and a good and decent simple story. Finally, what I do not give, in politics, religion, and psychology, is the congregation that feels hungry and up, but so is life sometimes. People with uneducated simple beliefs behave differently from us (probably brilliant) from modern people and the scene is not as incredible (I buy it, but I know Irish) as embarrassing. But people do so, they say such things. Not all are hips and it may not be desirable for everyone to have a tree. Are people so much better today than seventy or eighty years ago? And how? I do not belive. We're just different. Now watch the movie.
