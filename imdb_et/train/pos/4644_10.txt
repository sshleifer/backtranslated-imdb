Soft display, which is a joke of the movies of the entertaining art houses. <br /> <br /> This flick reveals all the clich√©s and some! Excitingly Bad (Downs Syndrome!) Participants. An awful difficult self-important dialogue. Scenes that should hit but fall flat. Editing. Pointless plot points. Everyone has put together a kind of smirky miasma that respected the audience and vague psychological power. <br /> <br /> This is exactly what it was meant to be. Fun satire of funny movies made by funny teen trusters to show your parents when they ask them what they have done in the last two years! After "What is it?" was awarded the Cannes Prize, Werner Herzog was announced as a part of the film's spam! He chased the info. Until today, he refuses to discuss this case. <br /> <br /> Anyway, look at it and laugh, it's classic humor for years.
