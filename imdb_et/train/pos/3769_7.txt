Oh, come on, learn a little fun. When I was a kid, this film was worth Oscar for me. I thought it was hysterical. One of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now it's a little stupid, but come on. If you liked "Great Adventure", you should probably have fun with "Bogus Journey". It was a movie before "Dude, where's my car?". Only this is really funny. As I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously, and if you liked the first, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. Just to rejoice, look at it, let go and remember that it's a silly comedy. That is all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
