I saw this movie for the first time as a teenager. At a time when heavy metal dominated the world. Trick Or Treat has every element of the film that rocks. What will win the Skippy family, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne preacher? Backward evil messages are played on vinyl! Yes, it is right, they use the documents in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to the disc player's evil rock star message when things start to scare. Monsters begin to come out of their speakers, and his stereo becomes dominant. As a teenager, I tried to play back my records, hoping it would happen to me. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is one of my favorite films of all time.
