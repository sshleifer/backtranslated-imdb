Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a short comic market for a very lost player. This market is dominated by the Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies shorts from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able to unlock hidden gems such as "Spring", the amazing story of the most beautiful season of the year. /> <br /> In the environment shown here, spring does not cause natural cycles but is made. And who? The elves of small males living underground. Every spring, when the snow starts to melt, they start working. They begin with the cutting of the rainbow columns, then they cut into rubble and use this rubble to make it a colorful liquid that moves to the ground and carries grass, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the copy shows the spring, but the second part is slightly different. The old man's winter comes back and he's trying to extend the winter by destroying the elves. From that moment on, we will help the battle between the barrels and the old man's winter. <br /> <br /> The music you hear here is deliciously wonderful. Melodic parts stick to the head like an ink point on a sheet of paper. The second part of the melodies are exciting and perfect for action. It's just awesome, Giorgio! Animations are also a pleasure. The colors are well blended and every little detail is shown in a massive, epic environment. The term itself is great. The barrels attract characters, so is Old Man Winter, which effectively depicts the cold and merciless feelings of the season. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong message here. The struggle seems to have disappeared for the missing, until one late arriving elf jumps into action and this leads to the barrels winning in the winter. So the point is: only one person can make a difference. <br /> <br /> To sum up, the "spring" is a short classic from the comic era. Even more remarkable is that this cartoon director debuted here. And who is the director of "Spring"? That's sure William Hanna ...
