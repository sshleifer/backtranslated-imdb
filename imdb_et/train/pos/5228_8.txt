I found this movie fun. Spammers from other popular films of this time were some of the funniest I've seen in such a movie. Try it. When you saw the movies that this movie is talking about and you get humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and others who watched the movie with me) felt a more fun part of the movie (it's not a spoiler because I'm NOT telling you what's really going on) was a scene where the MIB had a "flashy". When they first discover the device and don't know what it is ... and then again in the movie ... you understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the movie is that I have never found it on a DVD to buy a copy.
