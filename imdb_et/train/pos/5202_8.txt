Just looking at this "Samhain" version, and although I like it, it's not like a "rough cut" version. When you check the bulletin board, you'll see the director apologize for this cut version after 79 minutes, and he says he has nothing to do with this R-rated truncated editing with a brand new screwed end. The Christian does not really have to go far away, because the basic gore elements still stand up, even if they are very trimmed. It's a shame, because it had the potential to be one of the goriest and the best gorefilies in the years. It still has porn stars and inbreds, and some extreme holes can be seen at least in part. I'm glad I have this "harsh cut" because for me it is the gem of every gorehound library. Christian Viel certainly has the skill and vision of delivering goods and hopefully his next project will be better produced. The idiots were almost classic and screwed to everyone. "Samhain" can be one of the most controversial and misunderstood horror films ever, and too bad gorehounds could not see what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** So you know what you missed, this is my rating based on "Printing a SAMHAIN job. <br /> <br /> The film lasts just over 90 minutes and has no chapter. the scenes do not have a sound in the dialog because I think they are intended to be a loop later. "Rough Cut" but "Samhain" is the only uncut version you probably see. The reason is that gore is extremely graphic, much more than even NC-17. Yes, there are some porn stars, but they are just there to kill and a little Sugar and Spice Addition: The story is quite common for American tourists on holiday in Ireland and staying in the middle of a forest, an area that is difficult for folklore, including the ancient Druids and Sam to mark a shark or when we call it Halloween. (spooky) <br /> <br /> The film starts with a huge dose because one of the local inbred mutants is attacking the camping site. This is a great gore scene because the man finds his girl's hanging girl to be helped. Everything he sees is his head, his hands and shoulders hanging in front of him, and when he pulls him, he is completely cut into two. That's what I would call EXTREME GORE, with internal, blood and broken limbs all over the place. We are here in the territory of Herschelli Gordon Lewis, with the exception of those whose effects seem more realistic. I'm just going to miss the story, because it's your normal stalk and kill the plot. <br /> <br /> The next gore scene is something to see, as a boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like a location (TCM-2 stuff) and a table. This geek then cuts out all its limbs (to insert a camera, a scene with a cue), and then we can see his torso in the barbecue room, turning the fire slowly and the torsol is hard (if you can believe it). Yes, very bad taste, tough, tough, you will find the right word, and it probably fits. <br /> <br /> Then Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, will be cut off from the neck, and all her entrances will be drawn out graphically and her blood will flow into the pot. Yummy, real gear huh? <br /> <br /> The best gore scene is happening inside the house and I have to admit that this is one of the best gore scenes I've seen. This guy (who doesn't matter who) is caught from the geek and opened his ass hole. Then the geek puts his hands in and throws out all the boys, the intestines, and what the hell is elsewhere, right at his asshole. This is happening on FOREVER because the boy screams and more and more internals are drawn to the bathroom floor. It's so extreme, so upstairs, so I laughed at hell. Obviously, you will never see this scene on the right DVD, IMO with most other truly extreme scenes. <br /> <br /> So what do you think about it? First of all, although I doubt that this film would ever have been released in this completely uncompromised presentation, it makes Rough Cut a rare expensive gorehound. Yes, it is a bit difficult at first, with no soundtrack, a few scenes you still have to enter, and credits that have no names everywhere. But it makes it so unique, and I wouldn't want to change it now. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme gore. This changes the "Haute Tension" from the Disney movie.
