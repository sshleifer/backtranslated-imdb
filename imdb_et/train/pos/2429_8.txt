If you liked Deep Cover, you might also like this movie. Many poetic stops Fishburne say in a deep cover "once in a lifetime" lyric script, which is the customization of a play written by Fishburne. If you love Larry as much as I do, you love this movie that is all Larry, all hot and all ready. Of course, the gaming and illegal use of the substance is a gangster movie, but the script is beautiful and the story even touches a little chick on the flick. <br /> <br /> A good movie ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you ever sniffed at night or hanged out of a clubhouse, you get the right effects of the tight sets (metaphorically, they're trapped in life). This movie is very smart and complicated. This movie is tight. GOOD JOB!
