At first I thought Sarah Silverman had her show. The movies he has appeared were not very funny and his humor is a bit down. But I was very surprised to see his true colors in this Comedy Central gem. I'd like to put Amy Sedaris on the same footing with Candy - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very similar to Sedaris' Jerri Blank. <br /> <br /> One of the downsides of this exhibition is his support cast. His sister's character is good; Sometimes it was funny, but in the end it didn't mean to steal Sarah's show. But the rest is quite sub-par. <br /> <br /> However, I am delighted that Comedy Central has given Sarah the chance to show her unique and mad self-expression and humor.
