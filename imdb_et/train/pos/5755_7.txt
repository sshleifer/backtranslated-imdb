This is a pretty strange movie. It is a film about the use of global violence and the exploitation of unrealistic situations, but it is unusual for the characters of warring rural areas to be built, not the invaders 'others'. <br /> <br /> The film is an over-stereotype of Vietnamese veterans, a long line of films depicting the dangerous psyche of vets of this war. Kris Kristofferson's last line is "I haven't lost a war yet" when he meets his death after a long trace of murder and destruction, including the city's police chief and his brother's girlfriend especially cold. However, Kristofferson is a good enough actor and charismatic enough to carry this cable at a surprising depth. Vincent is clearly a golden boy, but with a sufficiently intense layer on his clean cut goodness. The film carries some image similar to Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate the offender until he is forced to accept him. <br /> <br /> The film has a b-movie rating, although Kristofferson, Vincent's gorgeous Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give him an A-line lineup. <br /> <br /> I give him 7 that I had long lost sight of the American psyche after Vietnamese / Reagan intervention, paranoia and confusion, and the film industry, which was ready to deal with such issues at that time. <br /> <br /> Watching this is a great network that plays many old 70s-90s movies regardless of political curvature.
