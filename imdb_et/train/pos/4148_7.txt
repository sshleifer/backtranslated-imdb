Let's do one thing straight: this movie doesn't try to redefine the genre, it's not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. It's a silly flick with three big women (remembering no other comedy with similar qualities), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler SNL and indie queen Parker Posey, charming like never before. The story is basic: the three gals were the "losers" of the college and are still there. Poehler is a dog trainer (who doesn't even get a date in a dark guy), Posey is a senator's assistant (who "hasn't touched a man because Clinton was in office" ... I took it a few minutes later ... I'm a little slow OK!) And Dracht has a gay bride (Seth Meyers SNL, funny). They must avoid the daughter of the senator ("always in the lovely" Amber Tamblyn "" Noor of Arcadia "always" lovely Amber Tamblyn ") to embarrass her during the spring break, so of course they have to look over her and have some fun. comedy, quite short and quite enjoyable
