Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar, Aardman Animation proves over and over again how to make animations properly. <br /> <br /> I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it would be well translated for the American audience. My only concern is that most of the viewers don't see subtle humor in this show. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I knew I was there when I sat down to watch it. The animators did an excellent job that matched the pre-recorded voices to create the perfect game. See the first episode that has given the goat the stones, and the dogs on the street are calling to call each other. <br /> <br /> Is it for everyone? Not long shooting. In fact, I would be pleased that the exhibition would last for the whole season. But as I said before, the audience won't look at it.
