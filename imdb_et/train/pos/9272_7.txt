That was the first Panah movie I saw, I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was completely absorbed by the different characters he created and how differently they react and behave in comparison to the Aussie children and at other levels, in a similar way. I think that if more people could see such movies, they would see people as individuals and avoid racism, which can often be felt by unknown fear. There are obviously great political differences between Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I found that there are more subtle differences between the signs that this film is so successful on the screen, very interesting. The characters I feel are so unique. I found that it made the characters weighty.
