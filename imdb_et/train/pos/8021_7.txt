The third Muppet film is probably the most relaxing and enjoyable, with the gang taking its modest college to musical Broadway's white (still volatile) lights that are usually full of naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (the author of the group and the show) blows to their top; so, all others are going their way so that they don't have to take responsibility for them. Kermit herself with her friends communicates with a young man's fashion designer who makes ends meet, offering food to his father's dinner (the old man has a series of particularly embarrassing non-sequences!). We get regular local performances in different characters: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as a lofty dog ​​owner), Dabney Coleman (trusted), Elliott Gould (who was also MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnell (if itself is a portrait of a stylish restaurant, replacing Kermit, a sporty fake mustache, as a seemingly labeled entrepreneur who attracted the public to the Muppets' show, Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (perhaps a more fun movie scene than the Broadway producer to whom Kermit it looks like a street light and a chummy and fun bellows and afro wig!). The other Muppets go more or less through their typical pace, with (unfortunately) less space for Gonzo at that time; Miss Piggy is the taste, scenes I have acquired, where the last spies she considers to be a romance with the waitress? and especially his violent reaction to it? is indisputably funny. But what's going on is climate change itself (after a pretty redundant middle, where Kermit gets amnesia and finally gives up advertising on Madison Avenue), which doesn't give the original splashy routines something more original than Kermit and her wedding ceremony. eternal flame Miss Piggy!
