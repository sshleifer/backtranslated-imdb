It is amazing that a film made in 1934 may be a head and shoulders above any Tarzan movie, including the 1980's swollen and boring Greystoke. When the viewer passes through the first three scenes that are really boring, Tarzan and his Mate step out like shocks, offering alternation, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful like Jane and filming together. Weismuller is also strong. Highly recommended.
