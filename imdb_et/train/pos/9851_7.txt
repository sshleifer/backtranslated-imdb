Shrek, anyone? Imagine the Shrek ice age. Remember the end of Shrek? Because you're doing. Now, imagine that Shrek will become a human being and this is what the princess does. Is it? Great animation, actually much more artwork than Pixar and Disney images that try to get as realistic as possible in their drawings. Strong single liners, some social comments that children don't understand, will win good guys. One more thing: Scrat. By the way, how do everyone know that his name is Scrat? 7/10
