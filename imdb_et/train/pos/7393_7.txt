This movie was impressive. My first experience with foreign film, it wasn't too long or too complicated. I enjoyed the subtitles myself; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son visiting his older father and a retarded brother after a long separation was first published as clich√©s, but it turned out to be very touching and realistic. There were also some subtle humor to not push or wear the audience.
