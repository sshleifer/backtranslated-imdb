It's not a big movie. Action is not amazing (some sub-charters are even badly played), the film is not in any way beautiful. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big movies, it's not for you. but it has a great story - really a big plus. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own lives. The girl we didn't ask, the test we've failed, the friend we've shot, is all in our history. This movie works because it concerns it, it's a great story because it's small. It is the life we ​​all have, with regret that we all have, and yet this message has hit: every life we ​​would have lived would have had a negative side. The first time I looked at it, I was 15. It was at my school's party. 16 years later I think of it every now and then, and every time I see it, it makes me smile. Look out. That's good for you. You are happier with what you have.
