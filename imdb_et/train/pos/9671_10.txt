Paulie is the little girl's fantasy or maybe her memory of what her youth was like. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub performs flawlessly as a Russian scientist (PhD) who is unable to find decent work in America. He communicates with an isolated parrot when he performs the caretaker's central duties at a behavioral research laboratory. <br /> <br /> The chief physician is a bitter man, as Paulie, who can speak and fully understand and learn, disgraces the doctor. who later abandons him to the lower levels of the building where he finds Mikaili (Tony S.). <br /> <br /> Paulie gives her life to Marie and how they lost each other. Quest begins to reunite with Marie, over 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> The movie ends, some say predictably, Mikail again with Paulie again with Marie. The story is closed with three entries into Marie's home where you can make your final choice. <br /> <br /> Great Family Film!
