A typical bump through the reality of Cheech and Chong, which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, lingerie, upright comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !! It is not as steady or plausible as smoke, but it is still very funny without being as strange as Nice's dreams. There are some classic scenes that include opening procedures where they get gas for their car and work. Also funny is the Cheech song (Mexican-Americans) and Chong. Another spectacular scene is the Jones (human noise machine), the police academy and the old laughing man. All in all, this is a great step up in Smoke and is quite observable if it's good or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
