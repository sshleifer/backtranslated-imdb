Given the low budget and production constraints, this film is very good. It is plausible, realistic, and shows how Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains) risked their lives to save the American pilot from merciless and wild Nazis. another very brave boy - who admires the American pilot. If you are looking for special effects, superman heroes and magical ending - this movie is not for you. If you want to feel what it was like to have a permanent, immoral Nazi and their lack of compassion, then this movie is nice to you, I really enjoyed it and those who love horses, dogs and humble, helpful people who value freedom and want it the goal, this movie is what you remember for a long time.
