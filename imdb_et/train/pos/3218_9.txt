Of the nine out of ten, it may seem high to give a direct video movie that the US boxer is busy with and criticized as Kurt Russell's poorest film career. <br /> <br /> First of all, when you read the negative comments about this movie, they usually begin Russell's interpretation of Todd, a soldier, wood. I'll start here, with my surprise, that this is probably the best thing I've seen pulling out Russell. Todd is an emotional stroke and suffers from intense PTSD - this film, written before this phenomenon, was as widely recognized as it is today. <br /> <br /> The image is visible. Todd has been withdrawn, non-communicative and lonely. He suffers from irrational anxiety - through training that teaches him to analyze every move and interaction with another person about betrayal and danger. His hyperfocus leads to an inability to understand the greater continuity of the tasks he is given - there is a scene where he cuts carrots for slicing and continues to work, not cutting or cleaning the blood. Many interpret it as a sign of physical strength and focus on handy work, but it is also a sign that it simply fulfills the required task - not understanding the relationship between vegetables it prepares and the food that has been eaten later. <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is at least spartan - the two great spoken scenes he receives are at the heart of the film plot and both emphasize the darkness of his existence. We are told about fear and discipline. Always. Fear of keeping him inflated until a hyper disorder in a country where the smallest detail does not move him, keeping him ready to respond to the knife edge. Discipline that keeps it through its fear, overcoming it, and tactically. The conclusion is that he has no time to think and can not afford the feelings. Many viewers interpret their response to the Nielsen Sandra hug differently - but I believe you need to interpret it against a person whose only experience is fighting - trembling is his struggle / instincts of flight that respond to intimidation of fear, restriction of his movement and vision - fear and discipline indeed. <br /> <br /> Then, his subtraction (twice in fact) is so representative how our society tends to infantry in the society's trash when they have served their conditions. 40% of the unemployed are former military personnel in our world, and its UT can only be worse. Russell quickly accepts Mace's responsibility to his wife and child, who desperately need a mission, even one with such a high probability of death. <br /> <br /> There is also a military subtext - a conflict between Busey Church and Headquarters, Mecca. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and more aggressive. Each of them can land in Todd, but it does not concern the tools you have, how to use them. Favorable Todds, who have the freedom to exercise their own initiative and act without the anesthetic effect of perceived superiority, use stealth tactics and sliding tricks to cut through the newer unit - sent without support, coverage or research. It is a reminder that military power cannot fail in command. <br /> <br /> There are many other fine topics. If the film is filmed and scrambled so minimally, it leaves a lot of room for its interpretation. See the soldier openly and see what he teaches you.
