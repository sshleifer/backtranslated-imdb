The Notorious Bettie Page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress, but instead became one of the most famous girls in American history. Bettie Page, played by Gretchen Mol, was one of the first sex icons in America. Modeling Type Bettie Page participated in involved nudity and serfdom, which led to the US Senate investigation in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Walking out of the movie, which I just thought about how far we've been since the 1950s. Now you can go online and find some of the most annoying and shocking images the film "The Notorious Bettie Page" seems to be almost childish and innocent. Most materials, including slavery, did not contain nudity when Bettie Page was still involved, but we have sick pictures of women having sex with animals. I think maybe the envelope has been pushed a little since the 1950s, because watching this movie for today's pornography was very tasteful. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was quite impressed by the "Notorious Bettie Page," I found the film very well made and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer will lead you to believe it is and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks like a Bettie Page and gives a very good result. I also thought that because the film was shot in black and white, it made the film realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a movie created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film was running time, a couple of scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been. I looked at it and it seems that the movie has been cut 10 minutes after its launch at the Toronto Film Festival. The ending was also pretty annoying and I was expecting a little more about it or maybe some points that would come up on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie's life where the movie was left. These are my only two complaints about the film, which is not that the staging was sure, the exemplary was very good, especially Gretchen, and the writing was good. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron, who led American Psycho, one of my favorite films, is the "The Notorious Bettie Page" director and writer. I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a device and create great movies based on symbols because, like "Psycho", Bettie Page is a research and a good one. Harron hits the 40's and 50's easily and all the characters. He is a very talented director, who hope it will last for several years. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: "Notorious Bettie Page" is definitely worth it. This is a very interesting story that shows how far America and the world have come to pornography. The film also includes Gretchen Mol, who literally nails the role of Bettie Page. And take it with talented managers who managed to capture the look and feel of the previous era and have a good movie. Unfortunately, this movie is likely to be on the flop, because not many people who grew up after this time show interest in the film, but I think it's worth it. <br /> <br /> MovieManzel's Final Rating "The Notorious Bettie" Page is 8/10, an interesting feature of one of the most famous girls and sex games in American history.
