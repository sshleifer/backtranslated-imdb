We watched vcr and found it exciting. I didn't know anything about this true story: "Oh, no, P.Brosnan, as an American Indian (" red Indian film "), which is a bad choice" until I discovered the truth about Gray Owl. The film shows the dignity of these indigenous peoples and undermines the racist myths that affect them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, what a beauty and a very convincing woman to India (I believe she's a French-Canadian; she's sure she'll talk to her too familiar). Despite being an isolated, looting style of Brosnan, he finally comes convincingly as a passionate, dedicated person. The plot is a bit weak when he demonstrates his transition from trap to animal vicar. Good movie, highly recommended.
