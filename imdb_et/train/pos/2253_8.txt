I rented this film for my interest after American history, and especially for the somewhat strange story of Mormon. This film tries to understand the idea of ​​how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into a great religion of the world. It focuses first on the concerns that the Mormons had in solving them in Navuoo, Illinois. It represents the trial of Joseph Smith. During this trial, Brigham Young stands to speak of his transition to Mormonism and his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is murdered and Young has to deal with his doubts as to whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. In spite of his serious doubts, he remains and, ultimately, the vision (that Utah is his place of colony), which gives him confidence in the correctness of his leadership. Later, when crops destroy crickets, he doubts again whether he's really chosen - but there is a miracle that cemented his place in history. <br /> <br /> I found performances moving and the story is convincing and interesting. I would like to know if the Mormons believe it is an exact depiction. Polygamy is part of this story, but the reasons why it is central to LDS are not raised. The problem is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I am sure that people will stay away from this religious issue because of this film, but it has a great cast and it will keep your interest all over.
