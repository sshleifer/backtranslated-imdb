Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average person who feels that God is confusing his life. God hits him and shows Bruce his way out. Of course, giving God's authority can become worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems to be at home like God and poured the plot well together. Jokes are almost always the target, although sometimes they use a little too much Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film really represented God, not just that, but also a black man. I thought it was pretty good, especially with the great Freeman. For example, there are some fun scenes, such as opening a cookie scene, others failing to target a bit, but still a good movie. 6/7 of 10
