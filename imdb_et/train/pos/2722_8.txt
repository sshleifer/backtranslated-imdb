These infamous, 1959 Kansas murders, based on Capote's book, are filmed by Brooks and Gray in black and white, giving him a documentary feeling. Blake and Wilson have good results like killers and Forsythe as a policeman who follows them. The scenes that lead to the murders that have been filmed in a real house, where the crime took place, with winds calling, are quite intense and cool. Brooks controls a lot of veins and uses a number of interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it is a bit overweight, with the denouement pulled out and somewhat preached.
