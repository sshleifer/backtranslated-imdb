In the 1930s, the studios used this type of short film as a basis for testing new participants, given their relatively simple production compared to full-length feature films, so it is interesting that it should mark Shirley's temple, which had long established itself as the most famous adult star. And again, he probably wasn't the one I tried, I imagine it would have been Frank Coghlan Jr., who played Shirley's brother Sonny and gave a relatively less impressive performance. Then the 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy thing to do. <br /> <br /> The film opens with an impressive field of vision that includes a leaky ceiling. give a full glance at the ceiling, illustrate the working class of the film, and give a clean transition to the next scene that Shirley is lucky enough to get into the rain. <br /> <br /> This is Sonny's birthday, and his father is making a random and scary effort to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog he really wants, but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten once and ever bitten. since then. It is curious that if his father requires a dog, Sonny decides to go home instead of staying home and because he is not running to the destination, it is also curious that the film shows what it seems to be indifferent to homeless people, who even cross the exclusive indifference even today. <br /> <br /> Sonny passes the man who bakes the bacon on the rail bar on the side of the train rails (immediately after the train, considering how close the tracks he was, you would have thought the boy would have derailed, but no matter if). After Sonny refuses to share breakfast, because the sour scare that his cheerful smile gets a guy, he continues and the homeless man disappears from the movie. It is interesting to think about the longer the film would have made, because it leaves this poor man open. <br /> <br /> Not that it is important, Sonny will soon hear the sons who are moving down and jumping down to find a dog that is covered. It may seem like a fidelity that he will take up the dog immediately and accept it because he just left home because he is afraid of his dogs, but it seemed to me that he should not only have his power to remind the dogs but their lack of power over him. As soon as he saw the dog he needed, he won his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all it takes, I have to find a helpless spider and I'm set! <br /> <br /> This is a very comfortable movie, where everything works exactly as it should be, but it is cute and enjoyable (and short enough as it was) to remain a fun movie. We're not expecting an epic plot with a 19-minute film, but Pardon My Pups still offers a lot of character and character for a short time. At the end of the movie, there is also a fight scene that Charlie Chaplin must be proud of. I'm hardly an expert on Shirley Temple movies, but it's hard to see how he became the most famous children's star of all time.
