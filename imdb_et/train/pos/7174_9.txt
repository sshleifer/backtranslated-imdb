I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere - and really glad I did. As a big movie fan and lifelong in northern California, I was amazed at how much Oscar winning movies in the Bay area. Like a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Gulf region, not to go to LA, George Lucas resides in comments on persistence, community, and vision. Hey, if he and all other filmmakers can do it in SF, then other artists. <br /> <br /> Would recommend this movie
