The shine of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. This is one of the man's main fears. This movie is a spooky picture that every child has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen is surprisingly dull as a crazy dentist who thinks he's trying to kill people, but only works on his teeth, so it doesn't really work. Especially in the gory scene, we find so actress Earl Boen, who has teeth completely destroyed by exercises, and that's not what I think it's the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist. It is a typical situation for Brian Yuzna, which is not well written, but is gore. The plot is dirty and at times it seems to be on the ground, but hey, it's the killer dentist's movie, we've all thought about it, but they did it first.
