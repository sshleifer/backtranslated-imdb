it was my personal favorite when I was young, it was all that was great with 90's children's movies ... dinosaurs, cute kids, eccentric villain and some great songs (not typical little mermaid / beast and beast type songs, but those that are usually entertaining! I recently ran to this movie and I still love it! I recommend that every age of this movie be seen, and I certainly think it should be introduced to younger generations! Sorry not the most informative, I'm a little rush ... please, trust me. Everyone who is against this movie will kill their inner child!
