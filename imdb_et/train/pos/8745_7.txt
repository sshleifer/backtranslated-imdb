After finishing high school, the best friends Alice and Darlene decide to travel to Thailand. Although they are there, they meet a charming Australian guy named Nick. After spending time with Nick, he asks if they want a weekend trip with him to Hong Kong. They agree. At the airport, however, they are for the smuggling of drugs and then convicted for 33 years in a Thai prison for what they say they have not done. You don't really know what they're doing when they contact Yankee Hank, an American lawyer living with her husband in Thailand. The word is that if you have the money it can help. Things start well, but they still can't get out. <br /> <br /> The film is really good because it doesn't let it happen and it is interesting all the time. I couldn't believe that end. It was one of those endings where you do not know the 100% truth, but you still know what happened to Nick and drug trafficking really 'owning'. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale are both pretty good. However, Beckinsale's performance was slightly weak. The Danish and Beckinsales characters are good friendships, but it seemed stronger. Paul Walker also has a small unmarked role here. ;) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought the Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I'll give it 7/10.
