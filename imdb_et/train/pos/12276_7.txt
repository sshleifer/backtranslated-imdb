Has such environmental production failed its primary goal, which was the correct adaptation of Allende's novel? Probably yes. Bille August managed to make a superficial, low film, where the key elements of the South American mentality are simply presented as side effects, resulting in complete insecurity. I can't believe there was a whole production team who couldn't understand the book! Of course, this film has a technical quality and I think the actors did their best, but nothing is missing. And that was the most important part.
