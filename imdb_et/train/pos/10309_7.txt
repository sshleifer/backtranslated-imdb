Now whether you like Mr Carrey's humor or not. I, myself and Irene, saw the audience walking as well as on the other, rejoicing and dropping in cheerful mirrors. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you are warned. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, check out the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still smiled at the movie. If you don't think the vision is from a dog that puts the seat down after a relaxed relaxation, don't worry about the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a reporter who is stuck with "lighter news" threatens God when all his life seems to be in the pot. God takes the challenge and asks if he can do better. Carrey gets into all sorts of God's power swings by making his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) bigger breasts, promoting herself and responding to everyone's prayers with one-handed computer commands. <br /> <br /> This is not a high movie or even a memorable one, but it is very limited in intent, Carrey provides fans with almost constant smiles, and even any religious joy is likely to be imperfect for everyone except the narrowest thinkers and anti-god-squadders. <br /> <br /> At a more reasonable level, the film is tempted to speculate on Carrey's own career, which has been trapped in his comedy because he has largely failed to impress a serious actor after winning two golden globes. His most accomplished "straight" role, Man on the Moon, is less well known as his comedy - or Truman's show (which the Academy took three calls to Carrey).
