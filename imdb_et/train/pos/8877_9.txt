This story was probably one of the most powerful I've ever taken. John Singleton definitely went further and further in this educational masterpiece. Great performances of the whole performance, but Epps and Rapaport turned to the best and most convincing career of both young stars. extreme. In a sense, although these are many college campuses, they are not as big or open as this film believes. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that something like this could actually happen. But apart from being a little more dramatic, the movie was great and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think. One of the things in this picture that I remember forever was Lawrence Fishburn's character, "Knowledge is power, you don't know your power." Brilliant, just brilliant.
