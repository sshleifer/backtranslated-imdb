Here at IMDb.com, I read the opinion that Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan. I don't know if he has better and worse roles, I'm not his fan, but it was really extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the impressive hand of the film director. I give my respect. Particularly obviously, the peace, the beauty and the spirit of the desert were illustrated, I never met such a close in any movie before. original books and atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay my tribute to the original Gray Owl.
