Note that I didn't say it's better ... just more enjoyable. The lack of social comments and realism helps keep things moving. after every murder, a ridiculous bathroom scene (which is kind of difficult to distract because the rapist is a snowman) and fools. <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman who is reported to have no legs or feet in the city rides a police cruiser. <br /> <br /> 2. Even if it should be near freezing (or below), no one shows a breath and there are no signs of car exhaust when driving cars. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds you of more flocking or polystyrene peanut than actual snow. <br /> <br /> 4. The teen girl gets her boyfriend a few hours after his brother's murder. He talks about breaking the sheriff house, all the places to get it. But first he tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open the wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After the Jake head cut off by a teenager, his father, with a sheriff, argues that Sheriff's son Tommy was involved. Sheriff says Tommy wouldn't have won with Jake, because Jake is at least two feet higher than Tommy. At this point, someone sounds in the background, "No more!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the snowman of the evil finally begins to melt, the sheriff's flat snowman, who is made of some kind of fabric for a long time, is wrestling. It's much better than wrestling Tarzan with gladiators with rubber crocodiles or stuffed lions. If I was an actor, I wouldn't have been able to keep a straight face at this point. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun movie. There's not so much blood there.
