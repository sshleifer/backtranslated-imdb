This is an interesting series that takes real people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes some of his real story with the character of a continuous series that is involved in this story. Rail Detective "Matt Clark" - participates in famous old western bird watch tracking stories based at least partially on real accounts. In this sense, it is almost an anthology series, and as someone else has pointed out, this bizarre structure creates some timelines that contradict real events, but it is a fun series with many steps to satisfy the Western hungry audience of the 1950s. 55 years later. Clark cuts a powerful figure in his Western gear as he rises against some bad bad in some history. And her girl-sidekick Frankie is quite a dish. If you're a western fan, be sure to check it out if you have the opportunity.
