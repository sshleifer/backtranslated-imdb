Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick, where she has been told by a local professor type that she has the power - she is trying to get her to read Nietzche- she says books have never made her not good.After all, we know her father is basically pimping she was local politics and others. Eventually he has had enough and moves to a big city. We follow our men's track on the ladder of international bank success. The dialogue is rather slow, and it was one of the last films to come out before the Hollywood product code it created. See the young John Wayne companion as the victims recommended by Stanwycki. The Forbidden Hollywood Collection - I Watched The Extended Version - The DVD has both versions and Red-Woman and Waterloo Bridge. An interesting movie and showing the future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck plays in the film's noir era. B +
