I grew up in Brazil and I visited and marveled at the beautiful coastline where the film was filmed. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "green coast" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film once again brings to life the 16th century Brazilian world, where Europeans hardly began to explore the coastline, which was still in a rich state and sparsely populated by various local tribes. The French and Portuguese fought for the territory and the Brazilian trade in timber, while negotiating with the indigenous people who fought each other for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> One French wrong ("a mercenary") has died by his compatriots, but manages to escape and is kept by all naked tribes. Although he is the "slave" of the commander, he has been allowed to live relatively comfortably for several months according to tribal practices until it is right that he is killed and eaten in a revenge ritual. What I love about this movie is that it recovers in the loving detail of the villages of the natives and their lifestyles (they walked naked and were cannibals) and ask us to feel and accept life in those times when it was: in a fantastic garden garden there was life dirty, violent, full of pathetic superstition and strange customs. Europeans reach and bring their problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. There are no romantic "noble savages" or "heroic discoverers", but people are trying to survive in a tough world. The film is neither too sympathetic nor abandoning the natives. From what I feel, the image is quite accurate, which adds to the uniqueness of the project: how many movies have you seen with the lives of Brazilian natives and their early Europeans?
