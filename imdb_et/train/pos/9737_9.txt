The amazing power of Simon Pegg, who gets better and better for every role. As usual, he plays a part of a very colorful character who sometimes wants to hide him behind his party, but what Pegg has is. <br /> <br /> The laughs were regular and eye-catching and all of them were aimed at Penn. The film was very cleverly assembled, where every character plays a very difficult and serious part, as Penn is the only humor that is a huge credit for Director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I can't let it go without a quick applause to Gilliam Anderson, who's always shining. Recommended for everyone.
