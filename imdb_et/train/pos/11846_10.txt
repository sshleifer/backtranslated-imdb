I liked this movie. The animation was well done and the romance was lovely. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and Hans Zimmer's score was great. Many people do not understand how well it is related to the heart of the darkness / apocalypse (what happens when the so-called civilization invades an elses, what is meant by "civilized" etc.). The open landscape and music were very confusing. The film is a regret to America, which was once beautiful.
