I was expecting it to be the same type of shock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, so I missed it for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Not far from foolish weapon battles and car / boat ride, it was almost a thoughtful analysis of how a beautiful girl becomes as hard as nails, but nothing is overestimated or over-rationalized. <br /> <br /> It is likely that budget constraints actually contributed to this: less time and effort was spent on finding ways for stuntmen to pretend, and more on watching the movie. Hell, the biggest battle of weapons, is on the bottom of the screen - and the scene where it is heard is better for background noise, which adds to the relationship - who has won? Who's Dying? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as fallen as Monica Vitti, but there are few, and she will definitely have every ounce of class and fire that is necessary for character work - and her face shape, hair and her long , a slender body could have been lifted straight from comic graphics. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was a great choice for Blaise's bad guy to make his character interesting and pleasant - even pleasant (and I doubt I would consider taking many brutal psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). I can't think of one of Hollywood's "former waiters" who could have pulled this role well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise's baddies always die (there's no spoiler there!) That's really a good thing, because all the girls who would have spent such a nasty and interesting hobby can now pragmatically solve our usual Joes.
