This movie is a rebellion. I don't remember the last time movies were so big. I've seen some good comedy in my time and usually they're pretty funny. But it's the big walls to the wall. I think Best in Show is the last movie I was so hard and so much laughing. The film was complete until the end, when they took to cleanse the sentimental plot. Except that it is a continuous one-liner and silly situation. I'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because it's like Zucker's movies, where you don't get all the jokes for the first time. You have to see it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> If the actual movie goes, it could have used better editing, it is sometimes time-consuming, but we must forgive it. All the characters are great. It's not like Adam Sandler's film, where he's trying to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of fun. I think I remember all the main characters for years, because they're all so happy. There are no victims in this movie. I also thank God for having a 45-year-old actor playing his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays with her and she's a sweetheart. You just want women like it really to exist. He's not "10" like some other leading women, but somehow his smile is warmer than Julia Roberts's overdite overdone. <br /> </p> I assure you that the trailer does not make it fair. They don't give away all the good jokes. Just some mediocre. <br /> <br /> And one more thing. I hope the critics will put it in their top ten. Many of them complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve, and then at the end of the year they do not put their list. That means Ebert !!!
