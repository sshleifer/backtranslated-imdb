The robot randomly sent some sailors to the space. And the ship's oxygen was short. They had to send someone to a space station to get gas tanks and so on. <br /> <br /> First, the plot of this movie is not possible in real life. But it gives all the possible warm feelings when you put your heart in. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see those young actors who still look at the same look after so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in 2000, filmed in 1986) There are still many people in this movie who are still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was excellent from space. It doesn't seem unrealistic. It's about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you don't even notice. You know it's not real, but you are breastfeeding to the end. <br /> <br /> It's generally a good family movie. <br /> <br />
