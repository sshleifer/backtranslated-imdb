I watched this movie once and I can watch it again, but even though Jamie Foxx is good in the film, I feel they could have used a "less funny" character like Alvin Sanders. Foxx scenes, for example, in prison, when he faces Edgar Clenne (David Morse), are too funny. David Morse is again a great cop. Its harsh but mostly silent features are perfect for fulfilling your role. Morse will meet again at Doug Hutchinson (Bristol). Morse gets to Hutchinson hard. Both films are perfect for this scenario. I personally love this quality in a movie where the actors get in the same position as the previous movie, as the two did in The Green Mile. In general, it was a pretty good movie.
