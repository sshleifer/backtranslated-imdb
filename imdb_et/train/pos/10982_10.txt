I found that Gray Garden is an appealing film, amazingly intimate <br /> <br /> too eccentric, who is basically the right idea: forget <br /> <br /> society and live in a sacred house with no heating and big cats and tombs that keep their interests on <br /> <br /> rather, while chatting with the camera. <br /> <br /> Great Edie and Little Edie are two griefs that Mazles Bros has decided to document. They look just like Fellin's movie, only a stranger if it makes sense. Old Edie is almost entirely linen, pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes. Little Edie is even more interesting. She takes care of the house and always carries her child's headband, which covers her hair completely. We <br /> <br /> don't see our hair throughout the movie and never get hints that it still has a lot. Fifty-eight, he's still beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> In the gardens of the halls, we feel that both women have become much less alive than they ever were. Little <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the saddest of the two. When her mother, married in her earlier years, made a family, she lived luxuriously and even made some recordings (scene where she sang for 77 years, br /> <br /> with "Tea for Two" recording , which he made decades ago, is one of the best scenes in movies). br /> model to take care of your heavy mothers. In the 58's he still wanted <br /> <br /> to find his prince charming. If something Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glamor and fame, homey and romantic <br /> <br /> bliss that is still unfulfilled. /> <br /> Highlights of the movie include opening moments, where Little <br /> <br /> Edie explains her dress to the camera, "make a two for a series", <br /> <br /> birthday party, climatic argument, grocery store <br /> <br /> Scene and scene in the attic. The whole thing is incredibly <br /> <br /> sincere and modest. What's more, it has become <br /> <br /> because it's all real. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing Greens Gardens upside down with Kenneth <br /> <br /> Anger's short Puce Moment. The Criterion DVD is $ 35.00, but it's worth every penny.
