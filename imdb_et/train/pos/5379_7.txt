There are a lot of murders in college girls. The crazy scientist creates almost unidentifiable toxic gas. Before he benefits from his discoveries, the scientist kills the whip with a whip-welding monk. After the gas has died in the congregation, Scotland Yard is invited to investigate, but the killing continues. Who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go when he wants to go in and out of college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> Killer. What doesn't like a murderer slipping with a bright red FAQ with red gloves. The white whip she's wearing and using is very different from the bright yellow dress. Though the idea that the killer is in a burning red, witty dress that slides around the girl's school is quite far removed, this one has seen most of the joyful costumes. <br /> <br /> Groovy 60s Music. I really would like to watch the title music for the murderers of college girls. It has jazz, hip, 60s feel like I just loved. <br /> <br /> - Bizarre Touches. In addition to the killer's red dress and hood, the film has a sliding fireplace, a hole in alligators with a cage transfer, a poison spray with bibles, a strategically positioned mannequin, mini-skirts, go-go boots and miles. I would describe it as a cross between the 60s Batman TV show and the Italian giallo. College Girl's murders are a real treat for the eye. <br /> <br /> - End. Let's just say there are more turns than a mountain road. Just when you think the killer is uncovered, is there a twist here and another? and the other ?? and the other ?? and the other. <br /> <br /> What doesn't work: <br /> <br /> Inspector General Sir John. I know the boy was supposed to be a comic relief, but his buffering character is too much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> - Why are Alligators? Previously I mentioned alligators in the mine. And while they are a nice touch, they serve very little purpose. Why go through all the trouble and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some college murders have no flow or rhythm. There are too many moments throughout the film when things come inexplicably to stop. A better pace would have made this a much more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a lot of these German crimes, but I saw a few (Soho phantom, stranger of Blackmoor Castle, dead eyes) This may be my favorite. It's a real funky feeling that I really go. If the plot was a little better, I could have easily given the college girls murder 7/10.
