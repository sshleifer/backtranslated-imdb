One of the first OVA ("original video animation") I've ever bought must be one of my favorite anime titles. Cyberpunk sci-fi action against comedy is unlikely (comedy, that is, against the background of pollution in the near future in a dystopian society). <br /> <br /> Dominion's "heroes" are the tank police, formed by "if we can't win the crime, get bigger weapons" philosophy, and who, as the name suggests, patrol the tanks of the city, rather than patrol cars, and who is actually much more dangerous than any criminals they try to catch. Most, if not all, of these police officers are borderline (?) Psychopaths and neurotics that give a new meaning to the phrase "open cannons". <br /> <br /> Equally colorful and fun are their opponents, terrorist Buaku and his hench (wo) men, Twin Cat Sisters, whose presence always seems to be related to the heavy tank police. <br /> <br /> Animation is not modern, but otherwise it's great; The colorful palette of characters and mecha and the cartoon look fit well with Dominion's comic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Copying English again is fun. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I don't know if they've ever made this album ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great. It is a Japanese cyberpunk SF, which has a lot of comedy, full of ultimate characters and situations, ensuring that it never takes itself seriously. Highly recommended.
