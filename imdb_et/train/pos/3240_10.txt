I found this movie mistakenly many years ago and then thought (still) why he didn't get that recognition. A well-written, beautiful actor, one ironic twist after another and it is CAUSAL about what the embarrassing characters are trying to do. I do not recommend this movie to people with short attention; it requires sufficient intelligence to understand that the story can be the core of truth.
