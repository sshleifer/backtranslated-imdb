No, it shouldn't be a high budget shine, but it is great. You have to see it for what it is, a low-budget masterpiece that includes a 12-inch love rod zombie rapist to keep an eye on. those who gave this film probably looked for the next cult classic or hidden "pearl" as they say and just didn't get here. I love how everyone draws attention to the obvious observations, such as "5 cents a child who is not a fish", hahaha, yes, yes. I don't think a movie with such a budget could allow "good" actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. the guts and guts were actually very convincing. the film was a little dirty, from the sequence, but in general it is one of the best films I've seen recently, not following any trend or predictability. very good laugh.
