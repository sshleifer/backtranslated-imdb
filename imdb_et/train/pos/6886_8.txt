This is unlike other movies, the closest thing I can compare is Woody Allen's movie ... But where Woody Allen is constantly in front of human animals, it seems Bret Carr is trying to figure out how to cope with one of the crippling uncertainties that tend to us better or worse. In the case of Lou, this is the root cause of his beating, which may be due to a single grandchild's trauma that occurs with a flash. <br /> <br /> There are so many strange neurotic people. the world and I believe they all deserve redemption, though the diversity of human nature is what makes the world such an intriguing place, so we should no longer confirm our neurosis when we should fix our noses or breasts. /> <br /> This is an indie film made on a long shoe, but the production values ​​are enormous, like the size of the film. It seems to me that this is a peculiar Gem for a selfish market. I really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker is following, I could imagine a career along Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, though usually when such a boy goes through, he goes out and makes "X MEN" and his humble exotic will soon forget the origin or are they ... X Men are a bunch of heaps if I remember correctly :)
