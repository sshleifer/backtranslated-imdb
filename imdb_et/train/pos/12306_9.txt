The Chinese ghost story marks late, the great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, a taxpayer who decides to stay in an abandoned temple where she meets and falls under the name of a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost who is forced to lure the victims to the spirit of the evil tree that feeds the "chi" (vitality), he decides to try and release the girl by continuing to give him the right burial. Helping the nickname of the soldier, Swordsman Yin (Wu ma), Ling successfully links the spirit of the tree, but must also fight against hell against the black of the Lord for whom Tsing is intended. <br /> <The first Hong Kong movie I saw that was not purely martial arts, China Ghost Story opened my eyes to the incredible world of fantastic horror in Asia, the magical world where beautiful women live, haunting innocent heroes, sword Taoist monks, monsters spirits and keeping the dark lords of the underworld; I immediately loved the greatness of the film, energy, humor, ingenuity and visual excellence. <br /> <br /> Two decades later and this amazing movie is still one of the best examples of the genre I've seen? a proud, breathtaking masterpiece that perfectly combines horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. Excellent direction from Siu-Tung Ching, excellent editing by David Wust, stunning cinematography and all-imaginary special effects (including humongous killer tongue, lots of tentacled monsters and several flying heads!) A totally unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end.
