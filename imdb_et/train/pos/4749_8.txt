I really enjoyed this movie and it was a little hard to do if your brother makes stupid comments in this 30 seconds. But the movie I enjoyed was mostly because I'm used to traditional HK action movies. Most of these movies don't look at this story, look at it for meaningless action. And meaningless action is right. You see Jet Li jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. It is true that this film appeared to a wider audience after Li was a deadly weapon 4. This is one of the reasons why the ratings of this film fell. Most people had probably been waiting for a movie that was as polished as the North American film. But remember that most HK movie budgets are not nearly as high as the North American movie, and the HK action style is usually very different, so most of them need wires. If you want to see a good action film, you should simply try to ignore it. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
