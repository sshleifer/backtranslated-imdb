I saw Soyl Green back in 1973 when it was first released, and maybe eight more years later by T.V. or video. It was always one of my favorite sci-fi and / or Charlton Heston films. <br /> <br /> Recently, L.A. Twelve movies by Charlton Heston on Egyptian theater. I flew out of the country to see six movies in two days. Soylent Green showed a great Egyptian screen with a great new print. From the opening to the end of the ongoing film, the film was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston, a policeman who lives in a dog that eats dogs with little natural resources in the world and does not understand how the world was before, and Eddie Robinson, a man reminiscent of the past, is so great. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry is great together. In the film, the 35 mm print also looks so much better. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, cinematography, writing, used music and all that. The film is also a very powerful future for the future. Just think about how the world's population grew, lost rainforests, resources used, the greenhouse effect deepens since 1973. I just don't know why this movie hasn't been played in theaters during those years. Its reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of reputation, people often talk like Charlton Heston is not a big actor. I see him back in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, the Omega-man, Will Penny and Major Dundee back, I'm sure he's one of our best actors. Of course he made about ten other good films and for those who care, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
