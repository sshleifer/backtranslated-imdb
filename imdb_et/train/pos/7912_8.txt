These things have been on my head for about 10 years. Some pieces of this work were really memorable. - Id love to see another current example of cg showy offy stuff. Actually, I would like to be part of it. <br /> <br /> If I had been able to just say what I wanted and that is, I shouldn't write it all down to "10 lines, if the text", as the Web site requires. I really mean? It almost pushes me back, luckily for the filmmakers who really liked the Minds Eye - and it took 3 times for me to have enough lines, I hope you can't write me wrong. - You did.
