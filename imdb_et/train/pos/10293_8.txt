Bruce Almighty wins Academy awards with a record 14 Oscar! It exceeds "Titanic" as the highest film ever! Jim Carrey's illustriousness is at the highest level that he announces his presidential candidate in the 2004 White House. Almighty then! These great fantasies would only appear if the filmmakers (including Carrey) had the authority of God. This same assumption is the most important ingredient in Carrey's new laughing "Bruce Almighty". Carrey plays a television reporter, Bruce Nolan, who is so obsessed with being the main anchor that keeps God completely at fault for his contradictions. God, Morgan Freeman's heavenly play, gives Bruce a "gift of God" (his authority) to challenge him if he can do better the work of God. Obviously, Bruce gets away with his renewed blessed faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his usual all-powerful comedy "Bruce Almighty". Jennifer Aniston was not "mis.pittiful" as Bruce's girlfriend. But my premier weave goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not giving the dog out of house # 2 and showing us the most fun comic bathroom all the time. "Bruce Almighty" is not the deepest Carrey movie, but it is still the almighty "Carreyism" exhibition. **** Good
