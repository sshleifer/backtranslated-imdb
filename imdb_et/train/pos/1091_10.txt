I loved this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 20 years old (which was only four years ago) and I enjoyed it so much that I brought my copy the next day. Comedy is well played by all involved. I always have to rewind and rewrite the scene, where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found 6 feet of water in one area and 227 feet in another. See also Jason Robards' father who plays Mr. Retch. Talent ran in this family.
