Three horrors based on members of transgressive Hindu culture who return home, but somehow changed. At first reading, our former cult member is now in a crazy shelter and is visited by a reported person who wants to know what the cult went on. Somewhat slow as the story goes down in the setback when two sit on chairs and face each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what leads to the death of the participants. What seemed quite boring would suddenly become a very exciting story with surprise. Things get pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> Another story is a violent young criminal who visits a psychiatrist for compulsory treatment. The patient seems to have some kind of agenda, but it is the psychiatrist's job. Again things slow down a bit and weird. Then there is a story that is very well written and surprisingly strange. <br /> <br /> The final story deals with a spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove their hands from their illnesses. One of the patients is a former cult member, so successful healing becomes more complicated. Again, we are surprised by the twists. There's a pretty tough scene. <br /> <br /> There's some nice female female, as well as full front nudity for some reason. I found that the stories are very well written and the director is able to fully build every story for his surprising twist and gentle aftermath.
