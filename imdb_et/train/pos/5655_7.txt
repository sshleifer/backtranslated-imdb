I looked at this example on the basis that it says it reminds David Lynch of the Twin Pea - an example I adore. The exhibition is about to introduce the main characters and the unusual pilot episode is the best batch for me, its extremely dramatic and really out of the show's evil that is ready to move throughout the season. My biggest criticism is that I felt that the show had fallen a little - probably not because of my fault, because it was canceled after only one season, it seemed to show great potential and it deserved much better treatment than it received. The exhibition is great, and this exhibition has some of the best characters (good and evil) I've ever seen and well developed in the short term. The first five or ten exhibitions, which are a bit too dramatic, have a strange cheese effect, but as the season progresses, it is corrected. Well worth a look, definitely something ordinary!
