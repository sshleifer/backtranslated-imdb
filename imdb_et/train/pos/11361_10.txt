Although I saw this movie a year ago, I never missed that effect. Stephen Rea depicts the inverter deeply and moves. His torture for stopping deaths is felt. All the cast persons are astonishing at Sutherland, who is trying to accommodate him and provide the police with opportunities to coordinate their efforts with anxious citizen x. Every day, when we are bombarded with massacre stories, I mean the film and the exhausting work that people are trying to find killers.
