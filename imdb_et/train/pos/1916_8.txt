"8 DETAILED RULES ... I DO DUGHTER" is my absolute ABC class! I'm not sure I have seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say what episode was my favorite. But I think it was always funny when the accident happened. I've always laughed. Even though James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked to show more than John Ritter was a leading man. When you ask me, his sudden passing was very tragic. Everyone always gave good results, production design was remarkable, costumes were well designed and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some networks will bring fans back to this show.
