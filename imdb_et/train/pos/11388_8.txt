When I remember, the Iranian lyric and brother Ira Gershwin offered the Gershwin catalog for this movie and the producers got it. In many aspects, it was typical of the 50-year-old Freed Unit musical instrument in MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli, who had a lot of help from Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gershins was one of the biggest Broadway music groups, but I think George was one of America's greatest composers, a period !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two biggest dancers in the film's music (I think the other?) And I can't imagine that her casting was never a doubt. But I think the rest needs an explanation: Oscar Levant had noticed his personality of his time and, as a true friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in the film. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer, as well as observed neurotic and hypocondriac, and here, as always, he plays himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was a currently unknown French "gamin" type. A talented dancer, he was never a true beauty. George Guétary, who plays the part of Maurice Chavalier, is a victim, I mean Henri Baurel, Greek and not French, but he's definitely more than OK than the French boulevardier, even if that part is too small. <br /> <br /> The voice of the Gene hoof is usable here, but Guétary has much better vocal equipment. Although Gene was better poured elsewhere than obviously "Singin in the Rain", where his character is much more compelling, he even shows that he is occasionally a beard. The original heel of Joey Palway, Broadway music.) I was not so fascinated by his "I Got Rhythm" with children who do not seem spontaneous, as I thought it was. <br /> <br /> I also found the character of Nina Fochi Milo, which is quite irritating. <br /> <br /> The highlighting of the film is probably a long-term ballet at the end of the film, based on the title music, with sets and costumes of great French impressionist artists. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me to believe Gene and the Oscar as fighting artists, and I don't think that the musical number is as well created as possible but balanced, Gershwin's music is very well served in this movie. <br /> <br /> DVD is well thought out and clear graphics (if any are assumed) and mono sound is good but small.
