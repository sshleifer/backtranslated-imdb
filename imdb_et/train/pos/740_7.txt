"Foxes" have a serious look at the consequences of growing too fast in the 1980s. And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the film rises well with time. <br /> <br /> The topic of serving him is as important today as 25 years ago, and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (remember him?) lead a fine young person to aching, which is worth a look. <br /> <br /> The film follows four South California girls as they move through sex and have no drug roots. without parents. Teenagers spend their days in and out of school and their nights at a party, concert or street. Yet they are at home because of the immediate joy of being a pill, party or boy. <br /> <br /> But instead of condemning them, the film is sympathetic, accusing the absence, adults who don't want to grow teenagers alone. And charismatic casting is impossible to deny. <br /> <br /> Opening a movie ?? long and loving pan - sets the tone as follows. We see that girls sleep at sunset between objects that define teenage girls, from Twinkies to a young John Travola picture, while Donna Summer's "On the Radio" is below. <br /> <br /> From there, the movie accelerates when girls go to school and live. Annie (Runaway rocker Cherie Currie) is a wild child who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is the boy's crazy drama queen. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is a shy girl over her head. And Foster has a plan. It's his job to keep this team long enough to finish high school graduation while he has divorced and desperate husband's hunting mother (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> This is an almost impossible job and what Foster finally fails at. <br /> <br /> Despite its age, "Foxes" is a joy to watch. Dried hair, clothes, and references to Olympic player Dorothy Hamill have not hurt the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is just stunning, amazing, filtered, and L.A. with pool shots at dawn, twilight and night. Giorgio Moroder adds an 80's soundtrack that includes stories like Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment in this movie is that the young stars surrounding Foster do not end up as "St. Elmo Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should have. But maybe, like Bowling for Soup's song "1985", they just hit the wall.
