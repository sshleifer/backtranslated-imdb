Unlike many other movies that interfere with either Man Bites Dog or their violent violence (most of Peckinpah's films), Deliverance's shock is credible. Certainly, trickery is quite easy in its nuisance, but the effect of the film is much more due to its slow build-up and tangible separation that surrounds the four leaders, both before and after everything goes wrong. The moment when a canoe moves under a child under the bridge, who does not even recognize the previous men with whom he played music, not to mention that they showed any signs of these people, is one of the most severe of the most modern films. Tensions are constantly increasing throughout the canoe and lasting after the last credit - the end makes the characters meaningful. The credibility of the film is greatly influenced by the play of leaders, especially Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as a victim and a reluctant hero. Also Burt Reynolds has never been better. The cultural impact of the film is demonstrated by the number of people who understand the reference to “banjo territory” - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet job in the tourism industry in the area. I mean just a handful of movies that put me in such a serious depression after they finished - Se7en's oppressive atmosphere is the best comparison. While so much of it is great, Deliverance is classic, especially because it doesn't have enough reference points - it's unique.
