MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the final fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius because he is not just a filmmaker. Her stories and her style are a spell that goes beyond the screen. So STRAIGHT STORY was quite surprising to me, its easy to follow story and sunshine. However, Lynch is there, and although it is far from his best, it is not a movie that should not be missed. The recent result of Richard Farnsworth is one reason. <br /> <br /> 8/10
