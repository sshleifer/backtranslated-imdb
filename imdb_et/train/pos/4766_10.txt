It is unusual to see a movie where the performance of one actor is so good that it may feel that the film would not be interesting, if any, at all. <br /> <br /> Despite the prominent direction - there are actually many scenes that seem to have been shot too fast and carelessly - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot for a man who wants to pick up a priest and another week, Pierre's presence Fresnay is so impressive that someone gets shocked from the beginning to the end of the dread. <br /> <br /> I have never seen iomagine and could not achieve a better result in the future, even Paul Scofield, who works for "All Seasons of the Year". In fact, the end can even be considered ridiculous if Fresnay did not play a church returning returns to church. <br /> <br /> "Je suis Maurice Morand, prètre catholique" ("I'm a Maurice Morand, Catholic priest") is said to be so brilliant that you can forget the crazy Another impressive thing about this movie is the only scene where Morand - who, despite being split, is a girl's priest - Gérard, a man who wants to go back to Morandi's church or replace him, has a lot of wine growing in the cabaret - he has to drink it if he doesn't want to leave that cabaret. He does this in the midst of joy and people who think he is just drinking three of the four wine-growing. <br /> <br /> The next scene is also a remarkable dialogue between Morand and Garbage Collection. "Do you guys too?" asks Morand who hates himself for what he just did. "That would be too much work" is a smart answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is not worth commenting on, but it is definitely worth it because there is a very strong and strange emotion all the time. I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange film, but all the viewers have to see it - if it's a good Catholic, it's a must - because it's a very rare jewell in film history. <br /> <br />
