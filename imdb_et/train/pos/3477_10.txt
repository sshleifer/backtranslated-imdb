some people think the second series was where scooby was destroyed. I totally disagree. shows that quality did not go up or down and hit, win my opinion, because a very good chrecter.i looked at the poll jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said the second series was a scoobys drop. but 28% still can't be wrong. I like most episodes that focused on comedy. the same 5 people / dog solves the mystery in the same formula. scrappy was a show.sure fresh air breath, some people voted but when they started to look at the numbers DOUBLED. Back to the show.All episodes and segments were very funny. I was intriguded yabba shorts and .But at the end of the day this is the opinion, if you like to split or not, is the opinion question, certainly not a fact. But in my OPINION, it was a wonderful line that gave the tire a new formula and life for rent.
