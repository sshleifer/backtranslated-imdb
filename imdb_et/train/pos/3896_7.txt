Some people loved "aristocrats" and others hated, often walking in the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard are unlikely to be so extreme - if you can cope with a transvestite comedian (who says she likes girls) and has vocabulary that makes her program use the word "f". it would be one long beep when it was broadcast on television. Many Izzardi fans are so committed to see no mistakes in their performances. On the other hand, I thought this exhibition was occasionally more straightforward than Izzard's chest, but also more often than funny and at times totally fun. He has the opportunity to combine references to the routine at the beginning of his exhibition to his later routines. He's not a narrator. He's not a joke maker. He's not a silly fantasy like Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work, some of which - for example, the San Francisco funicular and the routine with Alcatraz - are completely uncomfortable. However, it has the ability to move gently over floppy routines and expand those that unite. I gave this show to 7 and could be persuaded to raise it to 8th. Not possible.
