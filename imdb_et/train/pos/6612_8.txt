Just like Final Fantasy brought CG to a whole new level, it is a revival of the capture of movement. Neither film nor film, this film looks like respect for Film Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of cartoonists in Europe. You see Paris almost as it could be, the characters seem as real as you and me. They are flashing, traveling, trembling like real actors in a way that has never been achieved before. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it to find the twister of the mind. You'll probably find it out before you are halfway through the movie. This scenario is certainly too simplified compared to famous thrillers, but it is a blessing of the eyes.
