Although there are no new episodes and it has rarely been shown. I loved Sabrina's magic and teenage witch. I could never see the latest episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why didn't the aunts disappear well from the show? I'm sure the end was perfect. But there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the latest episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard that he decided on his wedding day between Erin and Harvey! I hope he picks Harvey! And I can say that Nate Richart is HOTT !! Too bad is too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own vision of what she adds to the show, but there are a lot of "stupid" things for the show, such as how famous bands come out and play songs, and all the cast is heard, this kind of stupid. In addition, the cat is really flat when the show goes on, the jokes just started to fool and the things the "audiences" who sound-controlled would laugh, I think it was so flat. Don't get me wrong, in some places it was funny, but I think the exhibition lost its "magic" so that the exhibition went. I give the testimony to everyone, even though Soleil Moon Frye's girl was no taste and she was a terrible actor. I don't know what Melissa is or what's doing it right now, when the show is over.
