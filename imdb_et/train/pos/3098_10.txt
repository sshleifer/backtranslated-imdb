I loved this example so much and I'm so sadly sad that I thought it came back, but only two stupid weeks. It's terrible. I hate how we never know how everything is going. it sucks. Bring it back! ABC has foolish exhibitions like Supernanny, and that doesn't give time for good, like six degrees. When they complained about the complaints, it was probably because they had a bad nest because it was a really good show, something I could associate and expect. JJ Abrams edited, he's awesome, I want ABC to trust him enough to complete the story. I also loved the whole cast. I couldn't wait to see everyone meeting in one day. Everyone's story is now incomplete, now I never know if Steven and Whitney will get together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else. It's really such a drop.
