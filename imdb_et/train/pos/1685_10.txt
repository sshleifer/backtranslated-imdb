First I saw this movie around 1990 and died through it. It became a favorite of my friends' circle of culture, and we would quote it in a hood ("I'm going home!"). Needless to say, humor is still 15 years later. During Halloween it has become a tradition to expose many of my new friends to this movie (the good thing you still buy out of eBay). I found that Halloween candy tastes your tongue firmly planted in your cheek. this film gives him all-sins, midnight, uneven love, nobility and the list goes on. The Royal Dano gives a wonderful heartfelt presentation like the Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing her as "Dr. Lao 7 on the face" as a halban who met bad. Here you feel right now for an old man. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will get out of this movie with humor. In many ways, the creators got a real fine commentary, a small fine costume mining for other sci-fi movies and even a scene ripped from Wile E. Coyote's pages! <br /> <br /> Also, don't spend a lot of thinking on trying to analyze the movie, people - it's a fun price without the need for nitpick and shouldn't be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they don't know they are being mocked) . <br /> <br /> -Now, if you apologize, I'm going to get a "Zag nut" bar .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / entertainer
