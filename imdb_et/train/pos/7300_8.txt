Like the gentle giants who make up the second part of this movie, Michael Oblowitz's latest production is grace, but it's also slow and pointless. The manufacturer's last exit "Mosquitoman-3D" was the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow guided it. The only drawing for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was a satisfying animatronix that is always fun when you deal with the wonderful world under the ocean. But even this was satisfactory. The bad focus in some scenes showed that production seems amateurish. For dolphins and whales, technology is all but wastage. Cloudy scenes and oversized close-ups of the film's huge themes don't make IMAX's stunning 3D capabilities. There are too few scenes with any depth or variety. Close-ups of these fantastic beings are simply viewed flat and often there is only one creature in the camera field, so there is no contrast of depth. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow his father's footsteps, but if you have a cable Shark week, his internal and boring treatment is his constant disappointment.
