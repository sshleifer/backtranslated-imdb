"Dragonlord" sees Chani's return to the "dragon" role of "The Young Master". However, the first film has not gone a long way. "Tiger," his older brother, is nowhere to be seen; Marshall, his daughter, or his son, also played perfectly in the original film by Yuen Biao. The dragon has the same captain, although all other students have moved on to other things. (The dragon's laziness in training is very strong in this movie, so maybe he's still learning!) <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Young Master in Love", this movie sees Dragon (at least 60 minutes) village girl in various idiots and insidious ways. His rival to his affection is his friend (inappropriately called "Cowboy") played by the comic Mars, a longtime member of the Chan Stunt team. We see different scenes where their stupid schemes come back. This is one of those scenes that we (fortunately) are looking for "Dragon" over his head. <br /> <br /> This movie is known as not meeting expectations in the box office. Nevertheless, I am sure that the expectations were quite high and I feel that this film has never had an honest decision based on its own achievements. But even if I try, I still feel there are problems with the film. It seems rather vague, sometimes in a hurry, and I think this action is too casual and not as brilliant as Chan's second work of that period. <br /> <br /> What really captures the movie is the final sequence. Like the "Young Master", there is a fantastic final roll full of incredibly exhausting activities - every shot you really feel. And again, Chan will rise to the same rival with a young master (is it the same character?) And the timing and energy here is great. Chani-style use your environment to help your opponent win - not just based on pure physical ability - as visible as anywhere else. The camp they fight is full of smart little prophets and improvisations. This is the absolute highlight of the film and one of Chani's incredible career. <br /> <br /> Prequel does not need to be seen before Dragonlord is seen, as it may even raise more questions than what it expects to answer. But it has to be said that the original film is the ultimate film and "Dragonlord", which focuses on girls and team traffic, seems overwhelmed. Fortunately, a couple of struggles in the scene (plus a fantastic shuttle-cock-scene) push this line over the pattern as a film.
