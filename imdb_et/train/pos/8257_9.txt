I just saw Fido's world prize at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it thoroughly. Here we have a welcome redesigned genre that George Romero has widely believed to be at the forefront (certainly "broader and more successful"). But this is a Canadian film made by the Canadian leader and it's a comedy! And YES, I think it's better than "dead Shawn". Dilan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray, who I suspect we will see much more in the future, will be thoroughly credible and perhaps even more important. However, I have to admit that I enjoyed Tim Blake's Nelson delicious move to the neighbor Mr. Theopol, playing the essence of Victor Van Dort's animation version of Corpse Bride (or for those who saw the film, wouldn't want to). t, which read even better here than Corpse Pride?) and of course, Scotch actor Billy Connolly in his least animated but somehow deeply moving role as the character of the title. Consider that he would not have been given this role if Peter Stormare's obligations to Prison Break had not been (as evidenced by the screening on Thursday evening). I can't speculate in any way that the scriptwriters have got a lot of inspiration from the dead day of Zombie 'Bub. Suffice it to say that Fido is not one of those dour, graphically, of the movies you can rely on from Romero. Rather, it is a movie that is constantly laughing at you, and although (and I have to think carefully to be sure) there is a fair dose of blood and violence, the cheerful humor that surrealism improves by creating the director Currie and his co-scriptwriters goes a long way to make it look like a feature that should be PG-13. I invite you to look at this little canuck pearl. Be sure to buy a DVD when I hope it will be released next summer.
