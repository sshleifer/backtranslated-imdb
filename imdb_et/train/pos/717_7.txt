great fan of Ramones. I like ramoons, and I think if you hate them, it may not be an avid Bush supporter, but you may not like this classic. <br /> <br /> This is tremendously better than happy john hughes teenage movies and like this 80s garbage. endlessly better than the American pie that is breaking us now. <br /> <br /> There are other great high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., '84 Class, Three O'Clock High and cheesy more catchy (doesn't seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS is always my favorite because it is the most fun and fun plus, you can get along with it and dance. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
