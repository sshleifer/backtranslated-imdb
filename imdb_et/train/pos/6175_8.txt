I saw that pilot when it was first shown, and I'm sure countless "Spirit" fans hate it because, like Batman, Green Hornet, etc., he took a "camp". But I've probably never got enough from Batman because I thought it was fun in the same way as this show. There are two parts to me. First, when Denny's partner is deadly wounded and makes a dramatic speech about how she always stood up for the law and the exact letter. Then he says something, "Boy, was I stupid!" What's his way of saying that Denny instead gets the vigilant he's doing (though the Batman TV). Then, there is a scene where he tries to attract the villainess to let him go, kissing him, but he's not deceived because he's too honest to kiss him convincingly! It was a great example of a "camp" that was both an actor and an actor "undervalued".
