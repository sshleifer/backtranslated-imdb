I found this movie to be charming. I thought the characters were developed after I looked, I found myself taking care of those people. This is a periodic piece that, in my opinion, occurred during depression. A single mother, known as a city party (she has a reason to be), puts the advertisement on the "spouse" paper. Christopher Reeve plays ex-coni who is going to work in the city. She sees the ad and she goes out to see her. He hires him. I really had some smiles as their relationship progressed because I found it easy to put on their shoes. Everything went so seriously. She needs a job so she doesn't want to disturb her. And he needed help but didn't want him to get his upper hand. They are dancing around to really need each other. Things start to warm up to ...... to a great quench. I'm not going to break it when I tell you what happens. But the resolution point is absolutely wonderful. I found this story very credible at the time of its occurrence. I think this is one of the best "relationships". Maybe the younger generation can't do it, but if you're over 40, I think you like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve's "Somewhere in Time", then you like it too.
