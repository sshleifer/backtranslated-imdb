This is one of the best Jodie Foster movies out there and is largely ignored because the public's misunderstanding about it is like a flick. It's wonderful performances, especially the fight between Jodie and her mother, played by convincing Sally Kellerman. Three girls playing Jodie's friends are somewhat amateurish, but I think it's worth it.
