For Ralph Bakshi, most of his films are similar to two-edged swords. You get something fantastic about it, but only if you put it in a stupid and unnecessary bladder. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story that may not always shine in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and ice is a great achievement for Baksh from an animation point of view. Rotoscoping is much more detailed and animation is lively. You still have some dull cells and some blurry background paintings, but Bakshi's last fantasy epic is definitely better than all over. The animation has an almost realistic-naturalistic style for this and, unlike the LOTR, where this style was often in conflict with the actual content, it improves the film's unique atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie fails to make a meaningful story about its simple setup and, in fact, most of the characters have a rather vague motivation. Lorn and Tigra are mild cases, but even the main cable Necron was difficult to follow, not to mention that Guy with a hairy face mask (also known as "this man"). While most of the voice artists were relevant, there are some strange letters in the audio department, and Tigra sounds especially when she screams. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the natural entertainment value of a film will outweigh the foolish filling of the plot line. The little clapping of characters is something you will never get over, but it will help you recall that even though this movie is not going to be taken too seriously. It's still cool and funny.
