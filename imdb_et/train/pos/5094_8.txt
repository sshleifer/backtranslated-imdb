If you are squeezed, don't waste your time - otherwise keep your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerri - I've seen it a dozen times, but this movie is just as good, just different. I don't specify the differences because it would break the film. It's also a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a big Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain and supportive cast is great. I think the quality of casting supported is one of Hallmark Production's brands and this film was no exception. The cinema is excellent and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment then you will not be disappointed.
