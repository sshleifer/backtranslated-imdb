This low budget erotic thriller with some good points but much worse. The plot is reversed by a female lawyer who is trying to get her lover accused of murdering his wife. Being a soft-core film, which means she's going to a secret striptease club and having sex with potential suspects. Like the plots of this type of genre, not bad. The script is okay, and the story makes sense for someone in the 2nd century looking at not too much plot holes being observed. But everything else in the movie seems cheap. Leading actors are not so bad, but almost all supporters are incredibly bad (one girl seems to be drunk and / or high). Cinematic art is poorly lit, everything is sharp and ugly. Sound is so terrible that you hardly hear what people are talking about. The worst thing about this movie is why you watch this sex. The reason people watch these things is for hot sexual scenes with very hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations. Sexual scenes are not hot because they are stupid to hit a porn style where everyone is just a masterpiece of two people. She also looks at how they are shelters. I don't want to be rude or thoughtless here, but they all have this kind of breast implants and burned / weatherproof look. Even the title "Deviant Obsession" sounds like a Hardcore flick. Not that I have nothing to do with porn - I really love it. But I want my soft core and my hard core to be separate. What happened to actors like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who could act and who would awaken you completely? And what happened to B erotic thriller like Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Of course, none of them contain masterpieces, but at least they felt the movies. In addition, they pushed the envelope over Hollywood's relatively bridal attitude towards sex, sexual obsessions and perversions. Now they make hard-core movies without hard-core sex.
