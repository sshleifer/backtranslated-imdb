This film is a short masterpiece of cinema. The movie is moved perfectly with intense images that move the sensitive viewer deeply. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War, when a group of children is looking for another revenge. In fact, they work out a version of what they have seen in their surrounding adult world. Later, we meet these three children again in the sanatorium as adults. Here we see what life has done for each of them. One is a sexually repressed patient. The other man is in a hospital that has become ill. The third child, the young lady, has become a nun and serves in a sanatorium. This film is an allegory of the impact of violence on the psyche. Operation is great and the script is pretty well written. There is a musical score that gives this film a fear. It is not for people who are thrilled by the film, but for the thoughtful audience of the film.
