Most of the people who have seen this movie think it is a film they've ever made. I disagree, but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad ass and knows he's scaring and using it. It's about him and how his laundry runs across the table with a big house and a cocaine office. If you want a family movie, then this is not the way to go, but if you want mobsters and vengeance and such things then you like it.
