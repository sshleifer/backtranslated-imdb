What a nice movie ... <br /> <br /> The lush, emotional and dreamy music of the Oscar-winning composer RACHEL PORTMAN is the pure joy of the film, worth watching more than once a year. <br /> <br /> Incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for Emma's role. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The movie that stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! He was mesmerizing to watch, one finds himself on the edge of the seat just hanging on his every word and laughing hysterically with him. One of the most pleasant characters I've ever met. From one opening scene when he thanks Mr Woodhouse for this "cute quarter-back pork ... PORK, MOTHER !!!" she screams at her mother, Mrs Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law), who sees herself lost and lost. itself, if it is a picnic for one true intestinal scene, when Emma insults Miss Bates, who takes her cruel well into her heart. Then we see the poor beating Miss Bates and on the edge of tears and just so broken cannot help but feel her heart has been riddling in her name. It's a classic scene, one reversal and over and over playing ... <br /> <br /> The end is where Sense & Sensibility is, and one of the greatest lessons in life, how should a best friend marry ... <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will delight you as much as it is. <br /> <br /> RECOMMENDED THIS!
