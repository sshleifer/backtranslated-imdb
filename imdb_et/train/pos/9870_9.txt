With a relatively low budget for a $ 60 million animated film, Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done incredible work. <br /> <br /> They have combined the casting of modern digital animation, the cast of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a very entertaining, family movie with a strong message of collaboration, friendship and care for their other herd members. And sometimes it takes a lot of different creatures to form a herd. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I received a strong political message about communicating with people in my room - maybe it should be viewed by all the world leaders! <br /> <br /> David Newman, another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers, provides an excellent score that is not intrusive, but also contributes to the movement of the action and is sometimes a positive toe to the toe. <br /> <br /> The overall appearance of the movie is incredible; intensely dyed, strangely believable fantasy and snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. Individual characters were also convincingly convincing because the facial expressions of Ray Romano 'Manfred' were particularly healing. <br /> <br /> The entire sequence with DoDos leaves no doubt as to where the expression 'Dumb as DoDo comes from. '<br /> <br /> This is a good family film that keeps things that can distract or scare the kids pretty much disinfected, but still true. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie to see in the theater and buy at home.
