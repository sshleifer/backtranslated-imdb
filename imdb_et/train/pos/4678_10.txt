I decided to watch this movie at Tribeca, based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen, and found it to be one of the best films in the festival. Both leading parties give a well-rounded, sensitive result that seems to be in line with the personal level. The director did an excellent job of bringing characters and story to life with skills that are not usually seen for the first time. <br /> <br /> One interesting aspect of this movie is woodwork and New York's love. (Brooklyn). The film revolves around making and recognizing family furniture and knitting cinematography for both carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life? again, the director bowed to this good choice. <br /> <br /> This is a pearl and I would recommend it with all my heart (I'm sure it will do it on the screen).
