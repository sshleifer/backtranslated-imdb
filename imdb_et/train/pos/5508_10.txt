The Year is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who has been a Cuban citizen for the past five years, disappears from the Earth, leaving Fidel Castro audible that he is probably dead when he actually left Cuba to move to Bolivia to live the presumed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara's idea is to overthrow the corrupt, civic government there. Again, Steven Soderberg repeats "Che: Part One" (right only this time). Stimulation is more targeted, the actor's work is always so good (including looking for Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). Suffice it to say, it's probably best to see both movies to get the real story of Guevara and what kind of man he was (I rarely had the chance to see both movies on one screening ---- talk about long!). Like "Che-Part 1: Argentine", this film does not have an MPAA rating, but it contains enough salt and violence to easily "R".
