Although the elements of the "Eighth Day" plot seem to have been done many times, the film still has many sparks, mystery and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film was. Although it is not as good as "Toto Hero", which is always on my favorites list, the film still leaves us with a lot of emotion. Daniel Auteil, "The Closet", who has been odorless since 2001, reduces his share, is afraid of exaggeration (rightly, the role could have been easily destroyed if the actor was too dramatic). But I felt that this part needed a little more realism, focusing more on the character, not just on the character's growth. <br /> <br /> Don't walk into this movie while waiting for dark humor and unexpected turns you got from "Toto Hero" because you're frustrated. However, the film works as a decent, if not faulty, film
