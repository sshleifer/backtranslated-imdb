Hey now, I can't claim to have seen all Jesse (Jesus) Franco movies, and it seems that there are a lot of them, but this is one of the best (and more even) lots I've seen. I would most likely say that he was back in the late sixties / early 1970s, and in recent years I have a little strange thing, and I have a lot to say. Anyway, it's like a big bad dream where its parts seem to be real at different points. This woman is an actor or something, performs in some Berlin theater where "fake" torture is carried out for a grateful audience (?!) And apparently she has this dream problem. The harvest that is real and not in the film is probably the real thing that is in sharp focus and no dream. He seems to be in deja vu state. I'm not saying it makes a lot of sense, but it's pretty wild and weird and fun. The Berlin pictures seem to be a lonely and creepy place that adds to the atmosphere. The end is extremely steep, but the movie ends and the tape goes black, I don't think you need to know it. My copy was from the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash collection, and I say give me more Euro-Trash, I can't get it. But that's good.
