As a person born of a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a war camp), I come from a unique position. One must deal with different Nazis on one side of the family and winners of World War II. This minimization center does not get to every part of Hitler's psyche and has to give the viewer the current state of mind and the overall taste of Hitler's state of mind. This series is pretty good. Carlyle is very good than O'Toole, but I would like to get more information about relationships with other parties. Because Hitler did nothing for himself. He had people around him who often followed him in the letter without any doubt, and later, undoubtedly, in his murderous career. What was Goebbels, Goring and Hess? It would have been useful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people study the topic more. It can also understand why people who cannot get Saddam Hussein must not continue to be in power.
