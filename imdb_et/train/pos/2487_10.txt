I have to say that looking at Hamlet from the student's perspective, Brannagh's Hamlet version is the best. His commitment to keeping true to the original text should be praised. It helps to play the game on the screen and makes it easier for people holding the text to watch and analyze the text as we learned it. <br /> <br /> One thing I have heard repeatedly was criticizing playing big Hollywood names. I think it helps viewers recognize these signs more easily, but not the participants who all look and sound the same way to help with the confusion that is usually associated with Shakespeare. vagueness of the text. For example, how far did Hamlet and Ophelia really go and why Fortinbras just happened at the end of the castle. All in all, this version does not only include acquaintances, but also Shakespeare's familiar actors. It is presented in a way that does not have to be a doctor of English literature to understand and enjoy it.
