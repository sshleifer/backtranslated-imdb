In the age of such terrible cartoons, I am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals that makes it on the bottom of this IMDB animated film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the first. I don't deny that. However, when I was in the target audience of this movie, I didn't even notice if I did. People who did this could use the "new generation" to note that this is the second way Care Bear Family started. Maybe we have to decide for ourselves how the Care Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> It was my favorite movie at the age of 3-6 and it didn't scare me or disturb me at all. <Br /> <br />
