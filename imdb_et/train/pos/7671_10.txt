Morders, what am I saying? Jeffrey Combs has done it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been waiting on Earth for 100 years to come to Kabbalah, an evil witch so he can kill him. Mordrid and Kabal trained as children, so Mordrid knows all the tricks of Kabbalah. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a bit of confusion, but soon it seems you are part of the action. I'm not giving up, so go and see Doctor Mordrid! <br /> <br /> I found the movie very enjoyable because it doesn't have much violence or sexual scene. The film focused on the plot and I like it! I think the best films are those where time seems to be flying. This is because you have penetrated this movie. Doctor Mordrid is a fantasticly appealing film! I'll give him 20 out of 10. It is worth noting! <br /> <br />
