I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single father with a 17 year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. WANT that my girl is so good at solving the crime and helping others! So for me this is the PG level of Fantasyland. I read many Nancy Drew books with my teen years, a long time ago. Of course, this symbol was played by Emma Roberts, but it is not like Nancy Drew, who remembers books. This is due to the script, not the example. <br /> <br /> Emma is a divine teen who plays a confident, hardworking and proud character with good ways and good taste. He will not remain in his trendy competitiveness. Plot has some weaknesses, in addition to Nancy Drew's similarity to books, and tries to find out which decade we are. Before watching the movie, I read the IMDb review by studying Rachael Leigh Cook from other films. It's not one of his best roles, but I'm looking for more of my movies. Rachael was too old for this leadership, but does a good job as the central adult orphan of the mystery. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with other comments written here. Some are expecting a perfect relationship with books, some are looking for more reliable situations or adult action films. I got what I expected! Good entertainment, well targeted to young teenage girls and their fathers who want good children with high levels of behavior and achievement. It's a Teen PG movie, not James Bond! What kind of model do you want for your teenage daughter?
