Personally, I thought the film was a pretty good, very good actor, given by the fame of Tadanobu Asano Ichi killer. I can't say much about this story, but there were parts that mixed me a little too much, and generally I thought the film was too long. Other than that, the film contained great actors who fought excellently and many places were beautifully captured, great influences and lots of sword games. Another firm effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well I really can't say about the movie anymore, but if you're just an Asian cinema outlook, I'd like to try to rent it, but if you're a dead hard Asian cinema fan, I would say it's a good Japanese movie in your collection.
