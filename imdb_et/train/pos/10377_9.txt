The film I was very little waiting for and only looked at the quiet hours, but what the hour was like. Role is a great, if not too-serious, little story "country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-make-good", it's a funny collection, the characters are cute and the pace is just right. br /> <br /> Toby Malone is the real star of the movie with his loving Matt, the boy and the local Aussie rules hero for the big city to try out one of the biggest teams. John Batchelor excellently supports him in the local gangster Tiny. Follow these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
