Like the name of the street name (also staged by Gadg on stage and on the screen), Panic In The Streets depicts New Orleans, where his main claim to fame - the birthplace of Jazz - does not even mean to be mentioned. It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and he undoubtedly went on a long journey because he was a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in a disorderly little role as a bunch of deer, but the film is rich with talents, starting with Jack Palance (still for Walter Jack Palance) as the local Mr. Big, followed by Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus rock solid who is trusted by Paul Douglas, who is doc Widmark's point of view. This is a very rewarding film that is less visible. Catch it if you can.
