Damn, I've seen this movie at least four times and I still don't forget to watch it. <br /> <br /> Visuals are so good and with music that is absolutely fantastic and perfect for this movie. <br /> <br /> CGIs are pretty bad in IMHO, but the whole black and white feeling about it and completely sterile interiors were just ... Just a genius perfect for such a movie combination. The whole feeling of feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> Although the film has few errors, such as. sometimes I thought the film was a bit too slow, but I don't think about it, I loved them completely. <br /> <br /> A very complicated story also looked very much. as if he is in a bunk-like thing on the ground of a digital cubes where all their data is stored, and he has this conversation with the man there ... but it can also be me: D And the end could have somehow emphasized more that they should have made the part-back-true-memory part a bit longer and "louder", but then again, without these shortcomings, the film would have been so good that I would never have seen it again. .
