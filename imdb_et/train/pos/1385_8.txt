I saw this Cinema MK2 in Hautefeuille just one night after the first public show in Paris. A very beautiful movie from three 15-year-old teenagers, all of them almost psychologically. Many scenes give us the opportunity to return to the age of adolescents and our first sexual relationships. it is possible to imagine that the director wants to reduce the girls' first strong sensual feelings for lesbianism, but even in this case he does not violate the probability of the story. Sometimes you find the film a little slow, but it creates its intimate atmosphere. I fund very talented young actors, especially Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many small details, but this movie allowed me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressive!
