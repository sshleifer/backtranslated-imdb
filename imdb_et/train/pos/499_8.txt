The company's pilot has one thing that has been incomplete since the original Star Trek: a dose of realistic, faulty personalities. The next generation of utopian characters became tiring, they were so noble to be incredible. I also like the bottom line that people are bitter about volcanoes. His funny saw them as terrible. This makes me wait for people to become the dominant competition between the two, although I don't think it would work for the duration of the show. The only downsides that jumped on me were the quick interruption of the end of the 2-hour end, which is common among many Trek exhibitions. Another was shameless digging a couple of useless sexy scene. It was inappropriate, a good sci-fi show should be able to stand independently without catching up with the skin of the girls. But it's not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode does.
