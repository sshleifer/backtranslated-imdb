"The Groove Tube" was originally shown on video, in the first "video theater" here in Boston. In one room there were TV monitors on high stands, old movie house seats, small groups standing in front of the monitors. There were old refrigerators with Pepsi and York Peppermint Patties baskets. In the second, smaller room, there were no seats, but large pillows. It was a "smoking room", i.e. people got high there. This action only added to the fun of the video. <br /> <br /> I was a "frequent viewer"; The scenes that I most liked and remember this day are: Whole The Clown, Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening, Safety Sam / VD PSA, Chevy Chase hitchhiker w / nude runs through the forest, Finger Ballet has finally appeared woman's naked body. The last point reminded me very late, incredible Ernie Kovacki. Now, I've lost a lot of readers who are under 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs?"), But trust me, it's funny things. <br /> <br /> One reason I was a "frequent viewer" was that I and my friends would like to see it with other "Groove Tube" virgins. We would sit and look at "virgins" faces like "Security Sam" for PSA. When the camera slowly zooms in "Sam", we expect it "OH!" recognition as "virgin". Every time it was more fun than the last one. And then this "virgin" would make a friend's show, repeating what we had done. You need to watch the video to get this joke. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of them are dated, but most play, movie, television and now videos. Just watch any videos made in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie "The Groove Tube" in the theater, which was a sharp transmission from the original video. It was cut and lacked some of the original high-score scenes. <br /> <br /> The first "Saturday Night Live" show featuring Chevy Chase highlighted the immediate remarks of Groove Tube, "so it was the predecessor of Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can't look at the shortening without listening to the voice, "covering a large number of Kramp Easy- Lube shortcuts ..." and thinking of the "Kramp Holiday Loaf" recipe. I can always laugh at the aisle of baking needs in the grocery store. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the 70s was in parloos; "The Groove Tube" was a fresh, new and really humor of the ages. It offered a 'hip generation' of humor that was not available in any other format / media. MJH
