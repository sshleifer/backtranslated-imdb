As a habit, I always like to read the "hated" reviews of every movie. especially one I would like to comment on. and it is not so much a point-to-point sorta transaction; I just want to see what people are saying about flips. <br /> <br /> But I want to deal with one thing. many people who hated it, called it, paraphrasing, "beautiful but low", some even so far to say that the desire of the norm still can't help their brother on the daily plot, at best. <br /> <br /> I would like to disagree. <br /> <br /> If my brother's brother, with a similar malfunction, can associate. Every day you see them abusing themselves, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead to self-destruction. and that's not what they did when; how or why the paul decided to play gambling and associate with the respondents; it is really more how they are wired. on the one hand, they are true geniuses and on the other hand painfully destructive (it's like people like Howard hughes? The same forces that guide them are the same forces that tear them down) and all the time, you know it and worse, you realize you can't do anything damn about it. <br /> <br /> For Norman Maclean, the river passes and it was probably an opportunity to find out why the tragedy was going to happen and who was to blame. Finally, nobody is and often is not. but it takes a lot of personal anxiety to really achieve this realization. sometimes it takes life. and sometimes it never comes.
