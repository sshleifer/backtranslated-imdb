This work is less of Steve Martin's character about Davis when it comes to Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon) and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue entered through Davis is contemplative, contemplative, almost poetic existentialism at its best. . He is clever, intelligent, and thoughtful in both dialogue and content. Writers deserved the Oscar. <br /> <br /> Performances are simple, relaxed and natural; just what you expect from "A List" participants. Martin contributes to his latest Shopgirl, who leads you through life, love and wisdom, if not luck. Kline is a conformist straight - suit of the film - and her performance is crisp and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work is about life in every aspect. This creates real emotional investment in your characters and leaves you with the hope that humanity is not condemned, no matter what you believe, deep. <br /> <br /> In summary? It is admirable, with a sharp moment or two, and a simple natural dialogue that will bring you in, helping the audience to enjoy this work. Definitely worth your time, although it may not be the best choice for everyone on Friday / Saturday night entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this show. It is not typical and was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty presented here. Couples and friends have detailed conversations that feel and sound totally honest and (again) naturally. I was very impressed with this work and quickly add it to the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> This price is 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
