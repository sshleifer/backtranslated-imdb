In 1991, the two best queues were opened all the time: TERMINATOR 2: THE DAY OF THE COURT AND BILL & TED BOGUS JOURNEY. Of these two, I've always liked BILL & TED BOGUS JOURNEY. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is better, but Bill and Ted are nothing else. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade at TOMMY BOY, it's hard to think of a bigger comic duole than Bill and Ted. They are kind. <br /> <br /> Seemingly the National Lamp O.C. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo at the time he appeared in the local theater of L.A in the 1980s. These two began to quickly write about a scenario about two and a long BILL & TED FULL COMPETITION. Filmed in 1987 and released in 1989, it became a big box office success and a fast culture. It wasn't long before the work began. Stephen Herek, the director of "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE" did not want the offspring to work because he thought it was too average for enthusiasm and, unlike the first one, that Peter Hewitt, who made his film debut, was followed. There couldn't be a better director for the job. BILL & TED BOGUS JOURNEY is perfectly targeted. It's full of unique style and energy that can't be matched. <br /> <br /> What makes "BOGUS JOURNEY" one of the best offspring is that if it's darker than the original, it's just so much fun. It does not change such characters as most sequences. Bill and Ted are the same lovable characters they were in the first movie. This is because it was written by the original writers. Most of the follow-up results are not written by the same writers as the first, but since "BOGUS JOURNEY" had the same scriptwriters, it was as good as "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE", if not even better. Just like the first, BOGUS JOURNEY is completely fun, well written, fun and above all original. It is full of spectacular special effects and fantastic comic performances by Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It's an unforgettable trip. 10/10
