Wow what episode! After last week, Mellisa constantly saw Annos and Brand's friendships. But it wasn't until Mellisa was exposed after the dismissal. Seeing his hobby with his cast spewing out of the covert and screaming, someone getting their wallet was an absolutely fun thing ever in reality TV. He continued shouting at the people to get their "all" clothes like someone else would wear one of their terrible outfits. Are you 40 years old Mellisa and have you still been stunned? Then Joan will call Annie and Brandie to the name of each book and get up and go out of the show! Both rivers are corrupt brats who stayed in exhibitions to keep ratings. Mellisa cries and refuses to leave the interview, but proves to America what everyone thought you are a corrupted child. WAH WAH I can't get my way! I love how Annie told the cameras she could manipulate Mellisa to think about how she would do it, and then did it exactly. Mellisa is by far the most intelligent competitor and clearly deserves to win the whole game.
