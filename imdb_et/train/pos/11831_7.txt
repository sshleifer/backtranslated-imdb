Despite the fantastic and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of the most outstanding Disney movies I've seen, and I don't blame Disney movies very often. The Spirit is a wild slave who repeatedly seeks out a cavalry or Indians who both try to "break" him. The spirit comes into contact with India and it is a short story. As an exception to the beautiful animation of horses, this film and my five-year-olds were not very inspired or excited. It is ironic that it is called "Spirit" because the spirit is what this film could use a little more. An extra point was offered to enjoyable soundtracks with the songs of Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And while this movie is rated G, you'll probably need to finally explain what "horse breaking" means for your five-year-old. I did. <br /> <br />
