This movie was extremely funny, I would like to have it in my 1970s movie collection, which must be seen again, I know the lies of the characters, they are the people I have met over the years and that makes me look for this comedy. or VHS. Redd Foxx is always a comedy clown, Pearl Baily a great game like his wife's witty and sassy, ​​Norman's son, who's a secret, not sure if he has a future when it's over, Dennis Dugan crazy crazy funny man. Miss Dobson whore with heart and little conscience. Love, lust, strange family ties that this film qualifies for coming back, with the comedy events of the situation, as it could and should find its way to restructuring, I think finding it would be extremely difficult, or impossible, except Jerry Seinfeld plays Dennis Dugan's role, it marks a couple of Seinfeld episodes that brought me back to Norman to keep you, the closest one, from being impossible because it was impossible to reform the pretend prostitution girl and the infidelity of the parent. This movie was Cabbie's wild ride, reminding me of an episode. Kramer takes his shot over his lawyer. (Seinfeld episode) Parents have a falling moment of jaw, more fun fun.
