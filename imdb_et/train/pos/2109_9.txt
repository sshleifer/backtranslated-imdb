I've been watching this a lot of times, because I thought it was worth it, cute, dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy and maybe a bit outdated. But it is not too sentimental, as it is about office policy, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest and not everything turns out as you expected. But there is enough pointlessness and magic to touch the most confusing candle. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, consider seriously how well you want those movies to feel.
