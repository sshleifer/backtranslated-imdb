For those who have not followed the Anne Marie Fahey Murder case. You are missing one of the most sad, but most complicated, murders. The killer is a popular Delaware lawyer, Tom Capano, and the victim is Anne Marie Fahey, Secretary of the Delaware Governor's Schedule. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until his disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave her, but she just didn't let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters. Where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a family life? Moreover, this case is very complicated and interesting for a four-hour mini-series. Although the actor who plays Mrs Fahey does a good job, she has no dark hair. Her second lover is undoubtedly more attractive than a real woman. Mark Harmon has a better look and makes Emmy the award-winning Tom Capanol. This would be better with the real locations of Delaware and Philadelphia. With Ann Rule's executive production, she adds precision to Anne Marie's organizational character and her personal struggle with eating disorders. These data may be forgotten by any other leading manufacturer or director. If you haven't read a book, it's worth it. Ann Rule is an exciting storyteller of true crime. It is ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capan. He also played Ann Rule's former friend and theme, Ted Bundy, in the second book adaptation years ago. He was then and now great. He's doing an amazing story over the middle work. Even President CLinton offered assistance in the case of Anne Marie Fahey. And now, former governor Tom Carper is now US Senator Delaware, who won the long-standing popular senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 elections. If you don't think the movie is interesting, read the rule book.
