<br /> <br /> There's a STAR TREK canon - a lot of it. We know the future of Canon. Creating technology, events, places, first contacts with new creatures, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> BUSINESS is largely ignoring the ST canon. Unfortunately, there are serious fans for a long time. As one, I expected manufacturers to look back at TOS and retro at least from the first episodes, but no. <br /> <br /> Phase guns, like many technologies, look much more modern than TOS. An old style fleet laser gun, a slow golden spotted transporter effect - that was what I expected. I also did not expect to hear a pure beep-sound effect similar to TNG, but far from the TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the early perspective of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see Starfleet - a bit old navy - with a more formal military aspect. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for the rank. The classic STAR BLAZERS has more military code than ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> It is good that Captain Archer is not confident about the needs of the universe (unlike Kirk, who has never had confidence in the application of human rights), but within ENTERPRISE everything is equal. Professional, insecure, beyond official military service than any ST series - and it says a lot! <br /> <br /> Random Land Music Opening Topics talk about family trips rather than the adventures of a major large military ship. <br /> <br /> Entrepreneurship sees us as a fun, warmly blurred exploration of human relationships as we do from historical, courageous, sharp, high-level research I would have chosen Adrian Paul to play captain and senior man to be a doctor. However, I liked the participants mostly. The Boston College's extraordinary dance dancer Linda Park is definitely developing well. The characters that make up the team seem to be well thought out. <br /> <br /> COMPANY Starts its work harder than the last three TREK series. We hope for a good future!
