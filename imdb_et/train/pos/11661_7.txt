Looking at this movie, I was disappointed and confused and finally wanted to give the movie a strong 4 or 5. I thought the animation was casual and all over the place and there was too much going on there. Even my A.D.D couldn't keep up. It seemed like a small trip of acid. Everything seemed flat, nothing was. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie in the meantime and break its burned copy. But after I looked at it, I ended up reading the movie online and I should have studied this movie a little bit before watching it. <br /> <br /> The secret of clocks is loosely based on the real story of Kells' original book. The little boy, Brendan, has given the task of adding new pages to what is the greatest book ever written. This book contains information that helps to turn darkness into light. Brendan lives in Kellsi village behind large stone walls. In the 8th century, Brendan's uncle, Kells, attempts to build a wall to hold the Vikings. Brendan's uncle requires him to help complete the wall, but the secret of the "book" traveler and keeper keeps Brendan more insidious against his illustration skills and persuades him to perform the "book" and perform that word. <br /> <all the time I watched a movie I thought I was missing because I didn't understand what was going on. I thought I was just one of Irish history. A simple Google search taught me everything I needed about the original Kelll book. After reading many articles, my opinion on the film changed greatly. <br /> <br /> The Book of Clocks is a copied version of new wills translated into Latin from Irish in the 8th century. . Along with this paleographic and island script, the book also illustrates beautifully island art, a form of early art that is known for its complexity, complexity and miniature illustrations. Much of the art of Kellli's book is depicted as much as art without time in the apartment, in the apartment and in the dimensional sense. But what makes the Kells book different from other early art is that it uses many colors. <br /> <br /> The secret of watches is very colorful. Originally I thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminded me of a lot of cartoon Samurai Jack, who also had an apartment and an "amine." When I learned about the styles of Kelll's book, it is obvious that many of the styles of the book are imitated in the film. Brendan's lively lines and swirls and different shapes. Every time he goes into his imagination, the screen begins to fill circular shapes like the sun, gears, watches and wheels. The edges of the screen are framed with decorated triangles or circles. Transitions are full of color and Celtic knots. Many of the things in this world are covered with shapes or patterns in wood floors. <br /> <br /> The 70-minute clock minus credit, The Secret of Clocks is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure, and stupidity is thrown to keep people (or just children) interested. I think that in general, Kells' secret is to be open to mine, half of the film's history. Despite similar viewing, it was animated with Adobe Illustrator. However, based on the 20 films presented for the Oscar, I do not think it would be worth Mary and Max. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com
