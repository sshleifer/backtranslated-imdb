Sunny, Cocktail Dinner D.C. area is a bit dim. He drives an old clunker and rents a small space from a gay man. But he saves an outstanding Arab life by taking the ball that was meant for the official. She admires national journalism with her natural remarks and her sweet appearance. In the event of sniffing, the president's aide will receive him from the US Government's Protocol Department. Even then, he drives things at times, but he tries hard and learns a lot. He even grabs the romantic attention of an official of the state department. But is it another embarrassing plot involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? Blonde blonde? LOL, LOL, LOL. In this film, Goldie is as beautiful as a picture and as stupid as a fox, as they say. Sunny is learning his way into the US government jungle very, very well. He even has important things to say about honesty and lack of it in his protocol environment. Perhaps the Arab community would be more exciting about this work, but for those who want to laugh, rent it today.
