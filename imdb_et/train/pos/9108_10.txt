True Story of a Real Revolution, April 25; revolution against the 41-year repressive regime against the colonial war, for the preservation of the empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, S. Tom√© e Principe; the first and last large European colony of colonies) that begins with the conquest of Ceuta in 1415 year; military revolution for the people and democratic Portugal; the most surprising in this revolution is the fact that no people were killed in it (except for those who died in the country's political police PIDE, a brutal fire against an unarmed crowd protesting against this headquarters on Revolution Day, April 25, 1974) All revolutions are heroes, one of them was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a war-returned soldier whose convictions with the rest of the army were that they fought (since 1961) with a hopeless war and that sometimes the soldier must obey his country.
