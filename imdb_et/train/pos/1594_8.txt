What you like is one of the series you need to see, but you are not sure to see, the start is cool and it sucks you into the series just for fun, the second part of season I 2-3, which are older they come and go , what do you want. For many series, they don't end up with something special, because the second part of the series is always going to run out, it also happened somewhat, the third part is that which ruins and destroys the whole series, usually, but it is not, the end fits for the series, it fits perfect, in fact I was very happy for all these men in Choose Life, in fact I wanted to finish with Jeff, but later changed, decided to take Vic after almost 3 seasons without it, and that was the biggest surprise and also what series did, goes over. <br /> <br /> Look at it many times when the series is really cool not to expect the other part to be so good that it is not, but the third part does what it takes and made it a series, what was worth all the thing i'm happy about being a happy and happy series and now i'm going to see two men and girls when i've seen the whole series i came back ...
