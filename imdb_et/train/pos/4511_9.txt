I just took a DVD clip of this movie while on holiday in Norway, where it is published with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully captured and powerful. A young person who depicts the "Frits" sign is an amazingly open face that painfully reflects the tragic events around him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, we see that Father, whom Frits loves so much about mental health problems, has been raised when a brutal director refuses to attack a boy and suggests that it was his father. <br /> <br /> Climate change, where Frits refuses to respect the director; just standing on your land and repeatedly "liar" because his classmates are being brutally attacked, this is a scene you will not forget. <br /> <br /> Movies are just weak spots. a teacher who uses all the "friendly teachers" in the book. In addition, I firmly feel that this is the movie you really enjoy.
