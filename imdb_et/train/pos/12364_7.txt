"The end of the" 60s "and" early 70s "" demon-meeting-clergy "trend, which included the" Rosemary Baby "," Exorist "and" The Omen "Triptych," The Sentinel "is also as good (though a lot of the most neglected). In some ways, it combines the best elements of these films and slippers with a dash of good action by Polanski's "tenant" (which came out in the same year). The New York model, unable to cope with its lawyer, lives in a moss-covered terraced house, which initially seems to be a perfect locality; he meets old old bags from his neighbor (brilliantly Burgess Meredith), as well as other off-center tenants. Do not wake up loudly after your apartment, that soon you will discover that the spiritual priest and himself are the only inhabitants of the otherwise abandoned building. From there, Michael Winner ("Death Wish") directs this supernatural thriller into action and there is a devilish bow to the hallucinogenic torture he puts on his hero. Thanks to the brilliance of the brilliant ensemble, the subtle style and the magnificent makeup of FX Dick Smith ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a really horrible horror strike.
