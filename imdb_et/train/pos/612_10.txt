This remarkable movie can be summarized very easily. First, although the comparison with "Princess Bride" is inevitable, it is almost negligible. Although both films combine the spirit of adult and humor with fairy tale backgrounds, "Stardust" is as different as any other fantasy / sci-fi movie I've ever seen. This is a hybrid of these genres, but its scheme and script are so unique that, with performance, special effects, cinematography and scores, the end product is not just anything comparable to what has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective in pulling us at the same time the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place, and defeating the story, creating just the right amount of fear and excitement needed to make the magic credible. there are signs. Thirdly, I didn't find it difficult to track or confuse the film. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main sub-platforms even made it much more interesting. Wonderfully cast and excellently worked everywhere. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best I've seen since the "King's Return" (not to compare the two at all). OK, so it's not so easy to summarize, but don't let the raw and / or heartless and cynical review or the movie's pathetic PR prevent you from participating in the best time you could have this summer. Long time)!
