Soylent Green is classic. I've been waiting for someone to restart it. They nowadays look like sci-fi classics (i.e. world wars) and I hope some leaders / manufacturers will make Soylent Green again. With today's computer animation and technology, this would be a great picture. Anti-utopian movies may not be so far drawn. The human race pulls it so that it limits its external impact to the unpublished roaches. As human beings, we have the opportunity to put kibosh on the cultivation of fewer species when they pull out of hand, but there is nothing to control the breeding of humans except for us. Despite all illnesses, wars, abortions, contraceptives, etc., the human race multiplies the bacteria in the Petri dish. Classic Malthusian economics says that all species, including humans, multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and grow .... it's nil.
