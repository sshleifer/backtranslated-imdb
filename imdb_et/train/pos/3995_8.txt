Kureishi is not exactly blessed with films that justify the quality of his writing. Recent custom travesty like "Intimacy" has ruined a big letter. But Mother crosses all of her earlier incarnations, even reflecting my beautiful laundry. A middle-aged woman wins a widow, because she is very carnal about her emotionally weak daughter. The fact that you think it all is a testimony to the quality of operation, as is the limited gift of writing. And, Daniel Craigis, we have a hero, a dirty, terrible anti-hero who ever denies the public why a young man weighs a bed with his grandmother. A beautifully captured film is not just a weak image of peripheral characters, but a winner as an inconceivable study of lust.
