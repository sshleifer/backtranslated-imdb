An interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger, bitch and mammoth who saved a child who had captured a group of tigers during the ice age. Movie morale shows that good behavior with others can bring benefits. One of the group's tigers was ordered to finally defeat the baby, barely saved by his mother, when the tigers attacked his community. The child was then rescued with a lamp and a mammoth, but the tiger joined them with the aim of finally taking the baby. They went through very troublesome paths with very cumbersome ways, and at the same time the tiger had to fall and mammoth rescue. Finally, the Tigers group tried to hit the baby, but his tiger colleague helped incredibly overcome this attack and return the child to his father and the community he belongs to.
