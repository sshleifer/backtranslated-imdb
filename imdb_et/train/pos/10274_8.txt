SPOILERS This is a thrilling movie about grifter. But who is here? When will a hunter become a prey? This sharp, dark film is slow moving and seductive. It pulls you in and drags you in the proverb garden, but strikes you just as you think you're safe. I didn't notice background music, but it was never engrossed so it should be done right. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this movie because I usually do not go into this genre, but it sucks me in and held it until the end.
