The maniacal desire of Adolf Hitler to put his will to the rest of the world is another issue of seven US War Department films, a learning tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during World War II. Hitler's plan was methodical and well-designed, starting with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding into the heart of Europe, then moving on to the world island of Europe, Asia and Africa. His last step would be to transcend the ultimate conquest of the Americans America and the world. <br /> <br /> In 1935 Hitler ordered a national army because the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. School pupils sang their praise and the young German boys received training and indoctrination in military camps. In 1938 Hitler did not enter Austria, followed by Sudetenland with the border area between Germany and Czechoslovakia. In 1939, Hitler took over Czechoslovakia. Later, the world was amazed that Germany signed a non-aggression pact with its mortal enemy, which postpones Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately afterwards, Germany invaded Poland, bringing Hitler's right of conquest to Russia. He'll deal with him later. <br /> <br /> It was during this period that Britain still refused Hitler's thrust across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt that he had won a great victory for his country, agreeing with an agreement with Germany, his infamous declaration of "Peace in our Time". It didn't work that way. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information to point out, at least for me, in this regard, was the 30th anniversary of a small piece of German material by Hitler's rally. It was led by a German American who took the cue directly from home. Place - Madison Square Garden!
