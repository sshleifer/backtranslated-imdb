I loved the movie. it analyzes beautifully the small Italian civil society, how the leftists of the 70s have abandoned their ideals and reached a happy agreement that they do not want to disturb. For example, an aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his son and does not want to remind him of his more radical youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time, the video wanted to buy after watching the movie. a few times on the big screen and on television, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy nobody knew about the bookshops. great damage! One sex scene, which everyone seems to have, does not affect the film.
