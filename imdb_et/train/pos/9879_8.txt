It may be that Lily Mars's presentation has given Judy Garland one of the simplest roles she had during the MGM, as Lily Mars is definitely a sign she could identify. A young girl who has enough talents for ten people knows she has what she needs in the theater, no matter how much of the Van Heflin manufacturer deters her home town. <br /> <br /> I really loved Judy one as the girl decided to do it in the theater. Because it is Judy Garland with the talents of Judy Garland, you know that she has the right things, even when Van Heflin is convinced of almost the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Both Judy and Heflin talk about the same little town, Heflin's father was a city doctor who gave him and Heflin when he could go away and become a big producer at Broadway, their respective mothers, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington has been in touch. This is his ent√©e, but Heflin has been constantly struck by stagestruck children but never by anyone like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> Lily's presentation to Mars Garland did not come up with a real big hit, even though she sang all her numbers. The best of the film is the revival of the chestnut of this gas-light era, every little movement has its own meaning. Judy sings with Connie Gilchrist, who plays cleaning children at Broadway Theater, where Heflin's show is produced. Gilch was on FloraDora's girls' days and she and Judy gave the song in a grandiose style with Connie. This is the best scene of the film, because Gilchrist encourages Judy to keep it. Composer Karl Hoschna had been dead for a long time, but Otto Harbach was still alive and I remembered what he heard. <br /> <br /> The European musical star Marta Eggerth presents Lily Mars as a star who is confused first, angry and finally Garland and Heflin. He made a few movies with MGM and went back to Europe to get more work on the continent. I contribute that MGM did not know what to do with him and his tight Hungarian accent, although Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano he didn't like. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin is also a patient manufacturer who does a lot of Garland and Eggertos. Heflin had left Johnny Eager last year with his Oscar, and he and Garland don't seem to be the ideal screen team, but they're not bad together. <br /> <br /> Lily Mars is good at presenting the talents of Judy Garland. And he didn't have to share another screen with Mickey Rooney.
