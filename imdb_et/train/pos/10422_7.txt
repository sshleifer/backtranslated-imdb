Of course, Mario Lanza is in 1951 in The Great Caruso, featuring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known today, a very fictional biography. <br /> <br /> The film is richly produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna Blanche Thebom and other opera stars that appeared in the film. If you are purist, you will see the story of killing people who are smiling at Lucia during cedar, it's odd - even when Caruso's wife Dorothy was just a baby girl. It is also highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo Lucias; Role gave her too high. <br /> <br /> When you take a dramatic license, the script leaves some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. It was so remarkable for him that he actually created the functions in the operas of his usual repertoire, but it is never mentioned in the movie. These roles are Maurizio Adriana Lecouvreuris and Dick Johnson's "Golden West Girl", a famous photo that depicts him with a leaf like a toe. The reason for this photo? His only shirt was in the washing machine. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long collaboration with Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He sang the Carmen Jose of San Francisco at night. <br /> <br /> Instead, the MGM story is basically his dying stage during Marta's performance that has never happened. He had bleeding during Metroris during "L'Elisir d'amore" and was unable to finish the show; he sang three more times in Metis, his last role in Eleazarina La Juives. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino Peritonide. His first role in Metis was not in Radames Aidas, as shown in the film, but in Duke Rigolettos. So when the screen says "Dorothy Caruso's biography of her husband", that was what it was - recommended. It is true that Dorothy's father left him after marriage and left his $ 1 in his great legacy. They also had a daughter Gloria (who died at the age of 10/7/2007). But Caruso was married to four other children before Dorothy married. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Lanza's voice is remarkable as Caruso, but just listen to Caruso's song "Match Point" - Caruso's voice is remarkably different from Lanza. In fact, Caruso would have wanted to sing as a baritone for his sound. It is thought to have had problems with high notes, additional evidence of baritone departure; his role was his dramatic tenor role at the time of his death, which certainly was not Lanza. Lanza's voice deserves no comparison with another. He made a unique contribution to film history by popularizing opera music. He sings music with "Big Carusos" with vigorous energy; He's really here at the top of a short career. His behavior is natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is beautiful as Dorothy and she can sing a little herself. <br /> <br /> Really movie for opera players and Lanza fans, which is probably the same.
