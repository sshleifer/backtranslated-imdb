A great intermittent movie with terrible slow camera work that adds drama makes it look and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma makes this film super-Hitchcock imitation (many are called "ripoff") and 2.35: 1 widescreen DVD is needed to fully evaluate the camera's work (and several scenes where people hide each frame formatted on a TV tape ). <br /> <br /> The negative side of the movie, at least for everyone with a moral standard, is all characters, including a cop, played by Dennis Franz before NYPD (who's hair here!). The open scene is still shocking with a relatively long shower application, which is quite clear even 25 years after its release. The film has a number of erotic scenes, such as Dickinson (if it is close to her) and Nancy Allen doesn't want to show her body. <br /> <br /> In the first 20 minutes, there is not much dialogue and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting, and while it's obvious who the killer is, it's still a very good ratio and fun to watch all the way, especially when naked women ogling.
