"Broken Bow" takes us back to where it all started. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This "Star Trek" franchise contribution is, in my opinion, the first "TOS" series to rebuild the miracle, the threat and the excitement of "Going Where No Man is". Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as the first Star Ship Enterprise captain Jonathan Archer. He and the whole cast show real respect for Star Trek's legacy. John Billingsley is Brilliant when Alien Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock are completely lush as tempting, but logical, Vulcan researcher T'Pol. Broken Bow, in my opinion, is the best premiere of any track and I believe Gene Roddenberry would be proud.
