/ * small spoilers * / <br /> <br /> Back, before Evangelion was made, before Hideaki Anno was the idol and household name of many anime fans, and before Gainax was achieved, Gunbuster was made. With the Wain of Honneamise alone, which Gainax did at that time and the famous Otakon shorts or, of course, Gunbuster had some tough things to do. It didn't simplify itself by choosing the genre of the genre that had been made many times before. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax decided on this six-part OAV (live video). This allows the series to have a larger scope than would have been possible for film making. It also prevents it from becoming too boring and too long, with lots of meaningless battles and fillers along the way. In addition, they made efforts to stay clear of the experimental space used by Macross or Gundam in the opera room and many other popular room operas. <br /> <br /> In one show, Noriko's beautiful, Okinawa High School begins with a mechapilot. Noriko is the daughter of a recognized shipmaster, killed during the battle, when he was still a little boy. This makes his life in the academy quite difficult, as some of his fellow classmates are beginning to suspect that professors prefer Norot. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, focusing very closely on school characters and settings. Things change fast when the threat of alien invasion is reported, and Noriko and Kazumi (the best in-class girl) are selected to help assemble the fleet. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster's average mass leaves room for our wife's leadership, focusing on both personal drama and action. Two more characters are added and part of Noriko's past is pulled up again. In addition, the danger of an alien is getting worse every minute, and Gunbuster, the last hope of humanity, is presented. Clever as a writer, Okada was the principle of time dilation to spice things up. In short, time moves more slowly to those who travel at a speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that lasts almost a century. It also highlights its dramatic aspect when Noriko sees his friends returning to their base, who are significantly older than his age. Science may not be perfect, but it has been presented quite credibly, even between some short events of the SD science theater, where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series. /> <br /> The 80s series animation is definitely good. Design is, of course, a retro 80's style, but it has its own charm. The animation is smooth enough and the character's designs are nice, although the costumes bet on <br /> <br /> some fans that Gainax later uses. Mechad is also cool in the show, Gunbuster is the ultimate killing machine, strong and big. The last episode was made entirely in black and white. While generally believed (but not confirmed) to have been made for budgetary reasons, it gives the series a completely different atmosphere, ideally suited to the last part. <br /> <br /> Music is a very typical space in the opera fair. Too bombastic places, very general and certainly not worth it. It is mostly suitable for a series, but it can sometimes become quite annoying. Tanaka is not really a famous composer and the only other respected series he has worked on is Dragon Half. If you think of 80's anime music, you know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the focus will slowly shift from drama to space opera to epic struggle, but so the viewer hardly notices it. Step by step, the drama is tuned and battles take the lead. Both aspects are never completely excluded. With last-minute vision, Noriko and the team for the future existence of mankind, and faced with the last battle, presents some questions to the public about the position of mankind in the galaxy, and how far it can go to ensure its survival. Although they will not be answered later, they will still give some interesting ideas. The last episode is very epic, nice, but with a rather predictable ending, although not all ends should of course contain numerous extremes. Again, it fits the series. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster may seem like the beginning of your average spatial opera anime, alien invasions, big battles, and some personal drama and most of it. But it is exceptionally good for change. Instead of going into a long blend of old elements, six episodes, Gunbuster presents us with a change between small-scale drama and greater epic heroism. Sometimes we meet a variety of interesting and well-established characters, which are strongly changing due to the phenomenon of time expansion. The exhibition is very tightly written, although it tends to slip at some point. Too dramatic events and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. All in all, Gunbuster's trip is very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic. It may not have broken the boundaries and boundaries of the space opera, but at least it bends them a little. Very enjoyable anime classic but not without errors. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
