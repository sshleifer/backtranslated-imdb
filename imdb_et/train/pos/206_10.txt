I'm 14 years old so you think I've never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone like that. You're the boy wrong. I had heard that George Burns was in this movie and won the Academy Award for it. I've been a fan of George Burns for ten years. I saw the movie Oh, God recently and loved it. It was also very awesome. George Burns did a great job. That's what Walter Matthau did (it's the first time I've ever seen him). And although they had very small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. The special thing they filmed would have been fantastic if it was really done. Let me say that if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie now!
