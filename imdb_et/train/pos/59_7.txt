Although I was a video shop, I was browsing through a one dollar rent and came to this little pearl. I don't know what it was, but I just had an intestine, and it was never right. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on two girls who have just shot at school. One of the girls is the Alicia teenager, who is the only witness of the entire attack, and the other is Dean's second survivor, who was headed by some miracle. Together with fate, they slowly begin to painfully and beautifully display healing and movement. <br /> <br /> I just hate how amazing movies go through cracks. Because wow What a busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen's talk is about is the rest of the pain! My only complaint is that the DVD had no special features. Oh, and some movie jumps were sort of looting. But everything is a great movie.
