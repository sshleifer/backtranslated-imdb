My dog ​​recently died, and it was a movie I loved as a child, so I had to see it to try and make fun. <br /> <br /> (Beware of the dog, I mean the Spoiler.) This movie is not just for kids and it is far from normal. It was created in New Orleans in 1939. First of all, this film was not shown in this family as an additional family member, but as an adult who had a difficult life. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, Charlie is not too different from her dishonest and brutal business partner Carface. He's money-based, greedy and just escaped from death, as he claims at the beginning of his function. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and is ready to listen to others; Anne Marie and her sidekick Itchy. Carface does not even listen to a fat, ugly dog ​​with big glasses closest to her. <br /> <br /> Cropping is trying to kill the hero because he wants 100% profit in his business and doesn't live just 50% - a very unusual way for a German Shepherd to mix. It is also highly unlikely that a prehistoric-sized alligator will be eaten, who will save his life because you can sing. It's a comic and that's why it's logical. <br /> <br /> Carface's revenge method is murder, while Charlie believes that success is the best vengeance, financial success. After he begins to die, he starts a business with a Carface source of funding, a very talented girl with the ability to communicate with animals. They win a whole series of races and Charlie tells him he's giving money to the poor - a hint tip: Charlie and Itchy live in spam and are therefore poor. He uses money for his casino / bar / theater, not for the other "poor". The reason Anne Marie can talk to animals is that she has compassion and listens carefully. He teaches Charlie's ethics, pointing to his gambling, lying and stealing. Charlie tries to buy this dress. He added the necessary ethics to his business, while Charlie led it and Itchy was building. <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and property damage to destroy Charlie's business that the government is not protecting. Charlie loses everything and everything she has left is the little girl. Finally, he had to choose between his life and himself. First of all, she grabbed her self-defense and puts it down when the girl began to sink. Both the girl and the clock fell, and she had to pick one and choose a girl. <br /> <br /> A big part of this movie, which focuses on a person's ability to learn correctly from the wrong time and the child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of his pet's death is that it never shows anyone a death! The clock marks his life and the clock is shown to be under water and stopped. All the deaths were hinted, even the villain. I did not shout at this movie until now, and I have come out a lot more about it, that I had to write it and share it with you.
