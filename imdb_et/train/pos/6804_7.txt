Don't let your constructive criticism prevent you from buying and watching this Romy Schneider classic. This film was hit in a smaller budget, probably against Ernest Marishka's will, so he had to pay. For example, England is depicted as a border with Germany. Buggy drive alone. They arrived too fast. It probably couldn't help but Austria was the castle they rented. When she says she is a queen, she goes to a royal room where the court members worship her, with British citizens outside the castle, who rejoice for her new queen? Why does the ISBN not show her own balcony to welcome her themes? Low budget! If the audience is aware of this shortcoming? I don't know how the critics felt the hostel scene he met with Prince Albert, but the ISBN is not excited about it. Durring meeting at the inn inn will hear music from famous old American Civil War songs like "My Old Kentucky Home" and "Old Black Joe". What? Civil War Songs in the 1830s? Is Romy Schneider represented as a Scarlet? Where is Mammy? Does Magna Shnieder also play with her? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was Marishka? Well it adds to the camp. It is involuntarily satirizing Queen Victoria's story. This is the only reason why you should collect it or see a 03 11 09 correction for Germany and England are connected
