Luchino Visconti was a light year for his slow ones. The great leaders of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the media, but the visionary Luchino Visconti, who dared to bring the film, showed what he was capable of doing. He clearly demonstrates his genius at the beginning of his outstanding career with Ossessione, a film based on James Cain's "Postman's Always Twice", which later made Hollywood, but this version is comparable to what Visconti's film achieved. Luchino Visconti and his associates belonged to Alberto Moravia, a man who knew a passionate impact on people. <br /> <br /> The film has been well preserved in recently viewed DVD format. The film is indispensable for all serious film fans, as we see how Visconti's vision translates the text into a movie that speaks in a truly credible way that the American version lacked. <br /> <br /> What the movie looks like is the intensity that the director got from his main players. Excellent Clara Calamai is doing an amazing job, like Giovanna, a woman who is married to a parent, but when Gino appears in her life, she wants to get rid of a man who gave her a chance in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations of Mrs Calamai's achievements in Italian cinema. In the last line of the film, Mrs Calamai is best shown as an ironic twist, which acts as a monster crime committed for moral redemption. from his generation who appears as Gino, a hunky man who raises Giovanna's obsession. Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna, something that Girotti designs so easily and complexly that is not equal to the screen before. Mr. Girotti makes a person alive in a performance that seems so simple, but with another actor it may not be so obvious. Juan DeLandat is seen by Giuseppe, an older man who loved Giovanna. In fact, his character speaks more of his colleague in an American film where he is seen more than a buff. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic look, which was the preferences of an Italian director. Giuseppe Rosati's original music is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes Bizet's and Verdi's arias that fit well in the film context. <br /> <br /> "Ossessione" is a treasure because we look at the big Luchino Visconti at the top of its form.
