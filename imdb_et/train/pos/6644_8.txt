After waiting for too many years, Anne Rivers Siddons noted in 1979 the book "The House Next Door". The result comes up a bit from the novel, which, especially in the first story of trilogy, is understandable if it is not satisfactory, because it is a TV film that absorbs all and is really very good, just not as big as the book that is Stephen's King's favorites and one of my companions. <br /> <br /> If theater time has more running time and fewer limitations, it would have been possible to explore the rich three-story story of the ultramodern house. Groomed, especially the climate-like revelation near its end. <br /> <br /> However, the whole cast is done by an unthinkable story of insane malice. There are some unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fear is well developed. In fact, one of the most annoying scenes of abstract painting of the house is the neighbor of an amateur artist next door, who tries to visualize this corruption on the canvas. <br /> <br /> Be sure to read a great novel.
