My brother and I have a Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We looked at it a few times and it was the best. Too bad this new pokemon didn't talk about that time. I use it. <br /> <br /> Iron Masked Marauder was pretty average when he tried Celeb in his dark ball. Good thing Ash and Sam can pull him out of control. <br /> <br /> Russell Velazquez gave only one song for the final ride at Cele-BRATE. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever It was a success because the three previous movies and people always love this movie.
