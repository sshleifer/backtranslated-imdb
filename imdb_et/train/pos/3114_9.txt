I intend to keep it fairly short so that nothing can spoil you. This movie is fantastic. From beginning to end, it's a real thrill. Fighting scenes are awesome, chasing scenes is tempting, and it moves at a pace that it really only feels slow to the end when things are explained, but that's just because everyone before that. Damon shines and has really proved to be a very strong actor, encouraging you not to believe in this role. He has that role. A welcome addition to David Straithrin's series (I hope I wrote it right) as a CIA agent who kills Bourne. It is unstoppable and really leaves you at the edge of your seat. Some things towards the end are just an awkward smidgeon that denies 10 ratings. The end remains open to the results and I hope they will weigh them more, because none of them have been bad. A great movie as a whole and a fantastic ending for amazing trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The dirty doll did not hurt any action, but I think we can do without it. The good news is that you only notice it when people talk and not so much.
