This movie is great! It touched my stone's cold heart. I could not relate the racial discrimination experienced by Antwone because I live in my own country. I think it's really hard to discriminate. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie in our sociology class at New Era University and I didn't know it was a real story, I thought it was just an intellectual who wanted to bring fresh air into the industry. It's very good. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me was when Nadine sexually abused Antwone (who was only six). When I was on his shoes, I could have jumped on a ten-year high building. I welcome him for being so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face. He did not loot him or anything, but instead he told him about the achievements he had made for a long time. (I think I'll do it when I get the chance to track my roots.)
