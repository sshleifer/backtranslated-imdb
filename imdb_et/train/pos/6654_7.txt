The film took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and shows how he was. His relationship with Harilali is something Gandhi worried about and mentioned several times when his failure in his father's autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big grip is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly unpleasant in the movie. The person who played Gandhi could have done better. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too unpleasant and seemed to be deliberately displayed in negative light in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not really all-encompassing, it only focuses on a narrow relationship between father and son. The rest is blurry and is only used to show the movie schedule and overall setup. <br /> <br /> Generally a nice movie if you remember that it is not a complete picture.
