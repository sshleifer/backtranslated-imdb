First of all, I think the comment below is not valuable for such a site. Of course you have no taste and you do not respect the taste of others. Do not give you a lesson in history, but I think it should be done. Black actors are right, if not more, successful than others. If you are not part of the "black" competition, you will not be able to understand the quality, creativity and vibrantness of old films such as "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Since, unfortunately, you are not Black, you are not happy to know what we feel when we look at these classics, so you have to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non-dance contest. Thank you.
