I looked at my wife calling another room to ask what my price was. My comment? "I look at my life!" <br /> <br /> Although younger, but only 5 years or more than I remember "Rocket Boys", I remember the absolute urgency that Sputnick was welcomed by our education administrators and how the whole Science Fair thing got up and took me and others racing stream. My own tornado landed at my national science center, physics, '62. Until our group was less successful, for example, in supporting firefighters we approached for guidance and counseling until after a tragic event, our city went so far as to allow us to travel to the Nike missile shore on the shore of Lake Chicago. <br /> <br /> This movie brought it back to me and I will contribute to bringing it back to all of our "UberNerds" in the late 50s and early 60s. <br /> <br /> We are now in a similar brain drain period and really need this movie as a country. Look at this!
