Two brilliant career geniuses. David Lynch, who is better known for less accessible material, treats the delicate and subtle story around the most unlikely assumption. The man is driving to see his stranger brother. Other means of transport do not have more than six weeks of lawnmower traveling. Richard Farnsworth in his latest film starred in amazingly layered and nuanced performance. The great story of picking up small things is the Straight Story classic cinema experience, which must not be forgotten. Sissy Spacek is remarkable as the daughter of Farnsworth, a medieval woman living with the disappearance of her children.
