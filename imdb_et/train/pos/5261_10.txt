Do you like a truly ingenious comedy or do you love "wedding cops" when the answer is the last stop. I can't believe this film is higher. Basically, meadows play differently with Austin Powers. There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. From crudity - Leon plays himself in the porch, ex boyfriend eating. . Oh well. Inspire the voice of the lunacy clown, Broadway's routine. Meadows are great as childish but very sweet natural Leon. Some big lines "don't blame wang" for "freaky deaky sex world" too much. . . Why this movie wasn't great is a mystery. Great comedy.
