I imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he was going to be an icon and started "Wanted: Dead in Life" the same year, this movie came out or two years later it would be great, he wouldn't have done it. But he did it and we are richer for it. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a classic in the camp. Horror, how it was meant for the driving theater. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the film's latest features were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we've stopped it. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic remains cold. <br /> <br /> They would never have thought that the melting of the Arctic would be 52 years ago. Blob will be back soon.
