Whether we dance is a great movie because it shows how something like dancing can rejuvenate the flow of human flow. <br /> <br /> Dance is seen as the birth of existence and individuality. This is definitely the case with Aoki. At work, he has a humble office, but puts him on the dance floor and all his bottled intensity is released. Surprisingly, this press release is anxious about Japan's harsh compliance cultures. At the beginning of the film, all the characters are ashamed or scared of their desire to dance. They are intimidated or perverted to express their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth a look to recognize people's emotions and passions. It leaves a smile on the face for the day.
