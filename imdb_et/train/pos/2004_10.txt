I admit that I am a vampire addict: I've seen so many vampire films I've lost and that's definitely the top ten. I was very surprised by the original vampires of John Carpenter and when I gave up I had a sequel that I went straight out and bought. This movie does not follow the same rules as the first one, and it is not quite as dark, but it is close enough and I felt it was built nicely on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was pleasant and still hard enough for the viewer to believe he could actually live in the world where he lives. One of my favorite things was just after she met Zoey and traveling to the diner in the bathroom to see if she was more than she seemed. His comments are beautifully irreversible and still very practical, which contrasts well with the rest of the scene. <br /> <br /> The other cast members were well-chosen and woven nicely to produce an entertaining and original movie. It's not just a transformation of the first movie, and it's grown up like Fright Night II out of Fright Night. There are different elements that make this fresh movie a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I would recommend it. If you prefer your movies with less blood, then choose something else.
