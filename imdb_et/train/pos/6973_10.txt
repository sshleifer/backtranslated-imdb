BSG is one of my favorite TVs of all time. I was lucky enough to start watching it because the series came to the last season. For me it was a marathon from start to finish, which was an incredible ride! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed a picture of Hulus, I knew exactly what I was heading - Caprica! Although some things are not added when comparing both series, it is still beautifully done. Battlestar Galactica was not mentioned in Holoband or the mention of virtual worlds, but maybe I don't have enough series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this example to anyone who loves our world universe, technology and alternative fantasies. This exhibition is very interesting and wants to see you more!
