This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends know it the same way. This movie is at the same time very romantic and dramatic. I think we need movies or movies to keep South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao acted very well in this regard, and their couple attracted a lot of people. It's a movie, it's a family and romantic movie. This film also comes from the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is now the best ... setting up the movie was beautiful, which is also a great attraction. This movie must be ... recommended to everyone !!
