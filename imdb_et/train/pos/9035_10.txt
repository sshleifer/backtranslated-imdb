Acting in this movie was great. I found very few mistakes as an amateur rocketeer. As a human being, it touched my heart and soul. To see the actors, you think they are real characters. My favorite actor, Laura Dern, left nothing out of her performance. Young actors from Rocket Boys showed talent over these years, especially the young homer. Homer's father inspired this eternal love / hate between father and son to make it look real. If you can't break a single one in your throat or break it once the first successful rocket rises or if your father and son come to an agreement, check your heart rate (you may be dead).
