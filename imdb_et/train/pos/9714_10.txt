What do you get when you cross the Matrix with Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've all seen the Matrix. The creators of the matrix say it's inspired by anime. Just looking at the trailer for this classic, you can see where they took the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is a kind in Japan in the 1980s and really shows. Costumes, music and words (in the recent English version of Vision Vision) are all as they are lifted straight away. I believe it was done at this time, but due to certain plot points, this movie is not filmed! <br /> <br /> As you probably thought when I referred to the matrix, the world is not real. It's not really the 1980s. In fact, it is more than in the 2480s. After the nuclear war, the Earth (or "Biosphere Prime") ecosystem was destroyed. Survivors we are forced to flee to space, where the conflict continued. When the planets (or "Biospheres") were all abandoned, people began to live in the cities of MegaZones, where they were believed to be back on earth through the hypnotic techniques and the illusion of Truman Show-esque. the most peaceful time in the recent memory ... 1980s. When a young Shogo gets a mysteriously advanced motorbike, he gets to know more about what he should know ... Garland (a bicycle that turns into a Mech), a weapon from 2400, helps Shogo out of his quest to escape. As more and more MegaZone is discovered, war is getting closer to home, and MegaZone comes to war because of conflicts between the military and the computer ... Sorry if these points are considered spoilers, the plot is basically explained by the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Emotions are high in this movie when it is a matrix. You really believe that war is going on and Shogo really becomes quite scared of what he discovers. What begins with a uber-happy 80s flick becomes a tragic war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the cardboard cutouts we saw around the ball at Matrix. It really feels like the affected people can go through such conspiracy and war. It might just make you exhausted ... I know it did for me. <br /> <br /> Animation for this day is quite impressive and the picture quality on ADVision DVD is unbelievable at this time. The work is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime, very cultural. Get ready for quite a lot of violence and blood, there's also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The end can be seen as "cannot be an end", similar to a matrix, or allegedly followed by a sequel that I have not yet observed. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best anime I've actually seen in one of the best movies I've seen and what many have considered one of the biggest animations of all time. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend ADVision DVDs because taking them in English is incredible and either film fairness, and can also be purchased with boxes that hold out two sequences when they are released with the same vocal. <br /> <br /> All in all, MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie and deserves to be important for every anime fan collection. Heck, even my mom enjoyed it.
