DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a huge surprise. It includes outstanding (especially undervalued) Callan actions, fine cinematography and a compelling story. In other words, it is one of the best fear efforts that arose in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models while he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother (who happens to have no hands and feet). If Callan dreams of killing, then the dead will rise, the photographer will doubt his own peace of mind ... but there is more to the picture than he sees. <br /> <br /> This film never deserved praise. Most critics and filmmakers stumble upon the barrel of films released at the same time, but it is much higher than the lost batch. It's smart and unique, which can't say anything like this genre movies, but it's also passionately designed and executed. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a pearl of its kind.
