This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being a LDS, I recommend this movie very well because you can feel the life of Joseph Smith better. Although the film was not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable and changing film that everyone can enjoy and appreciate. I saw this movie with my family and I can admit that we all have a heart change. This film really allows people to understand how difficult life was for the prophet and how much trouble he faced. After seeing this movie, there was no dry eye in the room. Everyone they saw touched me and I haven't seen it the same way. I recommend this movie to everyone.
