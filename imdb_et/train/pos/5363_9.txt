This is a classic act of action since the 1980s, where Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his most memorable roles. Place in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is "Running Man", where convicted infantry troops are hunted and killed for millions of entertainment. It is created as a game show where the audience will vote for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who wolf down and kill the exhibition's unhappy "contestants". Target audience also won prizes for the correct prediction that he kills. And the host is played by someone other than the family Feudi Richard Dawson, who is a gaming experience that makes him suitable for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is wrongly accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of classic Arnold's one-liners, like his famous "I'll be back before he enters the arena. And he will hit an armed stalker with a fire victim" How's the light? but I don't want to spoil the movie. It's funny stuff! <br /> <br /> Whether it was meant or not, this movie is a great parody of the madness of today's "Reality TV." There are already many programs that show people lasting Pain and humiliation for spectators' entertainment, and even court proceedings are passed on for their entertaining value. Running Man shows what would happen if reality TV hits the bottom and it is a scary picture. One can only hope that networks have common sense not to let it go far. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it from 9 out of 10!
