I went to this movie, thinking it would be a funny b-rated movie. I was surprised and very amused. Eva was good, but Bell Bell stole the show. He had amazing comic timing. The jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flats of fun. The plot was enough to tie it all, the woman (Eva) dies on her wedding day and returns to the woman who goes with her husband's spouse, it sounds far removed, but actually works pretty well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Generally it is worth watching a movie if it is not sent from a DVD when it comes out.
