Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is cutting edge ... I highly recommend this movie. My presentation was, in my opinion, the material of the Academy Award! The only real sad fact is that Universal has never seen this movie ever available in any video format, be it a tape or a DVD. They ignore a very good movie. But Universal has a very small library on the DVD, which is sad. If you have the opportunity to see it somewhere (not sure why it is rarely used with the cable), look at it! I'm not going to the story because I think most people would have an opinion about the movie and too many "reviewers" spend hours on the story that is available everywhere. <br /> <br /> The 10!
