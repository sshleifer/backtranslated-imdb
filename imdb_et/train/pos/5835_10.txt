Stan and Ollie become SAPS in SEA, when their tiny boat begins to lead the sorcerer. <br /> <br /> The boys in this feature are great, starting with one of their funniest sets, with a horn. Always a few steps to sync with the rest of the Creator, Laurel & Hardy lives in a world where, as a rule, icy radios and beds are no exception. With its short length, the film is more stylish with classical short themes explaining its episodic nature. <br /> <br /> Only boys get credit for the screen, but the movie mavens is recognized by other familiar faces: James Finlayson appears Richard Cramer makes his bad role complete justice when sweet Mary Gordon plays boys' embarrassment with a neighbor. This is Charlie Hall as a flathouse desk and the silent screen comic Ben Turpin depicts the most peculiar plumber. <br /> <br /> One of the film script writers was the quiet comedian Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> Stan Ollie, however, is the main focus. Hardy watching the horn sounds, or, for example, Laurel's bombs with bananas remind the viewer why these spouses remain absolute cinematographic giants.
