Do you know how Star Trek fans flocked to all Star Trek films, even very bad ones? Why? To see your heroes in action again. So I know Doc Savage. I am a great fanatic of the character and the prospect that Doc and his team to see in the adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the movie only raised this sense of expectation. Then they decided to throw elements into a number of Doc adventures and throw them into one movie, which resulted in a somewhat common film. There are many promises that are diluted by several unfortunate choices (music, "camp" elements, etc.). . So, in the long run, what I'm trying to say is that it's not a bad movie: it's not as good as it should have been. And anyone who is Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should review this movie to get to know the hero who gave them inspiration.
