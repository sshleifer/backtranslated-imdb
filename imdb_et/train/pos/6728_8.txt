I stumbled at this movie and was completely hooked. The story of the surfers who drive the big waves, the waves that are huge, the waves that make the rational person flee with terror, are what can be remarkable and make you understand why people spend their lives on waves. The film has nothing special to bring together very interesting people who are in love with what they do and let them talk. Of course, their scenes are surfing, but what makes this movie so special is people. Here are a bunch of boys who are so enthusiastic about what they are doing to exceed people's viewing. On the side of this movie you want to go and learn to surf. Few documentaries have ever succeeded in exhilarating the passion and films of those people that make us feel that it is an excellent film. Look at this.
