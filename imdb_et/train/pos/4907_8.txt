Well-done and imaginative production, released from clich√©s, is a somewhat piercing thing that tells the story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy in less than ideal conditions: a man who escaped a convict who has robbed a young man of his value as a hostage. Expertly directed by Alan Gibson, in a balanced narrative movement, the film is freshness in almost every scene, as Felon Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection of unfairness was particularly undesirable, creates a complex but ultimately successful evacuation plan following his spontaneous nature, when he flees to live on his childhood lake. Often, a song or a couple of steps will break that capricious Steckert gradually gets his trust and affection for his imprisonment, and if the police inevitably closes for display, the tethered couple will be seen to be much like their rejection in the form of their responses shown by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) who has been determined to help eagerly Police Lieutenant (James Coburn), responsible for Steckert and his "prisoner". This is an appealing story worth noting, a fast paced and novel adventure that benefits from the fine turns from Harris Capital, Wagner, Coburn, and Karen Black with Justin Henry, who has hit a boy with appropriate alertness. Wilfred Josephs and Frank Watti's cutting-edge cinematography, all of which are made in the beautiful Autumn of Ontario.
