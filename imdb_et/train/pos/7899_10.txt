It was a great movie. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. It had so many links, so many beautiful pictures and so much compassion on things that were not said. I was thoroughly entertained and feeling delighted as I am at the end of most of Tom Robbins' story. Now, I haven't read this particular Robbin book, so I'm not doing the way it was, but I can't imagine that this movie would have been a very bad interpretation. The movie left you a lot to define yourself, which is the best part of every Tom Robbins novel, dreaming about details. <br /> <br /> For all those who said it was still the worst movie, I'm sorry to have to leave a bit of dull light in your heart. Far from the worst movie, this film was glorious. Long live a crane.
