This movie is humorous, charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is barely a serious history lesson, so I just agree with it. Bing, with his usual unrepeatable style, performs quite well with a blacksmith, Hank Martin, who is accidentally transported to another age, King Arthur's time. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking as Alisande or Sandy, Hank's affectionate object, although she is engaged to the brave and frightening Sir Lancelot played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I just love the episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress in dressed up clothes and took high rides with their backpacks to experience the kingdom for the first time. King Arthur's comment, "I say, we're not alone", while giving good joy to your cheerful clothes, is one of the fun moments of the film. The portrayal of William Bendix is ​​extremely ridiculous, not to mention his peculiar "you Olde English". <br /> <br /> The story isn't deep, but I think it's well done and I enjoy it more every time I see it. This is a great family experience. <br /> <br />
