There are some comments about this movie that say it's bad and stupid, and such a great actor as Pierre Fresnay shouldn't have done. <br /> <br /> I think, on the contrary, Even if the film is strange and has some weaknesses, Pierre Fresnay's performance is so amazing that it makes the movie great. <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film has a very controversial scene of wine consecration in the cabaret. <br /> <br /> Someone who doesn't believe the priest? even a raised one? can change it in the blood of Christ, the scene is maybe odd. But someone who has grown up in a Catholic framework is very sensitive even if it is rather unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The scene of the younger priest's death is enormously shocking. But it has worked very well. Pierre Fresnay makes the act of a mad murder understand his character in time, tortured Morand, who in this terrible way returns to his duty.
