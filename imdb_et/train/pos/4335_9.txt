Oscar caliber Peter Falki's performance in writing with an Oscar caliber. I loved the nuanced and balanced study of a long-lasting marriage - how often do we get it in movies, where the film usually ends when the boy and the girl get together? It's an adult movie, a complicated view in the eyes of all parties - a husband, a son - how everyone in the past has adapted to each other and grew up during the story. In addition, he gave me about 10 big stomachs, and I am one of those people who usually sit in sleep when the rest of the audience laughs. It was one of the few really funny movies I've seen. Big, original jokes.
