The second film by Abhay Deol, written by Imtiaz Ali, directed by Shivam Nair. Soh is probably the first (?) Muscle Role of Megha, a girl who has traveled away from home and is waiting for Delhi's marriage at the registrar's office to meet her boyfriend Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi). He's waiting and waiting, and finally he's wet as Ankush (Abhay Deol) who's in trouble. They spend a lot of days together when he casts out another harassing situation and finally loves him. Then the boy returns! Aage pardey for dekhiye! Sound familiar? This is another adaptation of Dostoevsky's white doors by taking a small loan from Le Notti Bianch (albeit very small - Ankush keeps lovers on top of each other, telling the boy he's dead!). However, it is more earthy and more realistic (duh) adaptation than many mortgaged and overdone Saawariya. I don't know why nobody brought this little legacy when we all talked crazy about Saawariya a few months ago. <br /> <br /> Delhi settings are wonderful - there's an obligatory run through old Delhi, Jama Masjid shots on the roof, Connaught's circus, rickshaws from the streets (What? How?). The hotel's colorful lighting is enough to say it is a tedious common space that can be rented in an hour! <br /> <br /> The more I see Abhay, the more I like this young man. In this second film, she's pretty good at hiring a witness that a beautiful woman gives in life. She never looks beautiful, and when she smiles, she fits this role, but I found she was not convincing in the more serious moments. I'm not quite sure he has this big actor or maybe he's like a brother. Himesh Reshammiya's music is not so big and actually the movie's fans, they sort of cut off the narrative and don't sit well with the characters trying to sing. Support cast is great and I will give it a little bit of adaptation to the white evening. BTW - The fact that I love Abhay Deoli's cute butterflies is never related to my assessment.
