I didn't know what to expect from Ned Kelly, but he loved it completely. It was dark, dramatic and thrilling. It also seemed very authentic, I felt I had been transported back to the 1800s. I've never been much of a Heath Ledger fan, having seen him only in teenage movies, but he's quite convincing in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how a very enthusiastic boy became Australia's most notorious killer. Naomi Watts is a great supporter of Kelly's society. Very Recommended - And That's Aussie!
