"Lady from Shanghai" is known as one of Hollywood's most difficult productions. Welles' original cutting was taken out by the manufacturers and cut into ribbons. This made the story of the already mysterious secret even more difficult. They posted their dialogue because of the high density of Irish accent and duplication is too obvious and badly done. Most catastrophic, Welles and his screen and real-life lady Rita Hayworth fell in their relationship and their angry chemistry appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's all about how fantastic the Orson Welles direction is. He makes the movie incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene just seems to breathe back from the screen. Their characters and scenes are also so strange that they limit the dream and the surreal. This strange feeling raises the scenes that often occur in these films, such as those in the middle of the courtroom. I usually found dramas in the courtroom, but Welles' direction and peculiar touches make them as interesting as everything else. The carnival ends with almost David Lynch. <br /> <br /> Here too works great. Despite their unsuccessful relationship, Welles and Hayworth both give a decent performance - but their relationship is a bit flawed. Everyone else is great and nice to watch, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "Lady from Shanghai" is obviously a problem, but it is worth seeing one of the best cinema masters. (8/10)
