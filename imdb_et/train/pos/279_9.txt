I love the fact that this game can literally jump from where you play it. The way the screen pops and flashes when you reach is very realistic, while remembering that it's just a game and you're not really there. Sound effects and sound are amazing. Many weapons and spells have been cast, and you can even choose which weather is stronger or not. You get that stone that can hit enemies when you recover mana to break your enemies even more magical. The best part is that all the time you play it, you are really nervous and scared, which may lurk around the next corner or that may jump behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try turning it on with the headset.
