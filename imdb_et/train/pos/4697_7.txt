Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" in the start-up games made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays with her sick mother, Griffin Dunne is her DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other characters include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet shop owner in the 1930s who is catching a child who steals a puppy and tells him that he has been the owner of a pet store. He turned early to a young child to become a mother for pancreatic surgery ($ 49.95, special this week) and started working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the surname "Dangerously" in the mobile world. <br /> <br /> This movie has some fun scenes, and Stapleton is a rebellion when Johnny's non-smoker mother needs an organ in his body. Peter Boyle, like Johnny's boss, gives a very funny performance, such as Griffin Dunne, a straight arrow DA, who doesn't "play the ball" curve with Burr (Danny De Vito). Like Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is an extraordinary Moronie who tortures English - but you have to hear him, not read it. It's funny that he does it all with an angry face. <br /> <br /> The film is getting a little over, but it's worth noting, and Keaton is great as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this movie was undervalued when it appeared, and like Keaton's second gem, "Night Shift," you can't hear a lot about it today. With some of the performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find "Johnny Dangerously" enormously enjoyable.
