Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80s. This is a film that breathes amazing action and very interesting management trees. In Jacknife, European and American cinema lovers can find things to associate with. The scenario is very convincing and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is one of the greatest performers. He perfectly portrays his alcoholic hero, making us feel our broken heart in every row. Robert De Niro makes us think again of him as one of the greatest players in one of the simplest but most realistic stages of his career. Jacknife will never be bored because it will show its heroes that are not typical of Hollywood's typical character elements. There is no hero after the war. Everyone is a loser and this movie is in this simple truth. None of them can correct their words after the war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is the soul of the diseases that war creates. Just a great movie.
