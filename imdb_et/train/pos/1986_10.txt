Tour deforce! OK, baby playing Oliver is a little cute! Starting with great cinema, color, costumes, and the most impressive performances, it's a movie. I've seen many adjustments to this great novel, but it's up to them and musical to launch it! It is a masterful Fagan who never leaves his character a song. You never know whether you like it or not, the same feeling I found in the book. In other versions, you hate him from start to finish. Bill Sykes .... when you read the book, he's one and so he's in the movie. Oliver Reed was masterful. His wife led it in a masterpiece. I went and saw his latest film, the Gladiator, based on his many good performances, not to see the headquarters. Music is suitable for times and moods. Who is buying this beautiful movie? You should!
