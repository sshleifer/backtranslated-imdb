Brian Jonestown's massacre, recommended by Anton Newcombe, could be used with some care. Dig! who won the Sundance Jury Prize, we look at him and his band sabotaging for seven years, while former friends and contemporary Dandy Warholid will rise to a comparative size (mobile phone ad, anyway). <br /> <br /> What Raises Dig! There is a tremendous, almost biblical comic tragedy over his contemporaries: a depressing honest publication of art and commerce and a compromise. For all his "watches, I'm a bloody genius", Newcombe showed that he was a unique talented, as enormously restless musician - more talented than his rival, Dandy Courtney Taylor, who tells the picture. When Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Taylor Peter Fonda. <br /> <br /> Even sader, Taylor seems to understand what his tired, self-conscious voice is saying: he knows his band won the battle - but what's the cost? In fact, they sold out, made Indie-Lite records, kept their teeth nice and clean, and probably got used to their hair twice before going to bed - so they won a record contract and a big bus. And encouraging the credibility of the whole process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in a racket, is constantly interrupted, hitting team members on the stage, heckers on the head - and the last glimpse Dig! by the police, having lost the right to see his child. <br /> <br /> Two of the best films about rock sub-culture have been led by women: the fall of Penelope Spheerer's Western civilization and it? for a moment for the classic moment it appeared.
