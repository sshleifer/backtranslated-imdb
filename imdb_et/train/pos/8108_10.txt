I have D.V.D. and it's very clear compared to my VHS version. Sound is fair, but sometimes it can be difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie so much that I was looking for a copy of the book and found it. This gave details of why some things happened. The best things about the movie are the little things I didn't first notice. Like, for example, John Cabal, who is playing a toy plane during a Christmas party, as it was a diving bomber, made it to the sea, calling the battleship, "Dinosuar." Vessels sinking by air force, attacking undeclared enemies by airplanes. Winged planes flying in the wings. Strong rolls for women throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There's more to watch the movie to enjoy.
