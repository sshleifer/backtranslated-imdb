I know there are some purists who poo poo something that is not exactly the same as the original, but sometimes spin-offs can stick to their own. I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar to the Japanese version, but at the same time it fits the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator because he explains things in elegance. Iron Chefs itself is very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at that time, but Bobby Flay is the only American iron chef who wins them. Mario Batali seems to be the most fun in cooking, commenting and making fun. I've been following the series and found that all players work well. Judges are not always the best choices. There are some exceptions, as the lawyer turned to food, but most judges are interviewed if they can do what is delivered. I like to look at chefs' excitement and the challenge is surprising. The end result is always amazing and sometimes it inspires the kitchen. Perhaps it is anyone who can ask if you really want to eat what you earn. The only thing I would actually do about the series is to ask people to show them a little lighter. Sometimes the mood becomes a bit overstretched and it is not always fun to watch if you expect more entertainment. I liked this version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was both top and original, but I can say that it was a pretty expensive proposition. I wish she had been with this version and was a host - Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, which would hurt me for hours. As long as you don't expect the original Japanese version and you can take this series on your own, it may be a pleasant hour.
