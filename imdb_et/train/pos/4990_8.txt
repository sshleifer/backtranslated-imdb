As other reviews have pointed out, this is an unfairly neglected depression film. Directed by Frank Borzage (Two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave to Heaven, Western People, Lifeboat, etc.), it is a heavy-minded, well-structured and realized movement around New York City citizens. They are grifters, beggars and women forced into prostitution, but they are as good as a bad community of people whose loyalty is just as difficult as each group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main feature of this admirable feature of this movie is the contrast between Spencer Tracy's Bill Bill and Loretta Young's Trina. He spoke hard, physically aggressive and obviously fearless, but Bill is not the character who gives this film its vitality. While he's using it, Trina actually hangs tight (if this term can be applied as a woman-like sign). His commitment to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she pulls out when she wants to leave, or "I'll even give the baby down if you're just happy." This is Loretta Young's performance (at the age of 20), quite simple in nature, that she does not seem weak or addicted, but rather a woman who knows happiness when she finds it and does not want anything more.
