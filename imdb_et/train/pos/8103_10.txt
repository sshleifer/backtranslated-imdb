it was the most expensive film in the making. Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells were both unhappy because of their bad ratings --- for good reason. it was and still goes far beyond its time. Aside from the seemingly bad direction, probably from editing, the beginning of the work begins with the end of stunning. <br /> <br /> The role of Sir Ralph Richardson's "Boss", or even better, of his wife, Sir Cedric, who is a spacecraft, Raymond Massey's "John Cabali" --- all give a great show. <br /> <br /> Mr. Repeat an incomparable, little girl-child running out to an absolutely "inappropriate" scene, commenting on "Life just becomes loving and loving"? it quickly brings tears to every parent / grandparent. it is not a movie for young people unless "experienced" and rather those who have seen "horror". <br /> <br /> I'm sure the "counterfeit parachute" looks like a hokey --- "magnetic cannon", now called "mass leader", can be seen as ridiculous compared to missiles --- gives Sir Korda a break - sir. Wells made that choice. and +/- $ 8 million, this film went beyond the "budget budget" --- so that it focused on what it can manage. <br /> <br /> The true power of this greatest cinema is John's Cabal's final statement of human destiny - his friend "Passworthy" doubts the wisdom of passing through space, saying, "We are such small animals." John Cabal's correct answer is (paraphrased) "Yes, small animals, and if that's all we have, we have to live and die like that." They stand under a large astronomical telescope. he wipes his hand over the night sky. "However, we may have everything in the Universe or nothing." - the end date is interrupted --- "What is it?" --- It is not "Star Wars", "Blade Runner" --- something that can be considered "Great" --- it's a real thing. I remember all Steven Hawking's last address from his last "medal of prize" --- "Humanity has to leave the country or die." - The core of this work - I love "standard entertainment" --- but "relic" for a wise viewer "What is it?" Be in the right mood --- whatever it takes - it takes your soul --- i guarontee - generally for humanity - the most important cinema. that many have commented on the "media quality" of "surviving" examples. In the 1980s, I developed a "patented" coloring process that required a "pure" original, which led me to Michael Korda, who unfortunately stated that everything had gone --- so we have to enjoy what is "sad but true".
