I have to mention two flaws so you understand that this movie was a great success when they failed: "Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you get excited about these two movie concepts and feel frustrated (like me), you probably enjoy the Renaissance. It will put you in the future world of Paris. It's not quite dystopian. They did the animation so well that I thought it was a rotoscope, but what I could say was not, it was just catching the movement. Facial expressions are amazing! Not because TRON has seen a fantasy world that is so well featured in animation / live hybrid. Black-and-white media is used to focus attention slowly on a scene object; my favorite effect was what they did with the lights. The director plays your attention and confusion, but you are finally happy to find what he wants to find. The overall impact is a harsh and sharp urban area filled with small surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but it's not terrible. This is noir-ish. For most major characters, there is a background that gives them some depth. There are spells. There is a "set" so you can feel at different places in Paris. There are some steps and even a car chase. I have to look at it again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to view it because the "kit" is detailed and the credit is small.
