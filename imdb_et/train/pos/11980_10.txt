Full House was and still is a great show. It is a good show for people of all ages and it is also a good family activity. There really aren't any examples like this anymore. The kids are very cute, and while it's a little cheesy, it's still good, especially for anyone who watched this baby. I would like to see the cast interview now. Anyone who wants to see some kind of interviews about the special features of DVDs, such as those they are writing now, should go to the petitions website and sign a plenary statement on the DVD, as there is a statement in the hope that the assignment can do so. Yay for a full house!
