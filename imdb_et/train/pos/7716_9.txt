It is a good reason that Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew of a relief ship that he does not dare to forget. <br /> <br /> Like Doctor Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last surviving expedition. this planet 20 years earlier. Since then, he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, Anne Francis. They are the only people who left this planet, once the home world of ancient civilization, known as Krellina. <br /> <br /> The documents decoded by Pidgeon show that Krell reached the cataclysmic end of unknown origin. The machines they left are still working. <br /> <br /> Maybe it works too well when members of the embossing party begin to die and especially mercifully. <br /> <br /> I see any speculation about reprocessing, and this is one movie that can't be redeemed because it's as fresh as 1956. The conditions would change, we would say now, instead of the hyper drive, speed is considered to be due to the constant popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We may not see men on a spacecraft as an airplane plank on a relief expedition. It may seem much more like a Starship Enterprise or Ship from 2001 on a Space Odyssey. It is interesting to look at science fiction from different generations and see how future concepts change. <br /> <br /> The story of Forbidden Planet is timeless, because mortal beings are trying to play God. /> <br /> You cannot write a forbidden planet without commenting on Robby's robot. The mechanical admiration that Pidgeon put together with Krell's knowledge of learning was quite a daytime society. He got a new lease in the sixties, which was a robot of lost space. His scenes with Earl Holliman, who plays the spacecraft's cook and his adherence to Earl's wish for some spirits, are very funny. <br /> <br /> Robby and other special effects were assigned to the Oscar, but they lost the Ten Commandments and the Red Sea. The forbidden planet is badly succeeded by a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeM. <br /> <br /> Among you, the classicists recognize the futuristic reprocessing of the banned planet as Tempurs, which you think could have been one of Shakespeare's risks in scientific literature. <br /> <br /> My favorite is Warren Stevens, who is sacrificing Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what she's doing. <br /> <br /> Never miss it when it is delivered.
