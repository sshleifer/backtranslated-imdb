Now my friends, movies like "La BÃªte" (also called "Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be done on the old continent :), in this movie we see everyone: horses dirty sex, nymphoma solution from gorilla, no dialogues, etc. etc. etc. In this serious sense, in its allegory that men can sometimes be emotional, visceral and cruel, Walerian Borowczyk (Director) shows us innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It's an amazing movie experience, odd and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of shocking exploitation in Europe, I recommend this movie. If you like it, I suggest: "Orloff against the invisible person" and "Modified countries".
