Immediately after seeing the film, the real magical feeling of the Walt Disney films came to me and I realized that I had long been seeing "true" magic in the film. <br /> <br /> The right combination of music, speech and magic effects brings Disney back into your body. Of the very special things I saw when the unconscious effects of the film started with the Disney logo, which changed into the Cinderella Castle and ended with an old story telling my father's parents. <br /> <br /> Magic has come back inside me. I appreciate this movie from 8 out of 10.
