My father was a prisoner (now retired) introduced to this documentary and I have grown up in prison, so maybe my views are completely different from everyone else watching this movie. I say this, those filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute wonder are fantastic artists and even better people. They were bold enough for A. Show and Tell This Story, B) Enter the Minds and Hearts of these Prisoners and C) Do it All Responsibly. Responsible for their art, and more importantly, Luther Lucketti is responsible for the correction complex for prisoners and employees. They should be praised for the end of this work. 170 hours, yes HOURS, video and it can be cut and moistened up to 93 riveting minutes is nothing extraordinary and they have my utmost respect. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on terms that only very few could see. I was in prison for screening. I was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts pour on the screen. I saw men crying in front of my television and let me tell you this was a very profound experience. These men have in some cases committed terrible crimes, but have found ways to redeem themselves, even if they see themselves free. How many of us have the courage to do this? How many people could be made in such a harsh environment that they have done? To see them in the film was an experience I am grateful forever and I will never forget it. I thank the men who allowed me to take a look at my life, thank my dad for doing it all, and thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour his blood, sweat, soul and tears into this project. /> <br /> This movie changes everything you think you know about prison life and the prisoners. Oz is not real, television is not real. "Shakespeare Behind Bars" is.
