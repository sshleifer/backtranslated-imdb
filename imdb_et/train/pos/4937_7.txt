This movie is actually relevant today, given the danger of biological terrorism and the danger of superbugs, Western Nile virus and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are mostly used for their tasks. The home scenes between Widmark and his wife give a nice difference to the main plot. The actor of this film, who mostly left his brand, is Jack Palance. His sharply defined traits and seemingly easy to exclude exterior always wilt to expose the embarrassing and cruel man under the surface. Packing station mileage is impressive today. Recommended, 7/10.
