Not surprisingly, the writer / director Michael Powell considered "the problem of life and death", his enchanting fantasy of Emeric Pressburg 1946 being the favorite of his films. A colorful romantic adventure released after the Second World War would have only given the tonic to the traumatized, renewable people who need a good rise. <br /> <br /> Following other patriotic warfare films, "Runners made it one of their royal, skittish and most patriotic. British support (Shakespeare, beer, honest games, good practices) is British, too. also in American Baroque compositions, technical invention, and subtle ethnic pain. <br /> <br /> Strange repeats of the classic 1946: "It's a wonderful life," AMOLAD opens with great certainty, one of the joyous voice commands that preach the earth and Heaven and what a great, wonderful world we live in. <br /> <br /> It will then be cut into the interior of the British Cabin, hit, with the fire and the co-pilot already dead. It sounds wrong, but the connection will soon be understood by the following events. > <br /> Approximately 5 minutes, a quick fire British pilot between Peter (David Niven) and American Radio, June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in his intimacy. swimming, magic, and outstanding adoration, and his warm engagement with June ending with a mutual exchange "I Love You." <br /> <br /> By escaping the magic of the moment, Peter, following his conductor 71, whose task was to transport him to "The Second World", escapes Death and finds himself on the beach hard. Later he met a bicycle ride in June and immediately fits with the body. <br /> <br /> But in realizing your mistake, the High Court wants Peter to be sent back and order the French conductor (Maurice Goring) underground to restore him. But Peter is living behind the June and Conductor error and deliberately watches his corner. <br /> <br /> The fate of Peter is ultimately the heavenly court and the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey) whose jury consists of several dead heroes and large British delegates. A surreal test that dissolves b / w back to a rich Technicolor can be a dream, but the final illness in the hospital confirms the predictable outcome. <br /> <br /> Abstract, the picture is filled up "from the stairs to the sky" (title of the American movie) twice: for the first time b / ws, when it raises Peter and his mysterious French guardian, crossing the huge statues of potential Peter's lawyers, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the softly lit staircase gives the cinema an iconic image of the device - Peter and June froze side by side, their admired eyes fixed in front of the frame, their fate closed. <br /> <br /> The unlikely affection between Peter and June will never become shiny or verbal; it is processed by nobility and perception that the couple are already married enough to be married and just need to convince people of their love so that they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor, who can freeze the time and the human body, captures many of their main moments by teaching Peter about his history and his terrible tricks by pushing Peter's "Top 100 Game Tricks" book and his coffee cup. <br /> <br /> As visually inspired by other Powell / Pressburger collaboration projects, did it first combine color b / w? the latter has a joyful quality when used for sky scenes, and both are equally exciting. <br /> <br /> An outstanding script is more than an imaginative complete design, with a dialog that sounds as if it is not, it doesn't feel written or executed on the screen. Fun and funny, Powell's / Pressburger's writing deserves equal recognition with his color and composition. <br /> <br /> Made in 1946, "The Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that doesn't do that. fresh and inventive, even in the age group where CGI would increase its artificial consequences, probably removing them from emotional wonder. Other changes affecting change would mean the need to reduce the average cut in seconds and the inevitable statement to shorten the dialogue so that it keeps the attention of most target groups low. Powell weaves a spell that unconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experiment with images without the logical development of Peter's failure.
