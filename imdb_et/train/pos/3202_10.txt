I don't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie. Why do they think it is so bad and so on. It is no worse than anything else there. Personally, I think "Soldier" is a great movie that is much better than most other movies in the same genre. <br /> <br /> Reasons why I liked the "soldier": script Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects and leadership (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I even think this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who has previously been an entertaining "Mortal Kombat" and not so much a fun "Event Horizon".
