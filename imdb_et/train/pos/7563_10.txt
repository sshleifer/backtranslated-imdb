The independent feature can now be seen in the work of cinematography and the continuation of video. Enter Broken, aggressively advocated, with 20-minute short style and enthusiasm. But is it a good movie, or does it only work as a demo piece? Ah, there's a rub. ). If he is in captivity, it is obvious that his robbers know things about him that he himself didn't even know. While they are questioning him, the black-clad soldier tries to hide his attempt to save him. Mayhem followed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he is doing, or at least he is very good at it. Fractures do not suffer from a lack of visual vision, which is particularly commendable given its budget and the inexperience of all involved. What he suffers is weak and a derivative. Think about a long kiss Goodnight will meet with the Matrix, written ten minutes after Fight Club reading. The good news for Ferrari and the producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the story elements are easily overlooked when the eye candies become apparent. Is the plot really very important for twenty minutes to show the creators' technical skills? No, really not. <br /> <br /> Although it would be unfair for me to look at the negative aspects of film budgeting and length. Broken is not a classic genre. The biggest problem was that it actually worked better as a full-length feature. The final "twisting" does not get enough time to be shocking. When Ferrari was allowed time to burn the function slowly, the elements of the plot seem less random and the film is more complete. It is known here that he will be able to. <br /> <br /> Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is another indie in the world. I've never heard such an aggressive environment ever from such small features. The Matrix-inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep, firearms have shocks and even dialogue is spatial. Of all the songs on this disc, today's independent DVD production is praised. It also comes with an equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track, which is the default menu. <br /> <br /> Attachments The features on this disc are literally hours. In fact, there are so many additions that I find it unrealistic to list and describe them all here, while waiting for my readers to continue reading. Regardless of the actual short possibilities, the DVD is unprecedented in informative resources. People who enjoy the film can learn everything they know about the production, including everything from conceptual art to advertising. Those who intend to make their own indie movie can learn everything they need about their qualities. <br /> <br /> Attachments are divided into categorical menus. These include: pre-production, manufacturing, post-production after short and cast and team biocides. From a critical point of view, I found that some sections were quite short. If they had edited one menu option, they would have been less depressing when navigating because the cursor has selected the top option by default when each main item returns to the menu. Of course, it's just nitpicking, but perhaps for future DVDs, filmmakers will advise their hearts. <br /> <br /> He has six voice comments and interviews and talented people, and despite the consonant Sales, their true colors are out. <br /> <br /> The willingness to share your movie-making secrets with anyone who picks up this DVD is quite generous. From the extras I learned what editing and effect software is the most reliable and efficient, which brand makes the most professional look at the lowest price, even when getting a cheap air soft weapon. In addition, I was given several alternative options if I could not find the products to be used in this production. Wannabe filmmakers who don't want to read a book on this topic could watch this DVD. <br /> <br /> Generally, I have created a real short of 6 out of 10, but I would like to have the opportunity for the length of the function and the effort, because I would be in these areas 8 or 9. I recommend a DVD with its features and excellent as an example of what can be done for just $ 8,000. Those who buy a DVD can think of themselves as the ghost producers of a larger project, because the more attention they pay, the more funding the game-length version.
