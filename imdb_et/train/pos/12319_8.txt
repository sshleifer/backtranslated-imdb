First of all, the female driver is too proud to leave it. Now there is actress Wang Zu Xian, who played in the film Xiao Qian, 42 years old and well-aged. It is always good to watch these brilliant times when you see such old school productions in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential titles in the 1980s. The art set and other aesthetic aspects are all pleasing. Even more fantastic the movie was black black humorous. It looks like a horror movie, but ultimately it's not scary, but just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating another Chinese Ghotst story and I thought the script was a decent script. But when I saw the movie, I was first disappointed when I saw the film differently from the script, as well as on a smaller scale and involving more comic roles. However, it turned out to be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the Lord of the rings, you will notice the similarities of this movie with LOTR. The climax is like Miranda Otto's mirror that fights with Ring Witch. This is certainly ridiculous. Bravo!
