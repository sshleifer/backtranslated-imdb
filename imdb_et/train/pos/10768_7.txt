I saw it back at the age when I was younger and could never remember the title until one day I was caught out of John Candy's film credit at IMDb and noticed that the title was "Once a crime ...". Something called the clock and I clicked on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back many memories. <br /> <br /> I found that it is pretty well aged, despite the fact that it's not about "great" comedy. However, it is quite enjoyable and is a good reef in Hitchcock's false identity and global excitement. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of characters in the movie, including an American couple who finds a female dog in Europe while on holiday and decides to pay her back - just to find her body on arrival. There's a plot and a quieter plot and they run after the police think they are killers. <br /> <br /> Some confusion "This is Mad Mad Mad Mad World" and a lighter Hitchcock feature, led by Eugene Levy and managed to get some of her good friends - such as John Candy - to celebrate. The film is mostly due to its casting, and at the end there is a funny little twist that is not completely unpredictable, but is also unexpected.
