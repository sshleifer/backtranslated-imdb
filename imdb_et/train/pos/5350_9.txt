I have seen Running Man several times as a fan of Stephen King and I have all my movies, but now it is even better, because up to 2 days ago I didn't know this website and I didn't know that Paul Michael The Glaser associated with this movie was the same Paul Michael Glaser, whom I watch in Starsky and Hutch's TV show. For me, this is a pleasant surprise because I can't tell you how many times I shouted when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode where Starsky (killing Starsky) almost died cried so hard that my father had to turn away for the show. What do you expect from a 12-year-old child? I'm deliberately looking for movies and programs that include Paul or David Soul and something that Stephen King owns, so I'm so !!!!!!!! I have to say happy birthday to Paul !!!!!
