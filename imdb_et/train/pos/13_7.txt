Quality Production, Cast, Prerequisite, Authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) The local and lush John Williams score should have led to a 3-4 star collection. Unfortunately, we all had a satisfying 2-star "decent" flick, mostly memorable for what he was trying to do .......... The local town and the story of ordinary people is in itself a genre, and if well done, satisfies most adults. Jane Fonda could not hide her pointlessness enough to believe her character. I was wondering why he didn't graduate in Yale, instead of working at Waterbury's factories. The character of Robert DiNiro was a bit too natural. An illiterate, handsome loser who actually turns out to be with the help of Jane's character, Henry Ford or Thomas Edison's 1990 version. <br /> <br /> This genre has been more successfully dealt with "Nobody's Fool" in the mid-90s and this year (2003) "Schmidt". I want the main studio saunas to try out more posts for young people and reserve a few screens for several cinema complexes in their efforts <br /> <br /> I'll give her an "A" effort.
