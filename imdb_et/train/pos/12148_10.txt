There's a lot of comedy in this movie, not the blind and Gordon Liu. She shows her comic and it was really weird when I saw her. His training is "unusual" and who would have thought that knot tying could be so deadly? Lots of great tricks and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mix and you have a fantastic final showdown! Do not mix Manchu cutters; they are ruthless!
