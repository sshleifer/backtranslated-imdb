Hi, I watched this movie today 14 days after 3 days. I'm a history teacher with too much time on my hands. I need life. I found a movie that contained a striking resemblance to break the mountain. I also found that I see a lot like Jean Lafitte if he was white. also my favorite line in the movie was Mr. Petey - "this baby can take pictures of the shipyard's eye from 300 meters!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British came, and one drummer who was so committed to his work, and he drummed up to death, as if the drum ended the war. it wouldn't be. well, that's all I would like to say about this movie. Oh, another thing..bonnie brown is a crazy physical bipolar mood that turns BEEYOTCH. That is all.
