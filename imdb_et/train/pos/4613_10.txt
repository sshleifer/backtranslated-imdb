This movie is one of the cheesiest plots I've seen. For me, it's so awesome! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in their original Munsters series. Although there were fewer strokes, they still did a great job with "comedically". I would like Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, to have more land involved. He showed that he could make comedy in the original series, but that movie was mostly wasted. This film also marks the great Sid-Caesar, but unfortunately he has no communication with Gwynne and Lewis. I think it could have been a better job.
