I remember the original series vividly mostly because of the unique mix of nervous humor and horrible theme. Kolchak was a peeled journalist at Ben Heche's metropolitan schools, and his brilliant decision and wise supplier made the most common episode to be closely watched. My personal fave was "Murder of Spanish Mosses" because it is completely original. Poor, worrying Cajun young people from Louisiana Bayou participate in dream expertise for dream analysis. Something goes on inexplicably wrong and he literally dreams of living a sex creature who lives in the dark folk songs of his youth. This malicious expression is looking for all those who have consciously violated their dreamers, and brutally stifles them to death. Kolchak explores and discovers this terrible truth, a lot of police captain Joe's "Mad Dogi" Siska (a wonderful essay by Keenan Wynn) and the head coach of another city, Severn Darden, to undermine, underestimate perfection. The viciously funny, harrowing final takes place in Chicago's sewer system and is a series of highlighting. Kolchak never got better. Timeless.
