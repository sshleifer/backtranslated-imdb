Such documentaries are often very opinionative. This film seems to take all the opinions out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It is sad that these poor people have to work, this film does a great job of showing the sweaty side of the sweat shops. Film Mardi Gras: Made in China was a good way to show the world how anything so small as beads for a party can affect the lives of so many other people. <br /> <br /> I had to watch it in English for a movie where we spent our time in sweat shops and how some people try to eliminate them, and this movie helped run the topic. It was a great, very informative film, and I would recommend anyone to see it, it will open your eyes.
