When "Caligar's Cabinet" is the father of all horror films (and German expressionist cinema), this pre-WWI movie is a grandfather. The stubborn title student makes a fucking co-operation with the devil - the devil gives him a bottomless bag of gold in exchange for "something in this room." The devil chooses the reflection of the student in her mirror. He leaves with the student's doppelganger, who commits a crime for which the student is accused. <br /> <br /> The film is subject to some limitations due to the technically primitive state of the 1913 film; The plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects, but the film is indispensable for almost any hidden daylight. However, the scene where the reflection reflects is still hidden in the wall. <br /> <br /> More interesting trends, if it is in its own interest, are still worth the student of Prague.
