I'm surprised at how this film (and most others have an average of 5 stars and lower than the IMDbis's average of 7 to 10 stars). ex-girlfriend said this movie is questionable. A year later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying it. even laughing quite a bit.It and replacing Killers are films that had been tagged by director Antoine Fuquat as black Michael Bay I don't see that since most of Fuqua's films are smarter than what Michael Bay has created, there are ... < br /> <br /> story: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a former convicted offender who was not used by a meaningless Treasury Representative Edgar (David Morse) to get a killer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson), Alvin's move is followed by an error after an accident mounted on his jaw. Bristol is after the golden bricks taken from the terrible thunder <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is both funny and Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a quick speaker who is much smarter than he promises. Doug Hutchinson is like Bristol. He may sometimes be in the position of John Malkovitchesque. He was better here than he was at Looney Bin Jim in the Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is a hard-tipped Treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. He and Jamie had some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only movie error is some attempts to fall on the thriller. The horse racing scenario is overall, but I couldn't look at it. The director went out there to get points for it. Plus the bomb scene with the Treasury agent associated with the chair when the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty. <br /> <br /> All Bait is not a bad movie with a long shot. It's never boring, always funny, and I didn't check my watch every minute. It should take something into consideration. Bait is one of the most underrated films of the year 2000. <br /> <br /> PS: For an observer of this movie who claimed that this movie is too violent ... How long have you been living under rock? I'm pretty sure you've seen Quentin Tarantino Die Hard and every movie. But are these films not violent? Weirdo.
