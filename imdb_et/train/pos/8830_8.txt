This is a masterpiece made with a B / W 35mm film. In the film, you see a strange opportunity to start the day at 7:35 am and how many things can happen in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> A short, amazing story will take you through a tricky story using very few elements, and step by step will realize that nothing is absolutely right. It expresses a great deal, makes your adrenaline high with a fine detail and is understandable to everyone, not just cinema critics. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: European short, black and white and low budget. Don't let it scare you. Is it really worth seeing someone, not just genre experts? <br /> <br /> Not much more to say, because the movie lasts exactly 8 minutes (exactly) and I don't want to spoil it. But I just watched it online and I didn't understand why nobody spent a few minutes posting a comment on it. <br /> <br /> It's really worth looking at. 10/10.
