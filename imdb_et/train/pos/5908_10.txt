This is one of the most outstanding films I've seen lately. Moves higher even from any international film of reputation. I am really surprised at why it has not received this recognition. Sonali Kulkarni, who won the National Award, is perhaps the only comforting fact. Renuka Daftardar is just amazed when she speaks through her eyes. There are a couple of scenes that stand out: when Gauri returns to the town of Krishna, he and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna observes Gauri's change, but no line of dialogue. The whole range of emotions is carried out in a subtle manner and on the eyes. Finally, there is another when Krishna asks Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gaur. If you don't move this scene, you don't have a heart. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this movie that gives you the brilliance and the ability to make a great movie.
