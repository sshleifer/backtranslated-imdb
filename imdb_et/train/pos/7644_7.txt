Jim Belushi is terrible as an "average Joe" who gets his "Twilight Zone" for 15 minutes. Michael Cane is a mysterious bar offering who not only listens to Belush's "story", but also has a "cure" for all Belush middle class problems: a magical drinking to bring the life changes of Belush into an avalanche. <br /> <Br /> Flashbacks shows a 15-year-old disgracefully that he defeated his high school baseball team championship. Belushi continues his "merciless life", seemingly happy, but always thought, "what if ..." What seems to be several days, Belush experiences a "different" life that is tremendously successful, admires and hates others in equal measure. <br /> <br /> It's not really "it's a wonderful life", but some elements are similar and very pleasing. "End" is predictable but still satisfactory. See a little young Cortney Cox as a "deadly attraction" - like another woman. Very nice movie!
