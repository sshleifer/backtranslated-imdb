The narrative affirms the classic good and evil image that the brother is fighting against the brother. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart represents justice and justice. His brother, who works under the staff of the Dutch Henry Brown, plays Stephen McNally, a classic director who kidnapped the western law that his brother drove for killing their father. The world in which the story takes place is a classic dystopia in the West, where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their side walls as soon as they enter the city, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic Western lawyer Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> There are also western-like flat characters like the murderous Indian warrior, a demonized cavalry, and a girl with a cupboard. Another important film archetype that gives the film a name is the custom Winchester rifle. A weapon can be seen as an allegory for those awards that do respectable things. If it is stolen from a legitimate owner, this tragedy will bring anyone who comes into contact with it. In this sense, he resembles others such as the sacred Grails in the lost Ark Raiders and the Saving Private Ryan-colored letter. This gives the film an element of surrealism that is usually absent from the west, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> Being primarily a revenge movie, it shares this element with many other genre examples, such as Jack Arnold's name Bullet and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> Winchester also has a silent rape theme. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the movie villains that Dan Duryea played very effectively, kidnaps a woman after killing her husband. Flying cowboy toys equipped with a husband's husband and send him like a flock of caricature that plays with an insect before he hits his head. Waco Johnny Dean finally gets what comes with him after he comes in contact with a malicious Winchester rifle. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 resembles a mythological story of Jason and his quest for a golden fleece, as Apollonius' Argonautica said. Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object with some intangible quality. Like Jason, the Stewart Hoop comes from one adventure, looking for a one-a-a-type prize. Another Winchester '73 theme, similar to the mythical story, is the brotherly struggle. There are a number of antiquity stories on this subject, such as the Hebrew Bible story of Cain and Abel, and the story of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> With regard to the subject of abduction and rape in Anthony Mann's film, it exists in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europa, as Ovid said in his Metamorphosis. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is an excellent example of a Western genre and is an objective correlation with many classic American western and ancient mythological topics.
