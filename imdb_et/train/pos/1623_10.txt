This is a comic that could have won instead of Country Cousin. Visually well made and more fun and memorable. Just watch music! Although there are elements that will undoubtedly begin to crush some of these days, a bit of perspective needs to be given to the comic. It's over sixty years old and after all it's just a comic. I'm forbidden and if I was as hypersensitive as people watching such a comic and eye, I would have long been put in a fetal position and disappeared. Sometimes you need to lighten up, put your head back and bathe! The caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost terribly flattering. Bing Crosby allegedly hated it when used more than once. * SIGH *
