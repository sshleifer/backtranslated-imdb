Lovely surprise! I was waiting for another drop on the line: Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overheated film. Perhaps it is so little accepted that this new type of Bruckheimer fare has been approved. Smart dialogue instead of one gentle liner, a decent background / motivation instead of shaking-n-baked stereotypes, and when the chase came, it was really thirsty. Fanboys is waiting for Armageddon's wheelbarrow: away. This is one of the more intelligent action fans. It didn't even bother me that Jolie appeared so little.
