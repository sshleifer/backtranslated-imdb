Michelle Rodrigez was created for this movie when I saw her for the first time Fast and the Furious. You can say he's a tough woman. Not only has she proved her acting with this film, she is not showing fear and being as hard as she should be in this movie. She's a more bad girl and I like it. This movie is a worrying girl who lives as a boy and gets into constant trouble with school and family. Since he is interested in training his brothers to be a boxer, he decides to fight for his love and asks his brother's trainer to train him. Although they do not believe it has the potential, it is shown that it is wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a bit slow at the end, but it was well done. This shows that people can do something, even if they don't believe you have the potential. I suggest you see it.
