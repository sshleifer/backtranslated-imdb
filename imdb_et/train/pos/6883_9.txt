In rare cases, a film that has the ability to expand your mind will warm your heart and touch the soul. "LOU" is such a movie. I got a "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor in the film industry. He looked at it a second time with me. We were both amazed. Its like the first time again. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical piece designed to send you back to the point where all your dramas started. It does this by being relentlessly fun. Bret Carri's behavior and pace as a director will not let you look away from the screen. He deals with a character that breaks the bug with a rabbit, innocent of innocence, but warmly bears such an insignificant sincerity that you forget to watch a movie. When the epiphany hit the brilliant peak, I saw tears the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach I facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film is a must-see for life coaches and anyone looking for their personal growth and transformation. It is a brilliant and creative masterpiece that has the ability to change life!
