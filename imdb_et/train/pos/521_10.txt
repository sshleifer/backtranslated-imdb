This is probably one of the most original love stories I've ever seen, especially in the case of a war-based (short-term) movie. Basically, this story, based on two worlds, one is obviously real, the other is fictitious, but the filmmakers say at first that it's just a coincidence if it's a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (big David Niven) was going to fall on the plane, talked to the June (Kim Hunter on the Apeside planet) before he saved and said he loved him. He had to die jumping without parachute, but somehow he lived, and now he sees in June and loves meat in June. This second place, like the sky, is unhappy because he survived and had to come to his world so they sent French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to go, but he's probably in love. Peter suggests to him that he should file a complaint to keep his life in another world court. Apparently love prevails when two lovers say they die for each other, even in June they even offer their place! Also Robert Coote Bob Trubshawena, Kathleen Byron as Angel, short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as English pilot and Abraham Sofaer as judge / surgeon. David Niven was number 50 among the largest British actors, the film number 100, which was the 100th largest Tearjerker for a lucky end, it was number 47 The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 46 The 50 Greatest British Films and 100 of the biggest films were number 59 Outstanding!
