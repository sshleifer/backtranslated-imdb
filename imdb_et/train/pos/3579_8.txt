Stone Boy is almost forgotten drama in the 1980s. Considering how many famous or soon-known people are in the film, one might ask how it could have been so neglected. It's a slow, desperate but touching tragedy for the farm's family. The film is more or less the accusation of the Stolistic values ​​of the West-West and the suppression of emotions. The film may not be for every taste, but anyone who appreciates the true human drama should like it. <br /> <br /> In the early moments of the movie, we see two brothers in the early morning to pick some peas and maybe shoot two or two if they're happy. While climbing through the barbed wire fence, the weapon accidentally leaves and the younger boy kills his older brother deadly. These boys have probably never taken the hunter's safety. The way the two men properly through the garden, like one weapon, would be: The first man climbs out. Another man gives him a gun through the garden. The first man puts the gun down and helps the other through the garden. At some point, neither man should arm a weapon or a fence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when his brother is killed, 12-year-old Arnold comes down to his world. She can't even help after putting her brother down. He just goes on and chooses peas and tells his family about the accident later. Under no circumstances does Arnold feel any regret or sadness at the time of the funeral or investigation. His family seems to have light on him. Maybe they are even angry to kill his brother. The ornithic uncle played by Frederick Forr is upset with Arnold, although the death of his older brother allows him to hit a child's girlfriend. Arnold's parents don't understand how to deal with their son. They don't even try to talk to him. The only person with whom he can communicate is his grandfather, played by Wilford Brimley's typical grandfatherly skill. After a while Arnold even moves with an old timer. <br /> <br /> It seems that Arnold will not open until he takes a strange journey to Reno Nevada to unexplainedly search for his uncle's ex-wife. When she meets her, she starts to get out of her cream when she apologizes for breaking her marriage, starting with a family-wide accident. Since then, the film has become a quick reconciliation and revival study. <br /> <br /> Action in most cases is strangely distant. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close make the perfect stoic farm a parent. Forrest is good, but maybe too hard for Paul Newman's performance in Hudis. The film is also exceptional. If you like moody pictures of traditional folk, it may be for you. Some may even recommend some tissues to bring. 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
