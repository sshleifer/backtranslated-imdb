I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné ... almost everything has been said about the film, but there is one detail I would like to shed light on: real, still standing videos, Hôtel du Nord (is it still? I heard it had to be demolished ...) used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt, the main reason being that they couldn't stop the St Martin channel traffic for several weeks.
