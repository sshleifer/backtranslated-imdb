"Show People" is an absolutely pleasant silence led by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What gems are both in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose behavior is to talk about Savannah, who is trying to do it on the big screen. Although he is successful in comedy, he does that he makes "art" so that he moves to a high art studio. Soon he will become Patricia Pepoir and too good friend Billy likes. <br /> <br /> Many silent era stars are "Show People", including Davies themselves without curly hair and makeup. I am sure that when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the complicated south; Unfortunately, it is not even the case today for film films. In one part of the film, however, he meets Charlie Chaplin; another is directed to him by author Elinor Glyn and Vidor has a pulpit at the end of the film. Other stars that appear in "Show People" are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice's Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle and many others. <br /> <br /> Davies was a divine and lively comedy. Shame William Haines gives up films - he was a lovely and energetic, worthy of a huge star back in the day. <br /> <br /> "Show people" is a simple story that is spoken wisely. It also looks at the exciting era of Hollywood history and includes performances of two wonderful stars.
