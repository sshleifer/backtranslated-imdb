The film begins with children in the reform school and focuses on the child named "Gabe", who has probably worked to earn her password. Gabe and her sister move to a new neighborhood to start a new start and soon meet Gabe Dead End Kids. The children of this film are small pants, but they are much less antisocial than they were in other previous films and deep, they are well-meaning pants. However, this neighborhood also has some criminals who are cheating through fraud and see Gabet as a comfortable scapegoat - ultimately she had been reforming the school and no one believed she was innocent when she was framed. So when Gabe is ready to return to the "Big House", it is in the rest of the gang to save him and reveal the real bangs. <br /> <br /> "Dead End Kids" appeared in several Warner Brothers films at the end of the 1930s and the films were generally very good (especially with ANGELS DIRTY FACES). But after the boys' contracts ended, they went to Monogram Studios and the films that deliberately said were very weak and formal - Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey were pretty much the whole show and the group was renamed "The Bowery Boys". Since ANGELID WASH KNOWLEDGE had excellent writing and production values, and Hall and Gorcey didn't need to keep the camera constantly, it's a pretty good movie - and almost earns 7 points (near REAL). In fact, although it is not an aesthetically great movie, it is definitely nice to watch, so I'll give it 7! Of course, it was hokey-especially at the end, when the kids took the law and Reagan ignored the bill - but it was also quite fun. The Dead End kids are doing their best and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan have provided great support. Of course, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was funny and quite charming - so if you can't stop the belief, it works well.
