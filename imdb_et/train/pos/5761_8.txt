I swear that this zombie was killed twice and came back. I gave this film 8. Let's be honest people, that's exactly what other reviewers say, i. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to the whole indy movie. The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies in this film is a respect for his talents. Yes, the story is a loophole, yes, we see the same zombies over and over, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun and spooky horror movie, one to share with your buds, or those who really care about LOL. Mellow out people, I think you all liked pieces of garbage like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. Supporting peace and independent filmmaking !!!
