Well here comes another romantic comedy ... but unlike all the other films in this genre, it is by far the best I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I testify that I first wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox and a little bit about Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you watch a good number of movies, you know Sidney and Alison would be in the movie and in one way or another, but I don't know how to start the movie until the end ... Okay, now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg. I don't see any other actor in Sidney's role, and I'm sure this would be a very weaker film, if not Pegg's excellent performance. <br /> <br /> There are several great jokes and jokes in this movie that kept me really laughing, Simon Pegg's character on Sidney ... but I think everything in this movie is good. really sure about the movie (usually don't guess him if anything more than the average act, but he was very good at it) then there is Jeff Bridges, there is Gillian Anderson and of course Megan Fox, who plays spoiled bitchy stars Sophie Maes ... his big roll ... <br /> <br /> In summary, although I usually disagree with its ratings in IMDb, this time I would agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go and watch this movie, it's really frivolous and positive, and i strongly recommend it ... My Rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
