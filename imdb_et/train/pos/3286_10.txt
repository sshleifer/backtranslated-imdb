Simply put, this movie is terrifying. <br /> <br /> It starts just by looking like a rebellious young girl and becoming a beautifully designed horror movie. <br /> <br /> Don't wait for gore or zombies. It's psychological, and as he does in Candyman, Bernard Rose succeeds in delivering a horror that he doesn't believe. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you will understand more about what is happening and how the two worlds will join in this movie. <br /> <br /> Drawings have never been more frightening.
