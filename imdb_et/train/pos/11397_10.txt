A timeless musical pearl, Gene Kelly's top form, stylish orientation by Vincente Minnell and great musical numbers. It's a great entertainment from start to finish, one of the movies people watch with a smile and say, "They don't do as they used to be!" But they never made them like that. The climatic 25-minute musical sequence without dialogue is the most beautiful film history. The magic of the film, which clearly derives from the hearts and souls of all involved people. Must See!
