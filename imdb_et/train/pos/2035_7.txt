Well I'm going to get the blade of this movie, so it seems. Being a self-recognized horror blower, I sat by not knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I found scared (quite rare). The film obviously has a small budget and is set around the train station, but the lack of movies doesn't stop the story. Yes, this story is a bit far off and doesn't explain itself well, but CREEP is a class action and continues to slash and split. LAST LIST !!! THE FILM HAS YOUR PARTS THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED BY EYE EYES OR SMALL SYSTEMS! you understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a good movie and it makes a good movie that really scares you
