Nifty's small episode played mostly laugh, but with a smart doll. In some way, Mars has come on board with a broken bus, but what a passenger is, (talk to your illegal immigrants!). All the stars are supported by cast, stitched Jack Elam (shamelessly puzzled), sexy Jean Willes (if he is a Martian, then I say we open the limits!), John Cruz, the most obvious suspect, with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice move from Bill Kendens bus driver). Makes a very entertaining half an hour even if the action is limited to one set.
