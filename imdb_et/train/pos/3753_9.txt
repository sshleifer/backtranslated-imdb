This short film that soon inspired a full-length feature - Spatula Madness - is a fun piece that claims similar cartoons that give multiple writers. The short film stands for Edward Spatula, who, after shooting, fights against the evil spoons. This assumption allows some funny content to be close to the beginning, but it is hardly available for the rest of the function. With a 15-minute drive of this movie, some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number will absorb. Unfortunately, there's nothing else behind it. There is really no time to show the created plot. But it certainly follows that it is better than a number of high budget Hollywood movies. This movie is worth at least a few times. Take it for what it is, and don't wait for a deep story.
