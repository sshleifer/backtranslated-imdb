Unlearned and Shameful, a Beautiful State of the Torah State, is the daughter of a fisherman who squats in a rich man's land. Charming and bold, he captures the heart of a millionaire son, but violence, fear, and sudden death are the ones that are bothering him in the near future before he can claim the peace of happiness. in this great, close to heart movie. He found Tess to be his favorite role and he filled it with all the dirty joys and enthusiasm that made him the world's most popular film term for years. The story includes all the important elements of a modern fairy tale, where Mary is a cute, unhappy hero, at risk of any dangerous and stressful situation. The atmosphere is first-class, and the set of outdoor fishing villages is particularly well prepared. <br /> <br /> Jean Hersholt looks like a painful painter who is trying to marry Pickford. Hersholt, a very delicate breath-taking screen, perfectly manages the full moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> It was really the second time Pickford in TESS. The 1914 version was one of his first important films, but the standards of the 1920s (for example, close-ups) and Mary, who produced their films and were strong enough for 1922, had slightly outdated their production values. he wanted to film, decided to film his career only once. The end result definitely reached its expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> An exciting study for some future film scientists would be the impact of Christianity on Mary Pickford's life; it probably runs through the golden yarn it produces. Although the romantic nature of the silent cinema can make these spiritual feelings somewhat uncomfortable today, we are forced to accept them as sincere reflections when they repeat beliefs from Mary's heart. In TESS, there is one beautiful scene in this respect, where Pickford teaches to read through the Bible. He points to Lloyd Hughes (who plays his sweetheart) at the back of the book, which he does not understand. He mimics it for him (the word is obviously crucified) and his eyes turned to heaven because the full meaning of sacrifice falls upon him, Mary's face becomes positive. <br /> <br /> A great new orchestra score by TESS has been delivered by Jeffrey Mark Silverman, who perfectly accentuates the beauty and stamens of this wonderful film.
