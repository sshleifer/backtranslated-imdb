... at least in Oxford, Mississippi. Okay, Paris, we get, is Paris, Culver City, except for the creation of the actual McCoy library film, but it's a spiritual Paris that is nothing, somewhere better. Okay, Kelly is not Astaire, but then who and Caron are not Hepburn, ditto, but Alan Lerner is a light year before Comden and Green are overrated who wrote Kelly's second 50-year-old Singin 'In The Rain to. Lyricists who write scenarios with songs from music designers, and just to balance things, are Gershwin's numbers much better than Arthur Freed / Nacio Herb Brown numbers, so Alan Lerner didn't have to feel too well. The story doesn't have to hold us anymore if the anomalies - Kelly hasn't got a game change and is a painter, ie a bohemian, but he can give a good fit a few hours before Foch invites him to dinner at his hotel; Well-documented love in this queue is bypassers strangely loved, other lovers and the background bridge is completely free of both pedestrian and vehicle traffic - this is ultimately a feeling of good music, so standing or falling by the score, in which case it is four squares. As you feel like a musical, it's definitely the top 10.
