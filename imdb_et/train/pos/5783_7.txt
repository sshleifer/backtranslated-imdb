I've read the comments about Kerching on IMDb and frankly, I haven't seen a positive view so far. I like Kerching. Kerching is about teenage boys called Taj Lewis to make 1,000,000 pounds for her mother. It creates a web page called rudeboy. The website offers a lot of interesting things if only Taj and his two friends - Danny and Seymour - can stop the Taji show. I find this exhibition quite funny and I enjoy watching it. The actor is O.K. but it may be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity is what makes him a joke. and Taji's second friend Seymour. Also, Carlton, the owner of the cafe, called "The Chill". We never see him, but we hear him. Taji's younger brother Omar and his older sister Missy are also funny. And Missy's best friend Kareesha. So many times, Taj has almost caught up. In addition to comedy, this program makes Kerching's drama, such as the loss of love life and loved ones, a big one.
