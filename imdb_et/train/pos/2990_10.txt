I think it was Ebert, who gave Stella four of the four stars, but otherwise I have never read a positive overview of this, unfortunately, misunderstood drama about division, love and sacrifice (the three most romantic stories or movies). <br /> <br /> Here is the main topic of class division. Stella is a story of a depression-era America. This means that it was translated on the screen in such a memorable way that this reprocessing (if you ask Stanwycki for a fan or two) was not accurately evaluated. The fans of the original didn't give him any chance. In addition, this Stella version was made in the 1990s, not just in America during major financial difficulties (as depression was). <br /> <br /> Now is the time to remove rosy glasses in the midst of a new recession and era of poverty in America, and see that this powerful story still speaks correctly, is up-to-date and up-to-date both in time and in time. <br /> <br /> Yes, class division is the main topic here. Stella is one of the working poor, single, with big dreams, but with little hope of realizing these dreams. He works in a bar, he doesn't have much money, lives in a fluffy apartment. You get a drift. In the morning she doesn't really want to get out of bed. His wall with pictures of movie stars in his idolizes. <br /> <br /> The man sees his dance at the bar. He's rich, educated, one of those higher-class families who don't have anything in common with Stella. His main concern is what the ivy college is attending to, how to pay the rent, how to be happy. They have a thing. They love each other. Stella gets pregnant. Stella tells the guy about the news. His answer? "How is abortion?" He says, "I just wanted a room with balloons." He supplies balloons and a proposal, but he sees his heart not in it, and he has too much pride in it. He sends him a pack. <br /> <br /> His daughter is finally torn between two lifestyles - the love she has for her mother and the benefits and happiness that her rich father attaches to her. Stella, alone and unloved, didn't want her daughter to be as unhappy one day as she sacrifices. She is giving up her only love and happiness she has ever had for her daughter's happiness and maybe to live, and with the hope of knowing that at least her daughter found something to live with. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie. Everything is right on this issue. Beautiful Score, Skillful Cinematography, Great Set (Contrast of Two Lifestyles, Dirty apt and Decorated Manors), Great and Hearty Performances Cast, especially Bette Midler, Oscar-worthy. <br /> This is a movie that is much more important and well done than believed.
