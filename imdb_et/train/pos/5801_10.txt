This movie is exciting, bold and music is very good. The movie Moonwalker was supposed to fall in the album Bad (1987). I'm bad. It's great (*****). "Man in the mirror" in the production. Then it shows the history of Michael from his earlier day in Jackson 5 to Bad. Oh, and Badder is good as well (Badder is a music video parody music video for Bad single). It shows Speed ​​Demon video. The song and video are indeed very, very good. Then it will show Moonwalker.a after a few minutes, playing a smooth criminal in a club called the 30s. like it, when he does lean.anyway, nice to see you.
