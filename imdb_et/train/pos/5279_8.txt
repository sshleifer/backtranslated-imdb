I do not repeat everything that has already been spoken by other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a great film, not just a very human story of the relationship between father and woman. his adult son, but also a small window to the world of practicing Islam, like me, who is not very familiar with this religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is that the man's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices and how his attitude to religion seems to change finely when we move on. <br /> <br /> This is a very thought-provoking, enjoyable and well-made film that I would like for anyone with a brain and heart.
