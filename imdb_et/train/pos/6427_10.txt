If you enjoy entertainment ... and just want to relax and enjoy ... bade Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started pretty good ... but this is Govinda, who steals the show from her hands ... awesome timing and good dialogue ..... it's inspired by bad boys ... but she also has Indian masala. .. people think it may be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is running and Govinda is acting should not raise questions .... other recommended movies in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) ... is Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Receiver Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie nr. 1, Iodine no. 1, Hero No. 1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
