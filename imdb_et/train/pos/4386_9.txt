This is one powerful movie. For the first time I saw it, Scottish accents made a lot of understanding and destruction of my viewing experience. I gave up on it, but then I got a DVD, used it for English subtitles and really for that movie, discovered how good it is. That's great. <br /> <br /> The widescreen picture makes it partially remarkable, with some great coarse landscapes and a story that reminded me of Braveheart, an inclusive story of good and evil. Here is Liam Neeson (Good) vs. Tim Roth (evil). Both are doing their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors meet as despicable as Roth. Man, you really want to fuck this guy with your arrogant, irritating pussy. (He's so nasty and whistled that sick critics love their character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man's husband and a solid hero like Gibson was Braveheart. Jessica Lange is a female leader here. The film will draw you in and get you fully involved so you are ready to see this emotional experience.
