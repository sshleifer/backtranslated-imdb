I had confusing feelings about "Les Valseuses" (1974), which was written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started to look at it, but I felt like it. I wouldn't call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and forgiving stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I understand why many viewers, especially women, would not want it or even hate it. It is a revelation of a misogyny (or it seems), and the way the two antiheroes treat each woman they meet seems unmanageable. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it somehow comes out like a delightful little pearl. I'm fascinated by how Blier got it. The movie is very fun and enjoyable: it is well written, everything is first-rate and the music is sweet and melancholic. In fact, when I think about it, two friends had done something good for a woman: they made a woman on the train (cute, obedient blonde Brigitte Fossey, who started her film career as one of the most impressive debut) of René Clément's "Prohibited Games" (1952) at the age of 6) to meet his wife, whom he hadn't seen for two months; they found a man who eventually got cold Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) and remained satisfied; they enlightened and educated young people and were very prepared for Isabelle Huppert (with the appearance of their early screen.) Their meeting with Jeanne Moreau raised this comedy to a tragic level. In short, I'm not sure I'd like to meet Gérard Depardieu Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere Pierrot in real life and call them dinner, but I had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring.
