As someone else commented, this is a good feeling for the movie. It has a glorious landscape and Luciano's wonderful voice! I saw this movie several times and saw it again this afternoon. I forgot how much I miss the song of Pavarotti Nessun Dorma and I need it out of the CD! It's a great movie to enter into the afternoon with fun and joy. Eddie Albert is big and a bit up on agent, but all the agents are anyway. The Italian landscape is great, but nothing supports the balloon ride for a perfect view. If you need Olivier's share, this is not the movie for you. If you just want fancy and wonderful music, check out this movie. Just enjoy!
