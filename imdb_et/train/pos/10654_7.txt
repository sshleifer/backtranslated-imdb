Haunting is a movie that has a really horrible house, good work and sound that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that pop you up and the unfortunate aspects of Hill House's past were interesting. The movie has really horrible moments and I liked how the ghosts appeared in leaves, curtains, and houses. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave him the right atmosphere and sounded around you. What I would like is something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to fight, and I think he kept a little too much back. Poltergeist frightened me when I saw it several years ago, and it's still up. Haunting could have used some more pure terror. The end was for me, a little anticlimactic. In general, I enjoyed it. Action is good and there are moments that will jump you. I just want it to frighten me more.
