I've read about the modest Blaise for several years, collecting strip numbers. After many years of fiction film based on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised that the result was good. <br /> <br /> I got a movie that wasn't based on action or violence. The director was focused on history and psychology. How Modesty was created based on her story and what aspects of her life were affected by her childhood. I think this is a better understanding of the next (I hope) movie. I just loved the old fashioned movies. <br /> <br /> But not everything was so good, playing was not so good. almost boring and unreal. It could also have been an improvement. I don't think the bad guy in this movie was real, the only reason he was there was so modest that someone could talk to him. They could also expand the film, showing more when it builds a "network", but I think it's for the next movie. <br /> <br /> And please forgive me for your bad English
