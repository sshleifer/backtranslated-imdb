I'm one of those people climbing the glass to see Hal Hartley's movie. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my Hartley's favorite) NOT NOTICE, Hali's unique brand is a taste. Infusing equal parts of mystery / espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte. Comedy is not necessarily yours and it often takes the whole scene before you reach. And this is the successor to both FAY GRIM and Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey stands for Fay Grim, the abandoned woman from Henry Fool and her mother Henry's only son Ned. Fay lives in a quiet life until she arrives home to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, MAN) and he wants Henry's laptops. There are a lot of Henry Fool laptops and they all thought they didn't contain anything other than mad trips. Obviously, there is much more to them. Secrets of weapons-related research or doing terrorists? Who knows, but Henry. The Fulbright Agency tells Fay that her husband is dead, but it is expected soon to get out of Fay and look for Henry (and it works ... but not the way they think). <br /> <br /> Fay fights several spy rings to collect Henry's laptops and look for him. He is also working with the CIA to get his brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of prison (he helped Henry escape from the country's original Henry Fool movie.) The fast overlapping events take place one after the other. In the event of death, Henry is discovered that he is being safely kept by jihadists, Fay releases his brother, but his son's life is unknowingly risked and the CIA is making a profit for threatening Fay. <br /> <br /> Hal Hartley probably loves to play with themes. And it makes it extreme here. Even the names of the characters (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have their own indirect meanings, which are quite funny. There's also a lot of screenings on the screen when weapons are burning in stop-motion sequences, never hitting our hero, though he's right at the fire. <br /> <br /> Now, as I praise this story, I say Parker Posey's overwhelming imagination of Fay Grim is not the best part of the film that is shameful about how much time he has on the screen. I understand that this was probably what Mr Hartley wanted: an unrestrained woman who went to the extreme of Italy. But sometimes it was a painful look. <br /> <br /> Even then, fans are likely to eat Fay Grim and rise more. Although it wasn't my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm ready.
