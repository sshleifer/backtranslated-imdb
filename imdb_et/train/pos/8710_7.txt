I remember this show on Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and it frightened me incredibly. <br /> <br /> I would like to review this series and see if it was as good as remembering, although I suspect that my taste and demands have changed. br /> <br /> Although it appeared before the alien and numerous other space thrillers, I suspect he has roots in the frightening films of the 1950s and the political climate of the 1970s. When I think of it, it was a real sci-fi, a movie that tried to discuss scientific and political issues about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since become dark and has become a term for every movie that has its own spaceships.
