The classic of culture is almost impossible to predict. Who would think that Vision Quest, Fight Club, and 2001: Space Oddysey, films that are sealed by critics and the audience during the dismissal, would become immensely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film expert. Unlike most Envy hated people (proven by a sad 4.4 rating), I found Envy to be one of the funniest films of the last decade. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. Dialogue is not wise, scenes have little consistency, and the script seems to have been written by the fourth grader. But that's why the movie is so fun. You will see that in order to evaluate the Envy random gene, you must enjoy the movie from an ironically separated perspective. <br /> <br /> Why do I love Envy? Because the film is bad because it changes well. This is a recipe for the cult classic and Envy is definitely worth the bill.
