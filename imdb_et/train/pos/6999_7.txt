Seven Pounds of Will Smith as Ben Thomas, IRS Collecting Agent, has a posterior motivational meeting with the people behind their tax payments. Thomas caused the death of seven people while he was on the road while he talked about his phone, and the film followed his attempt to try, frankly, an unforgivable crime. <br /> <br /> The story is as subtle as a brick green house window. What you see is exactly what's going on - even the end of Titanic was surprising compared to seven pounds. There is absolutely no twist, no confusion or doubt about what is going on. <br /> <br /> Usually I just like Will Smith when it's in full Bad Boys mode. The boy is the best in his arms sports, rides with the Ford GT and says "Aw Hell Nah", as always when he is trying to get serious. for. This is probably the main reason I did not expect the film, although here it is very underrated. Comedy is flashing, but they are fine, actually it was the lowest Will Smith performance I've ever seen, and for that reason he was fantastic and ironically should stand for a big prize. <br /> <br /> Supporting pains were also very high - Rosario Dawson seemed pretty much the whole movie and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper, like all other bit players, in the deaths door. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is crying - but it doesn't throw away all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violins to give you a choice other than cry. There were a few times that even my hardened heart broke. It is difficult for you to find that you cannot find any situation that is not related to your own life, which makes it more sensitive. <br /> <br /> I'd give it 8/10. Will Smith's exhibitions move on to drama without all happiness, and the better.
