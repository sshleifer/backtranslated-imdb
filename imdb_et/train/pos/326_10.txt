"Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" is fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I was laughing aloud. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-conscious, investigative. Don't wait for Bergman here. This film speaks in Sweden from the beginning of the 1960s to the mid-60s and what issues * contradicts * that the people and the world are facing. Sometimes Yellow seems to be a serious socio-political documentary whose main character is Lena and others who interview both ordinary people and politicians (eg Olaf Palme's home). At other times, the yellow parody appears to be such a documentary. Yellow is always acting as a personal documentary that explores Lena's life - her life, her love, her political views, her own views. He's a complete person? complicated, faulty, controversial, happy, sad, curious. And on top of that, the director's excellent complementary dimension and his team who document themselves with Lena's documentation are placed. This is that for me really the yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear in very funny times and in some funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is a fiction and an artifact, but their presence is the second layer of the film itself; they are filming their own filming. I am reminded of the same quality Bjork music video? a music video about making a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration becoming a hearty and cup competition. I think Sjöman may have something similar. Although "Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" may not be everyone's teapot, it is certainly smart, witty, refreshing, rude and authentic.
