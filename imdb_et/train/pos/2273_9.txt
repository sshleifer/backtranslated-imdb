I've never seen Nolte in what I didn't like. But saying this, he has made a lot of movies and I've only seen a few. In my eyes, I keep the presentations and his "Little Red Line" presentations. Nolte has full operational capability. When it comes to shouting, he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are the ones I respect the actors: if he just emotions through face, hand and body gestures without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that the generation of our present participants has absolutely no recognition of what an actor cannot speak without being aware of Keaton's and Chaplin's mastery, this generation relies much more on the mechanical wizard of computers. Of course, this is just a sign of the times we live. When Chaplin lived in our times ... who knows, he can just become a fan of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I haven't read the Vonnegut novel, where this movie comes from. However, the plot has not been pulled or twisted so far that we cannot follow the established path, even with all the surprises. Of course, this seems superfluous at first. But that is not impossible either. <br /> <br /> Consider them as starters: in the heart of Spy's third Reich: he is the extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, the most important spy of the United States in World War II by Delattre and Prichard (See more about Amazon). Think: History Undercover: Reich Piercing: American Spies In The Nazi German DVD (I saw it here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be a history channel production So, either story is ridiculous? Far drawn, yes, impossible, no. Back to the plot. Nolte's character is recruited and an unacceptably dangerous mission is accepted and, unfortunately, the script does not give us enough reason to agree. Was it a kind of passivity that he got the role as he says to suck because it was the best story he had ever written and he could play? It's hard to imagine that anyone of us would understand. But it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> The whole show is great and when people have noted, Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is very small. roll. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked by the end of the movie (no - I don't break it) and it made me feel awful. Did that person feel that the road was finally over and that he had talked about everything that was needed and that most would be chapters attached to life that is already full of many burnt pages? It's hard to say, but it really strikes. <br /> <br /> Nolte provides one of the best performances you can expect .... movie spaces make you think a lot of things. It is very fun and provocative. What big movies should be. A bit long but worth it. By the way, movie music choices are one of the best live composers: Arvo Part.
