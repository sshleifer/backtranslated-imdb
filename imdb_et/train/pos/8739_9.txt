This is FUNNY film. It has all the usual Disney components (music, a lot of characters, story, complaint) surrounded by great animation and great voice features from lesser-known actors like those who say "Antz" and "Egyptian Price". /> <br /> The characters work really well and have a strong appeal, and humor is geared towards a broad level that overcomes generational barriers. The film is also presented in an excellent movie format that adds to the cinema experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've seen the movie three times and I'm going to see more friends this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this film on my suggestion and are not disappointed. I work in a multiplex and I can honestly say that no one has gone out of this movie with a sense of dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Look at it and don't push it because it's animated. You've definitely enjoyed this movie and make sure you stay with the final credit! At the end and end, the fun part of the movie is full of laughter.
