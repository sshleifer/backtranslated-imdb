I enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant at any time in American history. It is always the woman who does what she thinks of climbing the class system. I feel that Lilly's character was correctly portrayed and couldn't do it better. I liked most when he realized what love really was. Throughout the film, all the men who had fallen on him were in love with him, giving him everything, even losing his career. Until he had met Cortland, he did not understand why these men fortunately gave up. The way his life had ended was far from what he had been waiting for. I recommend this movie to a mature audience so that you can understand the content and the understatement of the film and the plot.
