Who would think that Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) was in her past a movie by Steve McQuen? But this is just one of several strange and wonderful things about the film of the 1950s teen-battle-creatures that could best be described as a God who knows about space without a reason. Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" sounded less strange), a good guy with enough natural interest to be interesting; a very healthy but understandable girlfriend is Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough for teenagers to cut off their date by hot-robbers, but they are much more unnecessary when exposed to gelatin, human eating. right and left. But do adults believe them? Of course not what they know, they are just kids! The actors take the rather fairly imaginative script very seriously, because many souls look at each other's eyes and the "adult" support majority will probably say "Children!" very third sentence. But the real joy of the film is that creature that is well-conceived, well executed, and often succeeds in creating a surprising relationship. And while it's obviously on the cheap side (look at these miniature kits, guys!), BLOB is actually a pretty well made movie - and it's a memorable little theme song thrown for a good action. The 40-plus crowd (self-included) enjoys the nostalgia of the film, but it doesn't stop them from being young with the sensitivity of their milk and white bread in the 1950s. a great choice for either a family movie night or a more sophisticated "adults" together. Make a lot of Jello cubes for a movie shot! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
