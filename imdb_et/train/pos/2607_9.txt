He sent messages to the finals of the season, felt the feelings of joy and also the feelings of lying and cheating. Roseanne tells all of her viewers that nine of the season was wrong because her husband, Dan, was dead. He also admits that the family has never won a lottery and what season 9 was wrong, but he wanted or wanted it. I'm still confused when he said Becky ended up with David and Darlene Mark because Becky and Mark admit they're pregnant. So I believe he just wanted to do it, but it wasn't. So the season's final was good but sent mixed feelings. I'm always a fan of the show. :)
