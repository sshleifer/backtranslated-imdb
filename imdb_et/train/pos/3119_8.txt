"The Bourne Ultimatum" starts with a careless rush and the pulsating way explodes from there, because Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) rails behind the CIA black ops that made him a perfect killer in the last attempt to learn his true identity. Destructively icy David Strathairn, like the "man behind the curtain", has been added to conventional soldiers, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (nonexistent). <br /> <br /> Like another entry, I wanted Paul Greengrass's shaking hand held camera to stop at least for a few minutes. However, it can be said that it is a great way to capture the intense, claustrophobic feeling of struggling against intimate hands, and works equally well for walks that are mostly between foot and roof, with a random large car -up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communication that seem to be against the laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne's films seem to exist in some sharp hyper-reality, full of technological magic. It doesn't make sense that everything seems to be in the right place at the right time, but I'm fucking if it's not a blast to watch them. <br /> <br /> Emotional and engaging Franka Potente, writers are trying to create an emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but he is so empty-headed he never does anything. However, it can be forgiven because, unlike "identity" and "supremacy", this "ultimatum" shows everyone and we are finally learning the truth about Bourne's past. This is a fun and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have a good feeling and Damon will have it, it's the perfect ending.
