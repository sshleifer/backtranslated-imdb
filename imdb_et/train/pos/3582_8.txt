Here's another movie about the 80s that most people just don't know. This slow, picturesque (lovers of Montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of Costner's recent "Open Range", which also celebrated Robert Duval), and an emotionally satisfying film is a perfect film that can be viewed one night late. sleep or Sunday to Sunday afternoon. The right mood is treated with a subtle detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back when the youngest son accidentally takes and kills the oldest son during the hunt. The performances are all top-notch and quietly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their images, as are all supporting players and young actors. I especially liked how director Cain (who, unfortunately, hasn't done anything because it's the first, except for the first "young weapons") gives us a quiet look at everyone's personal grief. We not only see how death affects the younger brother or parents, but also the confusing middle sister, his uncle, his crazy woman, and the dead teenage girlfriend. What we are getting here is the western response to "ordinary people" in the countryside. There are also David Lynch's "Straight Story" shades in some of the loving ghosts here and there, the stoic down-Mid-West morale. This is one of the best and more realistic tears of the era, and a nice little find for you for high quality movie players.
