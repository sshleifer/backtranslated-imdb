This review is dedicated to late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> Original drum and bass. is more than promising "aving it, now-a-day it is usually very different, who at all, parody, the shadow of their (many) better years. To be fair, none of them have to prove anything to anyone, they have served With respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert material is one of the best for me, in order to command nearly 400,000 plus strong robes, skill, charisma, wit and healthy bloody good music. <br /> <br /> We all know other draft laws, The Doors (their last Show weeks before Jim Morrison's death), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free, and much more. most had to be seen, this exhibition was one year after the great hippie festival of the 1960s; Woodstock. The film and the disc had come out and so was the one who is still the biggest job, Tommy. Once hungry, the crowd wanted a taste to be able to experience their own a unique event to be able to "Grove and Love" tea To make this concert was yours, you need the best of what Rock 'n Roll was supposed to throw in a hungry crowd. <br /> <br /> Two o'clock in the morning at the end of August 1970, M.C. Announces: "Ladies and Gentlemen, Little Rock 'n Roll with Shepherds Bush from London," OO ". <br /> <br /> The body of John Entwistle is in black leather. Human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger dress in his traditional long sleeve and long flowing hair dress, Keith white t-shirt and jeans because Pete had her white boiler suit and Doc Martins whom she preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> Who didn't stop for more than two hours at High Energy Rock i attack, presenting the biggest stories of my and other artists like young man blues, shaking all over and then queuing, keith baiting "Auction, this is a bleeding opera" with Tommy, Rock Opera. what they had heard, and who was not disappointed, directly to Overture and never came to the air until the final note "Tommy can you hear me?" Amazing. <br /> <br /> top of their festival, which was supposed to be the last one of its kind in the world, was a great work of film. <br /> <br /> English DVDs are only in English / Linear PCM Stereo soundtrack, as I think you get at least 5.1, "For more information, see the local press?" about it, okay. <br /> <br /> The DVD duration is 85 minutes without any additions, which is disappointing. Yes, for rock and festival history, this DVD would be available to you at the moment you press play to see what the best concert stuff like Live, Raw and Face! <br /> <br /> I would have given this DVD ten if it wasn't due to the lack of 5.1, and some of the extras would have been nice. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
