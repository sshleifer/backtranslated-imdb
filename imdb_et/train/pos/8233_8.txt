Fido is a story of more good training about zombies trained to serve mankind. Everything, however, breaks down when a young Timmy zombie Fido eats a family neighbor. Since then, there has been a disaster (well, maybe not a disaster, but a certain amount of chaos). Most people treat their zombies fairly and one such character sleeps in their zombie (a very funny part of the movie, if not very disturbing). And we find the loving Fido that he can do. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent zombie films (there is no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I appreciate it 8/10. Rated z zombie associated with violence
