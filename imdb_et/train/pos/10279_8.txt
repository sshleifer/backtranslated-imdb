Rich psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and feels bad about her profession that it's hopeless to help her patients. A young gambling junkie client asks her to help her pay her debts if she really wants to get her better. Here he goes to Joe Mantegna. One more fun movie hell would break the plot anymore and "House of Games" could be the best movie in the show. David Mamet wrote and directed this jewel that is full of lively dialogue, great lump linings, and enough twists to keep you feeling. Crouse is perfect when the changing spiritual psychiatrist and Mantegna are the ultimate evil worshiper. And except for the coincidence in the last quarter of the film, this film controls its audience; and we love the cone. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
