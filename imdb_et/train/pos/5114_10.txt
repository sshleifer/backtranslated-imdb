Although Urban Cowboy did not pass the same testosterone that you might find at rodeo, it gave an accurate look at that day and age in the city of Texas. I also think that the real criticism of this film should have been in the time and place where it was made. Music, fun times and yes, some "harsh and tumbles" were in abandoned tones. The relationship between Budi and Sissy, such as "two ships flying at night", was well prepared. When Pam noticed Sissy had written to Buddha, he repeated the tragedy of many true Romans. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and the team did a great job. I thought the screen game was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have become the best supporting actor for the Oscar.
