At least half an hour a week. I haven't been interested in major 3 networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All lions are interesting, though Larry may be annoying from time to time. I really like the Middle East performance indicators they bring with Hunter. Most other signs are also interesting. Siegfried and Roy's side view is occasionally fun. The animation is top-notch and certainly the best weekly TV show made by CG. Typically, when they rent large names, they try to hide the bad script or characters. But not only is this exhibition available, there are a couple of characters that were weak and with improved voice, but generally the characters themselves stand. There is nothing that most children have not heard before, and most jokes would probably fly over their heads. Certainly it is not as raw and nervous as South Park, but it brings with it some of the same "Bash for All". One example is that he does both Dick Cheney's and Barbara Streisand's fun at the same time. Pride's father and other Dreamworks productions, such as Shrek, feel like the spiritual offspring of Animaniacside, Pinky and Brainide and Freakazoid. It is the same type of humor that has grown up. It may not be as funny as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still good. Otherwise, I may never find a reason for a larger 3 view.
