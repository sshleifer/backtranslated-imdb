In BARBARIA AND GEISHA, John Wayne Townsend Harris, a true US ambassador, was responsible for truly opening up Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before that, Commodore Perry was mainly invaded by Japan with weapons boats and in 1853 forced a contract with Japan. Harris, who arrived a little later, worked through the details and helped ensure compliance - as many Japanese people did not feel any particular tendency to respect the first contract. All this is true and shown in the movie. According to some other sources, I found romance between Harris and the Japanese geisha mainly in fiction, and this romance is at the heart of this film (hence the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction at the first time saw this movie as a surprise. John Wayne Diplomat? If he's diplomatic in most movies, he says, please and thank you when he pummels people !! So he saw that he was playing a man who was not a acting person and who could play a diplomatic game, it seemed very strange. In fact, in 1958 I don't think too many participants who would be more unusual for this role. By the way, I've seen Harris and Wayne have virtually no resemblance to photos. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the story took a lot of freedom from truth and strange pain, the film is still very observable. Colorful cinematography is nice, the film shows some nice insights about Japanese customs and culture, and acting is not bad. All in all, it is a pleasant and observable film, even though it is strange. <br /> <br /> PS - Read the trivia through this movie. You'll know a little bit more about the real-life characters and the supposed struggle between Wayne and the director (John Huston) where Wayne wanted him out! Based on what I have read about Huston and how he came with the actors, this is the case I believe. And this is also a great example of John Wayne's "diplomacy".
