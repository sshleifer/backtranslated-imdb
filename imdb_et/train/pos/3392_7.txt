It was a very meaningful provocative film, especially in 1973. At a time when it was really a big box box success. It was forgotten after 1970, but its central messages were absolutely important to completely disappear. It was actually at least fifteen years before his time ... no one has ever heard of the 'greenhouse effect' before 1985 and the controversial topic of euthanasia was rare. <br /> <br /> Sets and special effects may seem a bit outdated, but big sci fi money was a luck during this time.
