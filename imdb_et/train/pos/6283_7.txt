As much as I like the big epic pictures - I save your name drives - it's nice to hit some beer back and rub some action. Movies with a back seat on the plot. Movies where the dialogue is not so wisely written that it binds to endless purple prose. There are several movies that fit the bill ... but in my opinion, Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of those that is better. <br /> <br /> This is an update to a movie that shares its name. It also shares the ethos of this image, but does not quite follow it. Whatever was great for the original is harmonized. Whatever the smoother, the bigger budget increased. Often such aspirations are the recipes of a complete catastrophe - see the Italian work of the pug-unsightly remake of who blew it - but thanks to most great actors, Sixty has succeeded. <br /> <br /> There is not much to write about the plot and much of the dialogue in IMDb. Often you have scenes where the same dialogue office goes back and forth between actors, each of which expresses it differently. Many people found it annoying; I find this to smile. Every actor gets the chance to show his style definition here, Cage, Jolie, and Duvall, who run the package of course (and it should be noted that this is also fun to see if Mrs Pitt hasn't been here for the first time). Good oil "Saint Nick" (see review date) and Angelina chemistry bring a couple of good moments. <br /> <br /> The companion is not even a little scary - I have seen Chris Eccleston's playing rigid-boy roles before I know he can handle them, but I think he was deliberately targeting his role unchanged not to interfere with the action. We know that heroes succeed, somehow; we just sit with the car, enjoying the ride. I think many of these scenes have been played with language so far, that it went over the heads of many people who gave this bad rating. In fact, I wouldn't make sense to break a camera on a fourth wall: it's just such a movie. <br /> <br /> All this style and not so much content - something that often carries patience, if not filled * just * so - would be worthless if it were not. And it is mostly. Wonderful so. I've noticed that there seems to be a common tendency to use fast extreme close-ups to direct actions these days. Personally, I find this kind of thing tiring. I prefer such films where the stunts are impressive enough to not require artificial tension, because they are all struck all the time. I have been told that Cage actually did as much car stunte as he could go away without losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character is not clearly interested) and it shows. The man can really move the vehicle and use it in a very slow-burning climate finale, where he drives Mustang to the ground in the most extreme and FUN-way. <br /> <br /> So yes This movie is not an "epic, life-affirming post-9/11 image with mandatory social commentary". Stimulation is uneven, some scenes could have been cut and not all participants shipped. But car films are rarely better. So if you hate cars ... why are you even reading these comments? <br /> <br /> I would take many iterations of "The Flaccid and The Tedious" every day. 7/10
