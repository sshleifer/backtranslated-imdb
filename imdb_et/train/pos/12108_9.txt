Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated fresh baked! Japanese bread) is a story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to Japan and Japan for the perfect Japanese bread or Ja-pan. the whole world. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's just outside. Actually, Yakitate! Ja-pan is not really about bread, but about the reaction that occurs after eating bread and the reaction that comes with the red. The series is lovable because of these pails. Popular anime titles like Naruto, Detan Conan and Dragon Ball are played by films like Matrix and Rings Lord. It's all there. <br /> <br /> So this title differs from other titles in the same genre as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Timer? Well, unlike others who use world domination for cooking, Yakitate! Ja-pan is a purely comedy. Of course, it is time that the story turns to drama or even murder, but the comic atmosphere makes you laugh. You laugh at your sky view. Just remember that this is also a fiction, although some of the bread made here is based on real bread, eating home-made Japan # 2 doesn't turn you into Super Saiyan or turn your body into a gum.
