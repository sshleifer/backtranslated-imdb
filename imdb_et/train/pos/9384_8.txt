An excellent example of "cowboy noir", as called, where the unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses his job because he demands honesty (he's got a foot). If he does not get anything else, he decides he's lying. When he walks into the bar and owner Wayne (late, big JT Walsh) hurts him for a hit, Wayne has been recruited by his sexy young woman Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in fine form), Michael plays together and accepts Waynes money. * Then * she goes to Suzanne and informs her of her husband's intentions and takes * her money out of Wayne! If it didn't make enough things, then a real hitman, "Lyle Dallest," (Dennis Hopper, in his perfect role), and Michael are even more troubled than before. <br /> <br /> Red Rock West gets a lot out of places. Director John Dahl, who wrote the script with his brother Rick, was intelligent to realize the potential of a truly isolated small town story that could have seen better days and where residents could participate in any schemes. It is also an amusing idea of ​​what kind of problem an honest person might encounter if they decide to abandon their principles and give any level of temptation. It is a noticeably dark and twisted story, with the assortment of key characters that are not corrupt, at least morally damaged like Michael. The illumination of the cinematographer Marc Reshovski is excellent in his mood; even the climax set in the graveyard gives the whole thing a pleasant illness. Even if the writing is not "logical or plausible", the film is a good way to intrigue the viewer and just pull it right. <br /> <br /> Cage is doing a good job, but his casual wear has an old aging that bites his teeth and badges. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh have fun in these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are good as Walsh ambassadors (Walsh is also a local sheriff in a particularly good twist) and there is a fun role-playing game for both state and western star Dwight Yoakam, who loves to fine-tune the movie with an enjoyable final credit. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty good movie to watch. It is moving at an impressive pace and if something is definitely not boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
