Violent and rebel twenty-five-year-old sailors Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) will be sent for assessment to three sessions of dr. At the beginning of the treatment, he reluctantly trusts Dr Davenport and unveils his childhood, revealing painful traumas at his site. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant) and they love each other. Antwone becomes a new man in solving his personal problems. This real family drama is a incomplete and positive story about a man who finds a friend and is sent back to his normal life. The direction of Denzel Washington is great, making it a sensitive, attractive and tasteful story about child abuse. This may be a very difficult story for another director. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Voltando a Viver (Back to Life)
