A nice movie with a great soundtrack that stretches through the 70's and 80's rocks. Radiofreccia describes the generation, describes life in a small village near Correggio (Ligabue, a singer who wrote a song inspiring singer), describes the life of young people and their world-related problems. It reminds Trainspotting a bit of Italian touch.
