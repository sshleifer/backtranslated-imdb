I went and saw rivers and tides today. This is the second time in two days and yes, I see the movies I like as many times as I need. Yesterday I was struck by the shine of images and the works of Goldsworthy. This morning, when I threw the coins, I got # 29 Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy is water-related, hence the title. I got a 5th line change that moved to # 7 in the army. Blake Art was a war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few comments the SF examiner has. The critic loved the movie, but said that Goldsworthy's comments were made by enjoying the movie. He would be just pictures and a great soundtrack. So I was aware of it when I looked at it a second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as the king of the world. Today I got a little further from the pictures and listened to what he said. Can I enjoy a movie without my comments? He does what he says, beyond art. His perception of water, time, stone, change, and onward made me think that man is a reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar. Some of his works / words are Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie will be shown here (probably) in the Gulf area. Be a trend setter. Go to your local cinema and tell them not to have to book a movie you've heard of in the hinterland. It's called rivers and rivers. <br /> <br />
