"Insignificance" is far from a big movie, production, directed by Nic Roeg. In Roek's film scheme, it's bigger than most of her posts - "Don't Look Now", featuring Theresa Russell's lead actress. In fact, he is very good and far from the problem in other Roegi films like "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". Like the "Actress" who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective in depicting her as a depressive but pleasant siren. He plays well alongside Michael Emil at Einstein, who has very little to say. He seems to be an admirable part, and although Theresa Russell does not see exactly as Monroe, he is definitely attractive enough to prove his part. Other players are enough, if not quite as arresting as Emil and Russell. Pretty feasible, intelligent script is well run by Roek, but certainly not brilliant, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other recent Roegi films, he tends to rely too much on vague, irrelevant setbacks that add little to the film. In many ways, the film would have worked better than shorter (say 60 minutes), more modest. However, it is quite an acceptable and satisfactory film. Sometimes it's pretty great, but at all somewhat incomplete. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
