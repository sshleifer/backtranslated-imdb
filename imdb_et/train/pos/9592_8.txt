This movie came out 12 years ago and was a revelation even to people who knew something about the scene that drew in New York. Drag textbooks do not talk about these fashionable houses. Anthony Slide 'Great Rapporteurs' says nothing. Julian Fleisher's "New York thrust: Illustrated Field Guide" with its influential chart that pulls Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol's queen and 90's club scene - and after posting a movie - completely ignores the house. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - the closest thing we need to drag on the final book, quickly passed the movie and didn't give the background information that would have been expected of it. <br /> <br /> I understand the film itself and the various articles I found on the web that this house system is going decades ago. Chrystal La Beija's "The Queen", 1968, seems to be the main film performance of the previous 1990s. The historical context is the biggest missing part of "Paris Burning". <br /> <br /> The film is valuable because it focuses on a scene that is otherwise ignored. This is a valuable current situation in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during filming is a very dramatic end, but it is not the only film about transsexuals to cover the actual murder. As we now know, Dorian Corey was a mummified body in her writing cabinet, but it didn't come out three years later. <br /> <br /> Historical importance, but we still need someone who either has a book or a documentary that offers more context.
