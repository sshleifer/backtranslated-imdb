"Footlight Parade" is so exciting on so many levels. Of course, it would not be possible to produce "theatrologists" staged on some land on a particular theater. For example, think of large pools and three-storey-height fountains, such as "By A Waterfall". (Berkeley led John Garfield "They did me a criminal case" six years later and had Dead End Kids song "By the Waterfall" when they took their showers.) <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lil" is the best production number . This is the 30s Warner Bros. Sensitivity Catalog. Note that African men are confused with white and Asian prostitutes. You would never see it in periods that would be integrated into other films of the social scene, unless they were carriers of train or servants in a big house. Here the black boys sit in the bar and sing with others. I also have the excitement when military dancers present the "card part" of Roosevelt's picture. There's also a NRA eagle - the logo of the controversial national recovery order of New Deale. FDR was a new president and the hopes were so high that he pulled the people out of depression. Of course, MGM never sees such a working class. Warner Bros supported F.D.R. administration. Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than playing Chinese whore, "Lil." He even looked at his feet as he danced, which was one of his signature mistakes. <br /> <br /> Pre-code things are fun. In this regard, the number "waterfall" is excellent. Girls swim their swimwear with a crowded bus that runs through Times Square and all its lights. The eagle girls floating with the camera give a footage that would not have been seen for 35 years. In a few months, the production code would eliminate such lost pleasures.
