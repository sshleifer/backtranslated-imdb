I just stopped watching this movie and I have to say I was so impressed. All this was great. Actors, story. A faithful child who grew brave, always ready to help others. Her mother must be proud. I couldn't take that movie off that eye because I'm afraid to take it away. It is moral, cute and frightening sprites and 'monsters', but still with a heart-warming people. The child stabbed and teased at the school, who becomes a hero. He was elected to a local guest festival and traveled to Goblin Hill where he discovered Yokai, who has amazing creations that Brian Froud would be proud of. And evil Kato and his sider who definitely need hugging. These evil people grab Yokai and throw them into the red well with unwanted objects like motorcycles and other mechanical things, and they are raging a terribly violent robot monster whose only task is to kill. The young boy is Takashi, who gets his savior, red man / dragon, turtle and princess on the river, as well as the cute little creature that if they had been in America, they could have made it a soft toy and sell it in all the good toy stores. Lines are especially good Don't try children at home and other jewels that will smile on your lips. Stop faith and watch this child or independently and have fun! Although I have to admit that the end was a little sad. And not necessarily. Cheers Furdion
