I hardly remember it, a little, but I remembered it was great! My oldest brother reminded me of a recent show and I had seen an ad for D.V.D advertising. The net that once again pulled it out of the air, so they could place that place? It should have gone at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I think sometimes network managers think they are "gods" in the entertainment world. However, they occasionally misunderstand and show off the good placement of exhibitions. Let's say they have a lot more flop than "hits". It was one of the poorest decisions to cut out. Anyway, I get it for my collection.
