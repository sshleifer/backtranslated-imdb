Beautiful New York Postcard. The most pleasant thing was that I could watch it with my whole family and not wait to wait for the stupid toilet humor to appear. He never did it. My teenagers liked it too. My son Natasha Henstridge and my daughter Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we did not remember the last time we were sitting with children and everyone enjoyed something. This movie talked about a story that seemed comfortable but not old and not made. The end result was a twist that we all liked. If you are not just a cynical person and you are ready to tell the story, then this is for you. As a man, it takes a lot to keep my interest when it comes to romantic movies and it did. I recommend this and we need to watch these movies more.
