It was really bad for Rawi's first PPV 006. But the end was really shocking to all those present and those who looked at home. EDGE W / LITA WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad opener, these two can be serious if they had more time to wrestle. Flair wins DQ after Edge puts him on his MITB. 3/10 SECOND MATERIAL STRATEGY VS. MICKIE JAMES WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP It's not a bad thing to notice that it's the first time they've met in the Divas ring. Mickie goes to the modified Chick Kick, but Trish ducks and nails with Kick to win his title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH-TRIPLE H VS BIG SHOW Really good this game was actually. The whole game HHH focuses on the Big Show's injured hand, but the Big Show still fights back. Later, HHH is able to fight for the Big Show and the pounds. 5/10 FOUR MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a bonus game} Not so bad that it was fine. After Viscera was behind the judge, Benjamin's mother got a purse {What was there in the bricks} and blamed three times with Viscera's head. Viscera got up to get Benjamin with a spin carrier to win against a big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> LAST MATERIAL JERRY "KING" LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Bored, slow and sloppy. Both men did not really make great efforts. Jerry Lawler wins after winning the Fist Drop. 2/10 <br /> <br /> The sixth material TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN THE FIRST WOMEN'S EVENING It was a lot of fun for me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice to win the first meeting of a female woman. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN PRICE VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. DURING ANGLE W / DAIVAR'S TERMINATION IN WWE CHAMPIONSHIPI This was a cool exit chamber match. But nothing brings last year's liquidation house, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Price & Carlito. Carlito turns his back to Masters and rolls him to remove him. Seconds later, Price Carlitole receives three counts to win the Elimination Chamber and maintain its WWE title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the race, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Price on the win. Vince McMahon says his night is not over yet and says Edge is putting his money in the bank to challenge Price's title. Edge comes out with Lita, gives Vince a portfolio and heads off, because Price has another game to go to today. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH- JOHN PRICE VS. EDGE W / LITA WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {The price that has been loosened during the chambers} gets on Edge, Edge and immediately on the nail of Spear, goes to the cover and his shock. Edge Nails is another Spear & Covers to get shocking three readings as he has won the Hindu and winning WWE championships for the first time in his career. So last year's New Year Revolution was better than this year, but it was still fine. The EC game was also good and the shock of the Edge hit in his MITB is definitely the most shocking at the PPV show. <br /> <br /> Generally: I give him 7/10 & a C
