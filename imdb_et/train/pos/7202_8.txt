Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years ago), "Deathtrap" was the first time I ever saw two men who kissed the screen terribly kiss, and frankly I was shocked. I understood this in terms of the plot and it didn't disturb my feelings (not much), but it was the first time I saw it in the "mainstream" movie. I thought it was a time of their time, and they took the courage to try it, especially at Christopher Reeve when he was PG-rated Superman. Male bisexuality on the screen may have hit his step "Brokeback", but it's interesting to note this much earlier incarnation.
