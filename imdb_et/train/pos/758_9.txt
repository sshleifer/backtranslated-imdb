I knew it was a similar program to Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it's the same, only more extreme. Basically, three Welsh men and one crazy British bliss brought together the love of roller skating and the total ignorance / masochistic pleasure of harming themselves and their health and safety. They've had puking, eating pub-covered pizzas, jumping in needles, listening to naked colors, jokes to a smaller man while they were sleeping / snoring, stunts at work, eg. army, cowboys and many other crazy tricks that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomiting, maybe not just for yourself. Starring Matthew Pritchard, doing pretty much anything, Lee Dainton also has almost nothing, Dan Joyce (British), who hardly does much physical stuff and owns OTT laugh and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot but is more popular is short, greasy and lazy. It was the number 100 for the biggest moments of fun. Very good!
