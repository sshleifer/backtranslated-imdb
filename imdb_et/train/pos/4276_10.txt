At first glance, who sings there just seems to be absurd and great comedy? just some unusual, quiet and slow movement: what's wrong! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers in the desert, the bus and a great number of actors hide the pearl! <br /> <br /> The folded story and the wrong rhythm invite you to think, yes, it's comic, but just lets you think it's a delicate film. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny right now, dark fine cynics to others, its development will surprise you all the way? Very brilliant and smart presentation, all the characters are important and the actors give them a full life. <br /> <br /> And what is surprising is based on deep observation, great camera deployment and great meaning and really everything, general direction, and also details that just makes you forget about this movie: it's like watching something a human society that you don't know yet, a friend behind the camera. <br /> <br /> And you're one behind him. It's simple and just exceptional! <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong; in some way it would not mean script, image quality, music score is kind of amateur, no, no! This is a great Art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river? From the highest mountain up to the sea, all kinds of causes and peregrations that the real river sails to the sea? This little metaphorical image I used is the best way I can explain all the magic that has sung there. For me, I'll take the hammer again: just extraordinary ... <br /> <br /> I've seen the director make the Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, what do I know it's quiet? But as I didn't see it, I had no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers wrote dynamic reviews about this movie, I totally agree! <br /> <br /> The eastern European cinema is not well known because it is rarely translated, but I am happy that this example is one of the original languages, with good English subtitles. All in all: deep, delicious and extraordinary ... <br /> <br /> For fast and empty explosive types and special effects, avoid it at all costs, it may be too small and good for you! <Br / But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, then I think you will not regret it and if you buy, you have a good companion in your personal DVD library, which doesn't have many of my favorite leaders, such as Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** The film is never quite good if the camera is not in the eye of the poet Orson Welles ***
