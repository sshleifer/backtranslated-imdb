This episode is a little inconsistent with the entire gender flexion since the first season. I imagine that editing would have been significant before the censors would calm down. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well-written, and management is complemented by exquisite performance. (Nicholas Lea makes his X-Files debut, though not as an agent for Krycek, but as a victim of Michael) I enjoyed especially up and down. <br /> <br /> Its different but enjoyable. Take all the bad reviews you hear. Follow it yourself and then make a decision
