Reiterates the darkness. How rare is the film to explore the pain of lost people's souls. Adam Sandler celebrates Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11, and has since lost his career, his life, and allegedly his peace of mind. Don Cheadle marks Sander's former dental school as a roommate who seems to have a perfect life (Sandler probably had before September 11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings in the film ... feelings, except lust and revenge, ie. Looking at how they really help each other is just painful and affectionate. The writer / director Mike Binder ("Anger" side by side and Sandler's accountant in this film) really brings a special look to the film. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but in general it is well written and well targeted. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character reminiscent of his fine performance "Punch Drunk Love", but here he is much deeper. Cheadle is always good and does a nice job of expressing the burden she carries ... just looking at her while working with a mosaic. <br /> <br /> Support works are excellent Jada Pinkett Smith (Cheadle's wife), Liiv Tyler (a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (a strangely pleasant role), Donald Sutherland as an upset judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein in Sandler . <br /> <br /> The film really touches on how the tragic events of this day affected one man so deeply that he was basically destroyed. In addition to the interesting story and some great NYC shots you have to love all the films that include Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey's vocals ... as well as Eddie Vedder, who embodies Daltrey. Not just the optimistic film of patches, it's a high quality film with an unusual story.
