I had heard good things about this movie and thought it was a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, young; really all (small) cast is quite strong in its simple 50-year-old American environment. The reason I didn't appreciate this movie is that the older sister didn't feel so real at the end and it pulled me out of the movie. Maybe we should fill the plot or maybe the film should be a little longer. Maureen's character, in my opinion, is rather underdeveloped. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., younger) would be traumatized and angry, but why has his sister turned out to be more troublesome? Because he's a couple of years older? Isn't the end of the film still undermined? The tempo of the film seems to have been met by Maureen and the court only when she gets attacked (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, she seems to have been a bit shocked backwards. It depends on what you want - if you want girls to be happy The story of a young love that you seem to get, you are a surprise. The man of the month is as peculiar as a dreamy and harsh birthday movie - a rather uncomfortable combination? I liked the character of the court, I see what the girls are watching. to have the courage to get both children to hurt (most men, most movies wouldn't be) and kill. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my pretty harsh scale, for some reason I found Jason London tractor funny.
