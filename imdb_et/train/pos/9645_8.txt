The Presque Rien is a story of two young boys who love to stay by the sea in the summer. I don't want to tell the plot because it's not the most important thing about this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this movie is cinematography. The visual aspect of the Presque rien is so amazing that it deserves the highest note. It leaves you charming for this beauty. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it is shown in an uneven, rather complex way. There is no simple chronology or answers to all the questions the film brings. But this makes the "Presque Rien" even more interesting. I recommend this film to all the people who are very important to the artistic side of the films and they do not have to be disappointed.
