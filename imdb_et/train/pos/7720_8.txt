The only thing I knew about this movie before it was Robby Robot. My idea was that it was another long-lasting cheese sci-fi flicks that was observed in the 1950s. When I was wrong. The big studio, the big budget and the great product values ​​make it a visually strong candidate for the best sci-fi movie coming out of the era. I qualify visually because the word "World of Worlds" is much darker and more frightening than the "Forbidden Planet" and is probably more suited to form than alien territory. <br /> <br /> What impressed me. immediately there was a cinematic color transfer, followed by Dr. Morbius' (Walter Pidgeon) home and laboratory complexity and scope. But it was only a pre-icing project for the cake, the maze of land that was the fortress of Krell. It turned out that Krell's technology was even higher than Star Wars. It made me think that the audience of this film, when it appeared, apparently sat under the same fear that the theater visitors experienced in 1977 with the SW or in 1986 with the "foreigners". Looking at it on the big screen TV in my living room offered me the same effect and I'm quite resistant to hyperbole. <br /> <br /> It's not too long to imagine the predecessor of the "Star Trek" TV series, the "forbidden planet"; Gene Roddenberry himself noted that the film had a major impact on his vision. The followers of this short series can easily recognize the primer elements used in Star Trek. I had to do twice when the United Planets Cruiser C57-V men went to the carrier space, while Robby's response, which made it impossible to react, was at least two or three times the use of the ST series. <br /> <br /> When the film definitely took the brain-turn, it was the whole idea of ​​"the East". This Morbius himself used his subconscious mind to protect Altaire IV, which was definitely a unique concept in 1956 when every other sci-fi flick was with the ages or other grotesque space beings. The film worked as a magic for this viewer, helping me to understand that Morbius was the defender of Altaire IV for some time before Adams' director explained it (Leslie Nielsen). <br /> <br /> You know, looking at the calendar, year 2200 is not so far away. This film can be what it actually does to study and live on other planets. However, I think they have to come out with the most beautiful version of Robby.
