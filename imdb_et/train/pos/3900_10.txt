It's on my top hysterically funny list of shows. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half of the jokes. It represents Izzard perfectly as a talented comedian. I particularly like the fact that he never seems to be "buggy" to his audience. His timing is impeccable and routine is linked to a performance show rather than just gags. Thumbs up.
