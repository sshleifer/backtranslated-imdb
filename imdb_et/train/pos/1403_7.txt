Paul Verhoeven (genius and master filmmaker) captures less than a perfect but still fun "dirty old man", Hollow Man. The first two steps are so good that the final act is destroyed. At the same time, I recommend this film to be the special effects of MIND BLOWING (perhaps the best) and two leading dandy performances. Verhoeven's moral questions are of course provocative, and although the film is off many, this film is pretty soft for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two main drawbacks: Josh Brolin (a second-hand walking ape-man) and the whole elevator. If there were access ladders, why were they trapped in the lab? <br /> <br /> Funny horror movie for Saturday night.
