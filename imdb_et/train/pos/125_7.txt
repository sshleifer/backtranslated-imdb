Lars Von Trier has never been reversed when testing new techniques. Some are very original, while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He depicts a spooky train journey to post-war Germany. With so many cities in the ruins, Leo Kessler, a young American of American origin, feels obliged to help restore them. This is not an easy task if it becomes known quickly. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds him working as a night conductor on the Zentropa line. His job is to take care of the needs of passengers. If the shoes are polished, chalk is made on the soles. If the passenger's shoes are not chalked out, a terrible argument appears. There are many clues to the German fanaticism of following such foolish details. <br /> <br /> A railway journey is like an allegory that represents a human procession through life's trials and misery. In one order, Leo dashes through the back vein to find that they are full of a half-hungry body escaped from Auschwitz. The images that are terrible as they are are short as in a dream where everyone has their own terrible effects that are not yet interrelated. <br /> <br /> At the station called Urmitz, Leo jumps with a bomb parked from the train. Considering the many bystanders, he connects the bomb to the lower side of the transport. He returns to his cabin and contacts the clock. Later he jumps off the train (at high speed) and is located in a cool riverside riverside. Looking at the letters above, he decides that his task is to build and not destroy. Later, when he sees a train approach to a giant bridge, he drives to train and stop the clock. If you are concerned with analyzing the situation, this is a completely impossible task. In fact, it is completely ridiculous. It can only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is strange how little parts are remembered, such as a row of hooks hanging on hooks and robbing with rails. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is widely recognized, I prefer Lars Von Teri's later films (waves and idiots). The scene of the bombs described above pulled me down. Maybe I'm a realist.
