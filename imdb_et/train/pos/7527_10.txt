This fun and fabulous movie has the greatest picture of the era ever since the most popular pineapple than your typical dragged bio region, the great soundtrack and everything you want on an indie-type movie. I think it would be a tendency to portray Bettie Page some of the sexes, such as Jayne Mansfield. But when you really looked at Bettie's images, she always looked happy. Not "you want you to bring with me" a surprising look and "I just do it because my acting career didn't work out" the appearance of a porn star. And so, the women involved in this film (the three female producers, the female writer / director, the female writer and the lovely Gretchen Mol, who I am sure helped to influence this role with their sugar) really did take the idea of ​​a sweet, somewhat naive south girl who he really enjoyed his photo and hoped that the good sister JC wouldn't be too upset with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol turns out to be a career-wise (he may just be the most perfect breasts) I am happy about because he had a curse. Several years ago he made a cover of Vanity Fair when nobody knew who he was, tempting him as the next It-girl. And to be honest, it was a bit superfluous. Unfortunately, he has never done it for Gwynethi status, though due to lack of talent. Making some poor movie choices, if you're a pretty blonde, is terrifying in Hollywood. If it doesn't put him back on the A list, I'm a monkey uncle. <br /> <br /> Bettie has not seen the movie in an extraordinarily private way. Bettie left high and loved her old flame to Jesus. Whatever your boat's honey floats. You were one loving woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mary Harron for making our cult injustice.
