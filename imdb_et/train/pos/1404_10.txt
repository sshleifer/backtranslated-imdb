HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror films of the last decade. The sub-block is original and the main plot is even better. Special effects are brilliant and probably the best I've ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon proves once again that he can handle any role he goes on. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains was shocked by the World's issuing MANUAL in 1933. One of the most exciting horror movies. The activity is intense and the chills are true. You can actually jump when you look at it in a dark storm at night. Supporting pains include Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg, and Mary Randle. All who do extraordinary work. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered that someone is invisible. After animal testing, they move to human testing. But no one has to be a subject. Fighting, Caine turns invisible. But if his team can't bring back the visibility, Caine drives his position crazy when he looks for revenge ... * at the end of the spoilers * <br /> <br /> The film has created memorable shocks and is designed to become classic in the next century. The search for jokes in SCARY MOVIE 2 is based on the film that grabs you and never lets you go. The first 45 minutes are slow, developing signs and showing how their tests work. The other side is exciting and appealing to most deeds and horror fans. Think about DEEP BLUE SEA. Then turn the sharks into a crazy invisible person. And then change the water should come and blast. The transformation of the tapjahai movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
