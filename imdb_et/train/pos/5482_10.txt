This is an amazing movie. In addition to showing the actual material of the main events of Chavez's failed coup, we are given a background image describing the class divided society. Many rich have their choice with a democratic choice and are ready to use the military to change the regime. "Be careful what you say to your servants" is a revealing comment. The president of the country's largest oil company calls himself a new president with the support of the US, and these young Irish filmmakers have it on the camera. Great movie for educating young people about democracy. We see transparent documentation on how the media can be manipulated, and the power that is used by large companies for the democratic wishes of the people. Wilting.
