Fucking straight ..... this show went back a day and still caricatures. I can't wait to read some DVDs to share my little man and see the same shine in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Voltron (one in five lions, not 15 vehicles) and I smiled at my head when he said to me one day, "Father." How cool it is. <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, dust it down and give it real-time action. Couldn't be worse than Spiderman 3 ... Man oh man ... 2007 has been pretty flat for movies this summer. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm shuddup now <br /> <br /> Welcome
