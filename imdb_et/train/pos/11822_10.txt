Dick Tracy is one of my favorite films of all time. I have to admit to those who haven't seen it. You really love it or hate it. It came out a year after Batman's success. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were just left behind because the plot was so simple. But it is based on a cartoon ... what were you waiting for? Creatively, this movie is amazing! Sets, makeup, music, costumes and impressive show this movie fantastically. The film has bloodless violence and bad language - it is something rare today. Targeted, Produced and Letters Warren Beatty as an Ace Crime Fighter goes against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob thugs. Madonna steals the show as an attractive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. He has the best liners I've heard! Madonna fans love it! One of the coolest things in the movie is that they only used seven colors to look like a comic. This movie is really a work of art that the public unfortunately ignores. All in all, this film brings out all our children. This is a film that leaves you smiling at the end.
