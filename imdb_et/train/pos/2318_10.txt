I saw this movie as a teenager and I immediately identified Reese Witherspoon, depicted in the 1957 Louisiana countryside of Dani Trant, as a 14-year-old tomb. She feels she is never as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (now rarely seen by Emily Warfield), and felt her place in conservative baptist education. Then the son of his close friend (Gail Strickland) goes to the 17-year-old Court Foster (Jason London), Dani experiences his first break, while the court enjoys his company and deliberate spirit. Dani manages to get his first kiss, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls off his heels, leaving Dan behind. The close relationship between the nurses is severely broken by an attack that breaks, which only worsens when the court dies in a tragic accident. The girls are then made to understand how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just as perfect as loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality while trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinema and the amazing soundtrack of Elvis Presley, The Platters and much more will help you to make the film's atmosphere easier. <br /> <br /> A timeless movie that has a timeless message.
