If you need access, something that keeps your attention for two hours and lets you lose in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. After all, it's entertainment! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like ordinary suspects) where you want to see it for the second time, except for it all. I was thinking of Domino Harvey himself about his life interest in Hollywood. As far as the actors are concerned, many of the frequencies of celebrities have not been shown on trailers. And every actor who forgets me who made them has done a good job. I never thought of Kieras in a uniform or pirate costume. Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs that they are able to take care of other people.
