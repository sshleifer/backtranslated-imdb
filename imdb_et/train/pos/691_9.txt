I'll be clean. The only reason I learned about this DVD was that Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it was ... different, maybe not that good. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading the little comments on this short story, I was actually seeing it. I sent out my copy as soon as possible and got it in a few weeks. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack's insomnia, often afflicted by conditions that cause him to doubt what is reality and what is in his head. I'm not giving away what happens, but I tell you that the film can sometimes be realistic scary. <br /> <br /> Leadership is fantastic, focusing on what is indispensable for the story, without losing any entertaining or thought-provoking moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, I am going to give this great movie out of 10 out of 10 to go beyond what I thought would be short.
