This movie must be my favorite of all time. It shouldn't have been a plot because its makers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to think it was a real sniff film. It was an exercise in visual effects and was not cut when the action happened like any other film. Movies these days are now sound effects, leaving visual images on computers easier for CGI to deal with blood. There are still filmmakers who still can't get a fake counter to see the real thing. There is no rape scene because it was not a movie making point. Have you seen the mountains have eyes 2? Rape scene was funny instead of shocking. Although I'm sure there are some GONZO porn movies that have tried to marry porn. But because they are likely to suck in making movies, they would probably not be able to pull it out. "Baise Moi" is a disturbing rape, because the actors are actually porn stars and they show everything even when the film sucks. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that the movie can't be done without all the money, especially when it comes to AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his hostel series much better, but he's too used to getting an R rating ... or at least I hope his films are absorbed because of these limitations. <br /> <br /> Look at the traces of deaths or more than broken pumpkins if you don't want some real material (scene of scenes of crime and crime). Don't forget that this movie was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still be received by most of these days is a lot about this movie. It would be like someone who says 8bit Super Mario Brothers is sucking because PS3 has better graphics.
