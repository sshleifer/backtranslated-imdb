I saw this mini-series for the first time on British television several years ago, and this story is immediately enchanting. It surprised me rather than being a big fan of Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights; I think the first hero is fair in itself and the last work is overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> The Wildfell Hall Tenant, as well as the above-mentioned works, is also somewhat frustrating in parts. But the darkest parts of the film were compensated by Helen's escape, the breathtakingly wild and beautiful scenery of Yorkshire and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> This film successfully represents an irritatingly restrictive lifestyle for all women. At best, they suffered in the form of a smaller domestic tyranny, which is the treatment of women living in the household of Markham. At the other end of the scale is the unhappy Helen, who is married to a rich high-level man, but has been subjected to brutal and degrading alternation with long periods of negligence. She runs away and experiences short moments of freedom, but as mysteries living alone in the countryside, she inevitably becomes the subject of stupid rumors and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is great as long as suffering from Helen Markham. Not only is he incredibly beautiful (despite this terribly uneven haircut), he is the most amazing cheekbones, but is more than able to play a central role in the film. Tara is dignified and aside, while allowing us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves is a retarded but curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I could never imagine another player. Pam Ferris deserves special attention to his role in the care of Gilbert's mother, as well as the actress who played her sister Rose and Simon Carter, an unpleasant prince who has a taste for good things in life. Finally, I can only watch this movie for Toby Stephens; she is so beautiful, harsh, sexy, sensitive (but not naively sentimental). I'm not even sure if he's a good actor because my hormones prevent me from objectively evaluating! <br /> <br /> If there is a bug in the movie, it is the use of setbacks that I felt they were interfering with the story and making it a little confused. Other people who have watched this movie with me had problems with it and I found that I had to explain to them that certain scenes were actually retrospective. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful to those responsible for making this movie. Not only did it make a video (rare), but it made me buy Anne Bronte a great novel. Of course it was better than a movie, but only a narrow margin. I recommend that anyone interested is watching the movie and reading this book in that order. <br /> <br />
