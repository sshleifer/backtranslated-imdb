For those who do not refer to it, clubberin had 4 fists that hit one body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, after the review. <br /> <br /> I miss the WCW Saturday night. Some of my favorite wrestling moments took place at this stage. I remember Stunning Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP on their working days, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I'm here for everyone on the list. The point is WCW, who had a fantastic list of Hogan days and produced entertainment television. Dusty Rhodes commented in his later years gave me a whole new reason to see when I started smoking a pot as a teenager ... I really want Vince to put him on an exhibition or two, perhaps for the next Great American Bash? They're CLUBBER! Here is DA PLUNDA! He was great. <br /> <br />
