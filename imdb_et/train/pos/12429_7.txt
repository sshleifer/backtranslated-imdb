David Duchovny plays a leading role in this film. Now, many people who find that this doesn't look, don't even bother looking at it. It is very unfair to say that least David did his name for x-files and is a decent actor. Dr Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addicted doctor who has been violated for violations. In the event of a happy accident, he becomes a private millionaire of millionaire Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the role of clare-gangster moll. Timothy Hutton, who plays Blossom, is great and deep in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people think, and I would finally appreciate his work as a trustworthy one. His familiar monotonous tone and straight face are present but do not lose too much of the film.
