This is one of those films that made me feel the need to make a movie. In general, I'm a fan based on worthy real stories. And that's great! In addition to Meryl's action, which has received much recognition and praise, the film's greatest asset story is based. The story of the riveting story of a couple suffering from social and legal torture after the sudden and brutal death of the infant's child is indeed an eye-opening fabel that exposes the inhuman side of fellow citizens and reveals their barbarism. a very refined and legitimate society. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves to be friendly and intelligent people (such as the emotional jury in the ladies' movie) are actually nothing more than selfish dupes who, due to their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, would close their brain to any debate and contemplation even on all the facts, which clearly point to their opinions. The other side of the so-called "civilized" society that the film publishes is the pain of apathy fellow citizens (it goes without saying that this is very common, although this particular story is going on in Australia), which goes a long way to true cruelty. You have to see if you are willing to take something serious and possibly thinking.
