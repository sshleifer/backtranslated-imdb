It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched it on a DVD and the disc has no special features or even menus, but it may not be what I care about. <br /> <br /> I tend to evaluate movies on a case-by-case basis, depending, among other things, on the production of a large studio or a smaller film. It's a smaller film and I'm ready to give you smaller things. That means I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original titles I've seen. <br /> <br /> I liked the action of all major players. I especially liked Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the most fun lines. The character depicted by Claire Forlan may be unrealistic for some people, but I am personally known to be emotionally real people who see life decisions very well. This helped me to pull out the nuances in which his pains could come out of his humor plywood. <br /> <br /> This is clearly not a movie for children, but it is not a free sex or nudity. However, there is quite a lot of adult language, but it can sometimes be very funny. (Especially the character of Alan Arkin, who can't even swear right.) <br /> <br /> See also the characters of famous characters.
