This is a great example of good, stupid movies. No, it is not a high art in any way. The script is also not near Woody Allen or Mel Brooks. But so what! Killer Tomatoes (four films and a series of cartoons) is basically a kind-hearted romps that deliberately drives in a territory where Zuckers decided before they began to take serious pictures. <br /> <br /> As the title says, the fourth installment of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy concerns Killer Tomatoes plot against France. In this case, Professor Gangrene (John Astin's third time in this role) plans to lead France through an ancient prophecy concerning the return of a legitimate French king. Steve Lundquist returns as Igor, a humanoid who wants to be an athlete and who just happens to be a dead ring for the lost king of France. Obviously he also plays the above-mentioned 11k K, joyfully tilting the French. <br /> <br /> Fuzzy Tomato (like the others, FT on the second film and this would be the main character) and his human allies are fearless against them. Mark Price, who has recently been unemployed as a result of the FAMILY TIES series, is playing his thin hidden version, wearing "Michael J Fox" to win his dream girl. And Angela Visser is Marie's dream, which strikes between the trembling virginal sexuality and border psychosis. Oh, that former Miss Holland had more movie career! Another reversible member of Killer Tomatoes is Rick Rockwell (now known as the unhappy headline "Who wants to marry a millionaire?"). Like fellow John De Bello, Rockwell is working in front of and behind this series of cameras. <br /> <br /> What do you say about Jon De Bello? Not much, really, except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it out and has done it, has apparently fallen in shadow. John, if you ever see it, thank you for giving us Killer Tomatoes. <br /> <br /> The script is strongly but reluctantly aware that it's just a movie. Like the KILLER TOMATOES REFUND, the action occasionally works in the middle of the film team. Mark Price has a funny forum to complain about his own defect compared to his former defendant Michael J Fox. This is the biggest estimate for all Killer Tomatoes and it is a nice delivery note for the series. Okay, then the show moved to the Fox Kids series (which was also pretty smart), but the cartoons just aren't the same.
