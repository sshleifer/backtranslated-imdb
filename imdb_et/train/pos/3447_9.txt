There is no director who likes more than Mamoru Oshii. But unfortunately, although he led quite a few internationally acclaimed films, there are still some of his films that have been split. Tachiguishi is one of them, and although I loved it for bits, it is not hard to see why western distributors do not want to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> Between big and serious movies, Oshii is known to have some smaller and quirkier projects. Although Tachiguish is definitely in this category, Oshii has indeed exalted himself by creating something that is very difficult to classify, even when a freaky Japanese flick. Go figure. <br /> <br /> There is a documentary in your core business that is not quite different from the lack of Otaku video. But not the fool of an existing subculture, Oshii discovers his and delves in the life of culinary heroes, removing free food and supporting Japanese culinary levels. Oshii's approach to this subject is closely related to Dai-Nipponjin, as the object is treated with deadly gravity, while the images on the screen are as ridiculous as possible. Extreme humor is taken to the extreme. <br /> <br /> But that is not all, not just the shooting of his instrument Oshii decided to baptize this new visual technique. Live activity, photography, digital animation and dolls on the stick. The ranks of the Japanese animation industry have not been so successful and (or wanted) as the project had to have the lowest possible budget. <br /> <br /> And if you think it almost covers it, I know that the film is extremely dialogue-hard, making it a good companion for Innocence. Grifter's impact is analyzed from all cultural, political and even philosophical perspectives, released to the public through continuous monologues and dialogues. And even worse, the whole movie is entirely in Japanese real history and customs, making it even harder for the alien to grasp the material. Needless to say, it is recommended that you take all the details inside the movie in multiple views. <br /> <br /> This means that at a conceptual level the movie is easy to follow and already quite fun. Various grifteres are introduced as the most influential historical figures of post-war Japan. The film plays as if you were expecting a serious documentary on any other important line, but somehow the big and harshly animated cut photos, which are put together, make it difficult. The number of introduced characters is sublime, Shinji Higuchi, who takes the cake as a cow-creature wearing a nose ring, taking fast food chains with his bull / people. <br /> <br /> Oshii's regular Kenji Kawai offers an extraordinary comic performance, ranging from atmospheric and dark to mad, strange and comic. It is too much fun to be exaggerated by noise and effects, complementing the animation and completely contradicting the rest of the film's tone. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very atmospheric, although it has to be said that the animation is pretty little and effective, it remains toned down, only occasionally in a hyperactive strange. What is not exactly bad, seeing how Tachiguishi is so dialogue-hard. Nevertheless, the film is still a visual masterpiece, as each frame is completely lush and adapted to fit and improve the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Be careful, as Tachiguishi requires a lot from the viewer. If you don't speak Japanese, there are many readings and many cultural references that require some attention. In addition, the monologues in the film area are quite long and difficult to follow. The movie still lacks subtitles in English, and although my French language was largely enough to get something, I'm sure I have a lot of finer points in the film area. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not easy to get into the movie, but about half way through it gets all the steam and it won't let you down. I hope to see it again in English or Dutch. Duble would actually be the best for a movie (like Container), though I think a high quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask. <br /> <br /> In all this, I can only congratulate Oshii for another wonderful movie. It's rare to find a movie that mixes and mixes so many styles and effects to create something that is so unique and still works. The film is smart, looks and sounds good and full of creativity. It's tremendously funny, even if you can't look at all the details at first. But make sure you get it at least with proper help, because the floating automatic translation from English is completely worthless and the film is not fair at all. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi sees a very specific audience and I'm not surprised that the French got their release, while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the western world) is still waiting for that movie's mark. But for those who own Oshii, appreciate dry and dead humor and crave creative spirits, this is a film that cannot be missed, although it may also be the same. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
