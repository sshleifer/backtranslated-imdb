This short was called the Academy Award and I wish it won! Basically, the filmed jazz session between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, is incredible! Hollywood often attributed jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but it is a rare look for the film with improvisational jam. It has been added to the film retention list and is worth it. TCM runs it as a filler periodically and runs its "" 31-day Oscar Award every March. Near the city center, buzzing, swish, not just the net and the shot is so smooth, the net barely moved. Most definitely and highly recommended !!!
