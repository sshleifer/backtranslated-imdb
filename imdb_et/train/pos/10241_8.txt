I'm not trying to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw 5.4 ratings for one of my childhood favorites. It's not so much in the 17th, but as a family movie, it's a sweet and well meaningful film. Children will love it and will not remember the mistakes, and adults can guess behind each character and admire the unconscious message of the film. No movie was in any way preaching, in fact it has a great message that adds to its sweetness. However, I admit that this story is thin, and some scenes, such as Screwey's death (which still breaks me out), can be a scary side. But the animation is above average for beautiful colors and good character animation. The music of James Horner is very beautiful and the song is memorable, memorable and fun. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the deepest of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least involved. The Martin Short clown was so much fun and insubstantial as he said to Screweyes, "I finish!" I had stitches. However, my favorite is Screweyes, an effective villain who is insidious and I think he is intelligent. However, if anything, I want the film as he explains how he lost his eyes and why he was afraid because he would have developed more deeply. The script, though not Oscar-worthy, has funny and heart-warming parts and should entertain children and adults. The voice that worked for me was what made the film. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall, and Yeardley Smith gave special performances, but special attention should be paid to Kenneth Mars, as he was absolutely excellent as Screweyes and almost unknown. All in all, this is a good movie. I can't get a rating, honestly, I'm not doing it. Of course, this movie is not perfect and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land before time, but it's good fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
