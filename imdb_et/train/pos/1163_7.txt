This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know that filmmakers didn't have much money to work with. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may leave the nuances of this movie because of a very typical "obsession". killer "marketing method, there are unique differences about this movie. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, which is obviously a talented Justine Priestley, has a complex character. Some people love these movies just because violence may seem casual, but here is AMANDA's psychosis is shaped by the consequences of past abuse (which is dealt with in a realistic but tasteful way.) Surprisingly, Amanda finally redeems her with a love act, where most of these films become a typical fight against death, and an evil character dies at the end of the same evil as in the beginning. Some of the harsh edges of this picture, but I have to give it from 7 out of 10 stars, based on their thinking and yes, on the originality, compared to the usual - especially the budget.
