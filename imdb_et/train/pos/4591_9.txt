It's frustrating to see where Jackie Chan has come. He was previously an unstoppable hurricane of punches, shocks and incredible stunts. To be fair, he is now in his fifties and can expect some slowdown. But "Rush Hour 3", where he takes back the seat of Chris Tucker (of all people!), And then there is "Kung Fu Panda", where he not only has a purely vocal role, but his character has barely dialogue. .. say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal underestimation. <br /> <br /> This is the time when the only solution is to kick out the dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie with his younger ancestors. , Installer, Chris Tucker-Free Day. <br /> <br /> Enter "Police Story". Jackie Chan plays Kar-as, a policeman whose job is to defend witnesses before a big trial. He faces both an operational witness and a number of mobile transmitters to keep them both silent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, who cares? We're not watching the story of Jackie Chan's movies. We look at them to see how Jackie Chan performs striking stunts, and usually hits a lot of people who are less fantastic than he is. <br /> <br /> At this level, the police story is not disappointing at all. At the end, the shopping center has a fantastic showdown that culminates with Jackie's giant high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, if such a thing happened more often, no man would ever need to attract clothing. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy, much of which includes Kar-unintentionally disturbing country (Maggie Cheung), her ever-suffering and probably never forgiving girl. Whole humor is quite uncomfortable, but it works so I don't complain. Indeed, I'm not sure the police story is anything subtle. Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does it too) has a clear deep understanding of why we look at his films and know that when we look forward to the next fight, the last thing we want is to look for nuance and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is a blast. As with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually sees the things on the screen, the head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, if Jackie Chan really hangs on a speed bus with an umbrella, then a brand new "Wow!" a factor is added to the factor.
