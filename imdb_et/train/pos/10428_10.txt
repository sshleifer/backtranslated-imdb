An amazing movie that should theoretically be boring but equipped with fine and incredible action I've been desperate for a long time. Instead of relying on clich√©s and too dramatic moments, the plot opens incredibly realistic moments. Lead characters are not perfect and related to them because the people you know are simple. The film does not try to laugh or push the ideal to the audience, but shows us the possibility of true love in any case. <br /> <br /> Now I'm calm to wait for the weekend to see the sequel. Moving, thoughtful, funny look at love, which I think should be an absolute romantic classic place with Casablanca and breakfast at Tiffany. Softens even the heaviest heart.
