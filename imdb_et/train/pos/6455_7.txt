This film was pulled for a moment when I saw this Oscar at night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked. We Americans are admirers of a comeback return. As a very provincial America, I can only justify. Perhaps because of this provocative joke, Lena's character makes a movie and other social commentary at first, but maybe it is because of the central message that I think has the same power everywhere in wealthy societies. <br /> <br /> The message for this movie is the same as Titanic. Life is a short person, and as far as anyone really knows, it's all we have. It can be taken away at any time. So it is not a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind the walls of other people because we are afraid of injury? Breaking the walls is painful but lies in the other side of their sad walls. Lifestyle is a worthy risk. Give and get. So start living now. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this for lack of film characterization and other errors. I say you're all pseudo-complicated. Take the gripping people, this is the parable, the destiny of our wealthy western countries who are materially rich, but whose souls are in poverty. <br /> <br /> So join a choir or band or help build housing or distribute food to those who are less fortunate than you. Spread the joy and make the world a better place for as long as you leave and communicate with your companions. Writing control is not enough. We are of course social species. Even the smallest of your fellow citizens can influence you in a way you never thought. <br /> <br /> Permanent individualism is a place, but it's overestimated.
