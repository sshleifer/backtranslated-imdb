Ed Harris's work in this film meets his standard of excellence, that is, he steals someone on the screen with whom he shares it, and that includes Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a little consecrated, only lives in scenes when a lawyer listens to Harris's second convicts. It's breathtaking, a master class under artistic control. Other cast members are all adept and Connery is trustworthy, as is Fishbourne, but the story itself does not offer a wall. The plot is largely dependent on the premise that a white law enforcement officer will always be treated and blackmailed by a black prisoner. It is an engine that drives the track right or wrong, and does it to make you feel frustrated at last. <br /> <br /> Despite Harris acting, it's worth it.
