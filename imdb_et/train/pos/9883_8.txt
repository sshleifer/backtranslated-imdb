It ran for 8 seasons, but it was first in the beginning of 1959 and the last one, in autumn 1965, was shorter than the season 2-7. CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after seeing the first phase of the 8th season in September 1965 because he didn't like the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who had gone after the 7th season. The single CBS sent on January 4, 1966 was a repetition. <br /> <br /> I have often wondered why Rawhide did not go to film coloring last season? Most of the great western nations of the 1960s painted over in 1965. CBS sent color to many laptops in the fall, but Westerners like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained black and white. On September 17, 1966, Gunsmoke was the last West (and the last to replace the primary time series color).
