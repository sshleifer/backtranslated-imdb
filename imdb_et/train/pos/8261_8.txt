The sentimental and naive, but undoubtedly influential, emotional statement of the man-assisting person, in this case personalized as the German and French miners, who were forced to close after the war, thanks to a new border that causes frustration on the German side when the French are bosses. But when the fire begins on the French side, the common signs of German men bring help, safety and even friendship. It was a statement that fell on the deaf for a decade, because one man who was on the side of Pabst himself broke that part and turned the Great War just as a forerunner. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to rely on such fundamental humanism, because this film radiates this optimism, while his slightly cynical and cynical adaptation of Threepenny Opera did not get the job it needed to do that job. The further development of his honest beliefs is also the fact that these characters are not simple bearers for positions, but for real people who have real families whose home life we ​​are. These are ordinary, working-class men who simply believe that they care and treat their companion, and on this day of individualistic opportunism, I take a little thinning on my plot to get a positive message from what I think we can all do from a point of view. <br /> <br /> (Note: probably the end of most prints that the French will restore to the mining gate, closing men again. Brutal course of events and perhaps the film has become a better overall film, but I would have liked it to enrich the final sequence of positive vibesid, so in short, I'm glad it was trimmed.) {Grade: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (11) 1931}
