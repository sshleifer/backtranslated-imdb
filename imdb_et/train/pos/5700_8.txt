I've read a lot of negative comments on the movie and finally got the chance to see it on the DVD. To be honest, I really don't know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> This is a mystery thriller of a decent murder that is shown from different perspectives that are often the eccentric pain of potential killers / suspects. including late porn king John Holmes. Please read the plot summary about the exact details of the plot - I want to give you more insight than a synopsis. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers went so far as to give this film the lowest rating because of violence, but I really don't see it. Many modern films were worse - private rescue Ryan was ultimately more violent than the film, which often relies on the assumed blood color as the actual brutal killings (the murders depicted in this film were made with the clappers). <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by both sides of the movie - the first to show John Holmes the desperate money for a hungry drug addict, and on the other side to show his blood in a small conspiracy. The film has great actors, although Dylan McDemorant sees his biker-like personality and his narrow boy personality more than at times. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also fantastic - a fantastic blend of 70's B-side rocks and twilight pops, spread over a few hours in all the right places in the Boogie Nights area.
