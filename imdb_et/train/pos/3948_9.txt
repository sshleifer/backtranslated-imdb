So, I know it's there. Together with other Uk supporters, I saw what MUST only be a UK screening in the 70s. I remember the title, but I didn't get anywhere when I mentioned it to people. It frightened me (it's 2 'r), but when you fall asleep on your brain and hear your whole future about terrorists, isn't that the TRULY CLASSIC horror movie is everything? I can hardly remember the complexity of the film, but what I remember is my trembling meat and my elevated senses. Does anyone claim to be black and white? Again, if anyone has information to get this copy, please contact ...
