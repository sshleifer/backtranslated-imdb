Why are previews so blah so fantastic! Everyone should know what a great movie is. It is interesting and funny from the moment, the original and well-functioning. I wish the film would make itself as good a press as it deserves! <br /> <br /> Everyone who loved the princess's bride, the labyrinth and other really funny and original fantasy adventure is one of the greatest. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative Newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer makes her recent return screen quite wide. There are also many wonderful moments from small characters ... even to facial expressions.
