I loved "Dan Real Real". A great journey to a love story as you have sent an e-mail or if you slept but not ridiculously full of visual disturbances and raw jokes, and not so romantic that you want to throw. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advisory columnist who doesn't seem to get things straight out in his life. Until one day, she meets Marie (always beautiful Juliette Binoche) for family gathering / traveling, and instantly meets a woman who appears to be a fuzzy filter designed to listen to the classic cinema stars. Chemistry takes place over a cup of tea and muffins, but Marie must be turned off at the time of her previous employment and must attend. Later, Dani's close, fun-loving relatives who have not only large breakfasts, but also enjoy the intelligent and sweet dork in the back of many bachelor jokes are treated. I liked so much that although the family features may be somewhat uncomfortable, I thought it was a great family that didn't turn parody or raw material into exaggeration. The Burns family is just a close, loving group of people who are really interested in Dan's best. There are wonderful inconveniences that are not unrealistic. The family is nervous, but never means excitement or gossip; peculiar but never extreme. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, whom he collects for his family. And so the roller-digger begins with a restrained longing and funny love subjugation. <br /> <br /> I can go ahead, but I thought this movie was just awesome. It is not particularly "hip" or "smart", never too funny and obsessed with dry humor or biting because many comedies are in the modern cinema. There is a good balance between storytelling visuals and funny-but-real dialogue. In fact, at the beginning of the film, the original love begins with a sparkling debate in a classic Hollywood style conversation, where the characters say what they are thinking aloud. <br /> <br /> So I'm probably rambled and repeating myself, but I recommend "Dan in Real Life". It's a great date for a movie, trust me, laugh, and only if you're like me, you get some tears in your eyes. Nice fun and magical love, "Dan in real life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 Four Stars Rating: A
