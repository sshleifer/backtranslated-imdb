The cast was good and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd, who I like from previous films. The film was a great family film, not something that would make you worry about showing it to younger children, a good story, a lot of laughter, light and pleasant. If you want children to be entertained without a tear, it will fit the bill. Kid is pleasant and also difficult for parents to look at.
