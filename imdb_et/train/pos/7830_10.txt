Siegfried on Friday "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried". Now Kriemhild is looking for revenge. She marries Hagen and eventually ends up with a very drastic (but appropriate) action after a series of events. <br /> <br /> One of the things to watch this movie is that we can see certain images. Hunt Attila (called Etzel in the movie) is shown as a strange person from the east, perhaps a reference to the Soviet Union. Obviously, Fritz Lang's fault was not that Hitler used "Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the Third Reich, but we see what Fuhrer liked. However, it is a completely amazing film.
