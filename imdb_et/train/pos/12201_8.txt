Produced in 1946 and released in 1948, Lady and Shanghai were one of the greatest films made by Welles after returning to relative Citizen Kane for relative exile. Darkness, which speaks and expresses some early Cold War paranoia, is a film about the film-Noir criminal film. The cinematography of this movie is filled with Welles' characteristic odd corners, fast cuts, long pans and dark luminaires. The use of the surrounding street music has been a blow to the long opening of Evil Hell, and the mysterious Chinese characters and Chinatown sequences can be inspired in many ways by Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, Welles is obsessed with technical film making that hurts this film as a whole. The plot of this story is often lost in sometimes incomprehensible movie techniques. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, this story has been combined with great performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter). to film the joy of watching. Orson Welles pulls not only the Irish broog, but the torn identities like the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at that time, breaks her usual roles as a sex goddess and assumes the role of real depth and contradiction. Finally, Glenn Anders's strange and bizarre portrayal or Elsa's wife's legal partner is nothing classic!
