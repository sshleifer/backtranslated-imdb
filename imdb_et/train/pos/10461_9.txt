Good luck Cherish is a great movie. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, though different from the movie. Indeed, you thought you would answer if you were the shoes of the characters. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, EVERYONE! <br /> <br /> Although production is not quite Hollywood quality - no big special effects - yet, values ​​and ideals that represented more than compensate. And most did an excellent job of capturing emotional ties and destruction between family members, which occurs when one of them becomes ill. <br /> <br /> You don't want to miss it!
