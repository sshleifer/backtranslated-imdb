I gather at least a couple of people who watched it on September 2 at TCM. If you knew that Hedy had to change his name to avoid linking this movie when he came to the USA. It was a great scandal and I am collecting the original censors in the US so that it was practically incomprehensible. I watched I had just seen a documentary about "bad women", actors in the chair of US pre-film censorship that was created in the early 1930s. It seemed to me as if they were going more than Hedy's most "sensational" shots of "Ecstasy". In fact, according to today's standards, Hedy showed a positive innocence and it was nice to see her unspoiled beauty. It was a nice, lyrical film to relax. I loved what it was: a simple romance. I watched it after he was an early A.M. I'd like to see the first version of the US version for comparison.
