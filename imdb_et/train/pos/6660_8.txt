"Gandhi as husband and father?" People in India have always been discussing. "Gandhi ... my dad" is a story that only a few would have known about such details. This is certainly an overview of Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> I generally liked a movie about cinema and film. Jariwala, Aksay Khanna and Shefali Shah have all done a good job. Most movie scenes would be nice wallpapers ... commendable work. The traditional Indian folk music as a part of the film gives a good sense of events. <br /> <br /> But what I didn't really like was storytelling. In many places I could dramatize the tone. <br /> <br /> In general, Anil Kapoor Productions is a good job. I recommend it as "must-watch". 8/10
