I have also gone through a very painful personal loss (twice) and this film very well represents the intestinal reality of this experience, out of balance with life, nothing is sensible, well-meaning relatives, and so on. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see the ally again. He's one of my favorite filmmakers of all time. <br /> <br /> I laughed and shouted when the story opened. Great story and cast. Well done!
