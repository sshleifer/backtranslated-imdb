I've always known that Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor, now I know she's also a great writer / director. I've been a fan because I saw him for the first time in "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". <br /> <br /> It's so rare to see Lee Grant doing something these days. She's been gone for too long on the screen. It's also wonderful to see that Cloris Leachman is nothing but sit-com. This is his best work after the last picture show. If you grew up in an Italian American family, you will love this movie. I didn't expect much when watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, look at it.
