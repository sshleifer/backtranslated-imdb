When I was chairman of our college caf√©, one of our duties was to review groups of pupils' activities and films. One of the best things that came in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original assumption was that it was shown on Broadway in theaters where the television monitors were placed in the audience, so everyone had a great place. The prerequisite was that skits would become regular on Saturday Night, keeping the thing fresh. They decided to do it for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I believe that developers said Chevy Chase was on the film for the first time. Looking at her naked, though the forest was stupid. Like many mine surveys, WAS was Saturday Night Live before such a thing existed. I recommend this vid. I've been telling my 13-year-old son of Clown - He can't wait to get a copy!
