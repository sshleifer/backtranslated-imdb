Nowadays, the most accessible film for John Waters is one of his best, considering that it interrupts the entire campsite and direct vulgaris, which seem to have the most of their previous work. Of course, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is in fashion that cannot be considered too unpleasant or disgusting. Thanks to some excellent election choices, this film really brought about the subjective nature of contemporary art and your contemporary artist. Funny and somewhat light (if it is possible for Waters), this is one of the films I watch on a rainy day.
