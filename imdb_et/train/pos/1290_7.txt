Yeah, I remember that! Many years after I actually watched it. The story was completely surreal, but still great! What everyone who appreciates and appreciates about movies should remember the purpose of these films. This is the same as the "first child" that follows a similar pattern. Certain films - like this one - are directed only at ordinary and comical nonsense. Such films cannot be judged from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course, these films are not of high quality, there are no complicated stories, very often there is no first-class action, but if they fulfill their primary assumption - that's okay. I don't have this movie in my all-time favorites list, but I thought it was funny, I had a very nice sequence and a good story. Anyway, Brian Bonsall is a smart actor.
