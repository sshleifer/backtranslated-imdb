Garde à Vue has to be seen several times to understand its sub-plates. If you are not accustomed to filming French, based on conversation and mindset, rather than action, don't even try to look at it. You'll just die of boredom and make sure the French movies aren't for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a brilliant film based essentially on dialogues (written by Audiard by the way) and cruelly cuts the veil of performances. <br /> <br /> Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be accused of childless murderers, not to tell the truth? Because he was an 18-year-old girl with an 8-year-old sexual relationship at the time of the murder. His wife knows it, she is jealous of her and prefers to execute it (in France in death penalty in 1980), instead of exposing her only "clean and innocent" aspect of her merciful life.
