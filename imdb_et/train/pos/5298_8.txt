John Waters has given us a really enjoyable movie. It's definitely not without its shocking Waters-esque moments, but it's more taming than its older cultures, such as "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" ponderes back to John's early mainstream stage, as it reminds the viewer of the same type of humor that appeared in "polyester". All in all, it's a great comedy with great moments!
