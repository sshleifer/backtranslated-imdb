The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" (which could be translated as "The Most Loved by People") written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that got something like the Bible or the story of Hamlet, which is very popular and hard to get because of its satirical content over the communist regime. It represents the intellectual, humanist, drama in the "red" world. A movie full of passion, fear, sexuality, all great movies for the recipe. One of the biggest Romanian films, despite their psychological charge (after all, it's a European film).
