The stone is written that Disney animations just have to be musical. Is it? Where? Show me. Because I found this attempt to be much more enjoyable than not including a hokey-made-for-five-year standard Disney musical price. Although the story was not as appealing as it might have been, it was still quite good, enjoyable and adventurous. I had hoped for a little more, yes, given the subject matter, but this film is not ~ a bitter disappointment or a complete failure. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogue is quite convincing, as well as the story, the plot, the sub-block and the amazing creativity I found in this production. I refrain from describing the plot as it is done and done, but this film is a worthwhile view when you are a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the Best Disney Animated Feature Length Film. <br /> <br /> This price is 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
