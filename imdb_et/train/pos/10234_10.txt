<br /> <br /> Burning Paradise is a combination of neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam's cynicism. When watching a movie, they may feel that fighting scenes are only mediocre in nature, but that doesn't matter, it is the attitude and atmosphere that counts. This great movie is so !! Always trying to be different from your peers, Lam gives us traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in the "Lost Ark" Raiders. But these are not the light-hearted comedy incarnations you see in the Jet Li movie. Instead, these men fight fatal brutal results. What makes the movie even better is that everyone can die at any time, there is no setback. Too bad, they don't make such movies more often.
