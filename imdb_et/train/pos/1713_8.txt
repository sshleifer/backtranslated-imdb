This is a movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol both look very beautiful. Never reminds you so much about your mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay was born as an actor and will rise a lot in the future. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is very different from most movies. In some ways, you have remained dissatisfied, but if you really think, you will realize that the only reasonable ending was the end of the film. Otherwise, it would have been a serious injustice for everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is a professional witness who meets a girl who is expecting a marriage in court. His boyfriend does not appear and he comes to help the witness. Slowly slowly, he loves him over time. It is not clear whether he has similar feelings to him or not. See the movie for complete information. <br /> <br /> The film actually belongs to Abhay. Waiting for her more movies. It is never beautiful, but there wasn't much in the movie. Her eyes, innocence made most of the speech.
