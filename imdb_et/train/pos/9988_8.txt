What I loved about adjusting the Stone Angel screen is that it stayed true to the novel! Great movie! As an avid reader, I find the worst thing about the film's adaptations is that the book loses its translation in some way. You can say that the Stone Angel team was careful not to make this film. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was a great choice for Hagar's role and she is definitely a movie superstar. However, I think that the Canadian actor (Christine Horne), who decided to play Hagar in her younger years, also did an incredible job that requires great praise. I have not seen Horni's previous work, but I am looking for it after seeing my Stone Angel performance. 2008. I can't wait to see it on the big screen again!
