Although it was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not an animated version), I think it fell slightly on what Disney could do. It was well filmed, music was better suited to action and the effects were better (compared to 101). The action was perhaps better, but then human characters were given more appropriate roles in this order, and Glenn Close should not really be missed, as in the first film. She makes it shine. His bad deficit and overwhelming career broker are wonderful characters who play, and they add that Disney has given us. This is a great family film with little or no reluctant material, but it is fun and interesting for both adults and children. It's classic because there are so many Disney movies. Here's the hope that the third is even better, because you know they probably want to do it. ;)
