I liked this movie when it appeared, and I'm still doing it because the story generally changes hope in your life and people ... one thing I like about Lawrence Kasdan's films. In addition to the positive bows of the film, there are other reasons like the Grand Canyon. First of all, it is outstanding ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover. In my opinion, the highly acclaimed film, which won the Oscar for the best picture, was very similar to the film. The difference is that the Grand Canyon leaves you positive. Crash had the opposite effect to me; it was very dark. I would choose Crashi every day at Grand Canyon.
