This movie is great. Just. It's rare to find a comedy level and it's a bloody good example. When I first saw this movie when the credit rolled, the friend and I looked at each other and asked ... "Did you just send it?" Look at the level for these suspects. Check out comparisons, DNA between Vick and club people! Look at the different symbols, each position, and if you can't see anything else, look at the link between Vick's treatment and the way through the movie. ALL VICK CAN! An opening line for the Vick world. The ultimate scene where the camera comes with Vick's head and inside, across the universe! Neatly quoted, wonderful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
