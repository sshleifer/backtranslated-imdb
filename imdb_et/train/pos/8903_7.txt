Of course, it's a 50-year-old car, but don't let it fool around. In my little book, there are many smart touches with unexpected sense of humor. Try to duplicate Mrs Porter, who should keep an eye on doc. Not only does he steal the scene, but near the film. And where these indie manufacturers came to paint the color down, it was a sensible decision because the stain didn't appear well in the b & w. Yes, the result is cut around the edges if the number of foxes shows. But with the exception of several teenagers, the non-Hollywood cast performs well. Even when hot runners and policemen play, it is so lively and fun. Pretty daring a couple of leaders at home more than a pulpit. Obviously, they wanted to show teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was full of juvenile offenses. Again, the 27-year-old McQueen cannot barely get into the age department, but will in any case lead a hot-rabbit attitude. The film was a hit, helped, undoubtedly, with a memorable title that got a lot of radio communication. And except for the unfortunate final effect, the movie is still a fun, enter or exit. In the meantime, I am now waiting for the polar ice cream to change, whether we say the cold water.
