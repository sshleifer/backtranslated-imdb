I'm a 53-year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12-year-old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, witty, fast paced and completely charming. The plot was easy enough for a 10-year-old to follow, but complicated enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest was just fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles kits were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional but nothing different. On the other hand, makeup, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and management were excellent. All in all, I thought it was an enjoyable experience. I'm disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult men) attacked the film vigorously. Obviously, they have something against films that represent strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings show more of their own sexist nature than something of such a wonderful family film. I strongly recommend it to every child and every parent.
