Sometimes Kubrick's filmmaker takes such a special little, that unique, insoluble and hard-to-understand ingredient that makes a great movie or a great script a masterpiece, one age. <br /> <br /> It's not just that Stephen King's story has enough meat and potatoes, so it's hard for even the most labor-intensive directors to stay. Heck, even the king himself was not so bad. The way Kubrick perceives the king's universe, how he changes the page for a time that changes SHINING, both under the guidance of a visual party and a compressed master class. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's miss-en scene is, as usual, terrible. The movie is progressing at a fast, sharp, lively pace, although it is not fast and highly editable and the clocks are at least 160 minutes. The camera produces linear tracking shots through the overlook of the rich corridors, like the mystical labyrinth, which is common for exploration, revealing an impeccably furnished interior throughout their size. There is a symmetry and a geometric approach to how Kubrick perceives a space that reminds me of how Japanese directors worked in the sixties. Like what is depicted, it does not matter how all the different elements are balanced within the frame. <br /> <br /> Certain images are definitely eye-catching. The first frame of Jack's typewriter, which comes with a screen ball of droplets, like some other flooring or the self-produced drums produced by the typewriter itself, as if it were all a matter of course, and later turned out to be just that. The red river flows through the hotel lifts slowly. Jack strikes the door with an ax, the camera moves with him, watching the action as it happens in a static rather than the camera through the door and not the ax. The ultra-fast zoom of a child's face that pulls us on our head before we see two dead girls from their POV. And of course, the bathroom scene. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson's bursting too much has been said. His crazy is not entirely successful because he is Jack Nicholson. Anyway, the boy looks half-crazy anyway. Crazy playing makes him an exaggerated caricature. Shelley Duvall, on the other hand, is one of the most inspired choices ever made by Kubrick. Thanks to Robert Altman's fantastic performance of seventies (3 WOMEN, LIKE US, NASHVILLE), he brings the right amounts of his character insecure and emotional. Amazing and very underrated actress.
