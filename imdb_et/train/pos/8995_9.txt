I didn't find anyone looking at DiGi! with me because someone I didn't know was a fan of any band. Of course, all the assumptions that you can enjoy this movie only if you like Dandy Warhol or Brian Jonestown's massacre music, but that is far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way the career of the two groups is parallel is the perfect representation that the band can take, and looking at how the public eats and spits Dandy Warhol is exciting. I agree with others to mention that Anton would love to have the last word because he is clearly portrayed as his worst enemy and band, which is the band's ability to simply stay. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing for me is Dandys' respect for BJM (despite their lack or reciprocity) and Anton (despite his insecure behavior). Even though the group hates everything that Dandy Warhol now stands for (although it is arguable), Dandy Warholid respects the production of the group. The best thing about this is when Dandy drummer says, "I'll never get them again" and the guitarist threatens to ignore "I still buy my documents." For me, it just shows how good good music is. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch this movie even if you don't know anything about the band. It's more about rock music and how they make this movie so interesting. It is rare to keep the group so closely monitored for so long.
