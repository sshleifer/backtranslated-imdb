Sentinel is a film my father suggested to me years ago, and I've seen it many times. It always succeeds in attracting me, while being very horrible at the same time. Back scenes are what really did for me. Cristina Raines' father, running around everywhere, with two horrible women, can always freeze her back. It's your typical good vs evil thing, but at least it will be fun. The end I find worst in Horror's history. It has many shocks and tensions, seeing that Burgess Meredith is doing his thing like Chazen, I was on the edge of my seat. Sentinel has the perfect tension. We are never completely satisfied when Allison is on the screen. We know she's always awful, and it made things even more tense. This movie is often overlooked by fans of fear, but I think it is one of the best, and it is definitely satisfied for all Horror fans. <br /> <br /> Performances. Cristina Raines has her own wooden moments, but she came in a big way. She is beautiful to look at and her chemistry with Saranadon seemed natural. Chris Sarandon is great, boy, Michael. She had an instant screen presence and I couldn't love her. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger are all memorable roles or small ones. Burgess Meredith is terrible as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we know is absolutely terrible. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken do well when worshiping detectives. Beverly D'Angelol has one cooling that I don't break. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Sentinel is an effective Horror movie that Horror fans unfortunately tend to neglect. It gives you the excitement and fear you need to complete. Worth a look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
