I didn't expect the Gackt and Hyde performances to work as well as they were, nor did they expect them to be in an artistic, well-developed film with enough plot to interest you and enough diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me and I look at the next movie. I especially like that it is a vampire film, but it wasn't a vampire cheesy, nor was it a decoration. All characters had human attributes. The way it shows the growth of characters was incredibly tasteful and it really makes you sad for their entire life. I still give two thumbs to this movie. This is definitely the best film I've seen in the last five years.
