First, I didn't know what to expect when starting a video. <br /> <br /> Every time someone returns the genre of a cult film and adapts it to the current one, the translation loses something inexplicably. <br /> <br /> This is not the case here. This movie starts right on the right track. It is part of a familiar territory, but it can also be taken from the top. Crockzilla scene anyone? You have to see and try it and keep it straight. This movie takes some of the old fun of classic cinema films and combines with modern production. It is good to see that someone meets the needs of this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
