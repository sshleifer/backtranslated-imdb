This movie is fun. There are two things in particular: one is an easy way for the characters to have stereotypes, discussing their costumes and superpowers. The parody, which is very tempting, has a gentle sincerity; the other is the main sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves a special remark as the object of Mr Furious's wishes. Here's a boat load. I understand that some of the high expectations can be disappointing, but this movie is fun and cute.
