I had this small, independently made picture impressed. The story, a couple of social emigrants who meet, make friends and give each other a support system, seemed to be inadequate as children, is sometimes fun, sometimes sad, but always provocative. The music was mostly used with underground strips, as well as with camera angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. Performances (leaders play as film writers and leaders) are some of the best I've seen in recent years. If you've ever felt that a square tail is forced into a circular nest, I really believe you appreciate "By Hook or By Crook".
