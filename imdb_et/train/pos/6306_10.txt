Idiotic cages, baby, safe, plan and child. Add them all and get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with a few starred stars (at least a-minus ... okay, b-plus?), this movie got very little advertising. <br /> <br /> does not reduce your genius. <br /> <br /> Terrible writing, confident delivery and a credible group of characters. Some really classic lines and fun twists at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a slightly immersed "Nutty Professor" comedy. These are bad guys with low lifespan. They speak of poor languages ​​with a low life span and make the lives of bad people. But they do it for your entertainment and entertainment and do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
