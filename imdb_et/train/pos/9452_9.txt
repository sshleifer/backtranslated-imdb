After seeing Deliverance, films like Pulp Fiction do not seem so extreme. Perhaps, according to today's blood and precision standards, it doesn't seem so nervous, but if you think it was 1972 and the film has a really heartfelt core, it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, nothing seemed unusual until I got the "Dueling Banjos" scene. In this scene, the cruelty and edge of this film are truly visible. When I looked at Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) heading for a seemingly retarded young boy, it really shows how these films are quite sharp. If you think a child has a small banjo, which he probably might have done manually, compared to Drew's nice expensive guitar, then you really understand how four men are in their territory. <br /> <br /> As the plot goes, it is very plausible and never goes further. But this film really distinguishes about four businessmen who get more than they wanted on canoeing, that director John Boorman (Excalibur) interrupts all the characters away from ordinary cartoons or stereotypes. So when the movie goes full of horror and tension, I really took care of all four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> The actor is universally excellent. Major pain was played by Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, the enemy of the country) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease). Jon Voight probably makes the most difficult thing in this film and it makes his transformation from master to warrior very credible. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the beginning, the character of Voight changes in the film. Ned Beatty (Life) also plays a very difficult role, coming from mountain to rape, while Ronny Cox is incredible in performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that really makes my films really powerful for me is that the rogues were as scary as everything I've ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" cowards were excellent and extremely frightening as mountain balls. <br /> <br /> Overall delivery was great and I recommend it to anyone except people with weak stomachs and children. 10/10. Watch this movie.
