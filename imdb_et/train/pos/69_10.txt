I was on cable one night and started to start this movie in about 10 minutes - every time I even thought of going to bed, I went on to go on to continue watching it, even though it was time to go by. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been another light slam dunk anti-gun movie, but instead they decided to investigate the effects of the shootings. And even better, if the movie is kept in real life - just when you think they're going to easily and obviously call out the exit, the twist will change and the whole film will change. This film not only corresponds to the formula, but shows how other events often lead to and / or influence what happens later. <br /> <br /> All I want is for filmmakers to look into the problems associated with depressive drugs - Columnbine's children who were shooting were for years and it was scary to see Deanna every time they started nightmares. Until recently, they gave things like candy, and only now do they even realize the long-term effects of drugs. It was very refreshing to see that the story of the mental illness aspect was given to quite a few films with a relative suffering from a mental illness, I can say that the film was dead nuts in every aspect of mental illness. Bravo's director and writer who obviously did his homework on these issues. And for those who think that some things may not happen in the hospital (I don't want to tell you any details), you're wrong in that too - I've been there. The script was so real that it was amazing. <br /> <br /> Go buy this movie and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late. One day I thank you for that.
