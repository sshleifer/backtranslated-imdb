I know that this movie is hateful now. I've seen hundreds of horror films, including the 1963 Haunting original and most Hammer movies. This movie is not restrained and does not hinder what is probably the reason why so many of today's viewers did not like it. However, many viewers can accept films such as Scream, as knife killers are easier for most people to believe than demons or ghosts. In fact, this movie had many great scenes, and the effects and special effects were great. I've seen it 15 times and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and did not catch the 6th way of thinking realism. Haunting lets you go and is definitely not boring. Perhaps this film can attract more fans of John Carpenter, but more of a traditional plot structure. Old Haunting was also a fine film since 1963. It was even more frightening. See both the Innocents and the Hell House Legend of Pamela Franklin.
