This movie is one exception to the rule that the sequence is worse than the original. Its comedy is the best. This movie is a quick action that sees something. More than once, the whole audience laughed loudly. <br /> <br /> It was a great advantage to see the first movie, but it is not a requirement. <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Channel 2 also has the advantage of parody in the last decades in a reality television series such as a survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish film for Swedish audiences. So it doesn't see if you don't know Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
