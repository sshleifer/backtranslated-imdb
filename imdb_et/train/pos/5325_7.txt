The idea of ​​making a Beatles movie is doomed, because no production can catch the idea of ​​a real historical Beatles. Then it is probably best not to try to rebuild the past, but to produce an illustration that best suits other existing Beatles materials. That's exactly what "Beatles delivery" offers us, a simple story that is known to us without any extravagant. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here *** *** / warned that everything is not as accurate as some Beatles graduates can expect. The Beatles will feature songs that have not even been composed in the meantime. Beatles presents "Ask me", "P.S. I love you" and even "Don't bother me". Beatles graduates should see that if the Beatles on the film only present the songs they actually made in Hamburg, the younger viewers may no longer recognize the Beatles they have learned. From this original Hamburg repertoire, only "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe "Love Me Tender" are preserved. <br /> <br /> The boys who play Beatles in this production hardly see the originals, but the rest of the movie is still looking good because the film is quite accurate for the rest. The man who plays Lennon is good and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is great and the moment his bags are from Pete Best is probably the most memorable scene in the movie. As a bonus, you'll also see the original Cavern Club in the movie.
