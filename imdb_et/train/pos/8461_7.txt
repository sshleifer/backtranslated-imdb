Since the title is in English and IMDb lists the main language of this exhibition in English, I will focus on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as presented in the Bandai released DVD set. My real overview of the entire series is "Shin kid√¥ senki Gundam W" (1995) in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> Very little has changed in the plot, its adaptation to script and characterization in English and it really depends on your taste to choose which language to look at this example: purists stick to all of Japan's wishes, but more "more realistic" experiences suggest English because all characters except Heero Yuy are not Japanese (most of them are Caucasians actually with a couple of non-Japanese Asian .) First, the personality of the characters is more "straight" than the Japanese version - or take presentations but very well cast participants. <br /> <br /> The Wing Gundam pilot Heero Yuy is a highly educated soldier who suppresses his emotions, but Slowly learns the value of his humanity.Creatment can be criticized as "bad behavior", but it fits very well with Heero's personality. <br /> <br /> Gundami Duo Maxwell, who is dead before death also cheerful, gives a life course of life and friends. He may be the best actor in the show, masterfully played by Scott McNeil. He may seem too old for his age, but the Duo English voice easily rises in his irritating nasal Japanese. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the Heavyarms pilot, is a lost lonely soul who has been the only goal so far to fight; despite his inner desire to establish links with people around him, he knows only how to kill, not friends. Kirby Morrow gives a brisk but realistic presentation, like Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> The winner of the Quatre Rebarba is Brad Swaile, who has no difficulty in caring for the character and breaking his innocence. first hand of war and death. The big plus point is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl (and yes, it is expressed by a Japanese actress in a Japanese version), but to a bona fide typical 15-year-old man. <br /> <br /> Impulsive but confident Wufei Chang, whom Ted Cole expressed, may seem a bit overly, but it is in sharp contrast to Heero and Trowa's weaker roles. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older in English expressed by Lisa Ann Bailey. It may not sit well early in the series with its youthful personality, but if its character becomes a story later, its voice will follow suit and will fit well with the character's development. <br /> <br /> Zechsi Merquise would be one of the heavily changed voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices bring different sides to the same character. His Japanese voice is naughty, authoritative, and commands respect for his high level of status and charismatic nature. His English voice, Brian Drummond, is more restrained, louder, more frightening, and "snake-like", highlighting Zech's secret nature with his hidden agenda and honest beliefs in his ideals. <br /> <br /> OZ members are a mixed bag really. Treize Kushrenada, expressed by David Kaye, is given a more realistic and lower level of performance compared to his larger than Japanese speech. But Lady Une does not transmit her shared personality, unlike the Japanese version, and Lucrencia Nin simply sounds ......... forever. Cannon feed pilots and military leaders have nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> I would be grateful if they took the time to give different characters to different accents to reflect their ethnic background. The votes of Maganac Corp were generally uninspired, but could have been more interesting when they were accented by the Middle East. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also have played better with some stylish European accents that would reflect their noble status. Gundam Wing Script overall less transfer and more realistic rendition. Very faithful to the original Japanese manuscript, keeping all the underlying thoughts and topics of politics, war and human history. Unfortunately, it also retains errors in the original Japanese script.
