I found it very intellectual and artistic in every sense! I felt the script delivered all the things I physically and emotionally feel when I came home and watched. it is a tribute to the cinema in its highest form and format. <br /> <br /> Holy Guakamol! how do i wish these days come again. I tried to put a hood (honda civic 1984) on the side of my car, but the vacuum molded muffin trays did not cut it completely. also in my civil society, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by the waterbed, as is perfectly illustrated in the van. <br /> <br /> Van is an extremely flattering fun and can even replace porn when you watch some scenes privately. <br /> <br /> I assume Sam Grossman (Director) has achieved his opus. <br /> <br /> Ratings John: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
