I like Doodlebops. My son has been watching them for over a year. Last year we went to Doodlebops concert and yesterday to one concert (Connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops do not teach alphabet or numbers, but who cares? Are you serious? The TV does not think that numbers or alphabets will be taught to children. parents should. Get over it. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and at the concert you can say that all 3 have beautiful vocal rates and NOT sing. Imagine they are dancing, jumping and singing STILL. they have a talent, kids love them even when I look at the show. This exhibition is by far the best TV show for children. AND a rock band for children. How amazing is this? Why do people say Chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear about it? Whether he is or not, he is fantastic! Leave him alone. He doesn't like him or someone else who promotes homosexuality to our children!
