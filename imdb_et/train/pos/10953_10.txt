I think this show is funny funny! It's not for every taste, and I'm not going to raise or paralyze people who can't. I am sure they are wonderful bright people working at different wavelengths. But if you like it, you really like it. Sarah plays a suicidal loser called "Sarah Silverman", who often finds herself in homeric situations ("Homerian" as "Homerian Simpsonian"). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from her short events Saturday Night Live in the early 90s. I liked it right now and I'm gonna go out to see what he's done. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is a fun-to-your-food-and-wet-your-pants. That's why I always look at it before and wear adult diapers. Look!
