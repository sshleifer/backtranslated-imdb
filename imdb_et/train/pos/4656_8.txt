The clever, undoubtedly fun romp, starring Peter Ustinov, is a career broker whose sights are placed on a US conglomerate in London. He's buggy (and deceptively sharp) by Maggie Smith, threatened to exhibit jealous company man Bob Newhart. This is a film with many brains. Ustinov is extraordinary, as Smith and Newhart are quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, as the "Vice President" of the pill. Malden has rarely been so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley open up some funny places. Excellent music score is Laurie Johnson. Eric Tili's direction is brisk and the Ustinov and Ira Wallach scripts are first class and very smart. Busy time!
