I didn't see all of Jess Franco's movies, I've seen 5, I think, and there are over 180. So maybe it's a little early to say, but "Necronomicon Getr√§umte Gender" (better known as "Succubus") is the cut version) I think is best, Franco's best. Franco is the best known (though "well-known" may be a bit exaggerated) for "Vampiros Lesbos". Lucky few men discovered through the soundtrack and discovered what was expected after seeing the "Lion and Cucumber" ("Vampyros Lesbos OST") video clip: Jess Franco is the overwhelming leader. When the phone called 'Vampiros', I let it ring. I just wanted to see the movie more. From that moment on, Franco could never grab me so much. But then I stumbled upon this film. It's even better than "Vampiros Lesbos", I think. Franco is looking for what he can do with his story and camera. We know he can do a lot. I certainly did not expect the "Necronomicon" to be so big: its beginning doesn't impress. Remember that I had previously seen "Vampiros Lesbian" (though chronologically, only three years later) and both films started the same. But then this story went on, puzzling and tempting, beautiful camera work and things you'd like to see if Godard didn't do it if he wasn't so busy spreading his political messages. Later, I heard a dialogue in the film about what kind of art was old-fashioned or not. The man says that all the movies must be old-fashioned because it takes a week before the viewer sees what's filmed. But the girl replies, "Bunuel, Fritz Lang and Godard made tomorrow's movies". Janine Reynaud is an interesting leading actor, and of course Franco is regular Howard Vernon. Fortunately, the actor is good (something that can ruin many Franco movies for you). But be sure to look at the scene. Erotic tension, wild leadership and the fact that it is a movie tomorrow will make it a movie that many people should see. The fact that it is a bit more accessible than "Vampiros Lesbos" definitely helps.
