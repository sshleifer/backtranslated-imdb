This is one of the films I've seen so many times that I can usually quote it. Some of the lines in this movie are simply insurmountable. I am particularly pleased about how to stumble and fall for him, to get drunk in a fancy restaurant and part of the elk. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence, but it's funny every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's father a little bit with his elk, you laugh a lot of time. I remember looking at the elk for the bushes. It went the way I thought it would be. They all laughed so hard that they had a hard time filming it. <br /> <br /> Late Sir John Gielgud was a great addition to this. His behavior, his one-time liners and the way he dealt with Arthur were all equally fun. It is always a funny moment when she puts her head on her hat or tells her she's spoiled a little ____. I laugh every time I listen to "I'm going to the bath" and the following lines.
