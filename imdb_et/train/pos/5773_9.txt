Since I'm so interested in the lake monsters, I dug this movie. This movie is worth it. If you like this terrible, good movies have a look at it. Impacts are really good and just think "lost land". Originally, I watched this movie in the early 90's, or more than 89/90 at the local channel 'Morgus Presents'. I didn't scare me, but I was 8 years old and something Bd felt more A. A year later I saw it on a local Circuit City DVD and bought it right now so I can give it to 9 because I have my own 9 place my heart right there is Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good B-movie fun for all ages.
