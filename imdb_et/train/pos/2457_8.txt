If you have a gloomy or depressed mood, check out this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy from everyday life, and it is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and humanistic point of view. <br /> <br /> If you know both Turkish and Danish or German, check out the movie anyway. Half of the dialogue is in the original copy in Danish, synchronized with German, on the other side in Turkish, in Danish or in German. When I looked at it in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking audience proved that there should be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, regrettably, escaped me, but in subtitles only imperfectly. However, the film is interesting even if you do not have Turkish language skills. <br /> <br /> Aesthetically, film plays speed and slowness. At first glance, the flash has a lot of physical movement, making it a fast and irritated film. Especially despite being a Kung Fu movie, watch current scenes that beautifully express many emotions. But there is very little very slow, emotionally intense scene. And first and foremost, characters develop at a much slower pace than you should expect from the coming of the era; there is still some movement of the characters: Carefully watch out for the villain Omar, whose part and action I really liked. <br /> <br /> Contrast between speed and silence contributes to the image of human rage and dignity - displayed at the same time in the same symbols.
