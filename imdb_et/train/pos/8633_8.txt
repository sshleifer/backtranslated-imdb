Nicolas Mallet is a failure. The bank's banker, everyone walks over him. Then his friend, a writer who doesn't do anything, plans to change his life. Our hero tells his boss that he is giving up. He's going to spend the rest of his life doing a lot of money and sleeping with a lot of women. And he can do just that. <br /> <br /> If there was no death in the movie (murder / suicide / natural causes), it would be a farce. Married, in politics, in the press and ... life is a lot of jabs. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a pleasant immoral rogue. Romy Schneider is her most attractive. Definitely worth a look.
