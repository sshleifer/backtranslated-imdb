It's a movie that I can watch over and over and never get tired of it, it has a lot of laughter, guns, action, crime, good lining and a decent plot, upside down, Donald Sutherland's rather comedic role as Assassin. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act. Thomas Ian Griffin is great, because the Max Max DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent played by Carerra and John Lithgow Frazier on TV, played by a bad boy, Livingston. The plot is Max and Diane who try to hit Livingstone when they fight and argue with one another about who gets the money for the appropriate agencies, throw up the Assassin Sutherland, who has quite a lot of good lining, the perfect criminal cape, is a normal love story, but played very differently if you think Carerra and Griffith. The Mafia of Italy Mafia and the Chineese Mafia, which has been mixed here in Boston, where you have great shots and locals, a great movie and music in this movie, this movie is just a comedy of the offender, that's all you could ever want. in a particular scene, very unusual, this movie is a riot and makes you laugh at a really hard 10 plus for me.
