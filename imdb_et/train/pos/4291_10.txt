The opening actor of the leading actor gives us an early overview of how many men live by their women, and the humor that comes with what happens on the day of normal life. <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigau, director, asks how so many European men feel they are in complete control of their lives, but without the help / support of their neighbors, it doesn't seem to work. Using a facial image on the entire film is great and the positioning of a wise parent (mother) is on the spot. <br /> <br /> Although there is more than enough laugh in the film, it is still dealing with single parent / adoption and family strength in society. Really worthwhile to look at and again one that only French sewing can do. <br /> <br /> So far, one of the top 50 movies I've seen this year, and that's worth the start of 5. I am looking forward to adding it to one DVD collection when it is published, and I recommend it to every age.
