Unborn is a pretty good low budget horror movie that uses pregnancy-related fears. It has always worked very well with the good Brooke Adams and the b-movie stalwart James Karen, although supportive casting is quite average for the b-grader. Gary Numan's music is also good for all people. Henry Dominic's script is quite intelligent for such a thing, although there is an angry concern about it. Rodman Fender's direction is just enough and some unnecessary cheap fears. If you are an Adams fan whose film career is not as beautiful as it should be, look at it; She's great, as always.
