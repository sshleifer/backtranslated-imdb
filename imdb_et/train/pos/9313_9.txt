I liked this show a lot - we got the first and only channel in the UK on Channel 4. Characterization was right in money - a bit like the Simpsons, that all the different aspects of the small town were not represented. <br /> <br /> There was no laughter - I didn't see it in American television comedy at that time, except for Larry Sanders, and it really worked well here, increasing the suggestion that these crazy police officers really liked it, not just for cameras. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a tiny little number that just hardens me: I can't help but I think it might have been a sign for some target audiences. I think it would have been a cultural feeling in the UK if it was shown in an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I'll put it down with my usual comment: where the hell am I gonna look at it again? Ideas?
