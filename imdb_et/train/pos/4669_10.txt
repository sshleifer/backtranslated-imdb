When in 1968, two more charming performers appeared in a more charming film than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, I don't know who they were. I first saw this wonderful little satirical pearl 25 years ago at the age of 16, and I think every year I couldn't sit down to waste it again. It is intelligent, peculiar, clean, poor, cute, gently subversive and completely enchanting. The romance of these two social confusions is so abundantly comical and terribly mobile - never more than Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to make the right card on the deck, a scene that is so funny and the perfect thumbnail from the heart of the portrait bursting from loneliness. And this last freezing frame for worry, worried, Ustinov's loving face as he asks, "Are you all right?" - Has anyone made the appearance and sound of commitment so perfectly and honestly? I never want to know anyone who didn't love this movie.
