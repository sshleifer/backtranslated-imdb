I really enjoyed this movie. It managed to do something some movies now do; it gave me family values ​​during entertainment. Nancy Drew is a model for all generations of heroes and young girls. Little girls I had enjoyed with the movie and talked to Nancy when we left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families, and I don't think parents are bored with sitting in the theater. No, it won't win the Oscar, and it didn't show great special effects or even gave a terrible spooky secret, but it was a pleasure for me and stood in the spirit of books. I definitely recommend this movie to someone who has a young girl (she loves it!) Or book fans. You don't have to be disappointed.
