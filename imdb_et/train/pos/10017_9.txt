I totally loved this movie! I have nothing to do with all the other comments I've read about it. I was amazed forever every second! <br /> <br /> I found a story about thrilling, acting intensity and direction. I would literally jump every time the phone rings at the end of the movie. Although the story itself was not "frightening", I was definitely in the movie - and throughout the rest of the night. I found that there were so many perfect choices ... casting, scripting, small humor sticks that were sprinkled on it. There were so many points where the movie could have been a cheap excitement, but it never did, and it put me in this movie with so many mediocre thrillers that have recently come out ... and the last number of years.
