This movie is really cool. every thing looks like it came out of the comic book. kits, costumes and primer are great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman. he saw the deadlock a little better, but he still pulls out. Superman is also great. flying effects are OK. but it is a fan film so we can't expect them to be the biggest. The surprise car that was on the car was very plausible. it was cool. This is a movie I would definitely see if it were real. its got every thing you would want in a batman / superman movie. one exception however, i would like to shove instead of 2-face ..... generally i will give this movie 10 because of its excellent film.
