A somewhat typical filmmaking from this era. Obviously, it was set on stage for this world, but still a very good movie from start to finish. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York are showing their performances on a silver screen and both are doing it effectively. There is very little story, and anyone who does not know the nature of this type of attack can slightly delay it. All in all, a good movie is where Peter O'Toole and Susannah York can overestimate.
