CAROL'S MANAGEMENT is a joy to look at so many reasons. The action of Clara Lago is just so amazing that it is so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say a lot about facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film that has no consistency that pushes the plot steadily, limited enough to the tension to think about the nest scene. The Angel Garcia Roldan scenario is the story that best describes what seems to be the main purpose of films. The plot is unpredictable, but events that are disconnected are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film is to talk about the story of the Spanish civil war because it affected people. It was a great event in the 20th century, but the Americans hardly knew it. In fact, for 40 years of university studies, on average, I concentrated one semester per student, who had even heard about it, much less than anyone who could say anything about it - and the vast majority of students were worthy scientists who all speak of the enormous censorship of American education. So, in one way, this film is a good way to start exploring this event, bearing in mind that once one yarn is pulled out, a lot of history will be released. Evaluating this film is therefore directly related to the size of the knowledge. To watch this movie as a second age screen, there is a complete lack of film. The left elbow index deals with seven aspects of film - exhibition, product kits, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and artistry - for a very good scale 10, on average 5 and 1 needs help. CAROL'S MANAGEMENT is above average in all readings, except for the average that is rated average. The average LEI for this movie is 9.3, raised to 10 if it is equal to the IMDb scale. I recommend this movie for all ages.
