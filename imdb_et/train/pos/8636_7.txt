So a thriller playing Brad Pitt and Juliette Lew who joined David Duchovnyn and Michelle Forbes on a western ride. The last couple will investigate the infamous murderers for the upcoming book; Pitt is on the serum killer (not known to Dow) and Juliette is her poor, non-all-inclusive companion. It is a good pain and the story goes by, but Pitt is not scary as a serum killer, although it is one of his best previous roles. The best thing here is Michelle Forbes, who can always shine in her role as "Homicide: Life on the Street" or in the short series "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
