yes yes, it is quite nostalgic, looking at the first episode because it is one episode I remember. I enjoy watching the first season, and yes, compared to the action-packed exhibitions that we now have, this show seems flat. but frankly I like the "less violent" part of the show and the story is more than new. I thought it was interesting that Belisario Airwolf and JAG had a similar theme - the leading actor (Hawke and Harm) were looking for a MIA relative (brother, father). don't you know if Robert Belisario's personal life mimics these 2 examples? <br /> <br /> Question - does anyone have pictures of the Hawke's salon. I love this salon (like my dream salon) and this is one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
