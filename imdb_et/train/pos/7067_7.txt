Although little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a beautiful teenager who was a perpetual personality and a much admired opera song. This 1937 was his first big film that proved to be a box-bonanza for universal studio apartments. <br /> <br /> THIRD SMART GIRLI touches the divorced couple's three daughters who hurry their long invisible father - a faithful mother reveals that she may soon marry again - with a definite intention of undermining her golden digger girlfriend and returning to her mother. Although the story is small, the script is witty and expert in playing with pure screws. Durbin has a pleasant voice and an appealing personality and likes character actors like Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer. Especially light for fans of the 1930s movie. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
