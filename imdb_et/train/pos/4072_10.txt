Hayao Miyazaki's name became prominent for Spitied Away, but often the director's first film ambitions are ignored. Who remembers that Spielberg headed for Duel or George Lucas, who led the THX 1138? I remember seeing the fragments of this movie - almost certainly in the last 45 minutes of the 80s, and I was left with visual design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known shop for Â£ 9, I couldn't resist it but bought it. The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie are not compatible with my memory (the memory is funny). <br /> <br /> Watching this movie now with all of the collected knowledge of artists' portfolios is how very similar to Jean 'Moebius' Giraud. I can only exert some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches the fallen girl (Sheeta), her adventure begins - Searching for a Shovel - a reference to Jonathan Swift, who has forgotten some of Gulliver's tours. With full references to Jules Verne, this is a good good and bad chase, the last part of which ends with Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the part that is the strongest in my memory - the pastoral ecological aspect of the foliage returned to nature - a large number of robots covered with a pillar under a giant pool. This is, in my opinion, the highlighting of the film - the views of the leafless surface, not the mechanized underground. <br /> <br /> Although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot that keeps the garden and animals. The ending of "Silent Running" is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly stylish, I wouldn't say "slippery" - very beautiful and organic, with a huge number of details in buildings, airships and design and looks almost everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of such Japanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it.
