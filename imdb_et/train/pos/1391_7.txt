Given that it's done with a small budget, DAY TIME is able to complete its budget with some surprisingly good special effects. <br /> <br /> The story includes a family that is starting to get into its sunburn - with power at home in the isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwest California, just to find it - by motorcycle vandals. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has started to see mysterious things - the green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, and so on. And until recently, the triple star explosion light has caused extremely unusual aurors in the desert. Thus, the family led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone are faced with strange alien forces who have put them in time and space. <br /> <br /> Mixing the 2001 Elements: THE THIRD CUSTOMER'S THIRD DAY AND CLOSING DAY, DAY OF THE DAY, Despite the obvious drawbacks and uneven action, the work of David Allen's outstanding special effects remains interesting. Desert setup is very suitable for close meetings of this movie; and although the movie can't really be compared to Kubrick or Spielberg movies, DAY TIME is much better than many others in 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. I give recognition to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose 1977 Thriller made ARACHNOPHOBIA an interesting predecessor, at least trying - and on that basis I give DAY OF DAY 7 out of ten.
