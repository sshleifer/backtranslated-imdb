I had no expectations; I never heard of Jamie Foxx; all I knew was that the film had strong characters in it. I thought it was a lot of fun; it was fun. The plot was interesting and interesting. For me, Foxx is original. David Morse is terrible (true, it's not his best role). I thought the rocks and pyrotechnics had contributed to the film and made it well. I didn't expect much and I was happily surprised.
