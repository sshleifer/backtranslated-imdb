I was 10 years old when this show was on television. It was my favorite. Participants were very reliable. Alexandra Bastedo was just great ... I just ordered a DVD (15 episodes). They had no super powers. They just had better human skills (strength, hearing, vision). The three participants were very good in their rolls, very believable. There was a good story in every episode. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was supposed to be good and the characters were great. There were no fancy things like in other samples. They didn't try to make fun every two minutes to make light. I recommend this TV show to someone who likes good things.
