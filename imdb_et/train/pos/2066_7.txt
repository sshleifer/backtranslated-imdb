It's easy to forget that a series of alien conspiracy plot that was once a day was developed by the series, X-Files wrote episodes like "GenderBender" and "Dreadful Symmetry" where foreigners were not all small gray men or thought-control goops, but can actually make you surprise. <br /> <br /> "Terrible Symmetry" begins with an "invisible elephant" - in fact, an elephant that is somehow left in space and time, not "The Walk" - and ends with the kidnapping of a pregnant gorilla. And this is an episode of very wonderful moments. Sub-block is annoyingly worthwhile - yes, we get it, zoos are bad unless they are - but ideas that are exciting, visually powerful and very memorable, and cover the angle of robbery that is largely neglected why * would people be the only things foreigners are interested in? <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it wasn't just a classic, but it was a nice look, if it lasted very memorable and mostly, it was something you couldn't imagine that many other exhibitions did.
