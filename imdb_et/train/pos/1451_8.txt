I saw this movie about 6 times. And every time I watch it, I have more story and actress. It's like watching a train wreck that has been launched. This exquisite approach, but very effective in achieving this goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> The middle of the story is a very nice dichotomy. On the one hand, we have a deputy, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack), unknowingly tearing into the network of old boys, which forms the general ledger of the New York administration, and on the other hand we have mobop Boss Zappati, who consciously seeks to maintain the status quo with the necessary tools. This situation finally culminates when Zappat commands Alselmol to ease himself by killing himself and Calhoun by ordering Pappas in the same way, politically speaking. <br /> <br /> The film also has some really big liners like (my personal weakness): - You don't sum up a person's life at one point - the only thing that is new in this world is the history you don't know > <br /> All in all a great movie that deserves a much higher rating.
