It's a great movie, I did it a while ago. It had extra zing. I loved Vanessa Williams Roseyna and Jason Alexander also has a good voice. It was great. Also, these settings were very good. Except that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it makes it quite long. In general, I give him 8.5 stars. They also added some parts, but it was still cool.
