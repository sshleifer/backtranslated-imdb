This is one of the most remarkable gems ever produced by Hollywood. - The young world war The British fighter's ace, whose plane is about to break, is in contact with the radio with a young American woman who is comfortable looking, knowing that in a few minutes she will be dead. For some reason, a man who should definitely be dead is walking away from wrecks and finally learns that he was supposed to report heaven. When a messenger is sent from a pilot to involve him in heaven, the man refuses and requires his "day in court" to challenge his case. The man claims that his situation had changed in the last moments of his earthly life, that he was in love and became another person who had earned the opportunity to live. <br /> <br /> "Heavenly Court" is a cinematic joy! The "Jury of Announcement" is a definite highlight. The story, as fantastic as it seems, is tempting and keeps you in for nearly 2 hours of play. The final scene is just beautiful and requires "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This movie is my personal favorite on the top 10, this is my highest recommendation!
