This is a great movie and it is a treasure that can only be obtained through random cinema presentations, as it is not available on video / DVD. How a movie starts with the arrival of two lovers and ends with their departure (though quite a bit happens sometimes and they don't stay in one place during that time) will give you the feeling of closing down and feeling that everything is right in the world. If you can see this movie, do it. I can't wait to see it again and I want it to be released to the public.
