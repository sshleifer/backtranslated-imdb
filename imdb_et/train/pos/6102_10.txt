I just had to give this movie to 10 just because he did what the black audience was thrown into as many movies as they didn't. This film was trivial about all the clich√©s of video gossip, and it was also between gangsters, rappers and flawless language. A number of relationships between doctors, African Americans and African-American men / women have been explored at a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed that the films carefully interfered with the light that humor and some harsh and difficult problems were. At the same time, the film leaves you happy and sad. I also saw it at the Boston Film Festival. This premiere of AMC Loews in Boston and I really hope this film will make it into a much larger audience. Black people (and everyone else) love such a movie - if only industry had enough SMART to put them out there! <br /> <br /> Extra than your doctor, resident, medical student - a premedical student with a doctor, a doctor, a family doctor, or a great doctor - they would love this movie. It depicted the place of residence and practice alive, which was greatly appreciated by a doctor, a resident and a medical student. Dennis Cooper is fully living in his own medical facility, so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and it is very obvious.
