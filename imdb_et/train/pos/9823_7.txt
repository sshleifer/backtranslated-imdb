I thought it wasn't that bad. Not a great work of art, but Dermot M was a stronger performer. Patricia Arquette crossed most of the time. He played a cello that was very impressive and his lines were never forced. Besides, he is an incredibly beautiful man. Really sexy. Add it to talents and most of what it has been is much more tolerable. He always gives everything, even if some of the projects with which he is involved do not hit the highest mark. It is not usually the actor's fault. Unfortunately he has been in some strange movies that just didn't tend to box. Always with A-list participants, but not always "hit". But he is "worth every penny" for every DVD rented or purchased. Watch the Wedding Date with Debra Brass - one of her best feature films. ALL PENNY! ; ) (if you haven't seen it yet, do it, you understand that quotes!)
