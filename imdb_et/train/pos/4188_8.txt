Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had a very inconsistent policy in his films. Although "Shock Corridor" and "Naked Kiss" represented American hypocrisy and lunacy, and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrayal of the horror of war, "Merrill Marauders" painted the war into necessary hell and "Pickup on South Street" is a threat to communist spies. All of his films look very entertaining, and although he was often a b-filmmaker, Fuller was as good as any big studio contractor. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the style of filmmaking is far ahead. It is also a very fast paced, dense and sometimes brutal movie noir. <br /> <br /> The entire board is fantastic. Richard Widmark makes a great anti-hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works with his communist spies boy. The exhibition's stealer, however, is Thlema Ritter, which is a totally pleasing force for the police stoolie. Corner Fuller works, are big, making the running sequences even more exciting and brutal (it is very violent for this time). The camera is constantly moving like Tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great activated noir thriller. "Shock Corridor" is my favorite film, but the other is very close. (8/10)
