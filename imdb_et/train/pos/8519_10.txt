Amazing ..... Maybe this was a bad attempt to reprocess an already-created Omen movie, but I've definitely enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The last man who commented was stupid, this movie was one and the darkness of music, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would have approved this movie. <br /> <br /> Great suggestions for me to watch or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I collect horror films and soundtracks So, listen to what I have to say, not that other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that won't let me end. <br /> <br /> Prophecy says it's all inaccurate, including the final conflict and the left. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is .... There are big movies ... and they should be seen before the great depression falls on us and the Democrats Take over the Presidency. So signed ... Jacob Eder ... A farmer with a master.
