I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies right from the start. It is wonderfully conceivable and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this exhibition. <br /> <br /> It is incredible how many TVs need a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It is a huge relief to see an exhibition that is different from the rest, where, when compared to some of the more recent exhibitions, such as Scrubs and House, you would see similarities, and it becomes a annoying moment to look at exhibitions so close to identity. <br /> <br /> With great cast, great script and fun in every episode, Pushing Daisies is by far one of the most spectacular shows on your TV.
