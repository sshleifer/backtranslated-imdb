Old horror movies are interesting, with plenty of screams, lots of shouts and lots of humor to go with it. "Blob" is a classic in its work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager trying to become a hero in his city. Leaving your girls out of time is quite typical for all teenagers. But when an old man discovers the same falling object from heaven, he gets victimized and Steve helps him best. If it's up to teenage power, this movie really does. I know that most teenagers have had trouble when they act, when the danger goes around, they have to learn to forget the past and start something good to save humanity. When the adults of the city learned a lot about running "Sagittarius", they have to learn to trust the teenagers and not let their behavior get better. The day was a little juggernaut, and I think it was JELL-O! Once all the threats stop, the city is safe again thanks to good old cooperation. Still eating Jello and watching this movie all the time if you don't like Jello, TOUGH! Rating 5 stars
