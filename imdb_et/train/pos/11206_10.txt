I haven't seen this movie! At least not as a whole. I've seen some haunting clamp that has left me to see it all. One sequence remains in my memory so far. (Very convincing look) The spacecraft sounds in the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases the flash to shoot the hidden surface underneath it. The moon flashes for visibility. . . . and there are a few seconds there. Parallel lines, squares, whether it can be .. then the light fades and a brief look ... what ... has gone and space ship has time to return to Earth. Wonderful. I've also seen other clips, but I love to get the whole movie.
