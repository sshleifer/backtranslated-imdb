Only in my second review, years later, did I realize two things about this film: 1) I enjoyed it enormously and 2) Its execution is more decisive than the assumption itself. I was laughing before the movie before a new initial demonstration for me - valleyspeak and loogies, and airspeed (even * good * -painted dizziness) just isn't funny. But even though the film's momentum begins to end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr in an unforgettable scene) show such a remarkable sense of comic timing that even the hardest-written jokes (eg, Ted as a hell resident does not work as effortless as enemies) And Winter's and Reeves's joining clicks so well that Bill and Tedi (who only spend one scene that is separated from the whole movie, if they're not well matched) are completely unlimited. /> <br /> (Note: I found that the first movie is just a casual fun - it looks like there are distinctly different comics.) <br /> <br /> I'm giving him 7.75.
