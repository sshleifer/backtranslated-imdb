On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a passionate, shiny soap opera about sexual disturbances in the Texas family. But there is a deep social commentary about the life of the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk again appreciates another Univeral sister. Robert Stack loves Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best palm Rock Hudson also loves him. When Stack discovers that he is sterile and Bacall comes pregnant, fireworks will fly. And all too good Dorothy Malone won the Oscar with her biggest Texas nymph portrays, which Hudson kills. A good epic soap opera.
