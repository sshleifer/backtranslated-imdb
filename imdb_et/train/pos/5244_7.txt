"The Ladies Man" suffers from Saturday Night Live-based movies. And that means that a scheme that usually works within five minutes doesn't do it well in 90 minutes. Although this film laughs like Tim Meadows like Leon Phelps, a sex maniac directly from the 70s, and Will Ferrell as a wrestling-obsessed spouse, Leon had dismissed. So this movie is funny enough, but it's not "Wayne's World"!
