Sandra Bernhard is quite characteristic and certainly one of the most funny women in the world. He started as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s, but his great fracture was in 1983 when he saw Jerry Lew and Robert De Nirot as Scryese's undervalued masterpiece "Comedy King". His film career never went. He made a couple of odd but fun pictures, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most amazing parts were what he created. <br /> <br /> "Without you," his best efforts are undoubtedly. This is the adaptation of his smash-off off-Broadway exhibition that made him a superstar? and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten completely choreographic and staged scenes, Sandra Nina from Simone turns to Diana Rossin, speaks of her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco, and plays the famous songs of Burt Bacharachi, Prince or Sylvester. Directed by John Boskovich, Sandra won a 90-minute tournament that is both sexy and unique. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can't miss this movie; it is also a tribute to his (strange) beauty for his extremely unusual talent as comedy. And has it affected filmmakers in their work? For example, "Hedwig and Angry Inch" would look much different if "nothing is without you" would not exist.
