One can only imagine that Mr Welles could have finished without a studio intervention! This movie is flawed in Welles, but it is worth every minute because maybe we can see the size of America's best film directors at all times. <br /> <br /> We see how filming on Orson Well took this movie. This story has many holes, perhaps because of the demands of studio managers who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read some of the opinions given to IMDB that compare Orson Welles Coen's brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, if it were to be all the leaders to be considered as ambassadors themselves. Nobody was more original and creative than American Welles in the history of American cinema. It is fortunate that we still have our legacy either retrospectively, for example, in the New York Film Forum or its films on tape or DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth has never been lovingly photographed here. If she had a beauty with her red hair as a blonde, she was too stunning for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could make this movie a masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles' work was his own look. If he had focused on leadership and if another participant had interpreted Michael O'Hara, he would have achieved a completely different film. Orson Welles must be credited for being a pioneer who took the camera away from the street. The visual images of this film are so astonishing that we leave the theater after seeing that the film really impressed the work, vision and talent it gave us.
