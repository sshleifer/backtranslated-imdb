Before seeing it, I pushed the subject down, but it is not your average triumph over the strokes. While it's technically about climbing the blind Tibetan children, Mt. Everest, there's so much. This film shows very strong, often contradictory, individuals who were children who led the children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind climber / athlete and Sabriye is a blind German academician who started school in Lhasa, Tibet. They are both extraordinary in their own way, but do not agree with what really trusts children. Erik wants them to come to the summit, while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as an example and enjoy the moment. The nuances are complex and one walks away, not really sure who was right or if the whole climbing was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they are looking for before they reach school. Most of all, the story of Tashi, a weakened teenager who grew up in the streets after abandoning her parents, was the most moving for me. I could look at the whole film about my life and was glad to know that thanks to the school, he is working with some of his fellow students as a small business. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you love it.
