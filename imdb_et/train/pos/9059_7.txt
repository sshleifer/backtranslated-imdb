This is a good movie to watch if you have nothing else to do. If you wait for this movie literally, you are very disappointed. I was somewhat disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in primary school. <br /> <br /> It's about a new boy in the city called Billy. He contributes to school bullying and the contribution is not like most betting. Billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins. <br /> <br /> Actress is OK, probably the worst part of the movie. Child actors exaggerate many things. They think this is an apocalypse when Billy doesn't eat worms. However, Hallie Eisenberg did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> The plot line is good as a movie, but it sucks on the book for customization. I was able to watch this movie despite the time ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good family film with some weaknesses. I appreciate this movie 7/10.
