It is not a criticism of the film, but rather a comment on how blind it is to our own past. <br /> <br /> I recently watched a soldier in the winter and the ground was like a remake or a sequel - except it was in Iraq rather than Vietnam. Like this one-sided message, like the Winter Soldier, both films illustrate how we are happily hurrying to deal with false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to wear this greedy war. Both films are effective in demonstrating the mentality of the young people and making them an effective machine for killing, but training is completely inadequate to teach the diplomatic and police skills needed to effectively win the hearts and thoughts of the people they claim to be fighting. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam and is likely to lose the war in Iraq. My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided that it can be easily passed on as left-wing propaganda. Not me, think of you, but those who want to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced view would tell the larger audience.
