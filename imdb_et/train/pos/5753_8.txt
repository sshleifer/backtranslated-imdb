*** 1/2 Off ***** Although I am not concerned that this is a duplicated version of English, as some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted that it seems to be alive in many Quebecois mother tongues. But it was a child like a movie that I was an exciting admirer; considering now that it is made for children, I appreciate it relatively. The story is for children during the winter holidays about a building with an amazing snow fort, and strikes back and forth to control their weapons, such as snowballs and other pastries, when the hands of the hands and the rest of the day are equal. If I had children, this is definitely a movie I would try and would like to interest them because the snow tower threw me when I was young, and I think even children today agree, though Pixar and all the computer animation, maybe I'm out of date and just don't understand it. In addition, the film's message is perfectly allegorical and positive for both children and adults.
