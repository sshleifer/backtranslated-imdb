Precise signs of Pacino's speech over a dead child's coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be ashamed !! <br /> <br /> Was it Paul Schrader or was Ken Lipper who should be praised for remarkable dialogues? They are rich and intelligent and worth your time if you like movies with good scripts. I found a story story that develops fairly well up to the post task postcode. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to talk about in this movie; even John Cusack has done this better role. Interestingly, the film is very male-oriented - women are just extras.
