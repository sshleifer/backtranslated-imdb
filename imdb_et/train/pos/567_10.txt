Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann joined the best Western countries who have ever done, and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the movie is the outstanding Canadian rocks, which is the story behind it. Some of the best cinematographic works made. <br /> <br /> In all five western regions, Stewart and Mann did a great job of supporting roles. There is no exception here, below the parts that may be just a few lines, the characters are firmly etched with these lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical heavy bite in this movie whose only true friend is his Walek Brennan. This is Brennan's death in the hands of the villains, which makes him want to finally get rid of the bad guys' gold and redeem him in the process. <br /> <br /> John McIntire is a prank evil and he was an undervalued actor with a great choice. He could play nice old encoders, authors' figures and, in this case, a particularly nasty and insidious villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best Western countries.
