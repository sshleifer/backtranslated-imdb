Okay, I know I don't like this movie, but I do. I laughed at the pleasant interpretation of Pat Morita's Japanese stereotype, Jay Leno's irritating petting, throughout the film. As long as you consider that this is not the best film in the world, it is a good mvie. <br /> <br /> My favorite is Morita, who talks to her boss in Tokyo, drinking the second time.
