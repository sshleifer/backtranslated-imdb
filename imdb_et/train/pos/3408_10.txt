I'll give this movie to camp A + alone! As Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva wrote in her mother's book: "If God sees the camp of God in the context of a high camp, it can be very amusing." And how! I laughed gladly at the burnt-out score and amazingly, ridiculously, fantastic melodramatic dialogue. Viewers who have read Boyer's toupee accounts (which should have stayed in the heat) will always stick to the look. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other as they give their rows - instead they look at their distance in a dream, probably so that their face can be photographed at the best angle and with the most favorable light (if you are starring in turkey, it also looks good). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in her book, Dietrich managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and let him design some of the most adorable gowns, such as a chiffon beige dress and cover. <br /> <br /> I wholeheartedly agree with other reviewers who grab Technicolor. It is really hard to believe that the film was made in 1936 - the color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you look at Allah's gentle attitude and embrace your stupidity, you can't help but enjoy it.
