I saw this movie 12 years ago in TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and they showed it twice with Tom Jones (1963). I haven't seen this movie on TV. I was interested in seeing this movie because one star is very funny and talented Jim Dale, like Lusty sailor. I believe Dale is now talking about Harry Potter's books on Casette, but still she's pretty funny. It's a fast paced comedy. It is not VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through their film collection and consider restoring and distributing this movie to DVD. Christopher Plummer is as fun as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as a Ramble sailor. This is a clever comedy that no longer sees, with great product values. *** 1/2 stars ****
