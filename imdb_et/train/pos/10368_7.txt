Meryl Streep was incredible in this movie. She has an amazing skill in accents and she shows the incredible skill of this movie. I felt him very much when Lindy was persecuted. He also played realistically. He became harsh, irritated and uncomfortable as the media and the government continued their unfortunate witchcraft. I didn't expect much from the movie initially, but I'm really interested in it and the film is based on real person and real events. It turned out better than I had expected. Sam Neill was also outstanding; this is the best job I've seen of her, and I've really liked her in other movies (like Piano). I gave the movie 7, but if I can only judge the actor, I'd give it to 9.5 and 10 for Streep.
