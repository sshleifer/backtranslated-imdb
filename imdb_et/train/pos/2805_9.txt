Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie. I could never see it. There is nothing in the plot that interests me. I don't know anything about football (football). I'm one of those American fools who has no idea. I had never seen David Beckham before that movie. I decided to ignore the buzz around this movie when it appeared in America. Enough of me. It is true to say that this little mistake in making a movie from the sky was ignored. With a fun movie. It's full of color and overflow. I was stacking the face through the whole movie. Parminder Nagra is so cute and lovable that you can't help her. No wonder why the American TV show E.R. I have a new evaluation of Indian culture. These people know how to spend time. Wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was decoding some British slangs and dialogues through accents. I turned to English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a film criticism!) I'm sure that audiences around the world have difficulty understanding the ever-changing slang in American films. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect date movie. It has a great piece of sport like Rocky and a strong feminism that gives women greater influence. I watched it with my wife and sixteen-year-old brother, and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
