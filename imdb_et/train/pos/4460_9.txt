Ah, Kelly / Sinatra sailor music. So familiar, right? Yeah, but that's not what you usually hear. It is so in the city. But if you stick, you can learn something. Okay, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh speaks two sailors during a two or four day holiday. Joe is "Sea Wolf" and Clarence, a book type, revealing Joe "dame". Now that these caps are received, they get a little Donald's home. There they meet Susie, who is the bully. I was joking! Clarence loves her. At least he thinks he does. Is he right? Or is he a moor? Or is he just a mistake in society? Explore all this and more when you look at {trumpet fans} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson, something other than a sick sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
