I've recently seen this movie thanks to Jake's latest success with Brokeback Mountain. I thought I could see the movies I miss. I had no expectations of going to the movie, so I was surprised that I didn't answer that movie at all. This is an enchanting father and son, and it is an undercut. I even finished this wonderful story in the finale. This movie likes every age. The only reason I give it to the tenth ten is that it slows down slightly in the middle, but eventually it comes back strongly. The action was great, the story was great, and cinematography was enchanting because of the setting of cinema. SEE THIS MOVIE! Rent it, buy it, check it out, LOVE IT! I know I did!
