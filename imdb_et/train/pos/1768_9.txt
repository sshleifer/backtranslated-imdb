I haven't laughed at this movie for a long time. I have to go to the previous screening and I was excited because I was dying to see it. I had lots of eyes laughing throughout the film. All the audience shared my smile and bumped and teased the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Stuff to Steve Carrell (whom I had already been). In this film he proves his immense comedy of talent. She has a style I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is great as always. Thanks to God, Will Ferrell had no camouflage (love him but saw him too much this summer). <br /> <br /> In this movie, part of the comedy was genius. Partly thanks to Carrell and partly thanks for writing (also Carrell). Waxing scene and speed dater with "obvious problem" were completely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I will definitely go to the '40 Year Old Virgin 'if it is released. My advice: go see it for a huge laugh and it's an incredibly enjoyable movie.
