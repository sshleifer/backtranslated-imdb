Strangely enough, this movie didn't make a big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video to be released. My expectations, where they are high, but where they are not disappointed in any way. As always with Ang Lee, there is a fantastic actor, an intelligent and exciting plot that is right for you to finish and make great movies. With Unforgiven, it is easily one of the two best western parts of the 90s. <br /> <br /> People who expect something like Mel Gibson's Patriot (corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) are sour disappointed, all others who appreciate the above-mentioned qualities look fantastic. 9 out of 10
