The movie was collected in 4 bucks on the flea market, definitely got my money worth! There's less care for hot babes, but the animation just blew me after Simpson's steady diet (Sorry, Mr Groening). The best part, facial expressions. Recommend several views with some cool voices, good friends and a couple of cold!
