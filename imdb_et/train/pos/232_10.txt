What a pleasant movie. The characters were not only alive, but also alive, reflecting real everyday life and family conflicts. Each character gave the story a unique personality that the audience could easily associate with someone they know in their family or in the circle of close friends. may become part of the drama, laughter, and tears during the film's development. The script does a good job of capturing the emotions, actions and reactions of the characters to conflicts, opinions and solutions. . Lots of knowledge head nods and "ahhh" moments to share and enjoy.
