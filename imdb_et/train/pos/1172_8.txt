And another South Park race will end. It was not such a strong episode as I had hoped, but the night of the living homeless was a stronger finisher, Stanley's Cup, Ts, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. She still can't get a candle for Christmas and Goobacks by Woodland Critter, but few episodes can do it. <br /> <br /> Night of the Homeless is an attack on the zombie genre, which is only performed by South Park. Instead of eating the zombies, the units are homeless who seek change and seem to be out of it. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are locked in the community center, although this time on the roof where they can explore the scene. A particularly funny moment is when one member discovers that his home is lost and becomes homeless, leaving Randy with a choice but to shoot. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, there were four boys to solve the problem. the whole story behind the takeover of the homeless, which is trying to convey the message, but which is serious. South Park is at its best when it's ridiculous. Matt and Trey played safe this week and didn't criticize the homeless, but broke it. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> This is the first time that suicide in South Park goes wrong, and we look at poor people failing to keep their brains and then try themselves several times when he dies painfully. Another inspired lunch park moment. <br /> <br /> In general, the episode was funny, but it remained big, leaving the homeless commentary on the homeless and sticking to the zombie shtick. The end is somewhat funny but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait until October for the next episode of the batch. It is long-lasting, but South Park must approve it. The show seemed to be out of steam last season, but now it's back in full shape.
