Originally I rented this movie for my daughter because she wanted football - and I wasn't so disappointed (except for the football scene). As a father, I think I was a bit surprised by the introduction of the subject of lesbianism - but I must admit that as parents, these issues are nowadays fully accessible to children (as uncomfortable as I know the subject). In a sense, this emotion was the main prerequisite for the film's confusion - that you have to trust your children at some point to make their own choices. This dilemma highlights the East Indian legacy of a young British-born teenage girl - Jasminder (Jess) who dreams of having professional football. The unexpected marriage of a older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage gives her many rich opportunities to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jessi's disappointment with his parents' expectations - again, it is not essentially the same as most child-parent relationships. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY football scenes are very large (learning a lot slowly) and although I didn't need a story - something was needed to continue the movie.
