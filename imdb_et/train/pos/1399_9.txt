This is one of the lowest episodes that the plot really looked like an excuse for just having fun. BUT, I appreciated this lightweight approach and it is really one of the best episodes to see in a purely fun way. Think about it - team members meet with a white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight's wheel who kills McCoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the end. Despite all the dangers, you can't take everything very seriously - it's just too much fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's a great thing.
