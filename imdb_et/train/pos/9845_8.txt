I'm not lying, it's a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago in my local theater. I saw it a second time and I was a bit bored in a slow scene. Sid (lazy) isn't all that flattering, but Diego (the mountain lion, I think) is very good in the movie. Animation is outstanding and the story is an end to the story. It is worth taking children 10 and under, but teenagers find it a bit boring. The uniqueness of the characters is also so interesting. As I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I'd appreciate the "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 8/10
