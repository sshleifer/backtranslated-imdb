It is an extremely tight, harsh and complicated film that strikes quite slowly, revealing tortured details, such as the attention paid in the novel, and watching the movie "IS" like watching a novel. Although I didn't tell the narrator because I felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances, this film has some of the best actors in the band I've ever seen, and the leader, Phoenix, is fabulous. His innocence and naive may find unlikely, a kind of cross in Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this criticism, but it is still fabulous, partly because it is different from what I have seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly beautiful, filmed by Eric Gautier and part of what is so unique about this movie is how it never shows what to expect. It is always surprising and, despite the length of the movie, it is never more known than necessary. After 163 minutes, it is very short, guilty of one of the miracles of this movie. It's full of short moments that are just stunning, some of the best you see all year round, and all these moments will ultimately add an extraordinary film experience. The moments of the family are unique, Ian Holm is great and what this film says about theater is not seen in Cassavets' opening night or even in Chaplin's "Limelight" films. But believe it or not, this movie is much less common. I never knew where this movie was going, and now, having seen it, it still has many options. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.
