Message movie, but pretty good. Outstanding cast, top down. Interestingly, the plot of the Bette Davis plot is essentially a back story! Extremely Negative Ratings (Scenario / Playwright Name Associating it With Extremely Negative Comments "Angles in America" ​​and Others, etc.) It is against the fact that the film is not too preaching from Germany in World War II. Gosh, this is just a bit too complicated understanding of morality for me. <br /> <br /> The styles of theater and filmmaking and action vary over time and, of course, 70 years later this movie is not. Yes, Casablanca is a better film (or guess), but even though it was made in the same year and both have Nazis, Casablanca is mostly a love story. The love story of this movie takes the second place - more thriller. Both have quite a lot of funny accents and wonderful character actors. Children are a bit annoying and could have been changed
