Full House is a wonderful sitcom about his father, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. So Danny asks his brother, Jesse Katsopolis and his best friend Joey Gladstone, to help raise his three girls, Donna Jo 'DJ Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show and I can watch it all day. And something in Full House always makes me laugh and also sad parts. There is never a dull moment at Full House. The main characters are Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweet (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen (Michelle Tanner).
