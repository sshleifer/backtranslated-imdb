The best Treasure Island ever made. They just don't make movies <br /> <br /> any more or ever. Nobody makes such movies. More than novelty, this movie is funny, honest and exciting, but desperate, <br /> <br /> mysterious and funny. This is one of my favorite pictures. The director must have an idea of ​​what it is, but it definitely leaves room for its impressions and interpretations, leaving little to imagination. Why he hasn't done such movies anymore, I have no idea. At the same time, reminding me of some of the best knives, it's kind of like. But it's not lazy or easy.
