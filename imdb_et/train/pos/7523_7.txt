I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and it's a movie, not a movie, because it was probably HBO fired to show off its cable network sometime this year. This film depicts the Page as slavery and discipline of a fetish-pinup and B&D stag film actor who had enough talent to become a true actor. The page was a little more, and the film touches on some of its role in modeling, but not enough to balance the career of the 50th pinup icon. This film is supposedly based on Richard Foster's "The Real Bettie Page". This 1950s nostalgia is black and white. I have a book called "Bettie Page The Pinup Legend" for life that has many great photos crowning the career of the Page, and I have to say that this film repeats on the film, Gretchen Mol on Page, many of these famous photographs very accurately. Mol self Bettie Page with black wigs and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only does he see the Bettie page, but he also has the smile of his personality and the qualities that came through the camera. And her body is as close as possible to Page's copy. Terrible pain. The story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been much better. But it's a pretty good TV movie. I would appreciate it on a 7.0 scale 10 and recommend watching it on TV.
