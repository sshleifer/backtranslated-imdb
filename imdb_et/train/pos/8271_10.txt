One of the greatest hits of 1926, the Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama that includes a regatta and football scenes that gave William Haines a role he had to become an important star. This is Haines' patented all the way: a smart smart aleck who doesn't take anything serious until everyone gets away and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. No one worked on the formula like Haines. An amazing comic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could move from a comedy to a comedy tragedy. He's the full joy of this movie, as he had told Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good when a sick roommate, Ralph Bushman, is a rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams, and Grady Sutton. This movie is now celebrated with a homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and John Wayne's film debut as Yale footballer (but I never noticed him). Haines was a top-5 box office star from this picture until 1932. It is a shame that he is largely forgotten and that most of his films seem to have disappeared. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
