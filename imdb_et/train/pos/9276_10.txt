The US State Department would not want us to see this movie because they have Iranian state-owned beef. But it shows us how a civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the film, which focuses on women's struggle for equal rights in the simplest way: we can watch a football game on the stadium that is strictly limited to the male audience. The film is funny and funny in itself, it is a proof of freedom of expression and freedom of expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie intensely. Five girls are trying to enter the police border at the ticket gates to a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The resulting comedy is too funny to describe the bus stadium until the police intervene and the ensuing detention of the girls to the end. Don't miss this classic movie. See this BLACK. One of the best foreign films I've seen for years.
