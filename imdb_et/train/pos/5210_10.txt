His shame that he didn't get the credit on the screen, he did the best job in the movie, the girl on the cross, the best part of the movie. They had much more impact than Avril or almost anyone else in the movie. He almost made S / M look like fun! He was really believable to have an S / M model that scares his situation. Although they seem to be confused that such a dreamy feeling that you are looking for a bad boy, these sets were very well structured, but they just cut off what was photographed. This is one film that both cuts should be made available. They seem to have missed a lot, and almost all the really dark things that would have made the film a lot of dementia. Such as they finished the short sign they were going through during filming. What was shot would probably not have been an R-rating for NC-17 or X, but that would have been what he should have done to make the film as it should have been.
