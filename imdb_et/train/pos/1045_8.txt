Lillian Hellman, one of America's most famous female playwrights, was a missionary woman. His left-wing views were not well maintained at that time. In his memory, he talks about his trip to the Soviet Union because he was interested in the achievements of this system. As a result of these years, there must be a "view of the Rhine". The American left wing, like the rest of the world, was linked to the rise of fascism, not only in Europe but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> "Look on the Rhine" was Broadway eight months before the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack. In this, she proclaimed the American entrance to World War II. Adaptation is credited to Mrs Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, who is her long companion. As Herman Shumlin has shown on the screen, the film first came in 1943 for the first time. <br /> <br /> We will be introduced to the Muller family when opening the movie. They cross the border with the United States in Mexico. They have to continue to Muller's home in Washington, where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a small hostess of celebrities. We understand that Mullers are fleeing from Europe due to persecution against opponents of the totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, we thought Mullers might have been better if they were Jews, fleeing to a definite destruction. <br /> <br /> We find that Mr. Muller has had a terrible time in local land, as well as in other places because his appearance is a condemnation of Fascim. Little does he know that he comes to his mother-in-law house, one of the worst exhibitors of this philosophy. <br /> <br /> Film offers great shows everywhere. This is a piece of curiosity because of Bette Davis's supporting role. Paul Lukas, who repeated his Broadway role, is quite convincing, as Kurt Muller, a righteous man who wants to make a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas is doing a great job of depicting Kurt Muller, repeating the role that made him a plateau on Broadway. <br /> <br /> Another great show is Lucile Watson, who plays Fanny Farrelly, the matriarch of this family. . Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as Marthe de Brancov, a guest of Farrelly, married to George Coulouris, a Nazi sympathy with a despicable Teck de Brancovis. Beulah Bond, Donald Woods, and the rest of the support casts give good productions led by Mr Shumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should remind us of the evil of totalitarian rule.
