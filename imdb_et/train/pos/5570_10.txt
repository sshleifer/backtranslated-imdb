Sopmorous is this movie. But it's funny when everything comes out. This shows the "boys' changing room mentality" played by the "other side". It is good to see that such ups and downs change and how stupid they are. But this is probably not the news for most women because (ask only one), "they've heard me before". <br /> <br /> Look at it in a small group or party, and 97.3% of space laughs for 2 hours straight. And the remaining 2.7% ... can you really like them?
