One word: suPURRRRb! I don't think I've seen anything like this on the net or on cable TV for a long time. Watching this show was like a breath of fresh air, full of TV shows full of reality shows and boredom. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I had reservations. After all, critics were almost unanimous to joke and show down. But half an hour passed (by the way, thank you, NBC, for showing a free commercial show), I missed the instant love, love at first glance, the true love that a person knows in his guts. Everything about this exhibition was screaming EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> Graphics in this show were at least as good as finding Nemo and Shrek. Taking these films into consideration, we didn't have to work out over the years. <br /> <br /> The cast was wonderful. I'm part of John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the team was definitely equal to John. Special note: Lisa Kudrow guest. He was at the beginning of the game, creating a neurotic, puddle and a lovable panda with him in the Jews. (Panda Brooklyn? Only in this show.) <br /> <br /> The script was funny, a lot of internal and adult jokes that were sharp but not sticky. Note to all parents: This is not for children. This exhibition has never been advertised as such and is why it is set to nineteen, not at 8:00. So, if you want to complain about the "annoying context", save your breath. Adults deserve the comedy made for them, and the Father of pride is it. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a bit confused by Siegfried and Roy's characters. Do I know their stereotype? Yeah, they're gay. Yes, they are amazing. Yes, they speak German accent. But this is yesterday's news. Give us something new, something fresh, something funny. Placing old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this exhibition wanted to use the "star power" they have. That's good for me. But please do not hold something that everyone knows from the heart. Hopefully the rest of the performance will not be shown on the same old album. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show is definitely a black-and-white TV. Funny, witty, a couple of unexpected twists and turns here and there - that's not because Seinfeld is good. I am looking forward to the next episode.
