I wasn't born until four years after this wonderful show, but luckily I managed to attack from the mid-90s and the rest is history ...... I was hooked. The assumption was quite simple; Two hardened Nemesian agents, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are collaborating with experts (if not young) doctors and biologists (Sharron Macready) to drive the use of a dangerous biological agent behind the bamboo card. by red china. When they flee, their plane hits a machine gun fire and they break into the heart of the Himalayas, where their life is saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilization that heals and raises the trio's senses, creating a scene for many exciting adventures to come ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted 30 hours of episodes, and I think it was his relatively short, one-season race that has set the status of culture. <br /> Monty Berman, a producer, was known for doing things as cheaply as possible, sometimes for getting it with very incredibly sticky sets - especially in episodes like "Happening" (a studio that replaced the Australian upside down) and the "Operation Deep Freeze Package" and "The Beginning", but if you miss it and focus on the characters and story line, the show was really fun. It had a great blend of adventure and abundant humor (mostly from some amazing lining) The fun is a lot of fun, and this is confirmed by the documentary of the 2005 reunion, with three reuniting after 35 years to remember the show (and laugh at Anthony Nicholls' terrible wig!). I must say that I was always a fan of Richard Barrett - I loved my sardonic humor with this dangerous edge - he was definitely the man you didn't cross and these eyes ........ apparently would look on the television. I've also been following Bill Gaunts's career since then. But Craig Stirling would surely have been a legion of his female fans and I am sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole host of male fans running over him. including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> <br /> For me, there were remarkable episodes: "Auto Kill", "Poll", "Fanatics", "Mission" and "Gilded Cage", but I'm sure every person has their own personal favorites. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to look at this example for the first time or after years of watching it, remember that you look at it when it was done, and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the three-wire chemistry are , which made this wonderful show for me and I don't think I'll ever wear it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
