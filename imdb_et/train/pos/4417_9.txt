This film is a lyrical and romantic monument, spoken by the eyes of an 11-year-old boy who lives in the Castro Revolution, a rural Cuban town. This is probably a true work worthy of love. <br /> <br /> CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are simply trying to mislead it. JULIA DAMAGE is much more meaningful. It is more common to European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is simply inconvenient for people's daily lives and hobbies. This fact alone makes the film fairer than most of Cuba's works dealing with that time. <br /> <br /> Excessive use of the voice handler undermines the story, but the film does the unqualified clips of Hollywood movies that say so much visually as the narrator. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO and fair play as the film excites films, but has lost the loss of a lifestyle that goes beyond lost love. <br /> <br /> Revolution, like the movie JULIE, never seems to be over.
