In the 1970s, Amicus made almost half a dozen of these horror anthems, and this is one of the best efforts of the leading horror player Robert Bloch. All four values ​​are worth, but two - "sweets sweet" and "murder method" - distinguish themselves for fear of very effective warfare. <br /> <br /> "Sweets", Christopher Lee plays an impatient widow whose cute daughter (Chloe Franks) is reluctant to her careless and brutal intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of malicious evil and is one of the greatest childhood activities in the horror film from Martin Stephens "The Innocents". This installment is directed to a great nuance and the final indignation that appears during the screen is the moment of the purest horror. <br /> <br /> The murder method is related to a horror writer (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his own creations, the horrible Dominic. This episode is striking for its simplicity and sharp fear. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell has a great time with our expectations. The short pictures of Dominic, which are reflected in the pond or considered to be a fleeting fantasy in the meadow, are truly haunting. <br /> <br /> The original poster work featuring a skeleton figure that connects the tray with Peter Cushing's interrupted head to a rich peace of mind for the punters who are scared.
