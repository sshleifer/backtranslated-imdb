Why can't this type of compact, entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing. An excellent ensemble is cast. William Powell has a real star quality. Who knows - maybe he tried his future like Nick Charles. He is glad to look. You can also see why Eugene Pallette made over 200 films. She is a great supportive character and her great chemistry with Powell is fun to watch. Mary Astor doesn't do more than average work in a very fat fashion. All other hands are chipping to make it a completely enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect that Michael Curtiz had his leadership. Bravo!
