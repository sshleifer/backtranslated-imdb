Yes, some people have said this film was a waste of money, but I'm a fan of a hard dragon / world ending / sacred film. <br /> <br /> But when you take my position on this film, some of the best action sences were pretty dang good. But this kind of movie, just in time or just when it was evil, had become harder to save them on time. Although the film had surprised me with funny lines and gangs, the 3D graphics were pretty good. I mean a movie that 3D effects were great! The big battle shown on the trailers corresponds to what the film had. The fight between good and evil was at the end, I have to say that it could have been longer and a little better, it was still pretty good. <br /> <br /> Now, in some parts that I think would have been better. At first it was pretty good, showing the parts leading to big battles. I mean, if you really don't want to see this movie in theaters, then at least it's a DVD player ... <br /> <br /> Generally I loved the movie, but the plot just shook to speed up and fit harder.
