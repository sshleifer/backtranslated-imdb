In all the comments that praised or attacked Dalton's work, I thought he was great. He doesn't play Rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy, but as a robber, a powerful man. I liked this version, although the video game was sometimes annoying and the scenes between Jane and St. John were never really gelled. I'll give it 8.
