How can I see with Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger if possible? Well, I couldn't and so, I rented this movie's confusion. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by this young man's legend. I was also surprised when this movie was mediocre. Maybe I found it difficult to follow this story, that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4-hour film marathon, or perhaps because it was a bit slow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it's slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional signs. <br /> <br /> Although I would like to recommend it as a flip-flop, this is a great story about Australian history (considering how young the country is, it is very rare and should be evaluated) and the film has some good actions. <br /> <br /> 6/10 see this as a historical value .... (yes yes ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
