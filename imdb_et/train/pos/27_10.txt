Emilio Miraglio "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is the most complete example of a giallos I've ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements into one embarrassing tomb. First and foremost for me, this is a tremendous, complicated plot that will ultimately be perfectly reasonable, and the killer here will not be completely out of the way at the end. The story of the murders of a number of murders (you already know how much the title of the movie is, right?), What happens to the two siblings in the form of an obvious ancient prophecy is inclusive and murderous, red-hidden it's a crazy laugh of a mad and memorable mad woman. Every big giall has some beautiful actors, and here we have a fairly large selection, led by a ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and one of her earlier roles in the fashion house of Sybil Danning Barbara as a passionate tramp. Another good ingredient in good giallo is the catchy, hummable score and Bruno Nicolai will give it one for the movie that should stay with you for the day. Gorgeous Landscape? Check again. The film, which has been filmed largely in Wurzburg, Germany, is truly outstanding. OK, ok, but how are these murders? After all, isn't that what gialli is? Well, I am pleased to announce that most viewers should be very pleased with the various knives, shootings, impalements, and other carnage that this film tastefully nourishes ... not to mention crypts, the order of freaky dreams, rats and bats (and too much too! ), Drug References, Rape, Mandatory Red Herring, and Ugo PaglÄ—, Female Hunky Leading Person. As I said, the perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD is from No Shame's fine people and you know what it means: proud print and load attachments to launch! Thank you guys!
