The Indian summer is a warm, multi-character film that makes a fine afternoon movie (a bit of editing). <br /> <br /> The film begins with a group of children in the past, who have been shown a moose that sets the tone well before cutting to the present day, when an adult group of "golden age" camps is called again to spend a few weeks in camp camp, Uncle Lou. With the movie, the viewer can spend time with these characters when they remember their memories in their camp and make new memories at their last stop. <br /> <br /> The movie will be a great success if it brings its characters in this great environment and allows them to develop space without having to worry about plot development. Watching these people and their relationships with each other is what the film is and why it works so well. It never goes beyond the top and melodramatic, always keeping its heat, charm and realism. I've never seen a movie where nostalgia is so well captured and I found myself pulling, despite the fact that I've never been one of those camps as a child. <br /> <br /> For a warm, nostalgic film I highly recommend.
