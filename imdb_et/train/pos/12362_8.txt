I quickly deal with film questions: it was a very interesting story about destructive qualities that concern all consuming passions; a young Italian woman who is not emotionally connected to her imprisoned political radical fianc√© (partly due to her apolitical attitudes and a liberating approach to life) finds solace and passion in the new young love with which she explicitly starts sexual relationships. The anxiety, rage, tenderness, and passion in the atmosphere of the story are equal to the unpleasant silence that seems to be involved in the two leaders. It gives the film a peaceful mood that passes through the whole political conflict that otherwise has been lost by the viewer (unless you have a profound knowledge of Italian politics in the 1980s). I found a movie that is convincing ... what it was a bit devastating is a free oral sex scene that an actor performs on a male ... it's not simulated and leaves little to imagination. There are other sex scenes in the movie, which I think they were necessary because they describe the madness and loneliness that the characters live. But the mouth sex scene that I think is focused on the actual story. It was a smooth sailing until then and when the infamous sexual field appeared (which caused a lot of hoop back on its day), it's like hitting the road. It's jarring and unnecessary and I'm in a camp that believes the film wouldn't be damaged if the scene was removed from it. And it is unfortunate that this particular scene can prevent people from watching this intriguing movie, which I think is worth watching because there are so many under the surface, emotional and additional confusion in the subtext. <br /> <br Generally: Wonderful film prevents a lot of unnecessary sex.
