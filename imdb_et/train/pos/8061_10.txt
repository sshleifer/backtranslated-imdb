Victor McLaglen's production is one of the best film history. <br /> <br /> I think we all know "Gypo" because we've all won against what's right and what's not and what's wrong. It was one of the first art-house pictures released by a large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> The cinematic art of Joseph H. August is the best. However, the stunning part of August was overlooked; he did not receive the Oscar nomination he had earned. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama, a thought, a philosophy, with sadness, all of which are transmitted in the least possible words.
