Why a good actor like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this regular movie ??? !!! Cast cast some good results (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a mother without a mother and Justin Whalin, a man who was forever cut off), but the direction is very boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can't believe that such a movie was produced for a big screen! Julie Corman (producer): Are you CRAZY ??? !!!
