I went to this movie, waiting for an artistic scary movie. What I got was scary for intimidation. This is the core of the horror film. It's not boring like other horror movies where the haunted house is just ghosts and gore. This movie doesn't even show most of the deaths that show fear of characters. I think one of the best things in the concept where it is not just a house that haunts the one who goes to the house. They become haunted, no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some external reviews, I am surprised that critics do not like this film. I see it again this week and I'm glad about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars because it did what the horror movie should do. It frightened me out.
