I generally love these 1930 mystery / police Charlie Chan movies and this is no exception. But something seems bad about this movie. A recent attempt to change brain Moto films around the plot with a salad bar spoiled by comedy relief, which is as relieving as painful feet. An example buffer looks somewhere that is a clumsy English language playing a detective, and even other characters seem to relieve comedy. The plot may seem like a strange or bare excuse to us today, but at that time the opportunity for epochal archaeological discoveries was not only a real, but an ordinary event.
