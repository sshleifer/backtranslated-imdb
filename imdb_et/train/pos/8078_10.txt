Although it was a catastrophe, it's my favorite movie. This gives the family a strong message. It has a lot of violence and has one song with bikini. Compared to other Bollywood films, the action scenes of this film are more realistic. This is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see an Indian godfather, Amitabh will see it in this movie. Don't read the critic's comments, they're just ignorant. This movie contains good comedy, romance, drama and especially action. So if you want to see the action more realistically than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), it's a movie.
