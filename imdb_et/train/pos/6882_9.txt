I haven't watched the movie yet, but can't wait to see it! It looks very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen. The questions that it brought, really stopped me and made me think, a unique approach to boxing as a metaphor for "battle" ... thanks to God, someone strikes another corner with boxing. This movie is so fresh and smart. And the actor is really hot. I enjoyed a particularly short clip with Rocky movie actor, really smart. I thought the chosen topic - overcoming accidents and childhood traumas - is timeless and God knows that many people need it. Go ahead.
