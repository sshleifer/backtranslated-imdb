It must be one of my favorite films, unlike the weak Elvira Haunted Hills ... anyway I love how the movie is gz / com 'Wzzi Oz' story ... <br /> <br /> Elvira is the Dorothy goth who is a stranger in a strange city after a good needle (aunt Aunt Morgana) ... she is blocking the "Ruby" circle, which is extremely powerful and is wanted by Bad Warlock (her uncle). ..It is friendly with the four characters he unintentionally grows during the movie, with the dog pulling. His uncle (western evil witch) exhibition is where Elvira realizes that he has the strength inside him and will hit him. Finally, he sends out to the townspeople after winning their hearts and finally arrives at Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). <br /> <br /> The Oz Wizard has many references. the film ... he and his uncle both cite the lines associated with these parallel letters. Elvira: "You have to be Aunt Em and you have to be Uncle Remus .... No place like home, there's no home like home!" Bad Uncle Vinny: "I'll get you a beautiful little dog!" <br /> <br /> There is a sign that Elvira first goes on his journey to mention the state of Kansas. <Br But nevertheless, one of the sequences he "hanged, thinking it was inspired by FlashDance" is a pure genius ... and if you don't laugh, his titty twirling at the end of his "very 80's" Las Vegas show then you have no bearing bone in your body ...
