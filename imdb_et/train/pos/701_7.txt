I didn't know what to do except, so I think it was much better than it wasn't. Don't get my wrong, it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new leader and writer, so I think he deserves many praise for making this movie. You can say that this is a loving thing. Action (outside Dominicit) is a little cheesy and the quality of the movie is not great, but a movie with a really low budget movie is good. There were times when the story shrinks and there are parts that drag, even though I don't feel that it seriously undermines my ability to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I'll say it. The gag reel was fun, I don't break it, but there is a specific scene that makes buying a DVD worth it so you can watch it over and over again. If you like the movie, check out The Pink Mirror, a film made by Jagged Edge. I know Dominic fans enjoy this little sky.
