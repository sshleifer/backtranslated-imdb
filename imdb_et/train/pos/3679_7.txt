I just watched the movie two days ago and I was full of anticipation because Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent 18 months there in the 80s very romantic. I was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, although original and artistic, did not hit the city "light" and beauty very well. Not enough romance! We didn't see any trees lined with boulevards ... There was too much darkness, not just literally, but figuratively. Some plots manipulated the viewer, which seemed, and let him "flat" (the Marais sequence, the odds sales order to give two examples). Resurrection, good: Mime's sequence, cemetery, Montmartre (though it was too much for an observer to understand), "Cowboy" vignette and Sacre Coeur - seemed a little and far away, and I would have liked to see such a wonderful actor as Orlando Bloom is something that would be more of their originality.
