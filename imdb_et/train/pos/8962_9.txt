As Pagan, I have to say that this film has little or no magic. It is a "funny" witchcraft and is not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magic of all and it should never be used in a controlled or revenge way. It is a lesson that everyone must learn, not just the Gentiles. <br /> <br /> That's what Kim Novak and the glorious Jimmy Stewart have written and admired. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold gives Biancale a star, Elsa Lanchester (with too many movie credits, unless Mrs. Jane Marbles died of death) was wonderful as Mrs Novak's incomplete and still capable upstairs queen Queenie. Jack Lemmon (wonderful performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly funny) also play. <br /> <br /> "Witches can't cry. Why, they don't get one tear because their heart is full of magic. There's no time for foolish things like love." Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and his brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are witches of Manhattan. They are deep inside the craft secret underworld where they live among the other New Yorkers, one of them without the raised eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But then Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a solid, non-messy, dedicated businessman who is dealing with Gillian's old college rival. <br /> <br /> Because of his happy accident, he finds that he is moving into the Gillian building and is terribly "charmed" by his charm and grace. With the use of Magick, a little help from Pyewacket (Gillian is familiar, Robert E. Blair trained) and Queenie, Gillian will work on this beautiful new dream man to return to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> Aga> Magick should never be used to control or injure, and Gillian learns to do the hard way in the most horrible way. Not only does he have to face what he has done, but he has to face Shep with his guilt. <br /> <br /> From a critical perspective; but the film is a serious move: the consequences are very clear that they are clean bearings. Some landscapes were seemingly struck in the basement of someone's small home, but at least the characters were peculiar and fun. <br /> <br /> With a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Big cat! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> Trivia's remark is that this beloved Bewitched television environment has its roots. It introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All note marks are present and counted. You just have to look to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorites and I look at it often. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 9.1 / 10. .. <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
