Other commentators have described in detail the plot and social parable and comments (or better) that I could get, but I would like to join my admiration for the gem of this small film. It really rises more than 50 years later in every category - scenario, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it's really classic. It was my first contact with "young" Alec Guinness, and this is obvious from the first frame that made her so special that she finally got a knighthood. <br /> <br /> I only appreciate it with "8" because it is a fairly mild parable that explores human nature, but does not really shore it; and because the plot will be readily removed at the end, instead of actually solving the conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who pass through the city. Even a few minutes of reasoning shows the main mistake in the logic of the scenario - wear is almost always a decisive factor in buying new clothes (especially clothing); children grow up, people change in size, get and lose weight, and go to the latest fashions all the time, as long as looms are woven fabrics. And if nothing else, the manufacturer will make a fortune that will provide indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> However, this is a great movie. If you can see it in a classic movie channel, you should do it.
