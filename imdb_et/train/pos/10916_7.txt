Beating the comic between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of the mystery of murder that has one odd and unlikely plot. Powell is probably the 30's most common detective, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like tiny bells. They are extremely fun to watch, so take a plethora of salt in the plot and just enjoy seeing it. Eric Blore also has some comics like Powell butler. <br /> <br /> Powell's contract with MGM contained a clause that allowed him to refuse lending to another studio, but he wanted to work with Arthur again, and he liked the scenario so he praised the task. They had worked together in two 1929 Paramount films, Canary Murder Case and Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.
