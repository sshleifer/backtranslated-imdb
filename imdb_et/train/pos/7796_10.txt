It was the first movie I ever saw in Ashley Juddis and Victor Nunez's first movie, which I'll ever say, and the boy I'm glad I did. Its "silent tone, its relaxed pace," the real images of a young woman who starts in life, in her fine description of the struggles she has to make to make decisions in her life, the decisions she makes for real reasons ". things, the people he meets - there's nothing wrong with this movie. It's as close to the magic of film as I've ever seen outside of "Star Wars" movies, and given the similarity of these films, it means that this movie really deserves a high rating. Ashley Judds is acting, Mr Nunez'writing, and this great, simple, worthwhile story makes it a beautiful era and a wonderful movie.
