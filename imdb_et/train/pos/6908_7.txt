Richard Dreyfuss celebrates Moon Over Parador, a 1988 Paul Mazursky film featuring Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays the movie in Parador in the Caribbean in New York with actor Jonathan Nolan. When the dictator dies suddenly, the secret police officer (Julia), who is actually a dictator and a state-controlled, drafts Jonatan to play the dictator after noticing their similarity. Soon, Jonathan palace will enter if Alphonse Simms and Simms' prostitute girlfriend Madonna (Braga), who understands the switch, will help her in some way. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears as a mother of Simms, gives us an overview of how the CIA operates in third countries. Winters' character, supposedly a salesman, is actually CIA operational. The film, however, flirts but doesn't really hit very seriously and it is more sending and funny. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss does a fabulous job with Jonathan's actor and Alphonse dictator, creating two separate characters and nails both. The magnificent Sonia Braga is great, like Madonna, and Raul Julia is maliciously speaking in a funny performance like Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. This is one of those performances where you never know what a character thinks - he can be pleasant or psycho at any time. Charo is a hand like a maid and manages to be funny and unnoticeable at the same time. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, not a big bunch, but a lot of fun.
