This is the last episode we deserve. At the end of last season, things were "alive" to the mood that hardly deserved this realistic series. Although it was not a happy show, this series was always what you thought (a rare thing on television) and it is no exception. "Is death justified?" â€œDoes morality reflect society or is society shaped by the morals that small authorities choose? "What is just death and can it be?" All of these questions, and others that are shown by the authors of this exhibition every week, are their final thesis. Well-functioning, great writings, wonderful camera work, brilliant editing, pure direction. Once you've seen this series and run for the first time, you can copy it somehow. If you did not follow this series when it ran, it stays on its own, but it can be difficult if we try to keep up with all the characters and what they refer to in their diverse past. For those of us who had watched the series in the last two seasons, this is a very satisfying look.
