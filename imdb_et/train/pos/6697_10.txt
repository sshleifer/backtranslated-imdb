For the first time I remember watching Sabrina when she came on TV in ITV1 in the UK when I was 13/14. I'm 24 years old now and I love it as much as I did when I first saw it. I get a little stuck with some of my friends to still look at "show kids", but I don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite and later became a favorite of Morgan. I remember spending so much time watching various special events that honored Sabrina's TV show Nickeleoden UK. I love Mell Joan-Hart, she was a great "Clarrissa Explains All", but that much better. I was gutted when they decided to stop it! I hope it will be released soon on DVD here in the UK - I'm the first! lol x
