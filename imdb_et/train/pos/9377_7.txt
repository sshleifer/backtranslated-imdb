A surprise dancer with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pillow. An excellent casting mix with an intriguing plot, led by Twin Peaks-ish director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very undervalued actor and shows a man who is looking for a great relationship and is looking for the right thing. J.T. Walsh (RIP for a big actor) is always a wonderful villain like Dennis Hopper. It is so shameful that he never made a bigger profile. I'm sure he has his followers. All in all, this is a great movie that shows you don't have to be a big bang or a commercial sound for an entertaining movie.
