With Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was the iconic Columbo villain. Columbo's first "true" episode, followed by two separate pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from the classic status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, one of the partners in the mystery of the murder. . His partner, Jim, is talented, while Ken has no talent other than a gif of gift and skill to promote books. As soon as Jim has decided he no longer needs Ken's marketing skills, Ken will code a plot to kill Jim. With the exception of the fact that it is not a new plot, it is actually the actual execution of the murder leader, which was originally intended for one of their books. <br /> <br /> It won't take Columbo long to find out that Ken is a murderer, though unfortunately there must be some more murder (Ken Romans and then kill the main witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to convince. <br /> <br /> Nothing is wrong with Murder By The Book, but it's not quite top-notch. I would just give the "Publish Or Perish" edge to this: both episodes include Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but "Publish Or Perish" is a group that is more intense and unpredictable. But it's still a big episode.
