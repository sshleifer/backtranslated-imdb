Within 60 seconds. where i started, it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars. people say it is not a good movie, I do not agree that it has some parts with cheeses, but which movie is not. I gave him 8 out of 10 reasons for the action and comic relief if you like Rock or Face Off when this movie is just a good job of your alley cage with one of the least rated actors in my mind Del-Roy Lindo. I think sometimes people sometimes see movies a long way to sit in the movie and after the words ask themselves whether they achieve what they are showing. it means that when they acted it was an act of action. when they try to change the movie to change movies and try to win every prize with their prize? I think they made their activated movie, give it a chance and you won't lose.
