I saw this movie for the first time when I was a little boy and fell in love. Sets are breathable and some scripts are the right ones for the devil: "You are the son of thousands of fleas". <br /> <br /> It's always on TV late at night or really woke up at around 3:00 in the early morning and it just started. TV companies have to show a little more respect and put it on Sunday for the first time so everyone can see this good work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
