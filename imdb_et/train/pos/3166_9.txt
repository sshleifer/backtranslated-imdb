This exhibition has arrived so far. At the beginning, EVERYONE, as director directed by Eric Fez, were all new actors and actors, fresh faces, and just watching what they achieved. They stayed at the show and it was a success. Its one of the best shows ever made and probably the most fun sitcom I've seen in my life. It's sad to see it come to an end, but when they finish this show, I hope for God that one of the biggest bangs ever in the finals of the season will be out on the finale of the series. I don't care if the whole season sucks because they store all the fuel for the final episode. Go down, turn one last blow. The exhibition deserves it, fans deserve it when they go, let everyone know it ends, like Friends, and let the finals be huge. I say Donna and Eric got married, I say Hyde and Kelso are fighting and will become friends again. I say there is something interesting between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for a long time, but of course he's used to it. BY OFF OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY! <br /> <br /> This 70's exhibition is always the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had friends. You are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
