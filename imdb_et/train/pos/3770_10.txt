When will people know that some movies have been made fun and may not necessarily change the world? If you understand this, wait for you to look at "Bill and Tedi's fake journey". This is a movie that is a bunch of things to look at, Keanu and Alex make an excellent screen team who repeats their character "The Great Adventure of Bill and Ted" even more "style", then they had the first movie. It's not rocket science, but it's nice to laugh that the characters are very similar and the story is so radical that you have to laugh. Don't expect 'deep and meaningful' to just wait for pure fun!
