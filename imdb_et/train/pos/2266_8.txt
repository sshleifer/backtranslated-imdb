Nick Nolte's practice of getting to Nebraska takes some time before we can just accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. When you are out of the bar, it becomes an exciting story about a person who loses everything when trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Nolte, an American, moves to Germany, marries a famous actor and is satisfied with success in every respect until the war begins to rest. He has visited the American Jovial, John Goodman, who persuades him to accept an anti-Semitic radio broadcast for the Nazis. Nolte has no policy, but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that is almost impossible and then play it yourself. Another American secret agent changes Nolte's radio scripts, adding cough here, sneezing, which works to transmit intelligence to allies. Yet there is a catch. No one knows Nolte's actual role as an American agent, except for Goodman, Donovan and Roosevelt himself. Once he has discovered, he refuses to recognize Americans. <br /> <br /> Nolte goes down and his vicious circles are very popular in Germany. His adorable wife, Sheryl Lee, does not know what is going on or cares. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as "the people of two nations." The war ends and the problem begins. He's been caught by Americans who are bitter because of their betrayal. They beat him and left the mud. He saved Goodman, his "fairy tale", who sends him an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sends him some money now and then. <br /> <br /> By 1960, he managed to grow his friendship with a neighbor, painter Alan Arkin, who has lost his family and claims that these two are now part of the secret brotherhood. However, his location and his identity are leaking somewhat, and he is more or less accepted by a group of old racist racists led by a dentist and a priest. In front of his house and the mailbox are painted with swastians and accusations. It is meaningless for the former GI. But - miraculously - his beloved wife returns her old treasures to her. Second catch: it turns out that it's not her husband, but a younger sister who has loved her in adolescence. <br /> <br /> He has finished writing his memories in Israeli Prison in 1967 before crimes against humanity. It's not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can talk, but can't see a cellular passenger in prison. This is Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann seems nice enough. He suggests to Nolte that it is a bad habit to write fifteen hours. "It's important to relax. You have to learn to relax." Nolte laughs loudly and shouts, "This is how I went here." Kile is filled with such iron. At one moment in his relaxed conversations, Arkin tells him that "in spite of everything I think, people are good at heart." I don't know if the film was a commercial success, but if it wasn't, it would be a thing that could have torpedoed it for a younger theater visitor who would never talk to Anne Frank, to say the allegedly final statement in her journal. <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is an adult and adult movie. The story moves slowly, there is little violence, no cars, no shooting, and people don't seem to be under the pressure of manic speech. Many of them will probably slip past viewers who will not reveal their intentional approach. Nolte refers to his relationship with his wife during the war as a "people of two nations". This is a pretty compact phrase. There is no doubt that anyone could come up with a glib definition, but there is little focus on grabbing this emotional import. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a man who loses everything - his ability to write, his identity, his wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-esteem. At one point, he stops walking over the overcrowded New York Street and just stays there until darkness as he travels through a curious cop. The reason he stopped, is that he just doesn't have a place to go. Vonnegut describes much more than depression. I don't want to be tempted, but it is a feeling that your young people find it hard to understand. Adolescents might think they know what Nolte is in this place, but it really requires maturity and acceleration that only maturity can bring. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that Robert Frost's home at home is where you will go when you go there? Well, no place takes Nolte in.
