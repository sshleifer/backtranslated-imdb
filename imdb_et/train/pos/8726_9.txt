Now it should be a family movie! In recent years, there have been few films aimed at families or children who are really worthy of public viewing; but it is one of them. My whole family went away from the movie, scared, entertained, blinded and happy. We quote here and there a little anecdotes. Children loved it and so did we (hubbie and I am 36 and 32 respectively)! <br /> <br /> In addition to your beautiful and striking animation, characters (small as they are, and imagine as they are) are very well developed. They are not anyone you can't understand. Individuals who bring these little creatures to life are well-tuned talents, combined with the skills and art of some of Disney's best animators. This is a film that deserves Walt Disney itself. I think Mr Disney praised this new film from the heart ... Flick, Dot and their little heroes can be as popular in our time as Mickey and Minnie. <br /> <br /> This is one family leaving the theater who wants to see again .. and buy on their video or DVD. I want to see it again to miss the first time. (Never have I seen my children so fast and vividly that they have embraced and embraced the characters before ... my daughter still speaks a little "Dot".) <br /> <br /> This movie is funny , cordial, smart and great fun for the whole family!
