"Intruder (L'Intrus)" is the mysterious life of a visual pilgrimage. Grizzled Michel Subor plays like "Louis Trebor" like Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past who just lives in an isolated hut in the forest rightly for paranoid reasons (but attracting pretty young women who may be useful). We can learn more about him through dreams, setbacks, and trips that can be chronologically or not, as well as his brusque interaction with family, lovers, business partners, and prominent genius. Like "The Limey", the film resonates with a parent / child regret and a dubious past that has appeared with the clips of an old film with the same actor as a young man (here is Paul Gégauff's 1965 "Le Reflux adventure"). <br /> With complete mood contrast, we meet our son Sidney (Grégoire Colin), who has to be the sexiest man in the world, because he is doing sweet and seductive chores and taking care of the baby, toddler and every child. need for your working woman. Certainly, director / co-author Claire Denis has to create her as a woman's fantasy, when ever one lesson was learned for other filmmakers in pre-recording. There's an additional extended scene where she searches for her father in the forest, carefully carrying her angel to the baby's bag. He is all that his father does not have and has all the relationship that his father cannot keep; no wonder he thinks his father is "crazy". I spent the rest of the movie with fear that something bad would happen to her, because the true nature of her alienated father's heart is very gradually in front of our eyes. <br /> <br /> The film is a puzzle, but Subor is mercilessly excited when we look at him in mobility and negotiate unpleasant deals, and Denise's "Beau Travail" voice was still annoying. We have to see that he is traveling to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific. The passing of time is evidenced by the change of times and the emergence and healing of the scars created. There's plenty of water to clean and distance. <br /> <br /> Continuing the mystery of colonialism into globalization and playing a bit of the stereotypes of Mysterious Orient and Russian criminals, Denis has united the elements of Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando Tahiti with idols and French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy. page memory, the last for the title and the heart transplant plot, which was used on an ironic theme with limited immortality that has consequences. <br /> <br /> "Louis" thinks he has succeeded in being over boundaries, rules, and morals, with some entertainment in the last work, because the locals don't know what to do with him and try to solve his quixotic odyssey, even When he is again in isolation <br /> <br /> Many people in the audience were disappointed with the elliptical but amazingly beautiful story-telling method. A common narrative raises many plot questions about details.
