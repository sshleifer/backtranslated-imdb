Disney, the name of a movie that was once innocent of all things and fits all ages, has finally begun to realize that it needs to become more diverse to survive. Such diversity has been very evident in the last few years. Movies like "Tarzan" and "Emperor's New Groove" have tried to move away from the traditional Disney past and the new, uncharted territory. "Atlantis" is still a bolder step, but we must remember: this is STILL Disney. The first serious film that comes out of Disney's animation studio is a great achievement for them - in fact, it's so serious that it's in PG's territory. Perhaps many families were scared of seeing it last summer. the audience, so the plot was supposed to be easy enough for the kids to understand it, but interesting enough to take away the "little mermaid" et al. from the world. <br /> <br /> So what we get is a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering from a 96-minute film of condensed blow. Ultimately, it is an Atlantis action film, not an upcoming exposition, so we throw so many sequences through the first half hour that bombard the screen as much as possible without losing coherence. Stop your disbelief about how characters from A to B get so fast that you probably won't find an animated film that would have come out of Hollywood! If you want an ethical level of detail on the plot, contact James Cameron's "Titanic". Both films have a boat in some way. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about love, are we? Yes, as with many movies, the leading man (one Milo Thatch, bumble bee archaeologist) and the leader female (Princess Kida, clichéd Atlantis) fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as good as I expected. At the end of the movie, the unique / emotional / kissing symbols were repeatedly more modest. There are many points in the movie where the attraction is growing, but it's not just a "Little Mermaid" (good thing) in the ball park. <br /> <br /> You may have realized that this is a cliché film. Right. You have your own leading hero and hero, supported by more than half a dozen crew members going on an expedition, all having their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take a few minutes to scan, then disappear. Does it take math to do math? A 96-minute film that focuses on action and visual images and remarkable pain has very little time to expand the characters. What is it based on? Clichés and lots of them. Every character emulates something done a thousand times before. You have a bumblebee scientist, an attractive princess, a square columnist, a rich eccentric, a manic sleazebag, a Russian femme fatale ?? do I have to go on? <br /> <br /> I don't know why anyone got it? I found that the language-in-bladder character of this movie is quite fun. Alright, this is meant for a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up on every feature of his history? At least the writers have consistently tried to find a clever dialogue and sometimes it is a little inspired. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, these are the stunning visuals that make this cake icy. CGI animation is amazing in places and does not mean the last "Titan A.E". below. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an anime style to create a fancy comic design. In fact, the visual presentation of the film as a whole is a lot of anime, much more than any previous Disney trip. This resulted in a conflict with Japanese anime fans, "Nadia", about the overall similarity of the film with the cartoon series. I didn't see this anime, I can't comment. <br /> <br /> The picture has sound. Gary Rydstrom controls the sound team and the soundtrack! From the opening, the sound stage is alive and heals. James Newton Howard treats us with a dynamic musical score that praises the film in a comprehensive manner, never sounds on the spot, and always helps to build or lower tension. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the creators. I see the film as a joy of adventure, though with a more serious tone than any Disney movie in front of him. If you do not like the attitude of the cliché language, perhaps the effort made in the visual image will delight. Heck, at least mythology is much better than one can say about other Disney efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is positive, out of 10 out of 10 surveys, about who the movie was breaking. Will I always stop my unbelief with any animated film? After all, the laws of the real world are more in multimedia than often. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and maybe everyone can find something to enjoy about this movie.
