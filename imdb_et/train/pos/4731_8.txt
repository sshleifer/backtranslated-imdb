This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors are able to play stoic like Jet Li. Activities are fast fire and special effects for intensification. As a result, it can little guard the Americans. The little stop of disbelief goes far into the Jet Li movie. I think this is a great introduction to Jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces (especially the Fist of Legend) that make it to the US market. A nice combination of weapons and physical conflicts will satisfy most of the glow changers.
