I've been watching this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it's nice. And it's pretty scary, but it's all good, ghoulish fun. She kills her other spouse, but runs into a problem when the escaped maniac decides to pay her and her girlfriend for a visit to her robbed Santa's equipment. Mary Traynor, whom I remember from SNL, or any other TV comedy skit show, is a bad woman and Larry Drake is playing a lunatic robust Santa outfit. I had forgotten that Santa had been playing Drak for years. His Santa Claus is an unstoppable force and at times quite scary. You can guess how Santa finally gets to the house. This episode is a laugh, but it can be quite intense at times.
