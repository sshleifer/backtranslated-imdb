If you read only the plot summary, this film seems pretty typical of the 1930s. This story seems quite settled, the theme is maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film is cast in a direct, earthly performance. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow's choice of feelings, rich and subtle nuances floating over his face. When you look at your face in a chapel during a wedding ceremony, there is such a clear feeling between the main characters. Raw emotions are so sincerely depicted, so true. The final order is almost intolerable: when Clark Gable waits for such a joy and surprise with his son, he raises and proudly says, "My child!", I could not remember that Mr. Gable's son was born to him posthumously. This is one of the best examples of depression cinema.
