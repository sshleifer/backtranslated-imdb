I found this film very good in all areas. Action was brilliant from all characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character begins to become smarter and psychologically twist in minutes. The plot is interesting, although this film is more like playing between the main characters and how Catherine continues writing her writings with new novels. The setting was also fabulous and the atmosphere of the whole movie was the mysterious, thriller like a masterpiece. Watch this movie now, it deserves better than what it got from the audience, which was misled by some bad horrible reviews of the movie (before it even started) ..... You won't regret it if you go for it ...
