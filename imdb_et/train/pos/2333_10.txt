I started watching this exhibition recently and I have to say that it really made me laugh. You need to evaluate its unrealistic aspects with everything else. Some other people said that this exhibition should include more realistic reactions from the dead. If you are going to agree that Ned can bring the dead to life, you have to agree that others are completely crazy bits. After every episode I watched, I couldn't smile. I really think it's nice that there's an exhibition that can take a very strange topic and really look good. I love the story, I think it adds a little surprise to the whole exhibition. You cannot always compare the writer's old exhibitions with your new ones, then you have to take everything that is his own unit. It will definitely give him the opportunity and just enjoy the ridiculous parts.
