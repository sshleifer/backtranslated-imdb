More than one of Hayao Miyazaki's films, Lapyuta (City Sky) brings joy to storytelling. It's a movie that makes you feel like a child again; it's just magical. This is a crime that took a long time to release it in the countries, but now, if it is here, look at it! And stay in the original language; I changed my symbols somewhat, which is something that should always be avoided when translating a movie (or book, translation). <br /> <br /> I'll give it ten / ten.
