This exhibition has a great history. It is all about slavery, how they were treated, religion, ways of hiding Jews, inquisition, faith in Orisha, African gods, how women were treated, including daughters. Even for homosexuality. How the characters are intertwined and Violante, this character is sad for me. He is so desperate to love him that he will destroy everything around him. I'm so glad they decided to do this. again. Although I would like to see a modified version. Xica has become my heroine. I look at how he uses his power to help everyone who is looking for it. I love all the characters and have found that they can communicate with many people during this century. Waiting for your Xicat every day. It would be nice to copy it in English so that the Americans could love her too.
