Unfortunately, this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noted), but it is one of the major dramas of the Great Depression, the lyrical and touching love book placed in the chin city. It includes the performances of Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, which are among the best in their careers, and this is a surprising example of how director Frank Borzage was able to create an almost fabulous aura of poverty, crime and terrible social inequality, which simply proves that his talents were romantic and spiritual. This film shows how love lives in the middle and in desperate need, and that is absolutely life-long. This is a true masterpiece of the period, and it is a film that deserves to be more widely known.
