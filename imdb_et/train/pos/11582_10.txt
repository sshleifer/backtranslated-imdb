Someone who remembers Jane for the Daily Mirror comic is a nostalgia exercise to watch this movie. In this context, it is wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy burst and ignore the fact that the actors are cartoons. The drawing line is also somewhat slippery for today's audience, but very well reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s. Jane, you must remember, was an escapist fantasy of wartime years, created to increase the morale of troops. He gave the band a double meaning in strip art. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The topic would have been familiar to the readers of this era, a number of troubled Nazi-knocked by some in the jungle of England and, of course, in Africa. <br /> <br /> Jane fans need a black look. The rest of you are damp squid. <br /> <br />
