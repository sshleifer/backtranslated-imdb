Had it been done in the Zatoich series before, it would have been one of the best. It is good enough because most of them are, but the plot and characters seem too complicated for this series. The situation is unusually intriguing: provincial farmers have two masters, a benevolent boss (once) and a philosopher-samurai who starts Grange; both run against traditional local gangsters who want crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenue and their ability to pull some land; their main or powerful ally is the apparent puritan, who is dying of drinking and gambling, but secretly reveals his perverted appetite. (He also reminds Dracula because later Zatoich films are becoming more and more crooked.) These characters have enough meaning to have originally won against Zatoich, but now he has lost a lot of nuances and changes in some characters, such as the good boss and the man's angry Zatoich. Sister, it takes more time for the movie to give, so the story seems uncomfortable as some scenes disappear. In addition, most of the other series's performances show good performance, sometimes lyrical photography, living, believing and unique recognizable landscapes (the lack of which is evident in a random episode where the director simply forgets it) and technical quality, which by its nature conceal: limited clusters imaginatively diverse use, so no limitations exist. And of course, there is the main actor whose presence, as much as his performance, makes it all work. It must be one of the best series in the history of the film.
