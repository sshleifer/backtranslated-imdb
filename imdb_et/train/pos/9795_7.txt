I've always said that animated Batman movies were much better than live movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the animated films, but it's the poorest outside the cob and it's quite disappointing. . <br /> <br /> "Fantasy Mask" would be the best, then "Best of the World", then "Sub Zero", then "Joker Return" and finally the last. In this newer animated film, Gotham's mysterious new batgirl and Batman are going to discover if he's a friend or an enemy who wanted to retaliate. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce is involved with three young women, she starts exploring them and discovering who the new batgirl is. <br /> <br /> The tone of this movie is unusually light, given that most movies are gloomy and gloomy, which was quite disappointing. Bruce acts strangely by nature mostly from time to time, the crooks are used again from the latest films, and while the scenes are exciting, they are not really new. It also lacks the dramatic effects of other films, especially "Sub-Zero", which was difficult to develop in drama and character. <br /> <br /> All the film looks pretty recycled and supportive characters are charming, but no one really is worth rooting. <br /> <br /> All the time, I really enjoyed it, I had a blast and the new batgirl's identity is surprising, but it wasn't as exciting as I expected. <br /> <br /> (** Pool ****)
