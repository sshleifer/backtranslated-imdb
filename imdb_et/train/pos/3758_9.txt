This movie is fantastic. If you take it too seriously, you will hate it; But "Dudes" and "right ons" are about 15 years ago laughing and weak memories. I like her ability to just make me confused with obvious jokes and stupidity, and we can do it for me to look at it, "Bill and Ted 'Great Adventure" (1989). If you are looking for a movie full of versatile jokes and completely mature humor, don't look at it; but if you want a movie that is humorous and silly but smart and interesting, you enjoy it. I would like to see more of this picture in contemporary theaters. And hey, this is Keanu Reeves, who acts like everyone's parades acting on him ... right ... can't get much better than :)
