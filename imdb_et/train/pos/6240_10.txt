Dog Days is one of the most accurate films I've seen in today's cities, describing life. It is very harsh and cruel at some points, and unfortunately it is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional congestion, problematic things, perversion, complexes, madness. All things that are in today's great developed cities. This will make you realize once again how pathetic the country is in managing society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of the city wasn't shown so well on the screen. I just wish it was wrong. Unfortunately, this is not the case. That's why ... 10/10.
