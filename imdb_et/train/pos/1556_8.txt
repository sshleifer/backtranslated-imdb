Like other people who commented on "Fr√§ulein Doctor", I stumbled over to this television late this night with this little pearl, without hearing it before. On the one hand, the paper was a fictional story of sexy but negligent antiheroine, on the one hand, and realistic and well-researched warfare ditches on the other hand from the beginning. <br /> <br For me, this is one of the five best WWI films (others are "all quiet west", "honor roads", "gallipoli" and post-war "la vie et rien d'autre"). And the scene with a poison gas attack is really chilling; horses and men appear as apocalypse drivers with gas masks. <br /> <br /> I just want me to film.
