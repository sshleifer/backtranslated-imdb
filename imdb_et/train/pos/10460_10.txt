It was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brothers and the consequences of the terrible disease to the family. Well done and well run. When there were mistakes, I must say that this story showed a typical suburban family and their difficulties. But all people with cultures? I would like to see a movie where all these cultures are shown - as in real life. Nonetheless, the film rose to its values ​​and understanding of how someone can bring the disease closer to its creator. Loved the movie and it brought tears to the eye
