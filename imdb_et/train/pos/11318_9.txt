This is a haunting and powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel Postman always rings twice the great instructions of Luchino Visconti. It is so interesting for the film that in every way it crosses its source material to get something bolder and more original (interestingly, Camus also credits Cain's novel as the main inspiration of his landmark novel The Stranger). The film has more power and intensity than the novel, because Visconti is able to create a film equivalence of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more sophisticated sex study. Cain's very American novel is also about building lighting (a critical fear that he will be identified in Mexico and embarrassed that he married a Greek immigrant) is very critical. It allows class attacks to take center stage and dance to the passionate, destructive love affair of the two main characters. This movie is a complex, tense and rewarding experience.
