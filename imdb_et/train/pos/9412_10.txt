When I saw this movie in the 1950s, I also wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I took a girlfriend to see it for the second time. I don't think he was so impressed when I was! This film was comical but serious at a time when synthetic fibers were quite new. The lessons learned from this film could be used for questions about today's genetically modified experiments.
