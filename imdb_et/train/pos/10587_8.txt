This movie is not a script, despite lo fi production and its connection to Troma productions. Dark palm for adults. Use is a sugar cookie issue and one wonders whether the cast has fallen victim to this issue. A weird movie with an attractive vision: the shadows and contrast are outstanding. Definitely worth a look, especially for Warhol fans and stylish decadence. Through cruelty and evil, moral, though twisted, can sneak.
