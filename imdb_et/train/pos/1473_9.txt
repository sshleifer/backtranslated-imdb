Remember that all the films (not to mention the documents), which confirm any truth, cause the cynicism of an unfavorable and proportionate amount, those who have no idea of ​​proposing and searching for it, those who are already masters of Psychology, film and soul will undoubtedly find it the movie is superfluous. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For me, like me, I found the "Perverts Guide to Cinmea" .... mostly for people interested in movies, psychology, and contemporary philosophy. Anything like Scott Mclouds' "Understanding Comics", directed by Sophie Fiennes, unites Slavoj Zizek, a Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic, in many films and specific scenes he discusses. Kate is a picture of "The Birds" (Zizek takes out a new boat for shooting). <br /> <br /> Lacanian psychoanalysis may not be funny, the evening fun ... but that's it! If you like movies that are .... Having knowledge of Lacanian psychoanalysis (Symbolic, Real and Imaginary) is a somewhat loose term in the beginning, but the scenes selected and analyzed by Zizek make it quite clear what was always a very abstract topic for me. In fact, it is probably better to know the films he discusses than the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Why I love, this movie is not because this movie chooses great movies to analyze or reveal the great truths about Lacan, but in a very practical and wise way where film and psychology (and default philosophy ) meet. <br /> <br /> Why is "Sound of Music" definite fascist, why are "short cuts" more than just class and alienation, why are birds "birds" attacking there to learn about the "alien resurrection" that The "Solaris" planet is doing what you want, what "Psycho" and "Marx Brothers" associate with each other, and what the hell David Lynch in the movie after the movie ... well Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voice in "Excorc" and "Star Wars: The Sith Revenge Of Sith" is perhaps the strongest and clearest moment when it comes to feminine sexual subjectivity I start to wonder ... at one point, Zizek recognizes that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children (funny, it seems ...). <br /> Anyway, this is an exciting documentary that anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it means more than literally should try to see. <br /> <br /> And someone who is interested in Slavoj Zizek is also indispensable, much less dry than "Virtual Reality" and more direct than "Zizek!", two more pseudo-documents, "from modern culture criticism" as he is spoken in english. <br /> <br /> Perverts Guide to Cinema is not a sex role in the cinema. Zizek argues that cinema is an extremely perverted art because it teaches "how to desire, not what you want," and that it is the only form of contemporary art that allows you to articulate these desires. It's not a movie about finding the reality of a movie, but about finding a movie in reality and how important and exciting it can be. Difficult to find and a bit long but effortless, one of the most stimulating movies I have ever seen.
