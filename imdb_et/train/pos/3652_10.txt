I started watching this movie on Sunday afternoon, I thought it was just another stupid aircraft fighter. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora Clock" is an intelligent political thriller, far from the quality of most TV movies. It can be as simple as debut on a big screen. <br /> <br /> Excellent, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga is one of the best performers in the CIA as a medical professional, and Frasieri Jane Leeves is also very good. The dialogue is well written, and the story is all possible. In fact, the last hour is full of twists and tensions in the plot that you can't leave your seat for seconds. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, invest time - about four hours. You will be rewarded with a wealth of rewards!
