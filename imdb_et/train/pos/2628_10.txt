I think Lion King 1/2 is one of the best queues that aren't the best in Lion King movies! In the movie, Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from and who have difficulties with others, such as Timon, who have difficulty digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa travel to find their dreams and find it and find it fast and also the Simba they raise, but soon they will have to choose their dream place or help Simba with the scar of their evil uncle and declare their right as a proud lion King Rock! Performs great new characters like Timon Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was a lot of fun and was announced by Ben Stiller's father's comedian Jerry Stiller. Disney was smart to Smarter in this role! Perfect for wonderful characters, animation and story and music Lion King 1/2 is, in my opinion, the best of any stage and better than Simba's pride, though I admit that I liked it too! Lion King 1/2 is a great Disney sequel that the whole family can enjoy! This is a good story and is great fun! 10 out of 10!
