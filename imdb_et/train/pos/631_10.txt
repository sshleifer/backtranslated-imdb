This movie is all about a fantasy movie should be, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and took it to the original plot (based on Neil Gaiman's novel I read now) and colored characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most prominent things for me was actually how independent the story is. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy films out there that leave open ends and it was a pure fairy tale that satisfied itself and didn't need a sequel. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun. Good fantasy.
