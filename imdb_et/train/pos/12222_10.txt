I thought this film was beautifully drawn, it made me confused and my cousin who looked at it with me. To prove the truth, I think the younger kevin dillon was hot.hahahaha ... but I also thought that the girl was a stupid cop and it was wrong she told her before her death: "I was inside you". I think it's what he gets for what he did to him, and how he's going to tell him he's too young when he never cared about how old the other girls were. Do I not think that I myself could ever trust a policeman, but to tell the truth, it was quite obvious that he was even when he wanted to become a policeman who was still suspicious he was so funny and it was funny if she sprayed her in the shop eye. hahahahaha.she was still stupid to go to the store, and so was the policeman who died HELLO !! Sometimes these films have turned me crazy when people behave stupid and do stupid things.
