The plot: The criminal master unites 3 different mafias in the company to buy the island, which would be an instrument for money laundering of organized crime. To prevent this, the FBI tries to break one mafia master. The thing goes wrong, and because of some unlikely plots and twists, we are being presented with another "police buddies who don't like each other" movie ... one of the female FBI agent and another male former DEA agent so far is so stupid. But the strength of this movie is not his story - at best a bad joke. It's funny. (The at least synced German version is). The action is also good with a memorable scene that includes a gun and a rocket launcher. But the focus is largely humorous. Not intelligent satirism, not quite secret, but somewhere, you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> But this film is the opposite of political correctness. Legal drug abuse is highlighted without criticism and even if it is cool. This is a bit of a movie that seriously disturbed me and makes me feel unsuitable for children. All in all, with a nice evening out, it is acceptable to have some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Remember: In this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / TV room. Then you have a good time. 8/10
