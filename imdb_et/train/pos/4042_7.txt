The film begins with a bunch of Dead Men Walking peeps sitting in single cells, waiting for their inevitable meeting with the dead represented by an electric chair. <br /> <br /> Then our "hero", called Tensh, is guided, he is zapped and then .... he's still "alive". AHA! He has the opportunity to choose some horrible soldiers who really look cool: will we stop you until we are convinced that you are actually dead, or you can walk through this door and take any destiny that may be in front of you. â€œOur hero says yes to Option 2 and then the real story begins. <br /> <br /> He wakes up in a different cell (very high tech and very large), where he finds another cell-companion who also tells the Speaker that they are free to do what they want as long as it takes place in this room, sounds a bit suspicious, but two men accept: what else can they accept: What these two men do not know they have put together so that they can wake the inner urge to kill inside them. until they decide that they should kill each other, does it seem strange? Indeed, this is a bigger goal everywhere. must not appear, and so it will not appear. Question: How long can you stand with a man who is SOB and would you kill him for freedom? <br /> <br /> The first hour is basically trying to attract your interest, it slides without you actually knowing it. The WILD Matrix-like combat scenes will then change to a skateboarder with a specialty comic book based on the film. <br /> <br /> The film is indeed very special, so it's special that ordinary cinemas can't see it under normal circumstances. But the story is exciting, the music is fantastic and the actors do their bit (some more than others) to make the movie truly unique. <br /> <br /> If you should be so happy that your cinema or video will hold it, check it out and enjoy it so that not everyone tries to make regular movies to earn big bucks. <br /> <br />
