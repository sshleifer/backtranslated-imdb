Well, after some time I practice reading comments on those movies that don't reflect my experience. For me, Amitabh was here as a better coat than in some of his most famous films. He was a hard criminal, an unpunished villain. For me, it was a breath of fresh air to see her in a role where her mistress was in no way down. <br /> <br /> The boy who played Aryan was probably over his head. There I think the director could have done better. But to be honest, the best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. He is an uneven heroine, a true veteran who is qualified for all the roles offered to him. But I have to say that I appreciated his contribution very much when he was playing Virendra Sahi's wife. He can do little to him, but he does everything completely convinced. I'm sure he sailed straight across most audiences. <br /> <br /> So if you wont be on the middle of Bollywood, you won't get much of this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, it can give you some of what you have lost.
