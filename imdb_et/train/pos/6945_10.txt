The genre of my favorite films is Western, which is really the only film genre of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, no one does it like Americans. <br /> <br /> At the top of my ten favorites list is the Westchester Winchester 73. It was the first partnership and only black-and-white film partnership directed by Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film in which Stewart chose a percentage of profits instead of paying a universal salary. Many of these transactions followed the players, making them as rich as the moguls who used them. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann had until then done mostly B-pictures, noir-type things without actual budgets. Just before Winchester 73, Mann had a fine fine with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, which would never get enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart will have to see it and decided that Mann was the man with whom he decided. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Mann also developed a mini-corporation as John Ford was legendary. In addition to Stewart, others such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson will be released for future Mann films. <br /> <br /> This is a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killed. Why am I not saying, but until then we had never seen James Stewart see such a cold rage on the screen. Anthony Mann reached the heart of Jimmy Stewart and pulled out some demons we all fear. <br /> <br /> Hate is really well shown at the very beginning of the movie. After struggling with Stewart and Sidekick, Wardat Earp is armed with Will Geer playing because the weapons are not being transported to Earp's Dodge City. Dodge City has a racing competition for Winchester rifles and the betting favorite is Henry Brown from Holland, played by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer enter the salon and Stewart and McNally at the same time and arrive to draw weapons that are not there. Look at the neighborhood of Stewart and McNall, they say more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Stewart, runs on Waco Johnny Dean, played by Dan Duryea, who almost steals a movie. Maybe it was Duryea's best moment on the screen. He is a psychopathic deadly killer who is deadly as a left-hand drawing, although he sports two six weapons. The second person, Stewart, meets Shelley Winters, a fianc√©e in Duryea showdown and killed. His best scenes are with Duryea, who has invented her. He plays time until he can safely get out of him. Guess who he'll end up with? <br /> <br /> Some small roles have some great performances. John McIntire as a sparse Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as a grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson received his first real message as a young Indian leader. Even John Alexander, best known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in Arsenic and Old Lace, has a brief but impressive role as a trading position holder, with both McNally and Stewart stopping at different times. <br /> <br /> Mann and Stewart made eight films together, five of them from the West, and were ready to pass the sixth western night when they quarreled and Mann walked out of the device. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced high quality films.
