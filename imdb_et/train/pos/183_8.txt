Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davies (with William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood to find a stardom. Cameo's performances present "all the stars in the MGM sky" in the famous commercial scene, plus a lot of vintage movies that make the detail of the scientist. The picture also includes pictures of the famous, malicious, sarcastic impersonations of the descendants of Davies (his Swanson is beautiful!). <br /> <br /> "Peggy", even struggling to meet his famous star Marian Davies in tennis, turns his nose up and comments, "Oh, I don't like him!" <br /> <br /> My print was perfect. Story, direction, authentic charm and almost all silent afficinados.
