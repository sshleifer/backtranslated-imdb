I think it's a bit too long in the middle of the movie, especially in the scene of love, but you can imagine it all the time. but the best thing that made this movie unforgettable is the big explosive pictures, their color, slow motion and pink floyd music is a unique film education! <br /> <br /> Destroy your propper and popular form.
