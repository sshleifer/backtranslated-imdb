You should not take what I say lightly. I've seen many, many movies and I watch them a lot. So if I tell you that this movie has one more fun scene I've ever seen in the movie, you could listen to me. There are many different opinions about what makes this INCREDIBLY stupid movie as funny as it is. And for those who just couldn't, I can't blame them too much. The scene I'm talking about is about a 30-minute mark and includes a dead convict who is involved with John Candy. Until then, I had found the movie foolish, confused and losing me. When that scene came up, I laughed so hard, posing in my pants. I've never done any movies before. When the project started, "Going Berserk" was supposed to be an SCTV movie. I remember it was announced. When the time went on, cast John Candy, Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy. It was also supposed to be a change of universe mode when it was at the strike, because it appeared in almost ZERO theaters when released. Watching this second time, I listened to the thematic song (which actually says, how incomprehensible is what the plot is), relaxed my logical nerve, and wondered what was going on. In addition to the above routine, "Going Berserk" has many other fun scenes to recommend. This is almost 3 Stooges flick, except it's a lot of funny. Director David Steinberg has a sharp timer on the razor, and he has to laugh at it all. For Candy, who is principally responsible here, she has never been funny. With all the equipment on the plot and the explanatory scenes that are thrown out of the window, he runs completely wild. Flaherty and Levy follow her effortlessly. There's a plot, but it's a plot like "Animal House" was a plot and yes, the script is uneven and a bit slow to start. However, if you know this, you can still understand the full SCTV style that appears. It's silly, but it's a stupid goal, and you have to keep that in mind when you see it. DON'T see it and discover yourself if it has the most fun scene ever.
