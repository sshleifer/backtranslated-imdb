Now, I know that French prisoners have probably not read Lovecraft (and this proves that his writings should be taught at school, perhaps as a separate subject), but how did they think that something that sounds like "ftagn yog sototh" could Being a movie is held in prison, where four very unlikely cell companions stumble upon a magical book that can be read if it is right. When the prisons go, the cell was completely unreal, so I had trouble getting into the atmosphere. It also moves slowly, which can bring people. But besides this, it is the ultimate sharp feeling that Sartre's "hell is mixing with other people" with Lovecraft / Barker story and quite successfully. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Watch the time. This means that it will not be done if you go to work or sleep or do something else. This is the film that works best when you are immersed in it. Lessons learned: Yoga is bad, almost as bad as French women.
