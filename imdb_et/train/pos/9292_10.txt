If you like the movie, don't miss it. If you want to act or horror or romance, you don't know what's going on. Everything here is in a gangster movie. And what happens is the transcendental murder. <br /> <br /> There are few similar movies. There is no doubt that it looks like a limited release and it's hard to find. But the search is worth it. If you want to study mileu as a potential symbol, this is indeed a learning film. <br /> <br /> You can never look at it. If you never see what's going on. Dark City is better. Joe Vrs. Volcano is more fun. But Mad Dog Time can be transformed into a gangsta crowd symbol. . or at least think twice before re-shooting.
