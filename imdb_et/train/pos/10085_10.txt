I saw this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd Annual Film Festival with Roger Ebert. After the film, children were allowed to ask questions to Director Tian-Ming Wu. He (through the translator) talked about several stories about his life and making a movie. <br /> <br /> All tangents aside, both of my kids really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to paraphrase many of my daughter's subtitles, but much of the film is self-evident. is so much better than 95% of Hollywood crap (especially children's movies) there. <br /> <br /> Greetings. <br /> <br /> ps There is a real mask mask that can / can do 12 masks at once. The film actor trained and studied up to 4 masks at one time (then they cut and changed 4 new masks).
