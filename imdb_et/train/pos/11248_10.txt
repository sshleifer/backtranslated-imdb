Illudere (delude) comes from the Latin verb "ludere" (to play), so you have warned of "spy game" as a complex and sophisticated and intelligent (!) Activity of the complex, and as it may appear absurd and useless personal history, no matter what what is this; and yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of betrayal and loyalty, which is any relationship with the material, personal social; After, years ago, I was ABLE to finish this book, it was a revelation! At first I was so boring as not the surprising style of writing (I really started to love this novel after LOVE Le Carre). The main character does not bother at all: he has chosen to redeem his weakness by observing the way of faith toward friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel, you can clearly understand that Green's "Our Man in Havana" is a darker version written by LeCarre with "The Tailor of Panama"; there is no game left, it ends in tragedy or grotesque in a comical way, or both. There's no Smiley here to ensure decent human qualities in the service, or at least not make sense to introduce it in such a case. The BBC has done a great job with these series of LeCarre novels: actors are great as well as locations and kits; of course the script is perfectly adapted here. Be warned, though, even if someone can make it ridiculous, it's a bitter taste.
