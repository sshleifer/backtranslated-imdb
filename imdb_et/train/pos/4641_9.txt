Eytan Fox did it again: move the hearts of the viewer into a modest story that takes place in the confusion. The film can be described as perfectly and finely in the atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and everything is there: lifestyle, relationships, heartbeat beating, confusion, obstruction of utopian minds in the most painful, bright and forgotten megalopolis ever. <br /> <br /> We recommend: this is a trip to heart and mind with an interesting perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Nota Bene: The movie is gay. If you do not believe that you are too gay, be prepared to challenge and finally see it as "just love." (and don't worry: the chick is too hot!)
