Another fun, witty, frothy RKO music with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film. Although it does not have great stories from SWNG TIME (although the last number "Face the music and dance" is one of the best and justifiable of the team), it is very enjoyable because the two are not able to actually do it in the 1930s. Once again, the plot is light and forgotten, but looking at Fred and Ginger with dancing is heavenly. These two gave dance more romance and magic than many couples in the movies make great love. Although Fred and Ginger are better, it is definitely visible.
