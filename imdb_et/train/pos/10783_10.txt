I enjoyed this movie. She hasn't seen Andy Griffith's age and felt she was perfect for this role. I'm associated with comedy, but I'm happy to see that she is versatile. <br /> <br /> I was not worried that Dotty's 'anxiety disorder' might not be literally a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of any phobias and neuroses and they can take many different qualitative and quantitative forms. He's obviously sensitive to the extra-sensory power that local Indians understood, but not in Anglo. Not surprisingly, this sign is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although it is considered a light "family movie", it is actually more complicated than it seems. Hiram's final result was a pleasant surprise for me and all the previous activities in the bundle. It is fun to consider the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
