"Death Lends A Hand" is one of Columbo's early episodes that helped show the next 30 years. It is the first of four performances by Robert Culp (three as a murderer), playing the same role for each show. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp Brimmer is the leader of a large private detective company. asked if Kennicut, the wife of the rich Magazine Magnet, has a thing to do. Although he is, Brimmer decides not to give Kennicut the hope that he can blackmail his wife in exchange for his wife's business partners. He reacts badly to this proposal, which is an argument that quickly becomes violent when Brimmer takes over his face. Because he has a big ring, he hits the ground and kills him. <br /> <br /> There are some very invaluable moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is where Columbo looks like palm reading, although it is really a storm to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's circle, not admitting he knows he was wearing a killer. Columbo is Columbo, he only shows what he really knows when it's time to turn the screws a little. At first, he plays a part of a fairly simple-minded man who gets excited about the "life-saving that goes over the mound", or the somewhat ridiculous palm-reading mumbo-jumbo. <br /> <br /> Another great scene is when Brimmer tries to provide Columbo with his company, bribing to stop his nose from being hit. Again, Columbo does not show that he knows what is going on, he claims that this job offer is honored and excited. <br /> <br /> And there's another where Columbo tells Kennicut, Brimmer, that he wants the murderer to hear their conversation. He wants to suggest to Brimmer that he is on him, without being directly accused of him, so he decides to make a brutal (but understandable) decision to play Brimmer in mind to force him to panic and do something stupid. Of course he does! The whole Collector who is exhausting doesn't know the subtext of this conversation. It's just the end that Columbo explains to all Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I don't reveal how Columbo finally kills the scorer, but let's just say it's potato. .. <br /> <br /> A really good episode, perhaps the best of the first series. If you liked it, you'll also like Double Exposure, which also includes Robert Culpi.
