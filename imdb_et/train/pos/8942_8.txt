Several respondents have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. He was 25 years old and was 50 years old when this movie was released. I think the difference was not for a temporary drama like Vertigo, but it is important for romantic comedy. We can easily understand, this is why his character is attracted to him, but it is not so clear why to attract him. <br /> <br /> But the film acts as a light romantic fantasy. Actual magic is a scene where she stares at her over the head of a cat, with dark colored eyebrows and her hummingbird and cat sounds. That's why it is small when the scene shifts to the top of Flatiron's building and we see the age difference very sharply. He grabs him to run his fingers through the hair, but stops it moving and gently brushes his fingertip to his bodice.
