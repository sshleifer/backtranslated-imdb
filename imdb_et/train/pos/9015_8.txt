At first it is from England, so of course I had a 98% chance that it was a smart and very good movie. I've never heard of this movie. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here is the feminine version of my left leg. I was right, but I was wrong. Wrong, because the two movies are very different. My left leg was the same John Ford movie and this is a similar movie from Chaplin (not because it is funny, but Chaplin has this big melodrama that brings tears to the eye.) I was right because in 1990, beautiful Daniel Day- Lewis turns a little ugly when he is playing a exhausted person, and he did it with great reality. Here, very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and it is very intelligent. For me, Bonham-Carter leaves one of the biggest women from the 1990s with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful cinema eyes from Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! He is also a true talent, as seen in many other films. Look at it, you won't regret it! And very good work by Branagh!
