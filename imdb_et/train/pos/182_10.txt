If you are in contact with the world of Gundam, it is a good place to start. If you have been burned on Star Wars or Star Trek, here's a compelling and realistic sci-fi series that can be brought in. Not a simpler savage-world-giant robot story you've been waiting for, but rather a complicated, emotionally convincing space war drama, where the line between "good" and "bad" boys is definitely less than different. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the young, na√Øve son of Al Izuruhale. in a neutral space colony. She spends her day dreaming about mobile suits and fighting with her friends. In this series, Al communicates with Bernie Wiseman, an enemy soldier. Finally, little Al learns some difficult lessons about war and the suffering and the reality of the victims. <br /> <br /> I loved this OAV series with its cool mecha design that included story and pleasant characters. I recommend this series to anyone who loves realistic SF anime or those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment.
