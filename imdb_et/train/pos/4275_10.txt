In fact, I am surprised that there were so many comments on this film. I saw it as part of a larger American University Slavic Film Festival. But no one in the US has heard of it, which is a real shame! The dynamics between people make it both funny and sad. They're busy during a long bus journey - nowhere have we been! But I had no such! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where they stop at the funeral. Then the men and women smelled for some of the forest work, but everyone followed them to look at them without knowing. Just as he pulls his skirt and he enters him all the time - the consumer starts to hack and they realize that everyone is watching! Talk surprised! But ... you really need to know them, even if it's funny! When you see the end, it's kind of ironic that they enjoyed themselves when they did! Serbian humor is the best!
