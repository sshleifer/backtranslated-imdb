witty. funny. intelligent. awesome. I was flipping channels late one night a year ago. it came over and fire started. I was late every night and tape it to everyone I know. some. like 3 people from almost 100 people I watched, it didn't think it was as fantastic as me. others laughed so hard that they wept and thanked me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. not run. check it out and have fun. intelligence and humor. This is a win-win situation. I wish I could have a afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian we need as a society .... sanechaos.
