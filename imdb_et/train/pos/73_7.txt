It's essentially the difference between House Of Wax, both on the plot and on the role of both films, Vincent Price. In both pictures he plays a talented artist who sends his creations over the edge. has been filmed by other, less talented and less careful people. In this film, he plays the designer of the illusions of stage artists who want to induce themselves to be disappointed when another illusionist, great Rinaldo (John Emery), demands that he respects his contract and gives him the first choice of any illusions he designs. The price is already poorly placed on Rinaldi because his former husband is now Rinald's parameter. He uses his talents as an illusionist and a brilliant imitation to get rid of Rinald and others who prevent his plans from being recognized as a performer and designer. <br /> <br /> The price is pretty much the whole show and gives a well-understood star to turn out to be the wrong person whose contradiction serves the audience's sympathy. The rest of the cast is competent if the colorless and the entire company weighs on the price that easily carries the load. <br /> <br /> Good Solid B Movie Melodrama, it's a crime film rather than a spooky picture and it's enjoyable if you don't expect a masterpiece. Black-and-white imaging is small and best seen as a melodrama and enjoying this melodrama star with unique performance
