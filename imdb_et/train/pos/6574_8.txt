It may be difficult for some people to get caught up in Hollywood production styles. Leadership is forced, probably just filming and sound quality here and there (people's clothes are sometimes competing with their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> My Friends and I started looking at what to expect and the first scene made us almost out. It seemed very static and cheesy. Then we began to tone up and really started to enjoy ourselves. <br /> <br /> This is very funny, despite some corns. It certainly gives you the opportunity to appreciate the great dialogue. Helena Bonham Carter is, of course, divine.
