This film is like a gospel allegory. It has such direct honesty and innocence that you cannot believe it was made after the World War, when Italy was devastated and devastated, and was filled with a huge homeless, impoverished population. It is a monument of the best qualities of the human spirit, but also the endless creative resources of the land of this inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character like Doestoevisky's "idiot", a modern Christ that finds its way into the big city. He is a love-enriched goodness and purity, and his actions change the people he meets, just like a miracle-working dove. The story is spoken in a natural way and in a simple style, but it is a magic that is almost an idea of ​​Fellini's surreal fantasies. It's one of the most inspiring, ever made films.
