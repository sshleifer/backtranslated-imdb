Robot Jox does not suffer the story or the consequences of bad. I mean, it was 1990 when you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used stop-animation because most of the movies were in the 1980s. If you look at your biggest blockers during your period, most of them did what they could with the special effect frames that were available to them at that time. It was only when Terminator 2: The Day of Judgment was released next year that a breakthrough in technology was discovered, and the story limiter began to use this motif. But you have nice memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers, when you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very dangerous. It makes you not want to face people without a really good backup plan. And this movie has some great moments. A fraudster / spy works in the middle of them. Who you think is on your side, supporting you all the way, could be the person you didn't expect. And it's very cumbersome to wonder if you agree?
