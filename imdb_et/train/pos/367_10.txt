"Color Purple" is truly amazing. There is no one like that, and I don't think it would ever be. It is the roller-coaster of emotions and pains that the viewer takes. Actors are flawless and management is excellent. I loved it completely. The film has never made me so happy. It's beautiful, it's the best way to explain it.
