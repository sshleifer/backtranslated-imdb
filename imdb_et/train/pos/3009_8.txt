A film that is as much as a 30-year-old Warners film in an era where each studio had its own look and style of production, unlike today, when it comes to targeting. <br /> <br /> Curitz was one of the most important Warner housekeepers, working closely with the economy and high efficiency, while creating quality, methods that were very demanding for Warners director, a studio that was one of the biggest five of that time major major company. Even if we have Long Island's upper-class settings, here's the general Warners style that has a narrative that could have been "torn" from headlines. Another example is when photographers comment on the girls' feet at the beginning of the film and comment that "they are not trophies" give the film more working men, felt on the ground, because they were the target groups to which Warners was targeted by major depression. (ironically, Columbia and Universal were two minors of these five major companies up to the 50s when their participation in television changed their fortunes - they would have done something very cheap and without Polish and big donations) Curtiz has created a great script a movie that goes along fast pace, keeping the viewer at an excellent angle and fast editing. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the heavens, soppy has no love-based plot of love, so fun can continue.
