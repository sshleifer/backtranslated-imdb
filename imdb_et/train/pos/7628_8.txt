This movie is one of those "WOW!" movies. Not because it's the biggest movie of all time, but because it surprised me. It wasn't just T.V. the film, but it was Elvis. I can safely say so many impersonators if there is only one Elvis, but I can also say that Kurt Russel came very close to be the real thing. It was one of the greatest impersonations I've ever seen. She had to believe me that it was her. While watching this movie, I learned a lot about Elvis's life. And don't manage the part of the television that lets you roam - it's really a fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could have been Elvis's twin :)
