"Pandora Clock" is a thrilling temporary / thriller that crosses the virus and disaster films. This film, which debuted in 1996 in two parts of NBC, is related to an airplane infected with a virus, if one of the passengers just happens to have the disease. US government discussions on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and the virus expert (Daphne Zun) are trying to figure out something to prevent disasters. I'm not a big fan of TV movies and ministries, but I liked "Pandora's". This is one exciting journey. Jane Leeves (TV "Frasier"), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as President) are also starred. <br /> <br /> *** (Four)
