When his DVD appeared, I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was on the right track when I bought it before. Awesome movie I can still say for Will Smith, He has been a fantastic actor, as always in action movies or serious. It always gives a record of braking performance. I think it's a movie after August Rush, which makes a person cry while watching. The way the director described this story was really fantastic. His previous life and his new life in the film were right for the audience. Even I didn't find the story or how they would hit it. I think his DVD should be a household because it's really a nice thing for your collection. It's not a movie that needs pop-corn for pleasure, it's a movie that lets the audience learn. Now what is the lesson you see when you look at it. And I suggest to those people who are film critics to watch it, if you could find any criticism about this movie, please tell me.
