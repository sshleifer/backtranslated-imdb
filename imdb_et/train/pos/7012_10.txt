Although it is a tear-off, it is definitely a "good feeling" movie. All the actors were great and Will Smith, as always, does the job and does it well. I could go but choose any of the ten ratings and they have said it and are probably better than me. But since I have to post at least 10 lines to comment, I say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. His performance was the most enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing him in many future films. <br /> <br /> And this movie shows that Will Smith no longer has any evidence as an actor.
