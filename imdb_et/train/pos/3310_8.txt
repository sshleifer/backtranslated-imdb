In the Kongwon-do ui film, he has a relatively intimate look at the way of thinking (as well as the general nonsense) in the lives of various Koreans; clear people who are looking for ways to fulfill themselves by enjoying the nature's escapism. From the beginning to the end of the movie, we monitor the falsification of different characters; we learn about their shortcomings and desires, the general complexity of human life (and the simplicity of mankind). Although the film is slow to move, it can be very contemplative. It does not force any ideas, but allows the ideas to emerge, which allows the concepts to emerge. <br /> <br /> The movie ends as well as suddenly as it begins, and one of them really understands the meaning of indifference, that love is often selfish and many mistakes. It's everyday, well done and beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action or intense drama, this is not your movie. However, if you enjoy honest, original and meaningful movies that aren't forced and spoiled, this is a great movie.
