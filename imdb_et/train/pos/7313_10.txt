Some Spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan, you know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films. Often imitated, not duplicated, this movie is a real horror class and it is definitely one of the most frightening movies, if not the most intimidating. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask why). I honestly saw other 7 movies before I saw it, that's exactly how it worked out. But I have to say it blows all the others off. It's really scary, and when you see that Michael jumps behind the bush or walks in the dark, your back will send. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael rushed to the guy and leaned on one side of his head. This is one of the most uneven images of film history. <br /> <br /> Later slasherists, such as Friday, 13th, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie is better than all F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you could imagine a mad man as he goes to kill people. I testify that this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a couple of nights. <br /> <br /> What this movie is great about is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure fear. It is too bad that later films in the series failed because it is just as good an example of a remarkable movie as they come.
