In fact, this is not really a "final" episode of the "movie"; with that I mean, if you hadn't followed the TV series (Homicide: Life On The Street), I suspect you would have a hard time after this movie. Having said that, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch. I think it speaks a lot about television production, that EVERY single cast member returns, many after years of absence, to portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program. The film highlights this "family" feeling, not only amongst the characters, but also among the actors. It's all very bitter-cute, knowing that this is the last time we see them all under the name of HOMICIDE. Of course I found this movie somewhat missing. The candidature of Mayor of Giardello seems particularly viable and I felt that his shooting could have been addressed in the parameters of his usual position, such as the Leiutenant. Also det. Finally, Bayliss's extreme plot, which remained at the end of the series, was never resolved, but I never felt it necessary; I liked the mystery left to me (remember that the first episode of the first episode was unresolved for the whole series!). As a fan of the TV series DEVOTED, I can love this movie and get it even after the H: LOTS cancellation, but I do not recommend it to anyone who has not had the slightest contact with the series. Now that they just release it on DVD ...
