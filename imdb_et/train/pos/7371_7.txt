An arresting thriller similar to Deliverance as a landscape and nature. There are also some very innovative scenes and good music, although the charms of a single character and sometimes seemingly careless attitudes are not suited to the situation, although this is not the mayor's problem. It also raises interesting questions about the fairness of revenge and the boundaries of friendship. <br /> <br />
