Pretty heart cancer small film and not just for kids. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without the hint of the inspector Morse). The boy who played William also did a good job, though I didn't find him convincingly in every scene. I loved the feeling of a small village and a slower life. I also felt the events in London historically accurate as far as I can tell. <br /> <br /> It reminded me strongly of the Scandinavian film I saw a few years ago called Mine. This film had a boy evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II. The family woman who took her asked the girl because (as it turned out) she lost her daughter. Instead of getting a boy, he completely ignores him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish makes it even more difficult. I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoyed Goodnight Mr Tom, he has the same feeling.
