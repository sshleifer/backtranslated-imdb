Paul (Jason Lee) is an under-performer who just happens to be a princess Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and schedule. In his bachelor's degree, Paul gets a bit too drunk and somehow Becky (Julia Stiles) gets back to his mines. "Nothing happened" as they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen phones. He's on his way to Paul's apartment. Obviously, Paul Becky pulls out of place, although his panties are left behind. But it's even more fun. At family dinner in Karen's parents' home, Paul is again running to Becky, learning that he is Karen's cousin. Talk about some explanations of what to do! Instead, Paul chooses the stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen ever discover that Becky spent the night with Paul? And what are the consequences? I'm sorry for the critics who put such films on. They should definitely relieve it because this movie is fresh and fun. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Lee is the perfect funny man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is natural like a real, but anal fianc√©ee. The rest, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, are also pretty nice. The look of the movie is great, as are the costumes and California settings. Best of all, the script is imaginative and inspired, creating great laughter for the audience. In short, if you want to staple proverbs, get this movie tonight. It may not be the Academy's award-winning material, but it is absolutely guaranteed that the bad day will become terrible.
