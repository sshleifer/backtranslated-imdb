Was it poured into my TIVO because of a rainy day, some people working in the industry, and when I finally looked I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film contains a Altman-like taste (he mentioned the final credit as "thanks" to the person), using the seemingly independent lines of intertwined lines intertwined when the film pulls its peak. Macy is clean, clean and honest, if a man who is unable to escape his "destiny", Sutherland plays and depicts a few who can, Neve adds a splash in a deliberately toned environment, add Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember mission Impossible on TV?), Not to mention the constant John Ritter and you have all the good components of FILM. The script is narrow, the dialogue is free of clich√©s and thoughtful (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Stop faith and have fun, it's really time well spent.
