If you like turning a plot, it's your movie. At some point it is impossible to predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it seems or ends, as you think. The characters are all sharp and interesting. Drilling is his best. Dennis Hopper shows his joy once again. JT Walsh is perfect in its final stage. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes a great debut in the film. I categorize this movie as "I have a really, really bad day" movie. This movie is not a slow minute. Real sleeping place. This film is underestimated and unfortunately neglected.
