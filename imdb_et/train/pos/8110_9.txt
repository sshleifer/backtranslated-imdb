The amazing effect of this time movie. The primer of the ineffectiveness of war and how the war itself becomes a carer. <br /> <br /> The wonderful thing about this movie is that it is now public and available at archive.org. Free, no need to register. See it in one session and you drive. <br /> <br /> I plan to share this flick with as many people as possible, because I had never heard of it and am a sci fi fan. br /> <br /> I would like to see others respond to this movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it. <br /> <br /> Rate it. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think.
