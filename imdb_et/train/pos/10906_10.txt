I have a two-year-old son carrying the same status as Jonny Kennedy. I could never meet him, but I've never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much of this program has helped his companions become aware of this terrible condition. This man has touched people so that a million did not receive a charity. I believe it should be compulsory in schools. I also agree with other comments - what do I have to grieve? She took everything that threw her life and was still able to hold a sense of humor. God bless. I couldn't look at that part of the show that changed her ties. I have enough problems with my son.
