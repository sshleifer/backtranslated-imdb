Seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear. Soon they will all be stolen and murdered with a mad Vietnamese veteran. "Trampa Infernal" is a pretty fun Mexican slasher that reminds me of "Zero Boys". Fast paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slipping or ax neck. Unfortunately, there are not many gores, so grand-guignol fans are disappointed.However, if you're a fan of movies, give it a rarity .Mexican horror flicks are quite hidden (I've only seen "Alucarda" and "Don't Panic") , so it should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher. My Rating: 7 out of 10Highly recommended.
