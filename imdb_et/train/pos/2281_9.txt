There are many films in the world that are related to WW2, but their mother's evening is quite distinctive: this film introduces us to Howard Campbell (Nolte), who lives in Berlin and married German Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to accept spy: More CIA Major Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell, who receives Nazi propaganda to enter the highest stages of the Hitler regime. Nonetheless, the US government never recognizes Campbell's role in war in the interests of national security, and Campbell becomes hated in the US. After the war he tries to hide his identity, but the past comes back and haunts him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can't do much for Campbell's falling avalanche of events ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply moving when we look at Campbell's tragedy, though a great patriot, they are being treated with contempt for everyone who surrounds him. Not only that, it also gradually realizes that even the closest people have many secrets. Vonnegut offers a moving atmosphere, desperate for Campbell, which creates and almost stifles the viewer. <br /> <br /> Nolte plays the role of his life in my opinion; he is even better than "Worried", although in both roles he plays tragic characters who are destined for self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also great, and the same can be said about the whole cast on the general. <br /> <br /> I haven't read the book so I can't judge how the movie compares it. In any case, this is something important here: my criticism is about the film itself, and the film deserves my heart 9/10.
