Definitely one of the best British movies ever made, if not one of the best movies ever made anywhere. Script, cinematography, direction and acting independently in class. This film works on so many levels. So why it's not available on the cassette, the DVD is completely available. Never shown on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly shown in the packed houses of the National Film Theater in London?
