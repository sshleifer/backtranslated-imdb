Wow! Such a film that could be viewed ten times and rejoiced with its nuances. Absolutely incredible! When it was Visconti's debut film, I despised thinking about what would happen if he got a better movie from the movie. The only other I've seen (at the time of writing) is the death of Venice - which was absolutely unbelievable: visually more prominent than Ossessione (obsession). One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, but the story wasn't like Ossessione. When you click on the "various" links on this page, these websites have photos of the film. They don't really make a movie experience: such graceful camera movements, such a beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such terrible characters, such a great story, James M Caini's "The Postman Always Rings Twice." <br /> <br /> unable to believe that it was done in the 43rd year, eight years before Brando had to act realistically for the world by Streetcar Named Desire (1951). Its participants may not use the technique of the method, ie they may not really know everything (I don't know about it) - but they are some of the best, true and most realistic achievements up to that date in the cinema. Even eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought new sensuality to the screen, Ossessione was electrically sensual! The most sensual thing from the beginning of the cinema! Yeah, I'm superhuman, but Ossessione was just that terrible. <br /> <br /> The reason Ossessione had no effect on Streetcar was that it was made in Fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini. Cut In America. The American audience did not see their full glory until 59 years, eight years after the street. <br /> <br /> I'm not talking about it anymore - just write that I'll tell you the best, most beautiful and exciting movies I've ever seen, and I'll tell you to go and see! Like another reviewer I buy it as soon as I find it!
