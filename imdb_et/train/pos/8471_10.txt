This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos and I've seen them all. As usual, Lorre is his charming self as Mr Moto. Lionel Atwill plays an admirable curator of the museum, the usual comic relief here is very funny and there are many suspects to be seen. It's fast paced and fun. The archaeologist does not have the same elegance as Thomas Beck, the usual leader in these programmers, but he is enough. Stepin Fetch is on board, and although he speaks stereotypically, his lines are funny, not humiliating his intelligence, and he saves the day in his short time on the screen.
