The main reason for watching this movie is the beauty of the clara bow and the wonderful appeal. "hula" is not quite equal to clara's best movies, but it's still enjoyable. she dances, she rides her horse and follows the man she loves. this movie is just over an hour long and was led by a future oscar winner who won the winner (with the wind). The movie moves fast and Clara's bow has a lot of screen time. if you like clara, i would recommend hula.
