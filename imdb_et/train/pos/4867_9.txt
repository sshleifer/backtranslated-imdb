Do not forget about the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire, who makes the foggy day and several other dances, one duo of unhappy Joan Fontaine. Here we see that Astaire does what is essentially "stage" dances in a cleaner form than Ginger Rogers' films, and before she learned how to make full use of the film's potential. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio / TV male-female comedy career, doing the kind of dance they have to do in vaudeville and not having the chance to make their 30s Paramount College movies . (George was once a dance teacher). Their two numbers with Fred are high points in the movie and it is worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm up carnival number for Chin up, where three of them sing and dance through riding and other sights. It seems almost spontaneous. Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen fans find it worth a "plot". I've seen it one or four times and found a fast back and forth button.
