I watched this movie waiting for what I got: a good sci-fi cowboy. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did a very good job with an extremely limited role. Military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions with facial expressions! Howzat? I want diva to give you great relaxation when it hits and drains. Despite the fact that Russell draws handcuffs verbally and explicitly, he pulls out an incredible character. His robot becomes human, despite the limitations. Great work! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs insures he goes into history as a great imaginative of the perfect cable - what you would like to see drawn and quarted. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, mom and proud. I'm not sure how much my impression is based on her acting and how much her physical beauty, but it was hard for her to take her eyes off. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> A lot of the plot is fairly standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but because it has a sci-fi comic book, I can't see what's wrong with some of the weak sides. The story finally wins a good boy and the grateful audience gets a lot of emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> A feeb who thinks Russell is not doing a good job is the same type of feeb who missed the whole point.
