Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday nights, which was shown for a long time. I ask the writer to write a long series and air it for life, SOON. Every person was very interesting and did a great job with these lines. filling the plot. But the movie must be continued for a long time. I would like to see the growth of Bianca and Jake's child and play an important role in the film with a new grandparent planning their educational future. Also bring back the kathy to see his brother-in-law and contribute to his life. It was a great vision for grandparents to work out their problems, but the family business had to get back to work and see how Jake and Bianca survive the marriage for years.
