The bloody gangster story that happened during the years of great depression. It tells us about another notorious nickname Michael (Mike) from Salliwan. Sometimes this turns out to be the opposite: Mike struggles to save his life and his only remaining son because the rest of his family was killed by his own boss due to dirty play. He succeeds in his revenge and secures his son a venerable future, but he will eventually die. After all, such stories are never happy. <br /> <br /> The role of Mike Salliwan's parents was great with Tom Hanks and some of Rooney (mafia chief) made Paul Newman. The film impresses and we hear the well-known phrase "we rob the banks". This movie is still worth seeing, though it could have been expected by something bigger from Sam Mendes after American Beauty.
