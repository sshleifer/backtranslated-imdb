First, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but when you take the majority of your movies, you see that the characters are the same moments they are. His character in this movie is far from being ... and counts. The story begins (not so far away) from the future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of the virus that has been wiped out of most humanity on earth. The story seems to be moving towards SF, but I think it's closer to logic because the story is slow. That's it. Movies at some points tend to be faster and slower, and develop more at the end than the beginning, but when you see this movie, you are aware of this constant rhythm and reveal facts that do not accelerate or slow down. It is the same speed that flows gently and quite good. But that does not mean that the end of the end will pull the nerves, it is pretty good. This is the prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by poor management, but it has become much better. So, if you are preparing to watch a Sci-Fi movie or some action, you forget it. B There should be more such movies.
