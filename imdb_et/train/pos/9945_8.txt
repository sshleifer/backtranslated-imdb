First things first! This is not an action film, although there are many actions! I think you can compare it with American sports movies! If a team of very bad players succeeds unthinkable, the game or tournament that is not welcome will win! This is not football or baseball, but Taekwondo! At first, these street guards seem to be good! But soon we will find that they do not want to be stupid and actually achieve something in life! It's great to see them in combat and training! I was surprised how fun this movie was! From start to finish you laugh your pants! Young Korean actors are very convincing! Go see this wonderful movie!
