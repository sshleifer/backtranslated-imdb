The adaptation of Will Eisner's SPIRIT to the TV screen followed many other comic book or comic book developments. (Remember, these two are not exactly the same). It is really ironic that this is the one and only adaptation of the Eisner's intelligent alec, the clever splitting, the tongue-cheek superhero (at the time of writing). <br /> <br /> The story is that Republican pictures were interested in making a film version and were in talks with the copyright owner in the mid-40s, but they couldn't close the deal. The left-hand screen game came from the series, MASKED MARVEL, one of the Republic's best. Perhaps it was just as good as this studio was bent down with comic books, pulp, radio and comic materials. <br /> <br /> With regard to this year 1987, for television, it is quite obvious that it was a failed pilot designed for the TV series. If an old, long time comic reader, like myself, can be somewhat harsh on adaptation, an unknown viewer of a character can give some fresh observations that do not understand what the version of this screen should be like. <br /> <br /> Well, looking at the session and story, small women (my husband, Mrs. Ryan) open up with one claim. "It can't hold your mind if it's serious or not!" It pretty well describes both SPIRIT and its creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the comic strip of the real creative gene. <br /> <br /> Film is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on the screen. The choice of Denny Colt / Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really very well done. Although in today's environment it was still a "good old times" tradition, as far as the costume goes, you know how men and women are still wearing the hats! It highlights this one final (and curving) point, and that is that the director and the production made conscious efforts and succeeded in giving characters the signs of Will Eisner's facial expressions and body language. We say Kudos for these efforts. <br /> <br /> It's just too bad that no series was followed! Oh, in today's movie world, it seems that comic customization is a hot spot. Maybe a big time producer and director can really make a first-class SPIRIT production for a big screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 6/4/2008 Nowadays, everyone who participates in shopping center multiplex movies has seen a poster promoting the new SPIRIT movie (subtitles, MY CITY SCREAMS); to be issued on Christmas Day 2008. Well, we see exactly what we're talking about. Just hold your fingers over! CONTINUE TO CONTINUE ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: We saw a few days ago a new movie, Writer director Frank Miller, was transferred from THE SPIRIT. Well, we got our wish; but is it a good or some other case, be "be careful what you ask because you can get it?" Please read our article elsewhere on IMDb.com. THANX!
