The love trap is an independent film that must be viewed. When I started watching the movie, I came with low expectations but remained a blessing. The story is poetic, meaningful and creative. The writer pulls you forward and forth, which is every scene, allowing you to communicate with realistic characters that everyone can identify with. The film gave me the opportunity to live my life and what I love. The film showed what love really is, action is not an emotion. I was also impressed by the quality of cinematography and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the movie to two big thumbs and recommend it to all people of all ages and backgrounds.
