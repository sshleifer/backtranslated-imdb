I found this movie at a very good pace. The premise is quite imaginative and as a viewer I pulled as the characters evolve. Stimulation is very good for those who are thinking - enough to hide the viewer early and questions that will be answered later, giving both a thoughtful and very satisfying movie about both brain and activity. those coming out of the gate. It would be more analogous to one of those cruise ships that will first take you slowly to the mountain - creating an excellent sense of expectation - and finally, in my opinion, more of a foundation originally intended. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
