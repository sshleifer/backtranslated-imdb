Marjorie, a young woman working in a museum and living with two female roommates Pat and Terry. The police can't help him because the actual rape didn't happen. Then one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, his attacker arrives. His name is Joe. The long battle begins with this man. Then he manages to spray his eyes and mouth with the insect repellent that kills him if he doesn't get help right away. He binds him and makes Joe the same physical and mental attack he used before. The first (1986) is staged by Robert M. Young. It is based on William Mastrosimone's 1982 controversial off-Broadway game. .James Russo, who played the attacker in the game, is convincing as Joe.Alfre Woodard and Dia na Scarwid are big than Pat and Terry.James Avery is seen as a security guard. It got a Golden Globe nomination. It's not a movie that should entertain you. This asks the question is revenge justified. It's not an ideal movie, but I recommend it.
