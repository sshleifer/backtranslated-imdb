Interesting despite Leslie Howard's performance. Mr. Howard plays Philips as a solid and uninteresting character. One must feel sorry for this man; but I feel against Bette Davis' Mildred. Ms. Davis gives her best performances (she was nominated for Academy Award). Thanks to his performance, he brings this pretty boring movie to life. ** Don't forget when Mildred tells Philip exactly how he feels about him.
