Now I'm talking about it. Finally, a low budget horror game that uses its advantages. Although WENDIGO is occasionally faulty, it is imaginative. It is likely that EVIL DEAD style camera tends to move its mood, but it is still a prominent vision that is better than 99% of direct videos. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: the family takes a break in a distant cabin and is threatened by one particularly unharmed hunter. But head Larry Fessenden really knows how to skip and add the scary horror of using Wendigo. Is this real? Is everyone the imagination of the boy? Is this an exclusion of the child's emotional state? <br /> <br /> Some have said the film is not satisfactory because it's up to you to decide. Don't let such a little mess. There is no need to avoid a movie that makes you think. It's one to rejoice.
