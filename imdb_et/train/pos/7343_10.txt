Why this movie is all but lost in the shade is an absolute crime. Conan is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie. Brutal violence, cool character designs and good pace make it one of the best fantasies. This is definitely the biggest animated movie directed to the more adult audience I've ever seen. It is not like Bakshi's usual frenetic style. This is quite a departure for Bakshi and, in my opinion, his best work. I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves.
