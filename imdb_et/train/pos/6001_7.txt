None of the masterpieces and the best things from Errol Flynn are still far from Israel. Locations and beautiful technical color art take us back to the time that has passed. Errol Flynn shows the glories of his past and is OK, like Jim Brennan, the pilot who has returned to the past. The picture is actually a 1947 "Singapore" remake and the story seems terrible and clich√© according to today's standards. It also seems that many supporting pains are just movements in this picture. Many people have compared it to the biggest sites of all time, CASABLANCA. Watching the film, I saw many similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take it for what it is worth. Finally, if you are a Flynn fan or old-fashioned love story, you might want to watch this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca or Malta Falcon as a good entry to some of Hollywood's classics.
