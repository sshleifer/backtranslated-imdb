There have been so many pictures and movie returns in the summer, not to mention the disappointment of some of those setbacks that I was shy to find a movie that I just sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to read the page (no spoilers), I'll take it together: it's more mature than Ella Enchanted (some questionable violent parts, plenty of death and a handful of scenes with small blood, not for small children ), but do not try to be too bright or to exceed its limits. Think of it as a bit more serious, a bit more magical Princess Bride, and you're going close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I may not be as proud as others like others ... Maybe once or twice a month when I feel active. I'm also a big Sci-Fi / Fantasy fan. I get bored with repetitive repetitive stories and movies that have more flash than filling up faster than 10, and this movie is a rough diamond. <br /> <br /> Finally, here (August), I was tired of enough broken expectations of the big hits I saw for Bourne Ultimatum Stardust. Being thoroughly inspired by Transformers for my fictional addiction, Stardust's previews seemed appealing, but I was certainly careful. <br /> <br /> Like many others here, I was surprised. I was thinking about seeing another general fantasy movie clich√©d here for breakfast. Don't be fooled, this is a fairy tale, and it really has sorcerers, magic and absolutely required suspension of belief ... But the most refreshing thing I've found is that it's NOT something I've been in the last 15 years have seen or read it and it is a really good movie. (Unlike 90% of other movies that seem to be permanently like thorns on the side, maybe note that Hollywood's ideas have run out? I can read the book this year and in two years it would be another epic fantasy story, Lotus likes and the rest ", so NOW and such and no doubt.) <br /> <br /> Stardus wasn't involved in every step of the pack because of the packed activity, nor was it a glowing bullet because of the plot hook after a screw-hook that threatened to tear the dramatic tension and echo across the theater in a loud boom. It didn't even use the tremendous audible signals to grab its attention on what was happening on the screen (Transformers, I look at you). It doesn't try to show the latest CGI techniques, nor did it insult my intelligence, which is easy enough because I would have been able to exclude them from the 3rd grade (the boy I hate them). <br /> <br /> I just ... looked. I looked and enjoyed the refreshing CREATIVE story that opened before my eyes. Of course, I can find out what will happen during the whole movie, but it will make you forget. It made my heart even shift to some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed was that I left the theater better than when I went. <br /> <br /> It's really a pearl. After so much saliva this summer with so much remake and movies that did not meet my expectations, it was like a cold sweet cup of tea that pulled off all the hard work I did while sitting through others who tried to get them out of my money's worth. <br /> <br /> It's probably not for everyone, but for yourself; If you enjoy fantasy films that stand alone in time (Princess Bride, Black Kaja, Dark Crystal, etc.), you should really see this movie. This little diamond finds its DVD collection from the moment it hits stores, you can trust me. <br /> <br /> Just wonderful.
