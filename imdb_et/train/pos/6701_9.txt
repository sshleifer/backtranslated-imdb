I really liked the first 2 seasons. since a number of good signs disappeared later. as most exhibitions are occasionally slow later and better later in the season, but this is the absolute opposite. Jenny from Season 1 and Valarie from Season 2 were Sabrina's friends, I really didn't care about others, jenny and Valarie were her coolest friends.

Finally, Sabrina would say some kind of redness associated with the clothing she wears, and then disappears. The fourth season's opening order includes bubbles. Sabrina's credit for opening seasons 5-7 is characterized by Sabrina in several Boston
