Each actor and actor (in the film) plays perfectly in NATURAL, which should be a film show; and the leadership skills are treated so perfectly as every detail that I never get tired of seeing it over and over again. But I am quite surprised that this film does not belong to some of the actors and directors, Attenborough's credits, that I understand: are they not proud of having made such an excellent, enduring film audience? I hope to get some answers to some puzzles (maybe one of the "knowledgeable" workers (insider) of the movie).
