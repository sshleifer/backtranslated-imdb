However, from Robotech's day to otaku, I can say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite anime times. Given its completion, the animation is of higher quality. There are no loops and sequences in which art diminishes. Although the last episode is black and white, it does not harm the enjoyment of watching a movie. Although it has been described as "blissful", it must be remembered that women do not react in the same way as men. As the main character is a woman, it should be clear that she does not necessarily have to use "maso-man" tactics to gain respect for her peers. Noriko for seiryuu also plays Akanet Ranmas 1/2. Noriko is a three-dimensional comic when he gets; his personality is the nature of a spiritual girl who seems to be completely helpless first, but ultimately, by the strength of his will. The only complaint I have is that the mecca looked like a teddy bear. Even Gunbuster uses the rather dubious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than wrapping the machine with gigantic velvet rain around a real Dracula style) technique. I doubt the scene was supposed to be funny, but it broke me. All in all, I would rank Gunbuster as the top 20 anime of all time.
