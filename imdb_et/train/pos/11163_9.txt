I love this freek movie! Walsh is the true captain of the cinematic form, his film is sometimes overlooked. But this movie is my favorite because it really gives me the feeling of when the movie was set up. All the great characters, lifestyle, dress, way they spoke, OK, they may be exaggerated, but it's good to know that it was twice when two men tried to overcome each other with uneven stunts. Many people have done this and appreciated it. <br /> <br /> Can I get it anywhere on a DVD? I've only seen it on television. But for anyone who wants to live a movie from then on, it's ideal.
