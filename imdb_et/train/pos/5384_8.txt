I thought the film was done quite well for a TV movie and it contained so much action and humor. I have found the value of entertainment that is worth seeing, and I look again or again for a similar exhibition. I am disappointed that Seani has not been credited to IMDb here. <br /> <br /> I see the possibility that this concept, or the post-Sea Season competition, can be played for even higher cash stakes because his life would still be on the line again. <br /> <br /> I felt Sean played a very good role and reminds me of the actor Matthew Ashford, who plays Jack Deveraux on our days of life - a soap opera.
