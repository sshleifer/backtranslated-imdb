A number of popular high school students play with bold Marti jokes (Simon Scuddamore's sympathetic performance), which leaves him covertly confused. Five years later, the gang will return to the high school that is coming together and abandoned. Of course, the angry and cruel Marty, dressed in a costume costume, shows up to tempt her tormentors. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale kidnap all of the amazingly clever clich√©s that make these 80s slice'n'dice body masses so fun: fake jumps scary, Steadican shots, fierce storm, crazy hard rock music, nice funny female nudity, completely ridiculous "what the hell?" supernatural climax, sticky make-up f / x and one of those lovingly flat "all this was just a terrible dream". What's more, complicated sets of murders offer terrible goods: Gory highlights a man's stomach explosion after drinking poisoned beer, a lady taking an acid bath, a man who is crushed under a huge tractor, and two people who get wild in the middle of an electric shock. Thirty British cult horror siren Caroline Munro is funny unevenly as the American teenager in the first third of the flick. Cast everyone gives a definite performance, especially with Carmine Iannaccone's outstanding work, such as the smartaleck ring leader Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman as faded macho meathead Frank and Donna Yeager as the unpleasant mouth of Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has a fun fire like Munro's buggy agent Manny. Harry Manfredin's desperate, grim music recovers consistently the clues from his "Friday 13th Century". Alan Pudney's slippery cinematography does that. Good, tricky fun.
