The first review I saw was that "what is the ultimate bhandarkar to say?". When he says something so decisive. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing is that it doesn't take sides. No propaganda. This is a film that captures so many corners of the problem (I don't know what I call "number" here), but like any mediocre movie, there is no solution. I was so interesting as I realized that the movie ended up in almost the same scenario as it started. <br /> <br /> The movie identifies as many characters with completely different priorities and different ideologies, but still all part of the system that is more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there would be more spoilers. So see if you want to see one of the most mature movies of the recent times.
