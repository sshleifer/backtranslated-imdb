***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What really scares you? Killer sharks or ghosts trying to bring the message back? Maybe a chainsaw using a psychopath? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears are not even comparable to the horror that people dare not even speak or think - and that is the death of their child. "Pet Sematary" concerns this base, the fear of adults, and then leads it to places that most could not investigate. decisions, etc. I do not agree. It is actually the first rate of such a movie. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the despair arising from such a scenario. However, movie events are not only logical, but such scenarios can be absolutely inevitable. This is the real horror of "Pet Sematary": it is not that pets and people come back from the dead when the evil killers who call knives and scalpels are that anyone who has lost a child can become so desperate to do the crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite the warning or even the past. In the film, those who are willing to go with it despair into the depths of the human heart. The defender's heart tries to make up for it if he can't defend. And the results are terrible. In fact, if the film dives to the end of the territory at the end, it is almost slipping, although I believe that it is perfectly logical how it arrived there. <br /> <br /> I am a real horror blower and I say this is one of the most frightening movies of fear. If you don't think so, look at it again after having children.
