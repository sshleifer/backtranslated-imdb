The dentist was made at a time when almost all professions had psycho. We had crazy police officers, ambulance men, secretaries, and that was just for starters. The dentist came surprisingly late, because going to the dentist is usually an eternal nightmare. <br /> <br /> The plot is turned. Super Clean Dentist Doctor Feinstone lives in a great "white house", has a beautiful blonde woman and a good place to work as a dentist. Blind clouds come to their horizons in disgrace as the IRS (Terminator's Earl Boen), the dirty pool cleaner "cleans" his wife and suddenly it seems that all the teeth have passed through a dark filter. She goes to nutso and starts taking care of people's teeth in a nasty way. And you don't want to come on your way. <br /> <br /> The team was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna had developed stylish horror films like Re-Animator and From Beyond. He led the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film Society was a nice spinoff John Carpenter they live. The film producer Pierre David is known for such films as scanners. Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him about LA Law and the Major League, but I could dream of him as a psycho-dentist. He was big in his role and he was a sad person. Linda Hoffman was amazing and stupid like a Feinstones wife. Micahel Stadvec did not have many features, but after seeing it with neighboring countries, I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) was a beautiful vision as a cop. Virginya Keehne was an innocent teenager who will be the next customer for Feinstone. <br /> <br /> Final Warning: If you are like me and have a problem with a dentist, maybe you should skip it. But if you want to try if you should prepare yourself in dark humor and do a lot of unpleasant drilling.
