But how can you stand for a baseball team who can't win. It's not easy for George Knox. At the opening of the film, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend, J.P (Milton Davis Jr.), ride bikes on the angel stadium. When they return to their mother's home, Roger is surprised to visit his father (Dermot Mulroney). His mother is dead! And when he asks his father when they start to become a family, his father jokes: "I'll tell you if the angels won the division game" So later, Roger and J.P hide the tree to see how the angels play baseball. When the driver George Knox (Danny Glover) pulls out his jug, the lady gets angry and fights with her and soon the angels enter the team that gets out of Knox. That evening Roger makes a prayer because the corners win the championship. If his breeder's mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP are going to football, Roger sees the real corners of the field and helps the left fielder (Matthew McConaughey) catch what leaves the tail and the gambler - play the man (Jay. O Sanders) he did it. Roger learns from the archangel (Christopher Lloyd) that only he sees angles because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
