Such a beauty film that is hard to describe. Perhaps this is a lack of redundant dialogue, or maybe it is an absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meena Mumar's feet, but it's a pleasure to watch this movie over and over again. I've never seen another movie close to India, and few from any country rival its perfection.
