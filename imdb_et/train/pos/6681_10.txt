This movie deserves better It's nice, there are some wonderful jokes and sight, some of us for "Geeks" (And we know who we are) and the impact is really effective. Watching Paul Reubens' party for the Academy Award Winner is only worth the entrance. I didn't read the comic book series before I saw the movie, but it has been since then. as good as they are, I still recommend the MM movie. (Although Flaming Carrot is a character, it would be cool). Greg Kinnear is ... amazing as Captain Amazing, and none of them can be Shoveller, except William H. Macy. "We have a blind date with Destiny. And it looks like he ordered a lobster." Watch this movie. BUY THIS FILM! It's only 5 bucks and some changes in your local Wal-Mart. You thank me. You really want to. Oh, and Mrs Garafolo is in that. This makes it quite remarkable
