This movie is a half-documentary ... and it's quite interesting .... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... based on a real story about how a bunch of Norwegian sabotage stopped heavy water production in Norway in Rukjan and the rest of the heavy water supply to Germany . <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and it could have been a little better ... the movie is that some sabotagers are playing !!! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of World War II and this movie is a movie you should watch!
