This inter-generational story of love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable on DVD after a sharper picture and sharper sound of PBS. My only reservation is that the plot has some unlikely moments and some of the stronger Manchester accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, even the word has been lost and there is no loss of fun: the main actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings a mysterious smile, a broken temperament and sporty physicality to the role of his young surgeon who desperately falls to his boss's wife at the hospital where he just started working. Francesca Annis is one of the most prominent 50-year-old women; Her actor competes for her beauty. (The scenes of these two love are better than words, how small is their age difference!) Each supporting character is also sharply drawn and perfectly depicted. This kind of dialogue and passionate excess makes it a pleasant mini-meal. As Russell Baker noted in his introduction, you may not be morally healed when you look at "Reckless" - but you have a lot of fun. (Next, part of the DVD box kit provides a natural but satisfying two-hour output. You don't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what it used to be.)
