Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has in recent years confused several games with Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film series. But none of them, so to speak, have really taken the spirit of their novel. The games aren't usually intertwined, there was more spin in the TV series, and the less they talk about Verhoeven's movie, the better. However, we know the least that an animated adaptation has already been done in Japan, releasing the year of Heinle's death. And believe it or not, despite the differences, this 6-part animated series of primitive Heinlein's classic most accurate customization. <br /> <br /> The most obvious plus for this series is the carts with soldiers, something we missed in Verhoeven. Like the book, this series focuses more on characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, although we see the fair amount of each. Although events occur differently from the book, the plot of the book has a feeling. Rico and Carmen have a romantic obstacle, but it only touches a little more than the book. While some may believe that dialogue and character interaction are a bit worse (it gets a bit of anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it's much better than the movie. Heinlein's political views are simply cut out of the film, if they are the opposite. The big profit of the series, however, is the climate struggle between Klendathu for soldiers and mistakes / aliens, which has the kind of action we should see in the film format. <Br / I generally enjoyed this series because I wanted to see Heinlein's closer vision. And I think they did it quite well. If you find this series, look at it.
