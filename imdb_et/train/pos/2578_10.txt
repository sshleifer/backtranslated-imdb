Superman and mole men are probably the most difficult Superman adventures. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, the world's deepest oil well. There are some radioactive mole-goers out there, exploring the city. Jeff Corey and many other townspeople are trying to conquer mole men. Can Superman change people's ways to save mole men? Will Superman warn people in time of the radioactive threat that mole men bring? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and Mole Men are a very intelligent, well-written and well-functioning film. Even if we see Superman only briefly, it still sees a great Superman adventure. Must see someone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars
