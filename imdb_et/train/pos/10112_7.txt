Originally, I got it in cinemas in 1996 for one week. It was impressive and my feelings have not changed much. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. These include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr, Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with movie clips or some strange modes. That's interesting (somewhat), but was it really necessary? I've seen all of Wood's movies and they're just terrible. Wood had ambitions, but not a little talent to carry them out. I wouldn't say he was the worst director, but he's there. Do we really need very mediocre filmmakers? I like the fact that they didn't try to make Wood a kind of saint. More than some of the respondents (especially Lugosi Jr.) hated a lot of men and it came out loud and clear. They also completely ignore their films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. It's still interesting if you are a wooden fan. The best interviews with Vampire (who pits Wood separately) and Dolores Fuller (long time girlfriend).
