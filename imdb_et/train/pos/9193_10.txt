This is true for the very same name of the original manga (Tramps Like Us in the US), but you can still enjoy it even if you haven't read the manga. It's a different tail that shows a strong and independent woman who hurts like everyone else. But because of his external power, he fears that he is showing his inner feelings, and so let them hurt him with his blunt comments. The only one who really takes him out and who he can be is his new pet ... man ... Momo. If you want something other than the usual boring stuff with some wonderful J-Dorama (Japanese drama) actors / weapons, this is definitely a series to watch ... and read!
