Deodato brings us some lightly shocking moments and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Absolutely classic it in its definite way. This film gives the barbarians a refreshingly different look. If you can see this movie, do it. At most times, you have a smile on your face. Not because it is funny or damp, but because it is so bad that it goes out and turns out good, though maybe not pure, fun.
