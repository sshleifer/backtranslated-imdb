A great addition to someone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys are a movie you don't see every day. It has great actors with a great story. This is not the usual role of Bruce Willis, but he has the role of John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors' story not new, but the story takes its fresh new direction. <br /> <br /> The man (Bruce) will be sent back over time to get information about the virus that has destroyed most people. <br /> <br /> The participants were fantastic. I have to talk to Brad Pitt, who was fun because the mental patient James Cole (Bruce) meets at a mental hospital. man-made virus. <br /> <br /> The animals that were seen in the viral world showed that they were leading the world when people enter underground spaces. <br /> <br /> This movie was great and must see it and its head. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
