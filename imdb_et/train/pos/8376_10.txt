One of the best movies out there. Yeah, maybe cinema wasn't the biggest, but a great line and concept. Great for time and great and creative ideas. Something different from ordinary movies and great fun. One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who loves creative and creative films. The 3rd World War and the struggle against giant robots gave the actors a great result and did everything worthwhile. Sets are not amazing but simple and worked for the overall look of the movie. This movie is very difficult to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I've loved it because it has come out. Not a mainstream flick and nothing you've ever seen. Look and think like a child. It's a great view and a lot of fun.
