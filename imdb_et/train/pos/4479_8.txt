Since I first saw Anchors in Aweigh in 1945, I watch a lot of nostalgia on my video tape. At the age of 15, I was easy to pull MGM Technicolor's first music. Now I am most interested in thinking about the future career of leading players. Although Sinatra had made a couple of important films shortly after her appearance after Dorsey Day, she was a solo singer, her first big film. As the other viewer noted, it seems almost to be a warm city. Sinatra may have had to work hard for this, but her dance with Kelly is plausible and she will make her next pair. But observing your body structure makes it easy to understand why he was caricatured as a string. Who could have imagined that, over a decade, he had won an academic prize for fighting and would continue to play many roles in harsh detective or combat. Although Gene Kelly's personality and dance dominated this film, her triumphant victory was that she became the main creative power of the MGM, almost an icon. Finally, it was strange to see Dean Stockwell with a fresh face and remember that he will later play the "thrill" killer at Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder in the 1920s. Additional Note: One supervisor praised Betty Garrett as the love of Sinatra. Later he played in the city, but Pamela Britton was in that movie.
