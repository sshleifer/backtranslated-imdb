If you are a fan of the movie noir and you think they don't do as they used to be, then here's your answer - they just don't make it in Hollywood. We have to turn to France to remember how satisfying, subtle and terrible the film is. Read My Lips is a wonderfully unpleasant little gift for the loyal director Jacques Audiard, featuring sharp narrative and fine performances from Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The basic image could have been written in the 40s: stupid but tempting ex-con and intelligent, but frightening femme fatale (who turns out to be mercilessly ambitious) discover each other when they live blind despair and longing, manipulate each other with their ends, develop complicated love / hate, cook a criminal scheme that involves attack, double baptism, close appeals and lots of money. All operations take place in depressed, saturated and / or poorly lit places. <br /> <br /> Audiard has naturally shaped some modern turns. Femme fatale is an underestimated office worker who is almost deaf and uses her lips reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And where you can expect steaming love scenes, you will discover that both characters are sexually uncomfortable and immature. Add some modern technology and music and it seems like a modern movie, but it doesn't make a mistake - it's an old school film noir. It's as good as a movie in every genre and easily one of the best films I've seen during the year.
