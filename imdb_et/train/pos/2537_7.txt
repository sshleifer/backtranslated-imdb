Boris and Bela do the movie well, whether they are against each other or on the same boat. I saw it in 1972 and bought it from Borders this year. This time, looking at it with my children, I took note of two things: he was in the middle of 3, 4 and 5 years of attention; and I tried some of the things I didn't have when I first looked at it. Need for movie fans !!!
