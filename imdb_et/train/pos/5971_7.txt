Skippy from the Family Courts goes to a cleanly cut metal child in this rather cheesy film. The film seems to have been done in response to all those irritated parents who claimed that metal music is turning their children into evil or killing them - except for this, the dead Satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave (using Skippy to help out). And if the plot is clever and clich√©, it's a funny (and big) movie creation (such as an evil green mist that takes off a woman's clothes) and a soundtrack. And of course there's nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who asks what love songs happened :). Definitely a movie that has some friends for a good laugh. And if you have done this, do it with the double Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there is a driller killer with black skin w / fringe on the "evil rocker" (as noted in the video box). Must see cheesy movie fans.
