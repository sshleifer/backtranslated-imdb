A film that dramatized the understandable reluctance of the inevitable advent of World War II when the Spanish Republic, which was sent by its soon-to-be-destroyed government (Charles Boyer), penetrates to England, seeking support for its cause, trying to influence rich mine owners not to sell coal back to the fascists in Spain. He disturbs the locals by beaten convincingly in a scene and later in a film that faces angry crowd miners who see him as another threat to their brave life. Despite the socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film passes through a sophisticated dark and tense intrigue that includes the incredible compatriots of Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre and has been filmed in many darkly lit scenes at James Wong's harsh Hotel Howe, and leads more than one once under your skin.
