I've never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel this movie was perfect. Colors, when the bold dances were, the gypsies and the rivals, who all put together, made a film that seemed too soon to end. I've seen other Carlos Saura movies and I agree that this movie can be his best production. I feel that the best features of his past films have been put together and brought to Iberia. I appreciate using mirrors to uncover the activities behind the cameras. Watching this movie, I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, looking at the dessert wood dessert with a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film is like a glove. I don't know how I can get a copy of this movie in the United States in the coming years. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the livelihood of other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is definitely on my favorites list.
