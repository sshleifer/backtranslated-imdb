If two writers write a morning dinner version of Tiffany, then you know that something goes right. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are great actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. Scenes where Patrick looked at Holly up and down like a lens, they were just weird. Drew Barrymore is very hot. The intimate strangers where Sally Kellerman worked were a big part. The weird rubber worm was just weird. Nathan was a very beautiful cat. But what was the scene where Patrick followed Holly's floor and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What did he go around there? And not every man has a woman, as Sally Kellerman said. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside of Victoria, it was strange.
