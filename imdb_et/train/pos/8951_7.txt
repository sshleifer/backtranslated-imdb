It's a gentle and simple 1950 comedy. Kim Novak belongs to the Manhattan Witches. He puts the neighbor Jimmy Stewart out of boredom, but eventually falls in love with losing his abilities. Look, witches are allowed to have "hot blood" but not love. Elsa Lanchester is a Novak aunt, also a witch. Jack Lemmon is his brother. Hermione Gingold is the main witch and Ernie Kovacks is the author of Sidney Redlich, who specializes in writing witches. <br /> <br /> I described it as a comedy of the 1950s because it can't be confused with anything else. Everything is so smooth and polished, from decoration, wardrobe and plot, performances and directions. Take the character of Ernie Kovacks. He is "drunk and nut". And here's how the movie shows these features. She asks for another drink, and although she always wear a jacket and tie like other gentlemen, her hair is a bit long and harsh. It is a strictly 1950 version of drunk and nut. Nothing is wrong; everything is fine and dust free. Jimmy Stewart's soles are barely loose. <br /> <br /> And the Zodiac Club where the witches hang. This is called "low diving". Yet it is clean, a blind spot with courtesy waiters, a quintet of musicians, a nicely dressed clientele, and potted plants against the walls of bare bricks. This is not my idea or your "low diving" - not even in Greenwich Village in 1958. My idea of ​​diving in Greenwich Village is Julius or The White Horse Tavern or The San Remo or The Swing Rendezvous, which is now a lost lesbian hangout. The Zodiac Club is a big dive compared to them. <br /> <br /> Today's standards always mute what we hear. I mean, Kim Novak is strange because he runs his apartment around his barefoot. And he's wearing a lot of black clothes like Beatn's in this period. <br /> <br /> But never remember it. This is an enjoyable romantic comedy. Kim Novak is effective as Gillian, who directs ultra-modern art. At the same time he has strange beauty, bulky and ethereal. He slips, not walks, weak. Her eyebrows stand out with a French French curve set. And Jimmy Stewart is pretty good as a puzzled and hidden victim. In the 1930s he usually played in light roles. In the postwar years and much of the 1950s, he was a tortured protagonist, but he puts his early experience in comedy well. Who could laugh when Hermione Gingold forces her to wear a towel and drink some liquid to treat her with Novak's incantation? It's good to see him as angry and outraged by the principle he was threatened to get. Richard Quine guides the film quietly, without any fireworks or special effects, and does interesting things to play. Notice the scene where Novak strikes Stewart's spell when Siamese cat's face and ears seem to join Novak's amazing eyes. <br /> <br /> Ernie Kovacks was a well-known television personality in the 1950s. Previous - or after - was never something like Ernie Kovacks. This reminds us of the word "surrealism". He could play five minutes worth of unspeakable and indescribable tricks in a non-inhabited space where only the Bartok orchestra was the backdrop. And he made an unpreachable sketch using the character Percy Dovetail, the effete poet. Condoli Brothers missed the confectionery, but it is quite casual because the two men - Pete and Conte - were virtuoso trumpeters who had an independent career in jazz ensembles. Conte was later a member of the Doc Severison band at Johnny Carson's late shows. <br /> <br /> The third act is a bit of a breeze and becomes more "romantic" than "comedy". But it's never boring. The whole film rolls as nicely as the Van Druten game and the kids get out of it.
