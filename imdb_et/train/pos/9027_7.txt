The higher-than-average movie and the action partially violated by this totally predictable story. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit every time the action. This flick is surrounded by the "Pleasantville" camp smell. It is more accurate than not in the period. The lack of tragedy and upward movement in the cities of the company is sketchy but moves. Chris Cooper becomes the first-class father of Howard's coal miners.
