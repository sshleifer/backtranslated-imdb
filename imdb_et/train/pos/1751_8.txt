The 40-year-old virgin is about forty-year-old Andy Stitzer, who works in an electronic store who doesn't have much social life and is very uncomfortable with women. Some of her co-workers in the shop call her one night and they discover that Andy is still a virgin so they would lose her innocence. One day in the shop Andy, a woman meets Trish, who gives her a phone number and finally Andy has enough time to go with her and they really like each other, but Andy is still very uncomfortable when Andy is. it is sex and she has to tell Trish, a lot of her embarrassment if she really has the courage to get her before things are awkward. The 40-year-old virgin's birthday has a good direction, a good script, good comics all over, good cinematography and good movie. The stars of the movie are composed by Steve Carelli, who makes a very good comedy breakthrough and his writing for the film is very good. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. It's sweet, funny, fun, fun, enjoyable, smart, good and good. This movie is as good as this year's Wedding Crasher and both films are the two best comedies I've seen for a while. A 40-year-old virgin really introduces a lot of talent and it has been introduced and it works for comedy and romance and it's sweet and fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
