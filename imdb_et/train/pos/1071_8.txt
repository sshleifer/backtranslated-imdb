definitely need some work in season 2. For example, like the virus between Max and Logan and Ames White with his old, super culture. During the second season, the only thing that watched me was seeing Max and Logan getting rid of the nasty virus that infects Max. Very good drama in the second season. But of course, like all TV shows, if there is something wrong with it, the broadcaster will take it away. I was serious about the third and last season. Season 2 leaves you hanging if you don't read Max Allan Collins books, you know what happens. <br /> <br /> Dark Angels should be put back again for the season, although it may cost a lot to get all the original actors back on. because Jessica Alba's carrier in the sky shook after the show. If that were the case, there would be a movie to complete it. like the exhibition Firefly, which of course also FOX canceled.
