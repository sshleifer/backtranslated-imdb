Beautifully filmed, well-functioning, tightly written temporary film. I was at the edge of my seat. I liked the leading actor and thought that the villain was well done. Not much to chew on the subject, but if you just get there, turn your brain off, look at the fancy camera work and enjoy the plot, you have a great time. The plot is well-worn and ordinary movie-makers will probably know more or less what to expect in about ten minutes. But it didn't bother me because I enjoyed watching it. In old times, they may not be so tightly focused on just two characters, and some tempting moments when I hoped they were going to have a few lines for another person. But these people were probably right to keep the movie so tight. The plot got me at the edge of the throat quite early and never let go. There is no point in thinking too much during or after the movie. because I'm not sure it makes much sense. Just sit and have fun.
