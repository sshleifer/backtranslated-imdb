I've seen this movie at least 4 times since '84, and it's still great when I see it. This is a very exquisite version of the opera Carmen, which has an amazing Flamenco dance, bare bones and, of course, great music. <br /> <br /> This Carmen talk is a story in one story where each parallel is another, up to twice the tragic ending. Obviously, Spain's low budget film is part of Spain's main Flamenco dancers. The combination of opera music and the sound of dancers in the wood stage makes the story even more powerful. <br /> <br /> This is an independent film that makes it the best and probably my favorite movie of all time in a foreign language.
