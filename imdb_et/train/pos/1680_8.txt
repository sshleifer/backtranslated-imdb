Well done and stylish while thinking that this thriller would work better for non-giallo fans to get the interest of the genre than later Argento records that move across all directions. <br /> <br /> Thrillers from these mad Italian fans appreciate George Hilton and the turns his character takes and what he does. Camera work is fresh with graphical violence and odd but with suitable choices and good non-overprinted music scores. The less you know about this story, the better it will work. <br /> <br /> The only thing it has not been because it was a big Sergio Martino, directed to Giallo, is that the story does not contain any special sexual or psychological or both elements that place it in the top . It is a more routine mystery, the characters are well defined, but live or die according to the plot, not according to their virtues and mistakes. <br /> <br /> The last DVD (2005) is beautiful and definitely a way to watch a movie if they never see a screen of artwork that seems unlikely.
