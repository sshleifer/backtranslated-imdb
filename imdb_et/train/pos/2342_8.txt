I looked at Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is "original". It is a word that is not used much on television because they all tend to copy what the other network is doing, and you get to the night of crime, unlikely comedies and reality. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me like a brick was Jim Dale's presence. Those who do not know the British "Carry On ..." series or those who have not listened to Harry Potter's book may not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or disturbs. I have to tune more, but it gives the atmosphere of the "Harry Potter" exhibition. Maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace has a gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead. He teams with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", "Roll Bounce") to solve the murders with this talent. Everything is good and funny until she gets her childhood love, Anna Friel (goal! The dream begins, the timeline) and things are really complicated. She can't send her back and she can never touch her. Boy, that would make the relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I tune in to see where this series is waiting for it to continue to entertain.
