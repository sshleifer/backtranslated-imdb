I was very impressed with this movie. Writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple. It is very easy for all of them to be emotionally connected. Indeed, the creators of this film hit the nail directly over the head when it comes to creating real characters and sucking the viewer into their world. In addition, music is terrible. They used some independent and some soundtracks to fill the score, and they did a fantastic job for the film. If you have the opportunity to catch this movie at a small theater or film festival (as I did), I suggest you see it. With a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's enough reason to check it out.
