In the classic spirit of "The Sting", this movie strikes where it really hurts ... in the heart! Stylish, the right female psychiatrist, who is hungry for adventure, meets the most severe and rothest. A vulnerable doctor will fall to a career counselor and will be asked to include his or her surgery. Although the film moves "slowly", it is the climax and the end to stunning! You especially enjoy how your doctor "forgives himself"!
