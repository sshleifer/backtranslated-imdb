IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that captures the biggest and deepest thinkers of the 20th century as Cupid helpers. Combining heart and mind is the central theme of this light and thoughtful film. You don't quite know how to react because some of the time you see great scientists do stupid things to grow a loving love. The end result is a fun movie with surprises. Walter Matthau is the perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a peculiar, scattered mathematician, and Tim Robbins brings to fruition the controversy of a poorly educated worker who is fascinated by science. All in all, they create love and science, spirit and heart through the obedient journey.
