A great story about teenagers, leaders, "stars" of high school football. How far are you going to protect your friends? Lie, kill me? How much can you lose if you are an innocent innocent girl? Does love win odds? Do you win the narrow-minded people of a small town? If your friend appreciates and you "lose", do you do everything you can to pay for it, or are you a man and respect his right to choose? Are you raping her and showing her to her "problem" girl? Can you stand who is the only sin, has his own opinion, that he can make his own decisions, choose himself? It made me think before I decided who was right and who was wrong, but one is sure - a very disturbing film and subject in general. Upstairs!
