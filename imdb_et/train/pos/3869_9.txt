I have seen a movie living in Vienna a few years ago where the audience liked it. I also liked the fact that Summer Phoenix's performance was still haunted, so I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story will be in London in 1900, where a Jewish girl decides to become an actor. He desperately tries to become one, but it is not until the man treats him badly, that he understands on the stage that he has a talent and that he connects the audience and appears as a stronger human being. <br /> <br /> Some comments when his performance was crushed, blaming him for being boring, unable to bring his character. I think this is his strong point, exactly what Esther Kahn should be and Phoenix makes a brave decision to make his Ester a pretty boring girl. So its transformation at the end is more powerful than it might have been. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is superb, the darkness of London around the century is very dark and sad, you can see the unpleasant life back then. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I think is the length of the movie, you lose touch with the characters, after all, it's just finding an actor, so there are no dramatic activities in the movie. It's a Phoenix credit that we won't lose the movie after the first hour of interest.
