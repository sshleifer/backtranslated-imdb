] Have you seen this movie? Didn't you even hear that movie? It won't surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films that have been produced over the last ten years was not a studio image of faith and was never taken for distribution. The independent company Kino Films gave practically no promotion to BOESMAN and LENA for a very limited time, and most of the major film critics did not even bother to review it. I think one-act film, one of apartheid's playing and its impact on two people has never been in today's market - and it's a smart movie-lover's loss. <br /> <br /> The record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover, deserved Ocsari candidates (just like the operator), but the film got so little fanfare that I can't even blame the academy. It is a film that is challenging, thought-provoking and heartbreaking, and it requires it from the audience under its own conditions. With this in mind, it is definitely not an entertaining entertainment movie. Director John Berry is not trying to play Athol Fugard. Of course, we have some broken setbacks and some breathtaking pictures, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA is the story of two people living in inhumane conditions. <br /> <br /> Their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lenal (Bassett), are not attacking anyone, but each other. The third character merges with them for a while (Willie Jonah, amazingly largely in a quiet role), but the focus of the film is never on the characters of the title and on what they have changed. Bassett and Glover give bold performances as a broken couple to presentations that simply couldn't be improved. BOESMAN AND LENA deserves a powerful and brutally stimulating rediscovery of home video, both intellectually and emotionally. Hands down, Best 2000 film.
