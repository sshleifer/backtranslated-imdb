It breaks my heart that this movie is not understood because it should be. its very underrated. people forgot what movies really are, nowadays they are just thinking about crazy movies that can be pretty fun watching popcorn and friends like transformers, movies oriented, hyper mega high budget like 300ml or even higher for special effects only and what are stylish movies without talk. This is a movie that I do, despite most. Of course, it is fun to watch CGIs, but we don't get anything important from such movies. <br /> <br /> I believe the performance was great. Particularly busy with Philipps, with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this film an Oscar. The busy Philipps' emotional performance was amazing, his kind of shame that we don't see in the Oscar he deserves.
