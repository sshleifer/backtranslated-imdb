this is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. it is really a refreshing look and i had several times the seams. I think this is also a factor of social awareness, which makes it quite interesting. if they were white girls, would they get the same reaction? maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't be? characters don't know any limits (check my words) and don't exclude anyone from their twisted fun! my favorites are builder bob. it is so stupid that it is a genius. If you like twisted black comedy, that's for you. If you like to continue performing, it is probably not 3. not blonde is another fun British BBC comedy that will be shown on TV! It is such a funny show and the characters released by the unsuspecting public laugh out loud! It would be impossible to keep a straight face looking at crazy signs and public reactions! This series easily adds great comedies!
