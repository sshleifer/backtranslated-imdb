Opening Credit: Great. Music: just this movie. Cinematic Art: Amazing With Great Impact. <br /> <br /> Don't train the train wreck. This is how some lives can be out of control. "Wonderland" depicts drug-induced atrocities (and its consequences) not as aberration, but shows how it actually happens in our society. It's better than depicting another wild group - Manson - because all Manson's films, books, etc. focus so much on Manson's crazy thought as a general picture of cheap fame and coincidence that are so wide-ranging today. <br /> <br /> If you'd like to see some of the best method-leading methods in the movie, see Kilmer in this movie. It shows how the "method" can be in the right role of riveting. <br /> <br /> Here the filmmakers have managed to raise the level of "non-control" to the art form, not only to give us cheap excitement.
