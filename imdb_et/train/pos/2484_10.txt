Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda have all led Hamlet, but Branagh is the only one who got it right. <br /> <br /> This is the only Hamlet movie that includes four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece and gives you a unique sense of the whole story. <br /> <br /> Not many directors could pull it out without the audience, but Branagh's skillful use of bravora film style and stunt selection allows people to see scenes that are usually cut out. Examples of this are, for example, Gerarde Depardue, because Ranyaldo, whose aim was to just say "yes, my lord", as Polonius asked him to spy on Learste. It also included Billy Crystal as a grave-digger, Robin Williams Osricina, Jack Lemmon Marcellousa and Charlton Heston as an actor. <br /> <br /> Branaghi Filling Act 4 Scene 4 Soliloquy (which again is usually cut out) has nothing to cinematic surprise as the camera shrinks as the intensity grows slowly back. This is a scene that made me literally jump out of my chair and start with applause. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only filmmaker who understood the importance of each scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the public. <br /> <br /> It must be for everyone who enjoys a good story, brilliant action and incredible direction. All these are part of William Shakespeare's greatest triumph.
