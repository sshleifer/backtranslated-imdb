This is undoubtedly my favorite Le Carre novel and it will be turned into a silver screen with all the love and care you might want. I read an overview on this site that seems to find the characters puzzling, but I believe it concerns the point. All Le Carre's stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception. This is an accurate reflection of this period. Fraud is the key to everyone for everyone. Pym's cultivation is so close to me that I find it cool. Peter Egan is in his best role and late liar Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles, such as Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis, are on the ground. This is Theater Impresario's Dream. The story must not be a poorly informed description, but it is enough to say that it is related to the slow but inevitable destruction of a young man and the descent into espionage and treason. All my sympathies are Magnus Pym and his only (not sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang - as wonderful as ever. His only true friendship, but also another long betrayal line). love it.
