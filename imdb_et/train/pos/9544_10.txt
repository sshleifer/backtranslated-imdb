The Meatball Machine is an amazing splatter film with original youth-loving plot, blood buckets and strange aliens who mutate people into amazing robot war machines. <br /> <br /> Now this movie is not for all people who love splatter movies or Tetsuo: Iron Man praises it. <br /> <br /> Special effects can be cheesy at some points in the movie, but you don't just assume that you are taking the film very seriously. But it's all fun if you find dirty romantic people who are infected with a slimy tumor, like gobbles, who are trying to destroy each other in bloody alien battles.
