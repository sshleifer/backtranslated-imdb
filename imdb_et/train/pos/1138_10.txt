When I was an 8-year-old child, I always watched movies and television that I didn't like, and that was one of them. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite films and it must be a more fun movie I've ever seen in my life, the actor is great, they're no longer doing comedies like these days (movies that are NOT funny and doing laugh without the use of faeces or some kind of body fluid causing vomiting, such as those slowed down by Judd Apatow's films, starring non-artists like Seth Rogen, barf. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the recognition.
