Just came back when the original instinct 2 was first shown. I was going to think that it would be crazy from the critics of the preview, and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original basic instinct, I think you'll enjoy # 2 as much as not more. A great story that keeps you always thinking and thinking. Music is great, repeating the original theme. Don't wait for the academic prize material, go for it and have fun. This is what movies are meant for - escapism. I can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with Sharon Stone, who is as sexy as ever. I mean again at the end of this week. Look at this!
