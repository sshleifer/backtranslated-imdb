I grew up during the time when music in this movie was popular. What a great time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. I think it sounds like I have lived in the past (I have great memories), what's wrong?!? World War II was a terrible time except for music. The death of Glenn Miller was a terrible sadness for us. This movie is my favorite. Clio Laine was great; what a voice! I don't know how I miss this movie. My main reason for this comment is to warn the modern generation of alternative to Rap and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!
