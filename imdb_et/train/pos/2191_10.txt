Shakespeare said we were actors who set a big stage. But when this stage is Israel, we multiply the work we interpret, and all the actions we do are full of hard style. Dan Katzir succeeds in admiring Tel Aviv's life, but besides, Katzir succeeds in penetrating the heart of the Israeli people, and those people who are far from simple prominent figures speak heartily. Katziri's film allows Israel to escape from the dark informative nucleus in which they live, and this wonderful country comes to light as an excellent bird born of his ashes. For me, it is great because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans only know about informative diaries or newspapers, is a close and absolutely human reality, a reality for a million people looking for their place, exploring the whole world. the whole culture whose sole purpose is to feel its part. Katzir builds an absolutely wonderful documentary and shows that when it comes to passionate human films, the deepest feelings are predicted and these feelings go beyond our hearts. Thank you for opening Dani's eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful portraits of the world's most beautiful countries.
