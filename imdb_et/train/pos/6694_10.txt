It has finally come out. The first season is available in March 2007. It is now in the ABC Family family from 4am to 5pm Monday to Friday. The last episode will appear on December 19 at 4:30. I left it around the first 100 times. I wish I could buy the whole series right away. Who chooses? I have to write 10 lines to answer the first comment. What I'm saying. La da da de de de. La da da de speed is up to 8, how can I get almost 9 to 9, now I need 10 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, I thought it was just a number 8. Punky Brewster is quite awesome. Almost 10 almost awwwwww.
