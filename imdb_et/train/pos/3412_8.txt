DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story of a brutal man. A doctor who cures the sick in occupied France, even if they do not have the ability to compensate. Yet he gets the weakest among the people. The images and cinematic art are excellent and offer a complex story to the macabre. He's the perfect psychopath. Charming and altruistic, intelligent and caring, computational and murderous. A movie that the viewer does not have to forget soon. Kudos to Mr Serrault for his cooling.
