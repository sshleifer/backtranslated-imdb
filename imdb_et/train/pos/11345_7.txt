That's why I still have a nightmare. <br /> <br /> This scary movie (musical) was considered suitable for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The boy leaves the magical journey to the island. Pufnstuf, mayor of the island, allegedly a dragon who sees me more like a conjunctivitis, and the magic speaks of a flute witch (Billie Halliday, who was considered a little right at that time). <br /> <br /> The flute is restored with an "interesting" witch convention where witches have a gay time. The boy dresses up as a "fairy" to restore the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
