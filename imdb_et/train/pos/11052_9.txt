When I was six, I found out what series called "Los Campeones", and even when I was just a kid, I did everything to convince my parents to allow me to watch "Champions" and "Avengers" once a week. I think it was the golden age of English-language series ... (I already have a complete "prison" cycle!), But it took a few years later for "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" (I'm just that or it's) Harry Potter girl, of course, before I want Campions to be in zone 1 or 4, I also expect "Dr. Who" (pack the whole series), maybe 300 DVDs, please, I couldn't spend any more on this, 8), tomorrow's people and many other 'low budgets' but great stories that are available in the zones I have achieved. speak and understand English, but not all my relatives, including my parents, whom I introduced to these great stories ... I hope one day, someone could feel the attractiveness of their series and then sell them when I first looked at them. Duplicated or subtitled, but in the same format I saw, keep in mind that zone 1 or 4 is fine with my TV!
