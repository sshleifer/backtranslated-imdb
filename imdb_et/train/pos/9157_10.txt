Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this version of film at the end of the 90s, I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the movie! This version is a bit long to sit in one session but worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing like Rochester. I was delighted that they put Jane and not a glamorous man in the usual-looking actor (Zelah Clark). I love sets and location. For anyone who is a real Jane Eyre fan, this is a look! For those who are interested, I found this version on DVD. I looked at my VHS copy almost to break, so I was excited about finding it on the DVD.
