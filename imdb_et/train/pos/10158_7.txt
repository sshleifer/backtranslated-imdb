Johnny and June Carter Cash funded this movie, which is a traditional gospel story. The music is great, you get a real sense of what the world of Jesus saw (I have been there too) and in June, passionate Mary Magdalene. Money telling is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was unsuccessful. 2. The story of money does not give any edge that puts some of your faith-based music. 3. Because it is inconvenient, I doubt that we will ever see it widely distributed. <br /> <br /> I'd like to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas
