The biggest games of Kasparov or Fischer can be unpleasant for the dish. This is a great movie. There are no special agencies on the plot. That's a clue! It is a PRIVATE company built as a PRIVATE company. It is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. All in all, the scenario described the ideal professional plot: private, self-organized, destructive, no trace at the end. Everyone can be behind the plot: a smart "manager" who has money. Everything can only be done by the delegation. The "director" must be just dismissal. If the ordinary viewer does not see the nature of the plot in the direct sequence of the film, there are fewer opportunities to discover the real plot. All of the actors' performances are well done, especially for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
