As one of the previous commentators said, it was a great film base, but something happened towards delivery. Such waste, because Collette's production was terrible and Williams was credible. I just waited for it better. I don't think it was bad editing or it wouldn't need a second director, it could have been a movie. It happened as a Canadian film, as in the first seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hockey. There was also a need for a little more tension. Something that makes you jump from your seat. The film that arrived at this moment vanished; like the wrong climax. I can see how too shocking was the story of "reality", but I thought that part was achieved when Gabriel was in the hospital when he was looking for a boy. This film must have a director's section trying to solve these problems.
