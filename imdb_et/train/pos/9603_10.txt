I have this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at Tribeca Film Festival. People were shouting in the theater. This film shows the difficulties Darius suffers from muscular dystrophy. The film was very well done and really made you part of the film, I was emotionally moving the movie because it made us remember that we are very happy to be completely healthy, some people in this world are less powerful then. And sometimes we should give and help them until the end. I'd give them ten stars, they gave them to Darius if they didn't ask them, they didn't do it for the money they made for the friend they needed, Darius, the world should know, Darius went west.
