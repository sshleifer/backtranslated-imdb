I thought the "River of Souls" was a very good Babylon 5 movie with some extraordinary performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If it were a series episode (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite scenarios. Personally, I have always preferred Scoggins to Christians, although it has been given to JMS by a large part of the series and he had to endure the Byron / Telepath plot. If you take a relaxing humor about brothel and "poorer" actors in these scenes, this movie is for sure. Probably the third favorite of my four films, but not at all bad.
