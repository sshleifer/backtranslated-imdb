A unique film about a confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who is dealing with sharp men. Joe Mantegna gives the Oscar a caliber as a mess. Absolutely enchanting first hour, as Mantegna shows Crouse's "ropes" in his games. The story speaks a little later, but still stands as a unique image of the innocent in the dark world. Definitely worth the picture.
