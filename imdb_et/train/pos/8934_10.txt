Two things haunt you all over L'intrus (The Intruder): who is the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you look at? The end is so shocking that you have lost the answer to one of these questions for some time. An intruder appears in different characters, in different men in different situations that do not belong to the scene, so they are excluded, kindly or cruelly, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a despicable person. He has harsh ways, some work and a heart. She needs one and goes after that. He has a heart transplanted and then decides to start a new life. Does this man succeed in seeking redemption? Such a guy could cut his hat in the hat. You know it, but Claire Denis doesn't encourage her to judge. Sometimes a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges her. He can even punish him. But not Denis. Beatrice Dalle plays a character who doesn't want to do anything about her: don't touch me, she says. But Denis is letting this man himself, he is filming himself. I don't know if what he's filming is heart or mind, but it's not a traditional plot. Whatever she's filming, you will end up with it. You know who the "intruder" is, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come to your mind with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
