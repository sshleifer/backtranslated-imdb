When I watch a movie with a small budget, I know what to expect. I hope that this is not so good (budgetary reasons), I expect that lighting is not so good (budgetary reasons). I hope the sound is not so good (budget again). Stop evaluating these low budget movies like a big budget movie !!! I'm a filmmaker myself to understand the budget constraints on a low budget movie. Stealing locations, frames, etc. ... the list goes on and on. I don't want to say that all the actors were bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza is good. Raul Martinez is natural. Not yet Carl sold in Washington. He must understand that every line is irrelevant, some are thrown away. I'm saying that if a movie wants to see what happens, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave her 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great job for Quiroz brothers!
