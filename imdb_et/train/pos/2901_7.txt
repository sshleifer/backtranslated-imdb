Tiempo de Valientes fits tightly into the genre of friendship, but goes beyond its roots thanks to its excellent casting, enormous relationship between its leaders, and outstanding photography. Diego Peretti is dr. Silverstein, who has shrunk to ride a shotgun with Detective Diaz (Luis Luque), is destined to investigate the murder of two small hoods who seem to be involved in smuggling weapons. Diaz is suspended from service, but he is the best person for the job and must have professional psychiatric help to restore. Silverstein and Diaz will soon find themselves in a conspiracy involving the Argentine intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them into an important point that will enable Silverstein to develop his own impressive skills. Peretti and Luque are great together and remind me of the screen team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti isn't as classic as Hill. It is noteworthy that even nearly two hours of Tiempo de Valientes does not carry his greeting, and even the writer-director Damian Szifron creates a possible sequel to the film's charming codas. All in all, it is a wonderful and very entertaining comedy that does not turn the lowest common denominator and offend your intelligence.
