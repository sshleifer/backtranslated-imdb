Ideal for families with small children looking for lightweight films that do not contain violence and are fascinating for children and entertaining, albeit perfect, for adults. Not a bad movie for a low budget job. Children are surprised by Santa's workshop and "magic", which allows him to enter homes through chimneys or homes with no chimneys! <br /> <br /> Kids thrilling for Santa's success hinder the nasty devil named Pitch (full of horns and tail in classic red dress!). They feel compassion for a poor little girl whose greatest desire is to love a little doll. And a poor little rich boy who wants to spend time with his eternally missing parents. And what does the child not know at school who is like nasty boys involved in Pitch to help Santa and Christmas destroy? In the end, everyone, including nasty boys, will get what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film carries the children of both Santa Claus and the message of love he offers to people all over the world. <Br /> <br />
