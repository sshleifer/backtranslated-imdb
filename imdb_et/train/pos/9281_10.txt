I don't know how and where the Iranian directors get inspired by this plot. In fact, this is a very simple plot that many directors may come up with â€” but may not be able to show off the film as Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to another - a football match and a fight between the sexes that take place behind the stadium walls. <br /> <br /> It makes you feel like you are in a movie and you. Watch any character in the movie and watch the movie as you want a glimpse of the football match. You will feel the same excitement and feelings as the feminine movie. It's thrilling so you wanted to see the end, you want to know that you are dying to see what happens to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like intermittent conversations with a smoker and a military practitioner. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference between men's and women's thinking and women's struggle to get equal rights and opportunities especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is another Jafar Panah movie I've seen (first is Crimson Gold) and I look forward to some more. <br /> <br /> I've been catching up with Iranian movies and it's black!
