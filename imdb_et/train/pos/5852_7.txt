It was the first PPV for a new era for WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel. The new talent crop had to be postponed. And it all started with Lex Luger, the former heavyweight master of the NWA world, who was given the title Yokozuna. Lex traveled across the United States on a bus called Lex Express to inspire Americans behind him to win his Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and get WWE championships back to America. As such, it was a lot to be expected for this game. <br /> <br /> But every good PPV needs a sub-card and had some good things. <br /> <br /> The night started with Razor Ramon, who won Ted DiBias in good play. It was in this story that DiBias had chosen Ramon and even offered him a slave to his 1-2-3 child in July after his shock loss. Ramon, angry, was then Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shysteri Money Inc team with a 1-2-3 child. To address these differences, they were given one response to DiBiase vs. Ramon and Shyster vs. Kid. Razor was able to settle his deal half after shaving the razor. <br /> <br /> The Steiner Brothers, who put the headlines of the WWE tag against Heavenly bodies, came next. Leading by Jim Cornette's "The Bodies" leader, who hit Scott Steiner with a tennis racket, they managed to win a decent game. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect were bothered by Wrestleman IX when Shawn Michaels met Perfect after Lex Luger's loss. Perfect had then paid Michaels an inter-continental championship when he mixed him up with Marty Janetty. Michaels won the title back and placed it on line with Mr. Perfect, but Michaels now had his 7-foot body groomer Diesel with his powerful ally. Micheals and Perfect had a great place, but it was Diesel, who proved the drawer, pulling out the perfect ring and kicking it into Shawn's steel steps to win their number. <br /> <br /> Irwin R Shyster testified to his partner's partner's disappearance earlier in the night, easily considering 1-2-3. <br /> <br /> The next one came as a big game for one night as Bret Hart finished the title of undisputed king of WWW for Jerry's battle. But Lawler came out with the crutches saying he had been injured in an accident in a car accident and that he had arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hartil and Doinkil had a satisfying game that Hart won with a sharp shooter. Then Lawler jumped from behind. It bought WWE President Jack Tunney to a circle who told Lawler that he would get a lifetime ban if he didn't wrestle Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning the sharp-knife, but Hart refused to let go and the judge canceled his decision. So after that was called Lawler WWE the undisputed king. This game was followed by Ludvig Borda, who destroyed Marty Janetty's short game. <br /> <br /> Undertaker finished a long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, who started in 1992 when Undertaker was defeated by the Wippleman customer Kamala Summerslama and continued when Wippleman's newest monster The Giant Gonzales had destroyed Taker's drum and then again in Wrestleman, decisive victory with Gonzales. Then Gonzales turned to Wippleman when he got into a bad game. <br /> <br /> The next time was six people because the Gunns of smoking (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka won The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka's capture of Sam. <br /> <br /> It takes us to the main event with Yokozuna, backed by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, placing the WWE title on Lex Luger and all on board Lex Express. Lex had to attack but Yokozuna took control. Lex returned when he managed to avoid the banzai decline and then the body slamata Yokozuna before he fell out of the circle. Then Luger attacked Cornette and Fuji because Yokozuna was counted. Luger had won a fine game !!!!! Balloons fell from the ceiling. Heroes all came out to congratulate him. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger had proven to be beaten. The only question was who could win her and get her title?
