I know, I know: it's childish. But I just love this type of movie. A bird who suffered a lot of "failures" and still loses faith in humanity and his sense of humor. What is special about this film is that Paulie is the main character - a parrot and is not used as a thrust on some human actor. What's more, I like the story: Paulie speaks to a cleaner place where she hit the ground. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice sounds almost like Joe Pesci!). And Cheech Marin of course is a man of humor. Since I saw "Up in Smoke", I've appreciated his naive way of doing things, making it a fun situation. Can't help yourself.
