Great farce! Of course, all that is meant. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, nor is there any attempt in this direction. Can the plot actually be taken or has it taken place at a particular time or place? Unlikely, after all, it's just a movie, and movies are an imagination, not a reality. The only purpose of this film is to entertain, not to educate and amuse it when the reality throws the wind with joy and effort. I think most agree that we expect enlightenment and authenticity from the documentary. But I want to entertain what is now described as a "no-brainer" that the mating game has in every sense. For some women and for a laugh right now, this is a good price fantasy.
