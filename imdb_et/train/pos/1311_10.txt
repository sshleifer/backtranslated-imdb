This is one of the best movies out there and that means a lot is that it was on television. I really want it to be d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such raw power. He played a rookie policeman who was thrown perfectly into the serum killer case. When he breaks down because he kills another boy, it was amazing. He's so alone, so he gets him. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber was so shocking as the serum killer! He brought him to his dark world. It was Oscar-worthy. If he talks about killing children, it's scary! If he understands who he really is! What a scene! <br /> <br /> They don't do that anymore. It was a real thriller without being able to.
