They didn't cut journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell "From Her Girl's Friday" or the funny detective William Powell and Thin Mani sassy lady Myrna Loy, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming like amateur shots at Scoop. The repertoire of these screws is more postmodern than post-depression, Allen's writing is full of ironic self-cleansing and simple old New York anger. The tones of old spirits rarely occur, for example, when he, like Sid, the great Splendin magician, replies to his background: "I was born into persuasion in Hebrew, but when I got older, I turned into narcissism." Johansson, a fresh Allen Match Point as a bad girl, will be a relatively good, sometimes ditsy journalist who has been captured by the mystery of murder suitable for London: the killer of serums. The plot is the reprocessing of his recent London-based thriller, the Match Point, the upper-class sins and the "American in tragedy" / "Sun in the Boating" accident. In fact, Allen writes about understanding the murder of Manhattan and the Cairo purple rose to name a few other examples. I don't care when he rewrites; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals, and unfortunately it is only a reflection of his younger majesty. <br /> <br /> Allen's director and actor cannot hide his love for the actor, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore takes the average comedy to a suitable place with the Allen canon, not big but amusing, at times perfectly satirical: with a higher-than-suspected murderer , Sid (Allen) smiles, "I'd be very surprised to kill one person." It's a vintage Allen humor. Although there are barely passionate references, like most of his films, he scores with Scoop's music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to find out that Woodman has not lost touch with his class.
