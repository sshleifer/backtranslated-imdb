Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot secret. I admit that I haven't read the book, despite being an avid fan of Agatha Christie. Adaptation is not without problems, the time when humor, and there were brave attempts to get it right, was a little overestimated, and the events that led to the final solution were in a hurry. I also thought there were some slow moments, so some mysterious felt padding. But I loved the way the Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC murders, and it really did create the atmosphere of dark camera work and dark lighting. The darkest moments were somewhat creepy, one of the most strange musical points helped by adjusting Poirot, perhaps not as disturbing as one of the two pawns that gave me nightmares. The plot is complicated, with all the important ingredients, though not as it is for Buckle My Shoe, and in some way it's good. Action was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can't use that word forever, but I can't think of a better word to describe my series performance) like Poirot and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran make justice to their integrated characters perfectly . And the students had great personalities and generally well developed, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. All in all, there is a definite mystery, but not a ranking. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
