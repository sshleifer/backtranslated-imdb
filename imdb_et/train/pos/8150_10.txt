My, Kasi Lemmings is definitely a fair-looking woman. This movie is a lost pearl, a dead-satire "Hip Hop Scene of the early 90s" when MC Hammer had just disappeared into this good night. We follow the three NWH members when they start their picaresque journey with potential wealth and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, they finally end their journey far from where they started, but at least a little smarter and much less naive. This is one of the best movies that nobody has ever heard of, but it's a movie you love or hate, such as the "Man of the Company". I consider this movie like the 1000-state island of New York: it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep.
