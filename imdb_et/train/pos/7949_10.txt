SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: An incredible journey is an important movie of my life because it's the first movie I remember in my home town cinema as a 4 year old. The story is based on Sheila Burnford's novel and is why it cannot be written as a brain-free Lassie clone. <br /> <br /> Main Story: Two dogs and a cat happily living in the Seaver family, when a new husband to a mother of three, gets to work in the city and they have to move temporarily to San Francisco when the animals are sent to the ranch to live for a few months. The links between animals and their caring children are particularly strong, and Shadow's golden retriever and Hassas's cat Sassy are heart-breaking because the children are, though the young and happy happy American bulldog, known as Chance, is a little less worrying and somewhat cynical (partly His votes, which explained that he was abandoned as a son, rose to the animal shelter and bought the family), although his growth in character during the story gives many important storytelling. <br /> <br /> Three pets are escaping from the ranch and staying in a wide and dangerous desert (fantastic desert settings by the way), guided by the Shadow instructions. They meet the road with many dangers, hoping that it will come home, while the family and ranchies are unexpectedly concerned about the disappearance of animals. There are funny moments all the time, a great dialogue between the three animals and fun lines (see - memorable quotes) and a comrade comrade who grows during storytelling between the main characters that are saddened by moments of sadness (for example, when Sassy's arrogance tries to cross the river without getting wet, it drops in the river and wash the waterline, leave the viewers deep in the moment of disappearance.) Somehow I don't see how adding a girl to the wilderness into the story and the journey they take is what it is. Somehow it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story. <br /> <br /> Final pulls that are bigger when the shadow gets into the train hole and hurt your leg, it's hard to get out and give up, exhausted, followed by Chance to climb with him to persuade him to climb, telling him it is important to him and how he pushed it so far that he should not throw it so easily. <br /> <br /> The way this scene (perfectly done) does not stop, leaves uncertainty that leads to the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then, as everything seems lost, he appears slowly and is reunited with the family. Ultimately, the final decision that has evolved between her and her husbands on the journey, and what the home is, indeed, to get to her long journey, leaves a fine epilogue to show how much her character has grown. but also how the other two are. Keep another, I think I'm gonna cry ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I'm not pretending to know where the differences between a book and a movie lie. But this is a movie that the whole family can watch, and although the lovers love talking animals, the older viewers understand the plot line better (as I found when watching the movie again after several years of watching). This movie is a cinema masterpiece and I suggest that if you haven't seen it, you go out and get it! <br /> <br /> And please do not leave a sequel (see my review of website II!)
