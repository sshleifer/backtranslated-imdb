This is probably the fastest-running and most urgent "Crimea" series by German Edgar Wallace, which is perpendicular to Dr. Between the Mabus films and the 60's pop thrillers like Batman and UNCLE. He restores the outrageous scraper of an earlier film, a stylish monk's habit and crushes victims with a deadly whip. In the holy girls' school, full of medieval old professors, and where police officers pampered their hot-to-trot secretaries every time, it is definitely a setback for those wonderfully politically wrong times. There's a strong link to a later Wallace-based film, a great giallo "What happened to Solange?", Which also concerns female students who are being violated by their parents (and are violated). It is quite suitable for monk art that the master-man's dwarf uses biblical bibles to deal with the blow of death here, and also retains a reptile-filled prison to entertain its target groups. <br /> <br /> Alfred Vohrer was always the most playful and visually terrifying of the series directors, and here is the real star of the exhibition in true color. Monk appears in a tailor-made crust and cloth that creates a tastefully shiny white whistle, while appearing with a purple-night background. There is also a voyeur-friendly turquoise swimming pool, which looks good both for nubile students and as a shady scene for some murder scene. Also hiding the "kicker" trademark "Ende" in the last scene set is also quite memorable here. And for retro-music fans there is a tiny brass and a double score. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </p> <p> <p> </p> <p> <p> The Chief Inspector, Sir John, plays the role of bull, convinced that after taking some courses overnight, he has acquired criminal psychology. Unfortunately, Klaus Kinski went on to bigger and better things. Because of this point, Crimea has lost some of its subversive subversive competition and has now worked at a much blatant level of pop culture that makes it quite accessible to individuals.
