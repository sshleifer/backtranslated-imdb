This movie started with me with Nick Cage's kick. It is a story full of turns - movie motives and movements. Of course Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect couple to catch their web dropped unsuspecting man. All this film is good - cinematography, story and most importantly. Cage stands out for what he does best - it must not be a hero of deeds, but an eternal caught in the course of life.
