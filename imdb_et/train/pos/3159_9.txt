... and the series lets you forget it all. I am about three years older than the children in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to ride in the first gas shortage and got my first college graduation job in 1979 during another gas shortage. The 70s was a really terrible time to be young - inflation, competing with a post-school minimum - job creation triggered by thirty milligrams, terrible music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this series does not ignore any of it and still succeeds in making the 70's beautiful joys for those who are old enough to know better. It can be seen directly in the 70s - with authentic clothes - and still fill the exhibition with the hope and things of young people that make high school and college for years both the best and the worst. Then there are the parents. Indeed, two young lovers - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - are really dreadful parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, aren't exactly June and Ward, although they're commonplace for decades. They represent what happened when the 60s reached the suburbs by the end of the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show their entire lives to give their wonders their legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso and Jackie round off a group that represents nervousness, well-known incompetence, and snobbit respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager to show suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play cards he had dealt with even when these cards were largely shared between missing and careless parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons, though the eighth season doesn't have a little time due to Eric's absence.
