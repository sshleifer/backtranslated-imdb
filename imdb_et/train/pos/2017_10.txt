Reading only two of the comments made here, such as the lifelong Bronte fan, starting with Olivier Heathcliff and running with many of Charlotte's Rochester versions, is more than just eye-opening to see that it is a UNsung Bronte sister who hides the trio man-chauvinistic period. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of the 19th century British citizenship is that "girls" were all "spinsters" and their only realistic brush with "men" was their czar and his waste? brother. Finally, it proved that it is ANNE Bronte, who has proved in her one-time analysis the feminist point that is along the way of modern types, and also the "franchise franchise" ranks. But history passes more than a couple who were preceded by Greek heterai and Sappho, and to the ancient Emperor Yang Kuei-fei. And how about "Eve" and her apple?
