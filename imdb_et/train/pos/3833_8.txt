I can't believe that others took such a serious view of it. God, it was a lot of fun for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great honor for the Western series years ago. It didn't have to be a big cinema experience except it. What if there were no special special effects. It was a fun, inflamed tongue, look old west. Man, relax and have fun.
