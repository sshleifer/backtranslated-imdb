I remember when this film was for Academy Awards and did not win in any category. For my life, I don't remember what it was, but one thing I can say is that it was one of the best films I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film doesn't convince me a little. <br /> <br /> Basically, it is a tribulation and affliction for black women because it grows up from a girl to a woman. There are many disruptions that are distracting and terrible, but all these are necessary to see how much this woman has been exposed to. Along the way, we see other women who have had to withstand their difficulties and redeem with them. Whoopi Goldberg gives the best result in his film. Danny Glover should at least have applied for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects in a humane way, not like some side directions that show like the newest "loved". I encourage someone to see this movie. 9/10
