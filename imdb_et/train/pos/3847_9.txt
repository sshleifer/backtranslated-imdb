During this time, this film had been a controversy over all of it (like most Verhoeven projects). <br /> <br /> Includes very graphic images of death scenes; A parachute that doesn't open * tasted * boys on the body floor. A boy eating a lion * chomp * with his teeth in his throat. And the boy, flying the fast ship * zoom * bloody corpse. <br /> <br /> In addition to gore, this flick also includes some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful) scenes filmed in the gray fisherman's town of Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds flying across the screen, somewhat irrelevant to the movie, a beautiful (holy) woman who puts flowers in a milk jug, surrounded by tumbled meat plates and a steamed love scene between two male characters, in a graveyard. <br /> <br /> The story has ended frantically, but it takes 10 minutes, which does not disappoint and leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are pros, some special effects are too high, and are probably made to see how far Verhoeven can lift the gore factor (eg, several eyeballs hanging out) out of its slots. Likewise, when two leading actors (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) make a great breathing opportunity for their characters, the character of Herman (depicted by the rather unpleasant Thom Hoffman) simply developed unknowingly, making it difficult to care even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I have made every effort to give you an easy idea of ​​waiting for this amazing movie and, as you can see, it's not just a summary in words. So do yourself a favor when it happens to find this movie somewhere, look at it! And enjoy the unique style and content of this masterpiece.
