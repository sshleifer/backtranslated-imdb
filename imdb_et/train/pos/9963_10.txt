I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I've always enjoyed it. Of course the graphics are a bit cheesy compared to the current one, but it was great in the 70s. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was great. So I remember my Christmas was my family - magical. Santa was amazing and I couldn't wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and Spanish, take them to see this old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus". It's a different version than today, but who says there is one way? <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie to watch. It teaches children good and bad. I don't know how the English subtitle version is or is English, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and happy holidays! Feliz Navidad!
