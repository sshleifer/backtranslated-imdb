Very rarely does an indie comedy leave a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare pearl. Not only did the writer deal with the challenge of managing his work, but he gave a joyful result as a bad roommate. The script has an interesting look at not only the situation of writers in difficulty, but also mixes so much comedy with the world destroyed by the writer that you can't help but commit to Ernie. Very funny stuff. Despite the small budgets, Adam Jones will be able to watch the movie seriously. He's not talking about making a good movie. I can't wait to see what he's coming up next. This man can laugh and think people; it's special.
