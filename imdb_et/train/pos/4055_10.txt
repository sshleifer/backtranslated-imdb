This movie is amazing and I recommend it to both kids and adults. Animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is enchanting; much better than what the American studios produced at that time. There are, however, a few warnings on this statement. It is a shame that Disney bought Studio Ghibli's back catalog and then went to the butcher. My main point is that Disney dubbed the movie again, despite the fact that the original version was very impressive. The new lie of Van Der Beek et al and others destroyed it and took away a large part of the attractiveness of the characters, eg. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to young teenagers. The original music score is also much better than the Disney remix. This raises the question of why Disney made such changes? It seems to me that when Van Der Beek et al. It's still a beautiful movie and I would still recommend it to someone. My main beef is that Disney destroyed a movie that I loved and love from childhood. I am fortunate to have an original Japanese import with original English copying, which I now protect with my life!
