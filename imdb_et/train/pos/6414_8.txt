I was curious to know how critics responded to this embarrassing, inspiring film, so I went to Rotten Tomato and was amazed to discover that the pompous peanut gallery, which is the film critic of our country, gave an average of 43% (or "Rotten") to the film. ). <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if this movie doesn't move, you don't have a heart. (It is interesting to note that getting the same movie on the same website was rated by 74% of the viewers). <br /> <br /> Not that critics are important to me. After all, I can't think of a more meaningful, overpriced profession. Some schmoids are paid to go to the movies (which is a difficult life) and do the same for everyone else on the planet: forming an opinion. But these wedges are an opportunity for your opinion as your opinion is more than yours and even worse that they love to hate. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that this movie is old-fashioned (well, except for f-bombs), syrups and a bit predictable ... finally you know from the very beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., depicting a real naval hero Carl Brashear, every time you win (in the end) just how he comes in: decisive and happy; Strong and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performance and De Niro (like Billy's Sunday, the combination of several real people) are so strong, inspiring you to have your feet delighted with many movie scenes, especially the climax of the courtroom. You have to be a muddy real stick that these scenes would not move. Like our film critics. Michael Rappaport is a magnificent and sweetly diving student who interacts with Gooding Brashear. When somebody has seen "higher learning", then this sign fully redeems. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is what I've always felt: don't listen to critics. Watch this movie and get inspired.
