I'm very entertaining about the movie. It was my favorite movie of all time, which was in 1976. Having grown up in the 70s, I was so in love with Kris Kristofferson's appearance and behavior, of course I'm not a film critic, but for the time it was very good. I really like the combination of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I've seen the film several times and love these two, like Esther and John Norman. I'm a very big Krise fan and I see her during the concert. What a talented singer songwriter, not to mention an actor. I've seen him in many movies, but still think back A star was born.
