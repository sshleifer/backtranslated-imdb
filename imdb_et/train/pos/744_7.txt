"Foxes" is one of the films I remember about portraying teenagers in the late 1970s. Since I'm exactly the age of Jodie Foster, I'm connected to this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships and rebellion of young people. The soundtrack is great with inspirational stone, eg. "More than Feeling" by Boston and sad numbers like Donna Summer "On the Radio". The music of my later youth. Yes, I always remember it, even if it wasn't great.
