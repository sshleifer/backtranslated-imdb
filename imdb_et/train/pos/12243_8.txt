Kate Beckinsale is as good as not better than Gwyneth Paltrow than Emma in this movie, although I liked Gwyneth Paltrow in another Emma version. They are both good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale, like Emma, ​​looks almost more interesting. And I liked a woman who played Harriet Smith better in this movie ... she was more incredibly sweet and sentimental. However, the Gwyneth Paltrow version is a more pleasant thing for me than the humorous side is more obvious.
