It was amazing! Photography, editing, cinematography, music that connects us to transport the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was enjoyment of "slimming" without compromising. We were there! The sequences of dreams and the end of the setback were fresh. He told me. Keep it up! Another genre is the city of God. Also - don't laugh! - Comedy desperately looking for Susan. Nice band types with great performances. Sorry, I think the training day is also good for this genre, with fantastic performances by the ensemble. I had to change the channel with some sharp sequences, but all in one, great movie!
