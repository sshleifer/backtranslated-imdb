Most people stay in the Hollywood concept. If the hero can stimulate heroic deeds for the child's mind within the boundaries of the law, I approve of the lessons taught by Doctor Savage. <br /> <br /> In all times of conflict or war, the public and government are looking to decorate the heroes. The film industry brings heroes to the screen so people can identify them - for example, Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as James Bond, Superman or some of the best in the best. All others who follow Doc Savage are only part of the character, not the "bronze man".
