Hot Millions is any great movie. A fun and spooky story with great performances from the four best professionals ever working in business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith - certainly one of the greatest actors of all time - is full of joy. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart create and are perfect. If you want a movie with perfect casting, this is the case. This impressive is how these people work with each other both naturally and effortlessly, creating lots of laughs and fun moments. Peter Ustinov had a wonderful sense of humor and is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and editing are also first-rate, and this is an excellent occasional in the 60s in London. This is definitely on my all-time favorites list.
