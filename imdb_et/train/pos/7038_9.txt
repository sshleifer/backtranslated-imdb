"The first war is 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. It's hard to describe the film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. He reminded once or twice of Dr. Strangelove, especially that it is in the scenes of Ben Kingsley (who, in my opinion, has done a remarkable job). I had no particular expectations of this film, even though I am a big John Cusack fan, so I just let the film wash me. And as a result, I was quite entertaining. Political satire is painfully accurate and the US military business is complicated. The sub-plots were somewhat predictable, but the final interlacing of the storylines made them all worthwhile. I understand why this movie in the US was not very popular, but for the rest of the world it is a timely story.
