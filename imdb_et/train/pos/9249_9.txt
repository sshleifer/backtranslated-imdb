This film is witty, observable and completely touching. And now you can often see Jean Harlow (or an actor of that age) to give another woman a quick punch of jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Harlow Ruby is sent to the Reformer after mixing with Gable's Edward Hall (he's with this cheesy but loving slanted smile), his contradiction becomes even more complicated when he discovers that she is pregnant, and she is convinced that this rake has been abandoned by her, but in fact her love has transformed her and she must look at her, despite the fact that she is arrested and, with the help of the minister, married. <br /> <br /> The great relationship Harlow shares with his associates is the only one with his electrical chemistry, Gable, who was his most frequent leading man. His cynical character is perfect for Gaber's smooth talk. What's not to like? <br /> <br /> "You know you wouldn't be bad weather if it wasn't your face!" Ruby speaks to his relatives, his rival. "If you go near it, I have to open another window!" <br /> <br /> Invalid!
