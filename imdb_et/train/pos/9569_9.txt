As I understand, after the Chinese took over Hong Kong, the infamous cat. 3 Hong Kong films disappeared. At least so far and what this amazing movie is. I knew it was a tough criminal drama, but it's the first cat. 3 I have bought what has recently been done, I was not sure what to expect. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian man goes to Hong Kong to hit a judge woman who is also a lawyer. It turns out that the judge dealt with the hit because he divorced the judge and threatened to take all his money. It's all known in the first ten minutes so nothing is given away. After the hit, the police hit the person quite quickly, but trying to kill him is trying to kill several police officers and civilians. In his life, the police and now the racing guy is to get him before he escapes to Cambodia. This is a film that never ends and gives the viewer the opportunity to breathe. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many policemen are killed because it is very difficult for a hit man to track down and take off when they are looking for him. In the past, a striker who tries to hide in a trash can find that a man rapes and treats women. He helps him and rescues him, and he persuades him to take him with his escape. I loved this movie, it's like a skateboarder that just moves and moves at high speed, because one case leads to another and the police are sometimes as bad or worse than the hit man. Action is exceptionally good and filming and photography are breathtaking on time. There is no shoot in this movie, not even a very incredible ending. The end is pretty much unbelievable and also suitable for all acts and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes brutal, but it is not a meaningless crime drama that knocks your socks. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs more distribution, including the release of R1. Great movie, highly recommended.
