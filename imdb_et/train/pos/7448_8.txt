I have not laughed at this for a long time - although the film also has some sad moments, especially when it gets hyper-funny and serious. The characters are very realistic at most times, sometimes delicate, but quite plausible. I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's exhibition - I'm sorry for the people involved. This movie is satirical and it is very good. I want to rent this movie completely. <br /> <br />
