I don't know much about Rat Pack and Frank Sinatra always seemed to me a little too self-conscious. So, when I call it one of my all-time faves, it is not at all related to the thinking of the zone of respect. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time is about a symbol, not a realism. It is kafkaesque (it is unfortunate that Kyle MacLachlan is probably a very strong crowd when he was as good as Josef K), it is stylish, conscious, sardonic and slippery. Jeff Goldblum navigates his way through various signs, trying not to hit and act rather than dorkily, trying to stay up to date with what he knows and others who he can hide and who he can't. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best results) are the ball and the supported cast look is on the spot. Symbolism, settings (one outing with Jeff Goldblum that moves with the steps seems to be very strange) is a dialogue (style, not practicality, is a day-to-day order), all of which are characters, not really gangsterism. Have fun, have fun. Critics were really a mystery ...
