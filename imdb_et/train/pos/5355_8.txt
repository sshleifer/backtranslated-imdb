The running man rushes into today's American media complex and hits it. It may be a simple target, but they still pull it out. RM effortlessly makes pro-wrestling (which includes some pro-wrestlers as hunter), network television, Nielsen ratings, the American government (indicating that it is entertainment oriented), crime and punishment, and one and a half other things along the way. It is far from the original Stephen King short story and Arnold is not a short story of Ben Richards. But who cares? Basically, this is Arnie's flick, where all the choreographic sequences and one-off lines are required.
