I remember Parker Posey's "As the World Changes" before he became the Queen of Independent Films. In this film, Posey shows his potential as a top-notch actor. In this film, with a supportive majority that includes Omar Townsend Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works on the street as a falafel seller who wants to become a teacher. Supporting light is a wonderful actor who plays with his grandmother and a relative of a unique family like Judy, an old-fashioned, dedicated and menopausal librarian. Posey when Mary learns she needs to grow and mature. The loss of her librarian's position understands how much she cannot do as her residence. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Village of New York. This movie is quite good and I have come to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary and other characters in other films.
