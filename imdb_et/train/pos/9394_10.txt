"Red Rock West" was by far one of the best 90's breakthrough thrillers with an excellent script (John and Rick Dahl) who probably kept you all over the place. It was superbly staged by John Dahl and there was a wonderful one, including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and especially J. T. Walsh (memorable performance) that made it a riveting and thrilling thriller. The film never had a lot of publicity when it came to publicity (actually I tried it on television first) and is therefore one of the special little gems you have to look for, but this unique film is slowly gaining a cult. <Br / Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams, who has broken and left work when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock. Unfortunately, the contract killer named Lyle Dallest was shocked to be offered $ 10,000 to murder the wife of the bar owner Wayne Brown (excellent Mr T. Walsh). He plays with the plan and decides that he should go and warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then the piece thickens and there are so many turns and surprises - and double relationships - that Cage is thrown out of one crisis and finds itself in a terrible trapped, he can't pull himself out! Then, just to make it even more complicated, the real Lyle is getting killed by the contract (which is played by all the heavy Dennis Hopper's favorite). When Hopper discovers what happened, he goes after Cage, but no one was able to see surprising events. <br /> <br /> Some of the favorite lines of the movie: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (Lara Flynn) Boyle: "I hate the innocent woman to get in but it's a lot of money". <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (for Cage): "Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you spend time with us until we get to the bottom". Boyle (for Cage): "You're not a killer?" Drill: "That's right, no. But the man I should just drive to get out of town". Boyle (for Cage): "OK How are you going to explain the incarnation of a hired killer and take $ 10,000 from my husband?". <br /> <br /> A tremendously fun little thriller (just 98 minutes) with a story that doesn't let and power the action of all principals. Every film containing J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and "Red Rock West" was one of his best. It was sad that this extraordinary actor career was tragically short in 1998 due to a heart attack. The most fertile period of "Film Noir" was undoubtedly the forties, but "Red Rock West" is a good contemporary example of the genre and has jumped directly into the list of my favorite film "Ten". I look forward to seeing more from Director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
