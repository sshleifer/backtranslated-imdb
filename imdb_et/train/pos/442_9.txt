That's what I call a growth film. Every character is different at the end and better - and all because one woman knows their chosen place is a "bath of love". Josie Lawrence, the most well-known comedienne, really looks like a woman who brings all these changes. Even the men of this film are going to become more self-righteous men. The book remained in the novel, which is a plus in my book because I am a librarian. Breathing the landscape and the message of love is real.
