It is said to be a very good "sequel" that is better than the first live movie 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all right! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has had some great care, is now a lover of dogs and very kind. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one dog whom Cruella never tried to kill, do not believe it. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (Option 2 Dog Shelter), believe he has changed. At the same time, Dipstick and his companions have given birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (fun Arabic), Glenn Close as Cruella himself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, name should give a hint) is a good family movie with excitement and more! One of the downsides of this movie is that it has a lot of painful strokes, but not as superfluous as the last movie. It's also more fun than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
