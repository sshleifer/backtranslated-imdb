The second channel 4 is very long before that time. Powerful action by Phil Davis and the rest of hope. Sexy, smart and funny. I remember watching it, and even when I asked, nobody had actually heard about it. But now it's the one who wants to find out who remembers it, even harder. Maybe Channel 4 does not work well enough when it rushes to the enthusiasm it needs. Is it or the public too interested in TV vomiting, which is Big Brother. I suspect the latter. Downloading Garth Merengie's Dark Place called Channel 4 the DVD of this series. We hope that the same can happen with North Square.
