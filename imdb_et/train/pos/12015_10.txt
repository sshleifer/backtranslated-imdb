First of all, this movie would be your typical western film, but it turned out to be very interesting and kept me very late, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston (Sam Burgade), "Midway", 76, had previous experience with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", 93, and Zach never gave Sam a forgiveness and stopped doing something to make sure he reached him and paid him back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), "Lady Portrait", "96" was able to grasp this situation and found herself out of sex with men who never knew her alone. Sam Burgade had to make very difficult decisions and I was quite surprised. This is a very fun movie and the actor was outstanding.
