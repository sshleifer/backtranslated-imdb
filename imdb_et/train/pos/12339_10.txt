Beloved Joan. Great performance. What is he not? I watched this movie and then Jane Eyre ... she just gets better. My heart was racing. Great old movie drama. That's what I want from a classic movie. Facials are worth the whole movie. I'm glad I have this video. Don't know what more you need in the movie. Beautiful woman .... broke ..... greed ..... murder ... detective ...... trial ..... <br /> <br /> Costumes are very nice. Makes me think about the budget for this movie? I wish they still made such films. Every time they try, they just look like a chewing film. Black and white films still have a certain secret.
