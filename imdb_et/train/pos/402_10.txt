I've seen Zu: Warriors Magic Mountain before. In this movie, it's in the Chinese mountains, Zu Legend looks like another dimension !! Thank you for using Tsui Hark's extensive CGI influence. He is capable of depicting his vision of the mountains floating above the clouds, the land where the creatures fly freely, and powers ranging from sharp sharp wings, shared swords, and ultra cool Moon Orb. <br /> <br /> Although there are many characters in it, the main focus is on King Sky and Enigma. The romance aspect exists, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes this movie worth watching. At first, I like how he resembles a Countess (Zu Warriors) and plays Enigma well when he's dealing with his past life. By the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very appealing to the eye? <br /> <br /> In fact, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and creates a new standard in the cinema.
