I've been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for years. This film is the best fantasy film of the years. I don't think "action" is the right genre, although there are many activities and KongFu scene. Wait, did I mention that it is ORIENTAL fantasy fashion? please remember don't use the hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the boy who goes around "poo", I'm not blaming you because you're still young and need to know more about "culture."
