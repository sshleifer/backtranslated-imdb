This very strange film is different from the time it was made in the West. In addition to its meaningless emotions and visions, dreams and amazing images, its impact is both beautiful and disturbing. The actors are choreographically more dances than the actors. It contains the only dream I know that it actually resembles a real nightmare (damage, Dali fans).
