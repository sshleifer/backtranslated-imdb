Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural gap between the local population and white people. Though filmed in a documentary style with seemingly non-professionals, Eskimo is a skilled production that includes a credible story that the audience wants to see in the final stroke. <br /> <br /> The mother tongue has just different beliefs and behaviors for women and life than whalers who darken their landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his partner, it is natural that other men share their wives with their friends. It is also common for their women to want to go to a missing spouse. All this seems natural when it comes to destructive Arctic law. A trusted Eskimo falls on shameful white whale species (with heavy European accents) who do not see these natives as equal. Fraud, drunkenness, rape, and death arise after the Eskimo men stay in the cold cold sea. Finally, the leader Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been deceived and takes revenge. Audiences would have enjoyed the theaters of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Enter the Canadian Royal Police and the moral dilemma of returning Mala. Mounties are played as a feeling of police officers who know that it is not cut and dry. Do mountains get their husband? Is it fair to keep Mala's Code of Conduct outside its traditional society? Is there a way out that Mala does not punish? Is it inevitable that the white man's law must prevail? Is there no hope of innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but what you enjoy about the depth of the issue, which is very different. I suspect that filming the sequences with the animals took place before the disclaimer today, that no one could be injured in making the film - so beware of the raw nature sequences. Highly recommended.
