Just looking at it after my mother brought back from America back to me, she was afraid of it after watching all the negative comments here, but I have to say, yes, the actor is cheesy, some of the consequences are ridiculous. <br /> <br Aga> You have to remember that it was supposed to be 1898, not 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I've read the book so many times and found myself "ahh yes, what is in the book" almost all the time, with the second version hardly a book. <br /> <br /> So well done at least try the real version.
