I am a fan of television cameras in general and it was one of the good ones. Cast performances were all pretty strong and there were twists and turns that I didn't see before each trade. It seemed to me that Medium met CSI. <br /> <br /> Did anyone else think that the daughter of a young Nicole Kidman seemed on certain lights? Are they somehow related? I would definitely watch it or rent it when it ever goes to the video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. She hasn't seen her much in things, and she did her job very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you're in a TV mystery movie, check if you have the opportunity.
