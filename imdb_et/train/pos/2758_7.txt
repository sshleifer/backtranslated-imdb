This film is about unlikely friendship between a down syndrome businessman and a man. <br /> <br /> The character of this movie is great. We believe Harry is a businessman who ignores his family, and Georges is an innocent man who desires a loving and caring "normal" society. It's a great activity and the best actor award for Cannes is deserved. <br /> <br /> The movie's fantasy scenes highlight the fact that Georges is plagued by his family's abandonment and the desire to be treated like a normal person. This message is also reinforced by the repeated song. The film shows that people with mental disabilities are good. We have dealt with them by discriminated against and neglected by the scene where Georges gives a gift to the kitchen speaker. When we understand and share the world of these people, we and people with intellectual disabilities can be very happy. <br /> <br /> I was drawn to both the film and the emotional experiences of the characters. This is a touching film for good souls.
