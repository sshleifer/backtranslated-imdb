**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** True <br /> <br /> * Bad <br /> <br /> Go ahead, do my day! <br /> <br /> The fourth picture in the series is run by Eastwood himself (who was proclaimed for most Magnum Force leadership) and brings the first two films back to a violent society. But the film still has no effect and credibility. This film appeared in the early 80s, during the time of Regan and the young Republicans. The rape of the woman who rape the rape assumes that her rape is punished. This plot would have been better for Enforcer, which would actually have made it a good movie. What a sudden impact was on Wall Street, but in the middle of Dirty Harry. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars
