From time to time, there is a film that raises the bar of every other movie in its genre. The film with this caliber will affect many movies after it is released in the coming years. This category includes "Chinese Ghost Story". It is undoubtedly one of the best horror effects of the 1980s; perhaps one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have created a film that invites all the spooky fans. The story is tempting and original. Rodents are threatening and intimidating enough. Sets are creepy and atmospheric. There is even a small blood and gore to satisfy the house's rust fan. But don't be frightened by the horror label if you are not a fan of the genre. This movie is easily suited to many different categories. <br /> <br /> The scene has been confused by the genres of drama, comedy, horror, kung fu, and romance for a delicious cinematic pizza. The "Chinese Ghost Story" is a beautiful epic love story, fortunately, free of nudity and / or explicit sexual scenes that have destroyed many Hollywood love stories. Those who are dragged by the romantic elements of the story can sit and enjoy the fast paced and "wire-fu". If that is not enough, the actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma offer enough humorous situations to satisfy your comedy appetite. This movie offers something for every movie fan. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark gathered a truly amazing cast for this movie. Leslie Cheung proves that she is not only a talented actor, but also a talented singer and a charming natural comedian. I can't think of any other speaker other than Cheung who might have better portrayed Ling Choi Sin (except perhaps Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is enchanting like Lit Your Seen, a enslaved spirit who steals Cheung's character. His portrayal of the character character is really haunting and memorable. Wu I am fun when helping young lovers dancing taoist. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, this film is very impressive even with today's standards. The direction is great. I want today's Hollywood leaders to look for talented artists, such as Siu-Tung Ching, to return to traditional MTV videos or Pepsi commercial directors. Cinematography is great. You must recognize every cinematographer who can make a movie when most of its central scene takes place at night. Special Effects Makeup is top notch. In fact, most of the creature effects of this film have been disrupted by shameful CGI ghouls and goblins, which have become commonplace in today's horror movies. <br /> <br /> Since its release, "Chinese Ghost Story" has created two values ​​of after-effects, full-length animated film and countless imitations. None of the movies that followed or copied were able to capture the magic of this classic. This movie needs to be seen by any spooky fan or just for anyone looking for a good opportunity to spend 95 minutes. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
