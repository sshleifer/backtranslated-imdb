Particularly tense thriller set in Brazilian urbanias, the largest and worst nightmare of São Paulo in the Third World Nightmare. In order to make it interesting and curious about a really well-made film, this Mexican feature is "Amores Perros", whose character is not so far from Max Cad, both of Cape Fears, although it is in no way a film of psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in the construction company Anisio (Miklos) pay a third partner (and a majority shareholder) in the said construction equipment. The murder has been accused in the city, but things are starting to look very serious when the witty and charismatic walk Anisio decides that he wants to be among the more nervous criminal partners, not only crossing, but more importantly, deconstructing strict social codes that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and she wants to go in. Appearance is almost entirely handheld, grainy and prominent, especially as a first-time actor (and classic Brazilian pop band Titãs) Paulo Miklos viewer with his pretty funny social terror. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on the Brasília movie in November 2001.
