This film has the most beautiful open sequence. I've seen this movie for the first time a week since I see every day opening and every time I feel so excited when I first heard David Niven, who preached the mortal words about the pilgrimage of Sir Walter Raleigh. <br /> <br /> Give me my scallop, my faith workers to walk, my joy, the immortal diet, my holy rescue bottle, my glory dress, the true gage of hope; So I'll take my pilgrimage (??). <br /> <br /> Do you know why truism would say that the life of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger is well founded for such a wonderful opening? Because they had already been given to the poets before they made the film. <br /> <br /> I imagine that both will meet in court during Doomsday and say they are godless: I ask for your grace, Sir. Do you want to know what we've done in our lifetime? Well, you see: We've written and produced: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, red shoes? Do you think enough sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their obligation to God, the Museum of Nature, or whatever you could name it when they made a question of life and death. The fact that other people's lives would be justified in their actions may not be visible to everyone, although I feel that my life has meaning if I never did anything else to see that movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, old times are tempted to say: they don't make such movies anymore. They're partly wrong; they didn't make such films in the past. <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Keats, but I repeat my words: beauty is forever joy.
