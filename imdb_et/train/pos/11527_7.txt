Miriam Hopkins is the "Red Lady Lady" in the 1940 Leslie Carter Biopolis, which also celebrates Claude Rains as David Belascot, Richard Ainley Lou Payne and fine cast supporters including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give great performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actor who makes us feel like Mrs Carter. Rainfall is great as an exclusive, selfish producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the great theater names. <br /> <br /> While Mrs Carter's second wife, Lou Payne, was an advisor to this film, this is a bad performance of the real events of Mrs Carter. True, there was a much publicized and bitter divorce, and he was undoubtedly regarded as a scandalous character and actor. But he had a son in Dudley's custody, so there was no custody there. When he broke with Belasco, he didn't return to him and actually started working in Vaudeville and made some films at the end of his movie. She really got married to Lou and became her leading person in many productions. <br /> <br /> Ms. Carter's motive power at the beginning of this film restores her son's custody, but eventually she understands that her time is away from her, she is deeply involved with her father. Also in the film (and I'm not sure if this is true in real life), she traveled with her mother and lived in a theater residence that gives the film some interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not a Carter or Belasco size. One of Mrs Carter's most famous moments was at the heart of Maryland, where she wore a six-foot stroke. The non-staged fans blew their hair when he hung at a height of 35 meters behind the stage, stapling the center of the clock to keep it ringing. Pretty visual.
