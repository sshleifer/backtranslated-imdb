Ideal for kids trying to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and violates the rights of existence. The boy, inspired by Martin Luther King, rises and speaks the truth. A family that breaks down and fights against it. A movie that can't be hidden. You see things and you hear things, and you know things that you hope to have never really happened until the day of death. Violence, disappointment, abuse of power, parents who can't do anything, and boy, I'm sorry, balls, boy who doesn't accept things that won't let him happen, child with violence and boy who acts like a pro like him he has never done anything else, he does it to the end of the movie and anyone who wants to see how abuses were found back in the 1960s.
