Peter O'Toole is affectionate to look at roles where the line he is talking about is good and gives him the chance to get drunk. Lovely Susannah York gives a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence. <br /> <br /> The film refers to an incest - without one explicit scene - but it can entertain the viewer in his fun social commentary. Although this is not a big movie with any kind of record, it is remembered for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a pity that I watched the tragedy. The possible weakness here is the Thompson reverse direction. But the film tends to be driven by actors and the script. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie twenty years in 20 years - both times called "Brotherly Love". "Country Dance" is a rather far-reaching and inappropriate title for this film, no matter where it was issued.
