After being forced to sit through the real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". Once, I didn't think the end! It was funny and entertaining and didn't use a lot of gross humor despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) so LOVED it too - oh and my 45-year-old "boy" smiled on his face all the time. This is a family film that is not only acceptable to parents. Relationship with a brother is so close to real life. "He didn't stop the song, but it irritates me!" Also, how a new child tries to make friends and how these friendships actually make up is the right way for kids to behave. Of course, parents have to act with little fun - but my favorite scenes were related to my father's getting used to his new job. Have fun!
