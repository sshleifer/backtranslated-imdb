How the Grinch Stole Christmas stole my heart instantly and my favorite film almost from my first look. Now, after eight views, it has the same effect for me as I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Scenarists Jeffery Price & Peter S. The sailor who drew Roger Rabbit's fame is doing a fantastic job of customizing the Grinch story. Ron Howard's direction led to a full life and Jim Carrey's typical energetic power as Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some movie detectors have argued that this is not the right original story. Having read the original story, I have to say that I cannot accept it. The film changes the same meaning of Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Indeed, it increases the impact of the story, making it more personal, showing us how and why Grinch got what it was. ... but if you haven't seen it yet and you are one of those who want to know something until you see it, you have to miss the next two points.) <br /> <br /> I think almost anyone can to be connected to Grinch's terrible experience at school. I think we all, at one time or another, were unpopular in the school that was always chosen. I know I was ... and that is why I personally had so much sympathy for Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou Who is naive idealism, believing that no one can be bad, was heart-rending. When everyone else had turned Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou decided to be his friend. If everyone had such an attitude, I think that the only thing that would have made the film a little better would have been to further emphasize the humor and content of adults. It was already quite restrained, but this adult humor (like when Grinch first hit Marta May in Whovier's splitting) just doesn't fit into such a story. <br /> <br /> This is a great opportunity to be a Christmas classic by having a book and a richly-earned place on Chuck Jones, which is the black vision of every Christmas season.
