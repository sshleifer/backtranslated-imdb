I totally agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I didn't laugh as much as watching a movie age! David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are great at this! they really work well together! This movie may not remember some people (I really can't say why it was broken!), But everyone has it! I loved it and suggested it very much! <br /> <br /> Management is great and some shots are very clever. They seem to have had a lot of fun during filming! <br /> <br /> Although the movie really has only 2 main characters and no terrible props, the participants can pull it out and make the movie enjoyable.
