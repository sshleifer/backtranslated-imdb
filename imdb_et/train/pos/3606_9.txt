I really enjoyed Girl Fight. What I would look at again and again. The actor was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film. Very convincing could be said. The film shows how women should keep alive. At the same time, he had so much compassion and much more hatred. Dealing with the unknown father didn't help him much. Even if he loved him, he was very angry. His mother died when he was younger. The love story was the part I really enjoyed in the movie. I felt the passion y was against each other. Then the drama will be reinstated and then he will choose between his boy and his lifetime dream. I thought it ended right. It was the end where you have to decide what happened to them in the future. For all people who like a movie based on good plot sports, I suggest you check it out.
