For years I have been looking for a copy of this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs) so I can show it to my kids. The movie is funny and Spike and his band members show why they were the best musicians in the company. They had to play it demented. I like it and recommend it to film students of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film is about a century of fire with a team of firefighters and departments (if they don't fight fires). ). There are regular races, as well as Spike Jones and his orchestra. Comedy relief by comedian Buddy Hackett and comedy Hugh O'Brien.
