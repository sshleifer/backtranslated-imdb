Together with Darkwing Duck, this is unjustly canceled. Disney has fallen from Tarzan ever since and we need an exhibition to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were ideal for Louis and Baloo's voices (familiar?) The theme theme of tune is also memorable. Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn from all the roses, all of which are excellent. Louis and Baloo actually sound very similar to the voice of the jungle book, which is not at all bad. In fact, it's quite inspiring! The animation was on the ground and the script had a lot of nonsense, which has been bad for animations for years. PLEASE FOLLOW THIS SHOW! 9/10 Bethany Cox
