What a captain. Take the Cold War conflict and transport it to the future. This film is satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion, this is expressed by dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> Wise naming of both superpowers, Confederations and markets. Cons are commies and market, west! outstanding. The intelligent use of Gen Jox was ahead of that time. only we can really see the dangers of gene technology. Robot joxs dealt with this problem in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message of this movie is the humble man's comrades and how it can overcome the wishes of the government. These films are screaming DON'T EVERYTHING VERY MOST. <br /> <br /> TEMPORARY 10/10
