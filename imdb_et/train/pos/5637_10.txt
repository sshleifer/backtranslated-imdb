I'd just like to say I've seen this movie twice and I love it! Action is great and although it's a similar plot to "Raise Your Voice", I think the plot is never boring for people who like this kind of thing. It has some great lessons and shows us that we can do something when we try. Incredible movie. I'm sure this is the one I look at for a long time. Although Britney Spears writes a book, this is a pretty realistic plot, perhaps not a love piece, but some of it being different and fighting, but ultimately the best, is really right for real life. The only small criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful? Do you really think Holly would have met the perfect man of his dreams if he was ugly or average? I doubt this ..
