I saw this movie for the first time 3 years ago and was then introduced by Disney's head Eisner and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago it came on TV and this time I recorded it. Since then, I have to monitor it at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, inspiring and good film that has been intelligently written and credibly acted upon by all involved. This contradicts both the sentimental tricks of the book and all other clich√©s. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see a movie where children do not pull and have a healthy behavioral problem and jocks have not represented a testosterone-driven muscle head. <br /> <br /> These are just normal people with dreams of you and I. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood's lost extremity, which they understand as "sharp realism", is made up of films that everybody is struggling with, and who have problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a man who has a dream and encourages friends and family to continue this dream. Big Lake TX people seem so calm that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said in b4, the film does not try to go overboard with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never loses. I was looking at him in the late 70s, and he is so underestimated. <br /> <br /> But this movie has amazing EVERYONE performances and a bow to writers. <br /> <br /> Gem in the movie is almost over when Jim is practicing in the mine before the big game, and his wife calls him to stand. He radiates and reaches his family. The three bowls that sit on the seat on the seat are unpredictable. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a speed change, pick this movie up.
