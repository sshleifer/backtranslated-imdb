I loved this example. I looked at it from the time he first incited the last episode in the late 90s. I honestly thought it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely an exhibition that you could watch with a friend or your children. Yes, things have changed a little with Joe because we saw him in the last books, but it's still with great stories and good lessons. An actor depicting Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a wonderful job as an actor playing Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort) Throughout the series, we see the evolving romance between Jo and Nick as well as the daily stories and lessons learned by children and students. I suggest you show it to someone.
