Disney has done it again. An excellent way to revive Timone and Pumbaa to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when they needed them. I love this movie and watch it over and over again. This shows how Timone lived with her family and her family before finding her home of home and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things are changing. Together they are looking for a home that Timon wants and repeatedly fails, which is funny when Timone gets worse. Then Simba appears and we see more in our childhood than in the previous two films. The rest, you already know.
