I don't think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was so funny. I haven't laughed at this movie for a long time. I thought the whole job was a big job. You'll find yourself laughing from the first moment through the last scene. I suspect that some humor players (especially those who take themselves too seriously) will turn off this sense of humor. Not me. The film was a real surprise. And the whole theater ran with a laugh at the show, which made me think that many people enjoyed themselves and were happy to spend time in the movies for change. I can't wait to see it again! If you're in LOL's mood, it's for you. Funny funny funny funny!
