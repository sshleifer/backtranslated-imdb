We saw it in one of the local art venues in the Houston, TX Montrose area. It was a total surprise compared to the news articles from the theater, but we both refused. It was a beautifully made and (probably) photographed Schloss (German name ch√¢teau) somewhere in the Munich area. This is a very explicit study of twenty male and female group sexual relationships, separated from everyday constraints. It's awesome at more levels than I remember. After the movie we came home and talked and talked about 4.00 in the morning. <br /> <br /> We saw the English version (mostly), so at least two versions must be available from the first reviewer. movie (probably its original) in german version. I was looking for and looking for a video tape version but never came up with anything. I would definitely like to have a VHS or DVD version. It explores relationships at the core level and is also a great tutorial on how to communicate with your partner. If someone knows the writer / director, convince him / her to release it again, preferably on a DVD these days. I can't even imagine being tired of looking at the real performance of the actors who are probably all their forties now. Please, bring it back.
