I remember this movie, which was shown several years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. Several years later, I see it again and head over to the crushed heels of that movie. The story of the movie is exciting and in itself. The cast makes it more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely up in this game. She counts Mrs Chamberlain's motives, accents and even looks. She shows pain, hurt, surprise and anger that Lindy had to endure, and it's hard to remember that it's not Lindy. In my opinion, this Meryl performance was better than his Oscar winning "Sophie's Choice", and he would have held his third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain and for some surprising reason the Academy did not recognize it at least with the candidate. All in all, this film receives only one Oscar note (Streep's best actor.) However, he received a number of Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a top-notch film: it tells a great story and gets great performances from all the pain.
