I have to say that from the start when I watched a Stargate movie that I wasn't blown, or something that was like an average sci fi movie with a lot of POTENTIAL, although the movie wasn't so, erm, amazing like other sci fi movies like Star Wars or aliens who, if u are a sci fi fanatic, admit that one of these two titers is amazing, though I'm not as hardcore a sci fi fan as some people, I remember one line of one of those movies, I'm not big fans who wear star wars T-shirts, in fact, when you saw me, I'd see you a normal person, ah, a little off this point, well my point is that what you don't have to be a sci-fi fan who likes this big series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons, the quality of which did not fall closer to the end of 2006. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't like the movie a lot, I was quite waiting for the first season in 1997 and let me tell you that the special effects were just one of those Illiant things from the series, the chemistry between the characters just flew me out of special effects, were as good as not better than most of today's sci fi shows. I have to admit that I would never have gone to sci fi if it wasn't a stargate, and my father who got to sci fi when I was 6 years old, and I'm glad he did, my intelligent didn't see the brilliant exhibitions like SG1, which in my opinion now set the benchmark for almost all sci fi series and movies, basically, if the new sci fi series is not better or as good as the SG1, it is not worth it. Basically, this is still the best sci fi show, and if you don't see it, you have no idea what you're missing!
