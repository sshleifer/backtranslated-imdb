I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I work with an acute care institution. Over the years, I've seen people die of haemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, have been involved in numerous conferences on blood-borne pathogens, and have seen many patients due to pathogens that are severely affected by blood transfusions. I have also heard several Jehovah's Witnesses say that they are dying when they refuse blood, and after 26 years in the area where I have never seen it, leaving the question "Is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is this community great, who will benefit from this? ‚ÄùThe question of Jehovah's Witnesses is moral. "You must avoid blood" is not an ambiguous statement. Thank you for this movie and let me comment on it.
