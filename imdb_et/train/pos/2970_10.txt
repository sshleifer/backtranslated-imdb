I thought Baseketball was one of the most fun movies I've ever seen! This is a funny humor that made me upset and the fact that Trey and Matt are so uplifted the comedy of the film. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD and just one of those movies where you would never watch it. I have a very short attention and I think this movie has such funny bits that it attracts me with all the entertainment. Humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours when I remember them later. I, because it keeps you laughing for a long time. <br /> <br /> P.s does anyone think they like me strange? hehe
