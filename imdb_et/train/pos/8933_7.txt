Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that the film does not have to tell the story that it is enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and do what they want. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the idea of ​​the most non-linear movie is that of an older man living on the French-Swiss border, a man who is dedicated to his dogs who still have a lover, but whose heart status is increasingly threatening his life. He has a son with a small family who rarely meets him, but when he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he decides to go through Japan to Tahiti to get a heart transplant on the black market and revive a long lost relationship with his son Tahitian women years ago. <br /> <br /> What Denis describes this story uses his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the size of nature, human interaction with humans, and animals, and so on. Much of the time when the film doesn't make sense, but it's because we're trying too much to combine all the points we have in beautiful pictures. Life is such: we look, see, follow, integrate, process and do what we do. <br /> <br /> Using this film-making form (as he did strangely beautiful). "Beau Travail") Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Does the viewer find that the payout of the final product is much related to our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual data. This is an interesting and visually fascinating film, but many viewers find it too long to be a discourse. Maybe it will change the view again. Grady Harp
