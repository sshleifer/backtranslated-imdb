This is a nice little nightmare that fans of indie films really appreciate. It has a good actor, a lot of gore and a good plot. One is reminded of movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget was not all that great, but the film really brings it into the atmosphere with the strong performances of the actors, which seems to be inadequate in many films filled with the special effects of today's big budgets. The movie is really moving and there is a great direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the movie is a bit short. In addition, it seems that the ending is a sequel that would be very interesting. So grab some popcorns, turn the lights down and enjoy it.
