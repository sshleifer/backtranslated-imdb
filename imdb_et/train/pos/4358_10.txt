Okay, this movie probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted with "10" to help compensate for the misleading assessment of a handful of bozo who gave this movie to zero or a 1-star comment. Each segment of this anthology shows great potential and promise for talented filmmakers, three of whom have made significant progress in the great Hollywood productions. Performances range from harsh to completely impressive, with outstanding performances by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove may be a great melodramatic because a psychotic hypnotist with a bizarro strobe lamp, and Lance August, will deliberately fail without sacrifice. But in general it is a very big laughter and some really frightening moments. Definitely worth seeing, so judge yourself!
