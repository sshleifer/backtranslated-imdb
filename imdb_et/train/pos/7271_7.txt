Writer / director John Hughes covered all the bases (as usual) with this bitter sweet "Sunday afternoon". "Curly Sue" is a sweet, early orphan cared for by "Bill". The couple lives on their way of thinking as they travel because the great US Fate in the US meets the "very beautiful" yuppie lawyer and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Kids love this movie-related heroine, played by 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who went to Pepsi's "you go"). The character should be about 6 or 7 because it is invited to think about going to school. Some of his vocabulary suggest that he is 9 years old or older. <br /> <br /> Like "Home Alone", there are many dirty and small fists that are big fat fats. Again, this is a "formula" film making directed at a young audience. Entertaining and heart warming. Don't look for surprises, but be prepared for tears or two.
