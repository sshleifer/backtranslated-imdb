This game was really a big and quite big challenge. It's a big, spooky story and the graphics are also very good. I recommend this game to all Horror fans and is very engaging from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I would have wanted more weapons but just me. <br /> <br /> A really great game for RPG and Shoot'em'up fans. <br /> <br />>
