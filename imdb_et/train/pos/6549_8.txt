The collection of old stories is a challenge for the production team, how to update this classic character and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience when it interferes with its former audience. In my opinion, their mission was fulfilled. Must see young children, pre-teens, teenagers and their parents. OK is a couple of frightening moments that will be solved in a short order, but parents with small children should sit tight, the film moves to better things. I'm going to go with those smart users reviewers who emphasize that Emma Roberts is giving us a positive example for young women, not a syrup. Nancy balances her femininity with career opportunities. A lot to enjoy here, laughs, not taking too seriously, solving a real solution (one can understand extra bonus and nice characters. Nancy Drew also thinks I'm a good date.
