I call this and BABYLON the 5 best television sci-fi series. Both stand out in my mind because, unlike the early STAR TREK series, the plots and marks have consistently evolved. When you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, they were beautiful, but there was no general theme or plot that united all the episodes. In many ways, you can usually look at the samples in a consistent manner without having to understand what is happening. It was less for DEEP SPACE 9 (with its gigantic battles that took over the last season) and other TREK exhibitions because there was more of a bigger story that united them. This unity seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw it even more with SG-1. The bottom line is that this series was in many ways like family viewing or a long-term novel. Of course, there were some "thrown" episodes that were not related to the rest, but they were very small and far away and were usually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Speaking funny, I loved this SG -1 from time to time to keep the mood light and not so terribly serious. In this way, I enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and Homer Simpson's love - it's really too bad when he slowly disappeared from later series. To really evaluate SG-1, you should look at it from the beginning and see how complicated the plots work. This coherence gives the exhibition extraordinary strength. And if you don't like SG-1 after giving a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably not a genre for you.
