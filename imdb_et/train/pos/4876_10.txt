I don't know why some men from the USA, Georgia or even Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don't understand at all. For those who haven't watched this movie - look at it. Don't expect too much or don't put some frameworks just because it's Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor - Serbian people DID actually get married when Bil Clinton bombs his villages, gypsies in all Balkans always try F * ck as they are, LOVE is always unexpected, clean and colorful, and the Balkans are extreme creative. For those who claim to be a bad film, I can only see that American sh * t (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) is much worse than a pure, sincere Balkan humorous love story, like a promise. The comment should be useful, and second, to represent the writer's personal view. I think the film is great and people look to it to pay tribute to the director and what has been said in the interior. It's simple, but true. It's brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh.
