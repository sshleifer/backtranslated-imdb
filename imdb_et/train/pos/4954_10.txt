A big, funny, sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and meets a small shop with Spanish girl Scarlet (Paz Vega), exploring a possible independent film. I was a little suspicious about the film in the first ten minutes, but as soon as she was in the store, I started enjoying the movie. This shows how a positive attitude can change something. It does not contain complicated parcels and is easy to follow, but it raises the saddest moods and changes the smile all the time without the romance of a small clich√©. It contains a number of scenes that will make you laugh at your side. Very rare masterpiece!
