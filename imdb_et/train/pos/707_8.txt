Must be honest and say I haven't seen many independent movies, but I thought it was very well done. Direction and cinematography were without interference. The angles, settings, and lighting that were used successfully created a spooky world where the protagonist was trapped. Many haunting and memorable pictures of the film will remain in your mind long after it is over (always a good director's mark).
