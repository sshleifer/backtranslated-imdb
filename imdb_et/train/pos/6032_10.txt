Antonion really showed some "coyons" when he had this movie. He went to America, who, according to the contract, worked in the most abundant studio (MGM) and made a portrait of the most sought after American society. Having seen the first hand of LA, this is the most accurate picture of an overcrowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonion had met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The next shot in the studio is understandable, after such a strong investment and a depressing return. It's sad that people don't see this movie anymore because I believe Antonion has been right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is more interested in what goes into their pockets and the relentless expansion of the dwelling into an unpleasant (yet beautiful) desert and beyond. How would I love to see interest in this movie and proud of the DVD release. <br /> <br /> I ask people to look at Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique film that comments on the turning point in the history of the planet's most powerful nation, and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> Unexpected Pearl.
