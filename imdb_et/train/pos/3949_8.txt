Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once when it first appeared on television in 1971. Certain scenes remain in my memory and the general feeling of anxiety is how I remember it. If I had ever made it available for a home video, I'd have it interesting again. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler: I don't know if anyone else would agree that basic plot settings and characters could have been derived from the 1960s British film, originally titled "The City of the Dead", unveiled the Horror Hotel to unleash America ? There are also some similarities with the later British film The Wicker Man. One detail remains with me for a year after seeing the film. It's a small but important moment in the beginning of the movie. I remember that the minister and his wife have stopped to help some people along the road, around 1870, somewhere in the west. Friendly seeming Ray Milland introduces himself and his (daughter?), A beautiful young mute woman Yvette Mimieux. While the preacher helps Ray Milland wagon rattlesnake sliders to watch and rolls dangerously, which does not mean any character except Yvette Mimieux. He doesn't even look scared, but looks at a tacit snake until it goes away. With this strange little moment we realize that there is something very unusual about these seemingly normal people, although the potential threat to the minister and his wife has long been vague and uncertain. <br /> <br /> This one little scene with all the other years will be lively with me all these years. The film has a strange quality that doesn't let it go, and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone should make it available for home video!
