Unborn is a very different film. The movie is James Karen & Brooke Adams and they worked quite well. this movie is gathering firmly and it keeps you going. Although I think you have to be a fan of fear because of the scenes and the plot. There is one short sex community that has no nudity that could have been left out, and for some people this scene may be disappointed by someone like me, what is on the film and thinks stuff will destroy a good movie, but that's when it comes to it. There's a scene where the Adams character goes into the nuts and kills the cat, but you can't say it real. The music is very different, but very good. Unborn in My Opinion is really a horrible movie that is wonderfully unpredictable and it's pretty strange! I recommend this movie to all the horror fans!
