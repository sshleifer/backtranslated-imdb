This film was a fascinating look at the Creole culture and society that some African Americans are aware of. My two children are my father's grandmother, whose father was a gens de couleur and a black woman whose parents were former slaves by product. He married outside his own culture and against him and was cut off from his entire family except one sister who regretted the situation of his brothers; Growing up 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; supplying the family with food if it can. Of course, he helped to fear this family for his former communication. My daughter was fascinated by the film. We're part of our library.
