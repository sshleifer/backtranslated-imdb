I just saw this movie and loved it. Everyone has a little bit of something and it's especially free for everyone when it comes to romance between Lachlan and Lili. When they are on the beach, I almost cried ... it is an inexplicable understanding that time is the most valuable commodity and it is most obvious when they are together. This idea was taken from a number of perspectives, from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least common places. The film puts you in almost the same despair when you know that tomorrow could be your last one. Crowe was particularly wonderful in the role of Lachlan. I've always had a soft spot for accent, but I almost melted my character. This movie is also beautiful, with music, open-field backgrounds and a wonderful act. All in all, this is a wonderful film that draws people's emotions at all.
