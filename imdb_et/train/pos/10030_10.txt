What is inexplicable? First of all, hate this movie. It may not be the biggest movie of all time, but the break, it got 11 big reasons, caused eighty thousand coins. It's a fucking good movie. What brings this second inexplicable aspect. I have no idea why this film impressed me when I saw it in theaters. I've reviewed it on TV and video, and it had no effect on the big screen (twice or actually three times). But it may be, its appeal. It's a movie, yes, capital M, it's epic, it's speculation about the wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem to me with hammy and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic doesn't have it. Well, the actor was really very good. Melodrama was quite difficult at times. <br /> <br /> But the reason Titanic works is that it is such an emotional journey. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate or give me visual excitement. This movie is not quite stupid, but it is not the brain at all. Visual excitement simply means ending the audience with emotions. I did not call when Bambi's mother died, I do not respond to tearcrumbs. But it is a tear of ten million power, an emotional rider that if it were normal, Buzz Aldrin screams like a little girl. And I'm sure if you see it on the video and you've decided that you hate it and you're ready to offer cynicism, you can't really feel that movie. But if you let this incredible stop somehow, if you give this epic melodrama doubt, you will enjoy it completely. And watch the ten strongest films of all time. Is one of them bad? Is one of them worth 10 out of 10? No, not even Phantom's risk. And this movie made $ 1.8 billion worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10. <br /> <br /> p.s. how can anyone even consider spiderman? Spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total of 9/11 kneejerk, which caused it as much as he did. it was just nothing special. nobody remembers it in 50 years. but I'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.
