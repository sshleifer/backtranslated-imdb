Bette Davis turns cold with an amusing performance like Mildred Rogers in this 1934 movie. The film seems to be dated in 2003. There is no doubt that fans of the film fans and Bette Davis are worth seeing, but it may not have so many complaints for the average filmmaker today. I was surprised to see how young Mrs Davis is looking at this step. The actors turn to a performance that is basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is in good shape as Philip Carey, a club driver. It is a film that has a strong message about who we love and why. However, "Of Human Bondage" did not seem to have a strong mental or emotional effect on me. I felt a bit intermediate and left the movie after watching it. I have the intuition that this may be the reaction that the director led. You're a judge! <br /> <br />
