As a baseball, this film contradicts what I expect in a sports film: authentic sporty-looking activities, plausible characters, and original story. Although "Angels in Outfield" fails in the first category, it succeeds nicely in the last two times. "Angels" is a story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim children who love baseball, but are looking for a family that is a woebegone on the Angels franchise who is trying to lead fans and win games. Roger asks for his deadly father's promise to be a family only when angels win a pennant, Roger asks for some heavenly help and becomes the diamond-living spirits bent over to turn the franchise downward spiral. And when George Knox, a short thawed director (depicted by Danny Glover), starts believing what Roger sees, the team suddenly has the hope of reversing their season - and Roger and JP will find something to believe. Glover gives a very nice Tony Danza, who plays the washed jug, well, despite the clear idea of ​​how to bring out the ZERO idea!
