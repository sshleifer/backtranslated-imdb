I got this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I was waiting very much for it to arrive. My worst fears were that it would be tiring, but ... you know what all the screaming fans were dancing? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? Such thing? Scaring. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly observable, even when filming and music felt that someone was going to pawn each two scenes and Gackt's participation was pretty good. Hyde, being Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend / gang member, so anyone who saw her on stage was hardly surprised. She's one of my two big beef herself in the movie. But the rest of the (including the opening of the child's actors) were very good at doing what they did, mostly fired and screaming. But my second problem was very small in terms of gorillus. It seemed too intense to me, like any scene where someone has shot, they either fall over, really sincerely died, or put on it for quite some time. But Sho just ... takes shots, repeatedly, speaks, beats LOT when he speaks, and makes Hyde cry. All in all, if you're an actor or just a fan of j-film, it's definitely worth it.
