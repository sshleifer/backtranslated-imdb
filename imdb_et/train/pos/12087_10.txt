I took the opportunity for "Hardcastle and McCormick" by purchasing the Amazon season's first season (Canadian version). When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I immediately stopped. I rated it with 5 stars on Amazon and I appreciate it with 10 stars here. It's just so good. I liked the opening and closing issues and, of course, Stephen J. Cannell's logo at the end of each episode, but above all the relationship between judge and Mark when they worked together to break each case. I was so hooked that I bought another season companion and I enjoyed it equally. If you don't have this good on the series disc, I believe you should buy it and put it in your collection.
