Magic works mysteriously. This film, which contains about four prisoners, attempting to escape with the incantations written by another prisoner, was an excellent occult thriller for centuries, with a surprising end and a lot of intercourse. Even if he had something in the theater (almost everything happens in the cell), it was never boring and it worked very well. In the "Cube" tradition, they felt trapped with characters, and even when they were criminals, some compassion for some of them arose, but changed the way they think. Some events took you off the guard and there was always a touch in the air. All in all, it was intense and fun, and since I didn't expect anything (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!
