I am embarrassed to say that when I was in theaters, I stayed between the "mother". I saw it on DVD tonight. I gave her 10 votes, one of the few I gave here. This independent English language is filmed so carefully and with high quality. It pulled me relentlessly. The low key and purely human story is brutally honest and completely absorbing, thanks to Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The film is stunning. The result is difficult on the plot. The story is epic, perfectly dressed by the writer Hanif Kureish in everyday life. This story deals with big questions about the finesse of impressionist painting. And some of these great questions are very controversial, which probably explains that despite many candidates, they have won awards. It's just one of my favorite films of all time.
