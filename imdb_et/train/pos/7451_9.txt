Here is one that the whole family enjoys ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall surpassed all of the most popular fairy tales of this unique, imaginative childhood. Scripts offer new twists to old old fables that have grown up and have a handful of stars in every episode. "Cinderella" is not an exception to the Duvall standard, and I think it is one of the top five of Jennifer Beals's highlighted series (remember her "Flashdance" - and she's still here and there in Hollywood today), Jean Stapleton as a fairy tale with a southern accent and Eve Arden, who is the embodiment of God's stepmother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Out") and Jane Alden make a cheerful duo as a sister. Matthew Broderick is a peaceful Prince Henry. You all come back to it!
