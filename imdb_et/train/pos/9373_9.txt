Like many of you, I'm a big fan of the real thing - Noir films from the 1940s, but Red Rock West was a longing for the longing for the past. The term "neo-noir" has been used so often in the past ten years inappropriately because it has lost its meaning and effect. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserved to describe it. Casting is perfect and would have felt at home with Tay Garnetti or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so dense that you are hooked within fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many modern movies encourage me to ask why they don't do them the way they were, and I'm not even that old. Movies like Red Rock West give us hope for the future, respecting the past.
