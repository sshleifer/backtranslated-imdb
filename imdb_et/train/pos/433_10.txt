It is one of those rare films, it is a lovely and convincing, dignified and original, real gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy or any vacation, because it reminds you to open yourself to a wider experience (yes, look for magic). I especially loved Josie Lawrent, like Lottie Wilkins, but every leader and supportive actor in this movie is flawless. Next, the costumes, if you have taken fashion and costume, are exceptionally well done. I just want them to release it on a DVD because I carry my tape version out! <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth your time, just make sure you look at it without interruption.
