I am Jane Eyre's lover and sister, and this version contains almost all the important details of the book, and the characters are depicted as I imagined them. Jane Eyre is a sophisticated story that is very rich and cannot be properly transmitted in the feature length format, which requires a mini TV series. Timothy Dalton Rochester is probably the best. There have been many discussions about how attractive she is and her age. In the book, Jane (narrator) describes her as "about 35" and not young, but not yet middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 years old to do that, so it's right. We also have only Jane's opinion as to whether Rochester is beautiful. He just met him and he asks him what he thinks. Like an inexperienced and modest girl, I can't imagine she thinks she thinks she is beautiful. An actor who plays Rochester must show us the character of a man and it is perfectly filled. I love the relationship between the two leaders, which is an important thing in this story, and the humor of their meetings. The other versions have spoken it, but that's right. The 2006 version with Toby Stephens (37 years old) is on BBC1 and is really great, so I decide if it's my favorite when it's finished. <br /> <br /> Looking back at this series after viewing the 2006 version, I've decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Charlotte Bronte's dialogue has survived and is essential to the power of the story. Modernization just doesn't work - it's a Victorian story and has an archaic poetic speech. This version is great - Zelah Clark is small and the difference in height between him and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and an amazing actor. There are no additional scenes to relocate from the plot, and the scenario contains all the important scenes, but omits unnecessary details by changing it to and grabbing. I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans.
