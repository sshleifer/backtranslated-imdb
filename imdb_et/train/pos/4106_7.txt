This is definitely not an intellectual film with a deep mission, so I really don't think it's too much to not understand if you're not Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just comedy. Humor is simple, pretty funny, and sometimes maybe a little sick. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotari (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý) so the authors are. But that doesn't matter, the genre is really different and these two movies shouldn't be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská does not try to give you a lesson, she tries to laugh at you and has a chance that it will succeed. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, not brilliant, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes are really worth it.
