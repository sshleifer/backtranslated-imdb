It is a great adaptation and big minisations on its own. Cropping a plot can disappoint the book's fans (but really, how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing the movie version? I know only a little). I think it's awful when you look at the comments that are critical of the series that have been clearly written by people who aren't the story of this story - did you really see the series or did you just carry BBC production because Gillian Anderson was in a newer version? <br /> <br /> The series is characterized by mood, pace, signs and plot drivers (cutting Dickensian flourishes that are not necessary and detrimental to film therapy such as the Turveydrop story, the dynamics of the Smallweed family and additional lawyers - Tangle, Vholes, etc. are severely cropped) . The only omission I wanted was the Jellyby case, but since the first episode is slow slow (after the first episode is perfect), I see it had to go. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is that Death could have been done more precisely. I see that it would have practically canonized Woodcourt and he is a bit more human than the absence of this scene, but I really think that Death is one of the most striking points in the book and I miss it even when it always cries to me. br /> <br /> Has this series actually seen? HOW did she think her aunt and UNCLE? Who is this uncle? I think someone who might have been mistaken for the name DENHOLM Eliott Desmond is not really an admirer of English art (film or literature). <br /> <br /> I think he's also misleading the law. Yes, the law is very badly done in Bleak House. It fails with Jarndyce's descendants, whose precious heritage is eaten by the cost of court proceedings, he is unable to die Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and anyone who believes in the costume. It fails from Miss Flyte. In some ways, Captain Hawdon, who is motivated by his death, is not able to make copies of the law of monotony. Yes, it feeds Vholes and Tangle polluters. But it also makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to live over their stations. Although Dickens is not kind to social status, he would probably have preferred not to be left in the station they were born in (in contrast to the Jo and brickmakers' families to climb out of poverty to Charley Neckett). <br /> <br /> Also, the law, although misrepresented by the Truth Horn and Chancery, is actually for Ada and Richard and Ester who are just Jarndyce's congregation. Their security was guaranteed by a law that gives them Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I can't see how anyone could follow the story. Remember that you shouldn't realize that Esther is the daughter of Lady Dedlar. Also, you don't have to use all "connections" right away. Dickensis just doesn't get the joy of instant. <br /> <br /> As for "seeing clearly" through fog - Gosian Anderson had such a dirty edit that I found it impossible to follow and I knew the land already! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Riggi absolutely brilliant (overplaying and drama doesn't do a good Lady Dedlock, but if you think they're trying Gillian Anderson's version). <br /> <br /> This is ADA and don't be "Kate"! and you get everything you need from the Rouncewell sub-block.
