OK, here is my personal list of Nicktoons, like today: <br /> <br /> 1. Everything SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My Life as a Teen Robot <br /> > 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. NOTE / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Know only the uppercase word? That means it's the Nick's show I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically a simple but wonderful animated comedy for three rich cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles - who get into strange and truly surreal situations trying to join the human Kimberley snack party with beer to save evil Spaceship Planet. This is one of Nick's show that you just have your funny bone degenerated sooner or later! The theme song is memorable and memorable. Vocal actors - including Wayne Knight from the "Seinfield franchise" bring characters to the fresh life with very original people. The stories are pleasant (fan episodes are "All King of Vegetables" and "Gordon's Happy Claw"). And humor is all done by some earthworm Jim. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which is becoming very popular in the world for just 3 seasons or less.
