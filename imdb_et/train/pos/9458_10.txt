This is a superb film element. It flows just at the right pace. The added music fits perfectly and is very pleasant for the ear. Funny parts are fun and even more made with the film's largely depressive tragic nature. <br /> <br /> Despite much commenting on the tragedy of nature, I had something to look at, but not just depressing. I enjoyed it thoroughly in a way that I haven't experienced for a long time. That means it's great and still without the common gear of all modern movies; violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" is nothing to be without the usual horrors. It is a fully matured primer that simply does not require and is even more decorated. At the same time, the subject is completely adult. It is an independent work of art that encapsulates you completely and does not want anything more than it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that know Walton a bit, but they are really meaningful in the long run because they are more contrasting. Rosier makes the path tragic, which then passes to an idyllic one that becomes darker, etc. This weakening landscape of emotional cinematography creates the perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a lithium-like state of stability. The peaks and horns are delicate, but more than enough when they rejoice. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie regardless of the genre you usually enjoy. Set aside all prejudices because it must be visible!
