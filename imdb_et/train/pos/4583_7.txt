I saw it in Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought this story was good, but there were times when some sub-letters were extremely overwhelming. It took the film away, as did a pretty flat musical result that really shook me throughout the film. If the musical result improved, I can forget some of the superfluous scenes. Then the film would be much better.
