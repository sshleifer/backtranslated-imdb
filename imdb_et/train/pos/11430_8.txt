Unfortunately, since the US viewers tend to override subtitles, this film has not received this distribution or attention. His fine subjects of belonging, identity, racial relationships, and in particular how colonialism is damaging all parties, outweigh the obvious dramatic tensions, nostalgic memories of the protagonists 'childhood, and his relationship with his parents' "son-in-law", "maybe only". the real person he knows. We don't even see our mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope I have given you enough hook to take it, whether you speak French or subtitles or not. I urge you to be as courageous, strong and aware as La P'tite.
