Dark remnants are simple and easy. The film is full of horrible visions and scares that make the most experienced horror veterans straight out of there. Especially the staircase, these guys are good. Although they didn't work with a huge budget, everything seems good and the actors are coming through. Dark Remains has one of those interpretive endings that may be negative for some, but I think it thinks. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are on the spot when the grieving couple are trying to build lives there, but some signs like the Sheriff did not convince me. They are not so important. I'll give Dark a better ten rating, ten times more terrifying than any recent studio ghost story / Japanese remake.
