This is not the best film of Bela Lagos, but it has become a good old-fashioned approach to the 40's horror entertainment. <br /> <br /> The brides fall from the altar dead. I think I will push the wedding until the couple is caught, but this is a horror film, so I think people ignore the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a crazy doctor who needs the blood of young women to keep her aging healthy and happy. She always hides Keystone Cops, hiding her bodies in her heart (who would think they were looking for a dead body?), And the brides just keep on coming. <br /> <br /> There would be no such movie. Be complete without a Lois Lane-type female reporter who wants to catch the offender. In solving a good crime, it is bad to keep your mouth at all the wrong times, I guess who Lagos chooses his next intended victim. I love the "haunted house" where Lois Lane gets stuck as a guest at Lagos' unfortunate mansion. Hidden passageways, vampire-like woman, evil dwarf Igor assistant, etc. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> A pretty good pace keeps the movie moving and the story solves in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, it's worth it.
