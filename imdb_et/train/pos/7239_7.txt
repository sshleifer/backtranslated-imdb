What a movie is pretty good for they did. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a shameful monster eating a few people and a party where two of the main characters for the first time, Bendan Hughes, plays the eccentric Vlad, who is a bit of a dough who has moved to the city and uses for specific real estate services to find a house in hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The film is traceable, but the performances of the actors are very woody and they seem not to want to be in this movie, but maybe it's all part of decadent air. <br /> <br /> Disliked to the end, but there is a sequel to sign it. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes wasn't fit for that part. Later, I couldn't think of him, he was excited by the fear, so maybe he was right on that part. <br /> <br /> BRENDAN HUGHES Last viewed as "Hitler - Evil Rise" as Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
