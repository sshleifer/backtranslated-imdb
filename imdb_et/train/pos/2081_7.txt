1 review 29/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Farmers from China report and highlight them and fight what Mother's nature is all about. This film is based on an award-winning novel and crowns a family that begins with a boy's marriage slave girl. The film is of great interest in keeping your interest in the teeth of Paul Muni, despite the leadership. It crowns, Wong Long (Muni's character), and how he works, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the land he originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main theme of the story (in addition to the land) and, despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, it does a good job of displaying the country and its people. It is obvious that MGM used this money to create a really good epic when they could probably afford it. Natural decorations are very well done and the rest of the film really looks good, which is the best film this year. The final definition of the epic is what this story is and it is pulled out pretty well.
