I have long enjoyed criminal law and order once. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, a female detective is quite difficult and seems a bit bitter in a series of criminal will. Watch your movie on the other side. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actor and if you are a criminal, this movie is his actress and you get pretty scary. yarn of family difficulties from the south. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the role of Albert Finneys in this film because he did so convincing actions from his older southern colleague who is hard-headed and unbearable and unacceptable. He reminds me of so many young men, and the portrayal is divine, but you probably find him very fond of this movie. <br /> <br /> Katryn Erbe is very pleasant in this movie and why I suggest it is a 10-year criminal, law and order fan.
