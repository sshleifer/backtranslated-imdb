Yes, that's right. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strange looking controller were both designed to make this game possible. It was amazing when I first saw it, with its enormous environments and colorful characters, and it's amazing now. Game control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful and it has Nintendo's charm, which is always so intangible but indisputably there. Must be for any N64 owner and why everyone else gets N64.
