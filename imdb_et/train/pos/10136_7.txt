This is one of the best episodes of the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has problems with women ... He kills everyone, they are often victims (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valerie stairs, I don't remember the Argento episode in season 1, etc., probably Imprint). I think he has the pleasure of seeing women burnt, tortured, spoiled, and I don't know. At least "the right to die" is one of the best that has good turns and graphic scenes and intercourse (specifically with cell scene pictures, wonderful). Acting like a whole series, regular I could be the worst like "Pro-life" or "We scream on ice cream". I also think that the plot it could do for the film, not just for the episode. The ideology of the series is terrible, kills and stops women, damages the animals and on ... the first season was better than the other, where episodes were like "Cigarette Burns" ("Best"), "Homecoming" (Most Funny), "Imprint" ( really shocking).
