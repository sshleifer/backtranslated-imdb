William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) are buying an old house where a cruel murder occurred many years ago in a very poor condition with a view to restoring. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and get her neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). But there are terrible events in the house, including the death of Sophie's cat. On Sophie's birthday party, blood leaks out of the tube and they leave the place, later revealing it. <br /> <br /> "This House, Bled to Death" is a scary and one of the best episodes in the "Hammer Horror House" series. A fantastic twist that reveals a mystery and tragic conclusion is really great. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The House that Bled to Death"
