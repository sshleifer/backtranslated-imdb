I think JEDI is now considered to be the last entry in the chronologically popular saga, and it is very good, like many of them. I liked how this result came immediately after EMPIRE STRUCTURE, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and actor Mark Hamill). Having heard so many negative things about Ewoks, they weren't so bad. I liked the exciting excitement in the woods and I felt that this chapter had many well-understood emotions. End (with some new additions, I assume?) Successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy story. I know that many real Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes he made in his original film, but being a relatively novice to these films rather late and not lost from what I didn't know yet, I thought he made these 6 movies completely as a whole. Oh, and the mistake - Carrie Fisher was pretty tasty in his low-light clothes.
