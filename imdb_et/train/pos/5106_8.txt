I think every time I see one of these 80s old movies, it makes me return to a simpler time, no matter how they look today. This movie is good. I remember it as a small child and thought it was the biggest film ever. It has all the heroic characters that a young cowboy wants. Now, as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still sad, but this time I know what's going on. I found one thing weird. How many people can move to Houston and connect with Sissy, marry, move to a trailer, fall out, cheat, have an uncle, push back, get a month ago? Only in America.
