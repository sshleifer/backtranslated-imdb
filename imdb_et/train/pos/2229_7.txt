I've read terrible things about this movie, so I was worse off. "Confused. Muddled. Frightened structured." While some of these accusations may be useful, this film was not as terrible as your average DVD programmer. In fact, he actually had aspirations. It tried something out of the ordinary monster / slasher meaninglessness. And, God, there are some interesting things. <br /> <br /> ms. Barbeau is a miracle to see. He gently carries the film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. UNHOLY will eventually fall under its ambition. There are too many (inexplicable) sub-blocks that try to co-exist. And the gaps created by the journey are never really directed: for example, when Hope knows that her mother is bad and that she finally kills her brother, why doesn't she kill in the first order? It would seem to have come out of hell to travel to the future. <br /> <br /> However, I give UNHOLY points a try. Little ambition is not bad.
