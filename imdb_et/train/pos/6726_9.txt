Once again, Stacy Peralta is the true first person to live the story. Giving them who are involved in surfing the big wave, tell us their stories, how it looked and what they thought, get that feeling there. The film will take you from the fifties to the near future, focusing on three major architects who contribute to the development and development of sport. A true "home movie" like videos of yourself and their companions takes you to your world. The layers of music, culture, technical information, a clear view of the participant's athleticism and the fabulous big wave images provide a full perspective on this aspect of surfing. <br /> <br /> Well worth it.
