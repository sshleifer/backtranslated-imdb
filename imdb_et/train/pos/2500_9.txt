... would probably be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). In addition to earning a big fan holiday for fan girls (well, it was superfluous), it was the story that blew me. hirah Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know some people disagree with me on this, but it wasn't one of the three big players (boys who played Shot, Son and Kei) that gave the best result (for me). It was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 Battle Royale! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like Hyde, worship her voice, but the problem was that some of her scenes were a bit off, but I loved this scene where she danced dead boy's body killing other boys . and Gackt wasn't that bad at all, I preferred how his character was separate from the start. I can't say much about my background in Lee-Hom Wang, I'm not pretending to know him, but he wore his weight with star-studs. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best collaboration I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive your spelling if it's wrong). if the whole song lasts about nine minutes, you won't notice that length because you enjoy hearing Gackti and Hyde together. Anyway, this movie is a must-see not only for fans (big fan base), but for those who enjoy sci-fi, futuristic movies, Asian style.
