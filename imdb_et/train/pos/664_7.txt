The Crypt of the Stories: And all through the house start on Christmas Eve, when Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband Joseph (Marshall Bell), she pulls her body out of the box ready to throw it out of the pit, but at the same time does not miss an important new radio newsletter that says The murderous maniac (Larry Drake) is dressed as Santa Claus who has escaped from a local asylum application and has already killed several women next to Elizabeth in his list but has other ideas and tries to make a seemingly dangerous situation for his advantage ... <br /> <br /> This story of the Crypt scenario was the 1st season episode 2, staged by one of the traditional producers of the exhibition, Robert Zemeck. The story of Fred Dekker was actually based on a story that appeared in The Horst of Horror and was originally adapted to film one episode of the Britsih horrorantology film Tales from the Crypt (1972), played by Joan Collins as a murderer, played by Ellen Trainor. This particular version is good enough, but it doesn't do anything else or special and is a bit too linear and predictable to be classical. With a length of only 25 minutes, it's definitely moving fast, the story is almost big enough, and it usually gives good entertainment and I liked the fun. This time, the opening and closing of Christmas is the Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) segments along with the usual punches. <br /> <br /> Director Zemeckis is doing a good job, and in winter there is also a nice atmosphere that includes Christmas. . There's not a lot of gore here, somebody with their head stuck in poker, someone's face cut with ice-lice, someone's hand cut in an ax, and there are some blood sprays, but in general it's not graphic. Tackling little pain is pretty good. <br /> <br /> And all through the house is not the best story of a crypt, but it's a decent person to watch, but after the comic book & original 1972 movie version do we really need or even want it?
