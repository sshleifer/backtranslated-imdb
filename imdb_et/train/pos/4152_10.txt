Over the years, I have seen quite a few episodes of a cold case, starting with season 1 episodes in 2003-2004. And while most of them have been good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but also of the few Emmy categories. While some disagree with the content that contains the story (ie the romantic relationship between men and women), I doubt that anyone could watch it without moving deeply in their spirit. <br /> <br /> The story is essentially a case that was reopened on the testimony of a dead drug dealer. Two central actors are two police officers of the 1960s, named Sean Coop (aka, a cold case victim who goes to his surname, Coop) and his partner Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> Coop is a Vietnam War Warrior with a deeply troubled past. But Jimmy is married, not less with children. Both are partners in police forces and not only form friendships, but a secret romantic relationship that they both have to hide deeply and clearly from homophobic culture at that time. <br /> <br /> These life-strike scenes are mostly black-and-white, colored bits that are then sprinkled. Examples include their red team's car, the yellow curtains that gently blow in the window of Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife looked at Coop and Jimmy to drink, fought, and then kissed each other in an alcohol-induced state. I found it interesting that only the selected items were painted on rejected scenes, everything else in black and white. I have still not identified the color scheme and logic. <br /> <br /> A clear homophobic tension between patrol officers and two central players only increases the intensity of the episode. One of the main emotional scenes was when Coop was his father after baptizing Jimmy's child. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respectable fellow, Coop has a rumor about Coop Jimmy's relationship. From that moment on, Coop can be excused because Coop's father's shame and disgrace came to Coop - "You're not going to shame your family ... and you're not my son." - clearly shows the hostile views of same-sex relationships in this era. <br /> <br /> Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room, where Coop and another officer go after Coop and Jimmy. Batman and Robin Homos ". <br /> <br /> With regard to the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more Jimmy in his life. Once you see Jimmy's face tension when he has to choose his commitment to his wife. and the child, his church, and his unintentional devotion to Coop. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jimmy walks away from Coop, realizing that he doesn't have both Coop and his family at the same time. because of Jimmy, but Coop can also be killed for his knowledge of drug and police corruption that came to power. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene in the whole episode was when Coop, when he was sitting on his teammate wounds, told his partner quietly with his last words over his police radio: "Jimmy ... we were happy. Don't forget it. "<br /> <br /> The selection of the soundtrack was outstanding throughout the episode. I liked the last scene with actor Chad Everett, who was still playing the older dead Jimmy and has obviously lost his former partner Coop. <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode and I think it is the best, it is undoubtedly the most well-written, well-functioning and well-made all-cold case episodes I've ever seen.
