This film is unusual and weird and a very good way is almost unusual and weird. I will give it briefly 7 just because it is so unique and out of wall, but much of the time seems to be odd to be odd. If the film had managed to integrate its strangest moments into a plot's similarity, it would have been really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the creators just messed up the spatulas with nonsense, then the whole bunch got more crap that sounded as if it was funny on the spatula's mouth. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth it, but it's not top-notch by any creators who are wild imagination.
