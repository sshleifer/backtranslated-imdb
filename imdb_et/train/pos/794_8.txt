I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was subtle and vulnerable. Once, the director of MacDowell's film didn't make yet another sign of her beauty in the movie. Kate and her young man's romance are nice to watch and it plays very well. His relationship with his friends is both life and thorn and balm. Imelda Stalinson, who has been the MVP for so many British films, is doing a great job in this. There are some tragedies in this, but I think the movie will eventually be recorded in brilliant action, pure direction and witty writing. The quality of the film is excellent and the music is good even though it is not available on the sound track.
