Carmen was there at the start of the show. He was one of the best signs. Why did they get rid of him?! The exhibition is not the same as before. That's even worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were in Carmen. You can't replace anyone from the start! It's like South Park without Kyle or child's play without Chucky! That's not right! The niece who replaced her is just, ugh! Awful. He doesn't fit the story at all. He was one of the main characters and his niece could not replace him. He was an awesome actor. Better than a niece. Get him back or lose the viewers TON.
