Believe it or not, after 12 minutes this movie (1912) is a full-length movie. Very few films have been longer since then, but this is definitely not what sets this odd little movie to the rest! No, what's different is that all the actors (except one frog) are bugs ... yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy might have looked like products like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead uses Russian production (or, in my opinion, models that looked like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were still undiscovered and I assume that Linder was busy, so maybe they used the bugs! With the stop motion, the bugs moved and danced, and fought amazingly well - and much more realistically than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The film starts off with Mr Beetle in time. She goes to the bawdy club when her wife is waiting at home. But, unfortunately, for Mr Beetle he is detained by a local film buffer. In addition, he does not know it, but Mrs Beetle also continues with the bohemian grasshoppers. Of course, this domestic comedy is much more than that, but the plot is old and very fun for both adults and children. <br /> <br /> Weird, but also very amazing and observable.
