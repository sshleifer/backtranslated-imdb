Thomas Ince always had the opportunity to bring to life the perfect and elegant stories of simple home communities. "Italy" is such a movie. Sensitive action, especially George Beban, George Beban, Jr., a silent child actor, and the wonderful bands, provide a realistic feel for early immigrants in New York. This gives the authenticity of this 1915 film, which is unusual in its vintage properties. <br /> <br /> The film begins with today's and man's (George Beban's contemporary outfit), reading the story of an Italian immigrant, and then the transition story of George playing the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his fianc√©e from Italy to America, marries and has a son with him. But times are difficult and the family is struggling to survive. I thought I was wondering why my mother did not breastfeed her baby and avoid the complications of black formulas, but well, even the early Dream Factory was a politically correct behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the image is when Beban has the opportunity to search for revenge on the criminals who inadvertently put him in jail, and at the last moment he decides on his planned action. Very clean. I loved the curtain effect, it was great. Great use of light in this movie. <br /> <br /> I give "Italy" 8 out of 10.
