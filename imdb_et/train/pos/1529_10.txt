Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs I regularly watch on TV. The way all the main characters do something in every episode, unlike today's exhibitions, where they focus on 1 or 2 people for each episode and everyone else is moved to the side. The function of the sign brain is also so hidden that you never know what it thinks, and if you think you are doing it, you are wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis Murder has dealt with different topics, not just cases, but the personal life of each character. Everything from racism and adoption, terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> What about older people? I'm 24! I don't think I can read it again. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will release all eight seasons on a DVD (not on the NTSC) so I can view them all in order. They seem to do it with many other programs of the same age, so they can rush it fast!
