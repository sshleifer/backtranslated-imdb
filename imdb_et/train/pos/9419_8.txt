This Alec Guinness Starrer is a very fun political business satire and easy eccentric character training. floor type funny, except perhaps the sound effects of experiments. But it has fun moments and it's very perfect. The big explosion segment is probably the most distant element. a particularly feminine socialist with a light romantic drunken character in Guinness. Political machinations have actually carried the story. Ernest Thesigner is very remarkable as hard. <br /> <br /> I don't think it works quite well, like LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS and CORONETS; But even light Ealing comedy is better than nothing.
