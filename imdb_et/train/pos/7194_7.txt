I'll do it the best in the Zorro chapters. An exciting musical result adds an exciting screen to the game. There's a great supportive cast and mysterious villain who keeps you up to the final chapter. Reed Hadley does a good job like Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last, but certainly no less, is Whitney and the leading English team.
