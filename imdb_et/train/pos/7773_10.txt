Great movie! Rented DVD recently and was on the floor with this stunning job. Douglas Sirk was a filmmaker and he gets the words of Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar), and Lauren Bacall that words can't describe. Paul Verhoeven honored this film with great respect when Dorothy Malone played the Sharon Stone murder-inspiring guru in his basic instinct. What a big joke! <br /> <br /> According to the image, the movie is fun, riveting, campy, biting, trashy, tempting and striking! This is definitely the grandfather of any large and small screen soap operas, but none of them is a dazzling style as you can see here: the camera's work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the montage of the title song is more memorable, the one-dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final picture is unforgettable head scratching on how censors then back let it do final cutting! <br /> <br /> Although the oldest, high-profile movies are sometimes considered bored to sit out, the written wind contains so much and goes so fast that it is actually a shame when it ends. Thank you to Mr Sirk for his craft - and Todd Haynes for pointing out - which has now become my favorite movie! SEE THIS MOVIE !!!
