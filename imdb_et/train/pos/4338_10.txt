The film was very touching. It was at the same time gentle and funny. The landscape was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning performances. Olympia Dukakis was great. I appreciate the story that his part was supposed to be short, but I wanted to have him seen more - he is a real pro. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser see Q and A after watching. He is a wonderful person, wise, eloquent and "real person". It was a really pleasant night! It's a movie's sight. You're so grateful that you went.
