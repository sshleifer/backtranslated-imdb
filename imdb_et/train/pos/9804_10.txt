"Batman: Batster's Mystery" is just as entertaining as animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> Although animation is still a comic, the animation is lighter than the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks like he is before, but now he seems somewhat less restrictive. Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced with less sharp, younger Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, calls Batman's voice better than most living actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did much more decent voice action than I had expected. <br /> <br /> As in Batman movies of live competitions, the quality of roses also lives or dies. My all-time favorite, the penguin, is here. His design is more glossy than before, listening more to the Burgess Meredith image of the 60s than Danny DeVito's "Batman Returns". David Ogden Stiers is a great choice for Penguin's voice. Penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning complexity, as he usually appears in the comic. Hector Elizondo's voice creates Bane, who is much more memorable than the forgotten version of Batman & Robin. And finally, Batman has a solving mystery that puts the "detective" back into "detective comics" (that is, "DC" means after all.) The Mystery Revolution is delightfully slippery. > <br /> The result adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the movie. It sounds like a "Poirot" score and a "Mission: Impossible" score. All in all, it's more fun than your average comic.
