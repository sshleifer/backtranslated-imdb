My Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I like this movie. Compared to today's futile movie (just action and special effet and new ideas), ask "Soylent Green" something that doesn't exist today: think. <br /> <br /> Well, it wouldn't be a big surprise for a person to eat "cookies" created by the human body. Anything that happens on this planet and seeing people being so indifferent to everyone is such a future. <br /> <br /> This film will certainly take time, but the idea of ​​the movie is real again. Rich in Paradise, the second in hell. Luckily for today, they are television and idiots like the "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> TV is a good laundry brain. It is a pity that people's intelligence is not as advanced as technologies. Because all stops are written. <br /> <br /> If you like reality, this movie is not for you. If you believe all politicians are the same. If you don't like to ask yourself now and in the future, never look at this movie.
