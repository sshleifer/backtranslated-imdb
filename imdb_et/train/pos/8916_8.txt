Absolutely the first film that frightened me of death. I happened when my older brother (r.i.p.) watched it. It was a black and white TV and not really a good picture, but it made me interesting. Shortly thereafter, my people bought a color set and, fortunately, the Million Dollar Movie would have shown it one Sunday. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten most of the plot, but it didn't take long for me to catch up ... and I was so scared that I was sleeping that night! I think it was just a movie, but it involved a creature that came not just from space, but you couldn't hear it or see it ... and when it was detained, it was too late. Even now, after that time, it still sends the backbone. A real classic and even better classic I've seen from generation to generation! <br /> <br /> Live the Blob!
