I saw this movie today and I have to say that it was much better than I thought it was about a couple of hours before it could be seen. Personally, I had some prejudices about this language, but it completely changed my idea. The film was mostly surprisingly good with the performances of a great actor and actors. It was the story of a boy who had a dream and who did everything to achieve it. It touched me and a movie based on a real story that convinced me. The new school, the psychologist's director and the young boy who get to know the new teacher are a bit different from others and in the fight for things, even if they don't seem to work. This showed how small things can make tremendous changes in many things, and sometimes can lead to complicated situations. I also think that the actors' choices have been successful. It really seemed like you were a person who watched the episodes as a bystander when they happened. Before I blame the film, I have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn't seem and felt realistic ... like the school headmaster won Frits aka. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. He was really beaten badly, but the only thing he caused him was blood coming from his nose when compared to the first beat when Frits got some stitches. ..I'd say that if I ever find it in the DVD store, I'm sure I'll take it with me.
