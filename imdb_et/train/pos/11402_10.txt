I saw "America in Paris" in my first edition when I was still in school and fell in love right now. I went back to see it the next day, and I have lost the hope of seeing it both in cinema and on television. It enjoys some of the best music and songs of the 20th century's biggest popular composer (George Gershwin), and has the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) history of Hollywood history. Oscar Levant's supportive casting (as original as ever), Georges Guetary (why didn't he make more films?) And Nina Foch (brilliantly unusual role) is at the top of her form. Perfectly choreographed for headline music, the closing ballet is perfect for Parisian sights and sounds, as well as impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All of Gershwin's songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable is "It's very clear" (on the shores of Caron and Kelly Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (Parisian children join Gene Kelly's "Une Chanson Americaine"). If you love Paris, check out this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, look at it. But look at it!
