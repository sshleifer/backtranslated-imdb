I watched this movie at one of the usual times, which is real real late at night. Usually, if the film doesn't interest me, I'll be asleep and I have to wake up to stay awake. with the fact that its shots tend to remain in nature for a long time. But after a bit, I'm going to go to the movie a bit more, because his story is more about the main owner. Finally, you feel like you have known him all his life. The film keeps my interest so much that I didn't even know the sun was rising.
