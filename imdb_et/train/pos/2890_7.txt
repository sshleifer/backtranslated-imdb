12. Animated Disney classic is a sensible film that is spoken through a simple story. Although slightly dated, it deserves a list of Disney classics. <br /> <br /> It is not Disney's toppings, but is satisfactory. One of Disney's most simple works, yes, but it keeps some magic and enchantment (old Disney is well known). It was an important movie because it recorded Disney's delicate situation. If it had failed, Disney would no longer be an animated classic. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is somehow returning to Disney's 1st animation class ("Snow White and Seven Dwarfs") as it brings back the fairy tale. It's not clear where this story is going, but I think it's somewhere in France because it's based on the story of Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many pleasant characters like Cinderella, Prince, Bruno (dog), Jaques and Gus (two main mice), Fairy Godmother (for fairy for whom he is funny), birds, king and Grand Duke . <br /> <br /> Jaques is very smart and fun. I love his voice. It really is a mouse-like quality. Gus may not be so smart, but he is humorous. <br /> <br /> The king is fun, but I think it makes him so funny his short mood. The Grand Duke is very cool and fun. They are two of my favorite characters in this movie and are responsible for many of the most interesting moments. <br /> <br /> The Prince is definitely one of Disney's most charming. There is no doubt that Prince Philip is "Sleeping Beauty" inspired by this prince because they are very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Latin Tremaine (stepmother) does not have to be pleasant because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, stepmom is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, beautiful and cute. By the way, I think his beautiful pink dress is much more beautiful than a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (cat) is a funny malicious one. The way he walks, the nose gets stuck in the air, and these lofty and snobbish facial expressions make him joke. Ironically, he is a stepmother very similar to personality. She always agrees with her childhood attitudes towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is such a devilish and average cat. However, he is not disturbed by anything. <br /> <br /> Music is simple but pleasant, though not Disney's best. The best song in this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many well-known talented artists like James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten <br /> <br /> good work, but also fine details, though never something like that. But the King's Palace is a great masterpiece that is truly majestic and colossal.
