I recently found a copy of $ 5 from a video store and I was eager to pull it out. Music and (apparently) graphics do not match my favorite list of standards Beyond the Mind's Eye, but I'm still one segment: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella in Ice. Music is great and emotions feel real. unfortunately there is no story or music on the website.
