I liked! The plot was weird, Drew Barrymore and DC were both uncomfortable. Drews acted terribly in places, but it may be during his life. Dennis Christopher, when the contraction was pretty cool and as always, he does his best - I'm still a big Dennis fan, so I bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> I didn't end! That weird animatronic red skeleton looked like it was out of film school, which is OK, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> .... and the whole thing with a knife - if it was so inconvenient, why didn't they just get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing when it was a strange thing for Doppelganger or was it DC or was it all Dennis all the time? Because Doppelganger was composed by Dennis and Patrick. In Patrick's scenes, when it was Dennis as Doppelganger, I think Patrick would notice. <br /> <br /> The music was at times, but at times intrusive, the whole orchestra score seemed to be around the subject, but this topic was superfluous. <br /> <br /> A large number of blood and Drew nude gratuities. <br /> <br /> Complete GPM-Guilty Pleasure Movie. Don't read it too much, don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you can't find it. There are some diamond moments and goofs galore- WATCH IT AND is just fun with it!
