Finally, I could see it after hearing great things about it. It really exceeded my expectations. Given the budget, it was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. The lack of money actually helped the film in many ways, especially because of the plot. Just like Blair's witchcraft, this movie was even better than filming instead of the movie. Another bonus: considering that most of the low budget horror films (even the best ones) suffer from medium-involuntary hysterical acts, this film was actually a talented story (recorded one or two characters), especially two leaders. The only thing missing from the movie was the original line. It borrows strongly from well-known films such as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you're like me, this kind of movies are no longer scary. In addition, the director keeps things interesting. I would be very interested to see what a director does with a bigger budget and I feel it is just a matter of time before we know ...
