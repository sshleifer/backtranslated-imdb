This is a great film about the lost age of drama on reactive television. My all-time actor, Robert Culp, is skilfully trained through a true liberal justice and belief system, the despair of conservatism and the fear and killing of crime. Teenagers are a collection of pure evil stereotypes, and the possible message of this movie makes Dragnet's episodes fairly equal. But what it really looks like is the high tempo of the movie, the build-up of fears and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feeling of the entire California atmosphere. Cars are also very good, remembering. I'm going to give this movie to 10, and I don't want anyone watching this movie and not enjoying it every minute. Remember that simply because it is made on television does not mean that it is not an excellent art.
