You have to pay attention to the 'twelve monkeys', but if you do, you will probably find a lot. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with traveling time. The virus killed many people in 1997, and a man named Cole (Bruce Willis) returns in 1990 and 1996 to find the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and placed in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who is likely to be involved with the virus. He also meets with psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who does not believe in him in 1990. When Cole disappears during a mental hospital when she is in a chain and locked room and appears again in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe Cole's stories. br /> <br /> The movie plays continuously with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it will be accepted in the future and "they" will send someone. For Cole, someone will only appear after a few seconds of a phone call. Such things happen throughout the film and you must therefore pay attention. You may want to ask some questions, but since you can't answer it, it's better to accept the movie. <br /> <br /> "Twelve Monkeys" works as a sci-fi with some great pictures and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller. You are never sure what will happen next and what will help the film. Maybe this is a story about something wrong, but because it is a fancy thing like traveling time, you should accept what the film tells us and just try to enjoy it. That was an easy part for me.
