Everything was better in the last few days. Even a children's TV. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. When I write this comment I am fourteen, but even in my teen years, I can't stand up to Fraggle Rock. For those who have really lived under the rock (haha!), There is a horde of fraggle rocks that are playful and hollow, called Fraggles, who live amazingly in rock. But they are not the only creatures. Rock is populated with many other species such as hard-working Doozers and numerous live plants. On one side of the stone, the inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later became friends with Gobo Fraggle), on the other hand, the Gorgide's assumed family of universe rulers. The five main Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (arty and calm), Wembley (indecisive and Gobo friend), Boober (pessimistic home god) and Red (love something for sport and general mind) grab each episode in some strange situations while singing and dances his care. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family of show plots that can be complicated with details that babies may not follow well, but song-and-dance routines keep their attention. The characters are strong and pleasant, their conflicts believe and their adventures are exciting. Gorgs are Scary, Doc and Sprocket Enlighten, Uncle Travel Matt Fun (Postcard segments are very 80s!) And The Last Episode, Changing Address, Really Touching. Let's go to Fraggle Rock again!
