Some guys think the sniper is not good because its part was not good enough. Well, if you consider this as an action movie, this point of view can be quite true, because the part of this moving activity is not really exciting. But I think it is a psychological drama rather than an act. <br /> <br /> The film mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who certainly had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 assassinations killed, looked like he had a cold heart. But after Beccket showed his day's dream of Montana, we clearly see our softness inside. It was a cruel war and a sacrifice of his partners, which made Beccket a "cold heart". <br /> <br /> Millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and not even a qualified sniper. Billy Zane did quite well to show millar hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put the ball through his heart" (as Beccket said). What he meant for his suicide mission was that it was easy to achieve and then he could safely get back and get a prize. <br /> <br /> These two men were quite different in their personalities, and I think the film managed to show the difference and impact they had on each other because of their differences in personality. These two snipers quarreled, doubted each other, and finally came to an understanding of communication and what they had done to help even save you. <br /> <br /> The sniper is not a good action movie but a good psychological.
