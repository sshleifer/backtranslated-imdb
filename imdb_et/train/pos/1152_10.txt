The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the Sally Shopping Center to revive their flagships is a good reason to enjoy this movie, but wait! There's more! It is a daytime television, movie stars (and upwards) and good eyesight for the horror of love. Robert Downey Jr shows a lighter side of his gene and Cathy Moriarty is great. Dialogue is witty and physical humor is the perfect skill. This is a film that attracts those who really enjoy the art of display, writing and writing.
