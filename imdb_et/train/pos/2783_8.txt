None of your hardest hits stories and this is the true strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships where less certain writers would have added some too predictable romantic tensions. Not only do they save the audience, but at the same time they cast some surprises. There are some Disney-ish moments, especially at the end, but they are manageable. Generally, it is worth the rent and it was good, relaxed fun. We followed her instructions and it was BRILLIANT! The next time we do this day before we intend to eat it, because it is one dish that will definitely heal if there is a full evening in the refrigerator to give out the spices!
