I enjoyed this movie. It was a pleasure to see the version so close to Peter O'Donnell's vision. <br /> <br /> Many people didn't like the movie, but it must be seen in the context of the origin story, that is. The film uses the modesty and the events that shaped her as the woman she got. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> This tempo is slow and my tension doesn't create enough tension in today's scenes. However, this is only acceptable for such a faithful version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you will enjoy it even for your mistakes if you just want to go with your finger - forget it. br /> <br /> It's the feeling that it's the first franchise, but since I've never advertised it, I suspect it's no longer. Sorry.
