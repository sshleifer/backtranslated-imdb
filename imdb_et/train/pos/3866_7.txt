This unpleasant, rather routine series deserves credit for TV history press for two reasons: it was the first to win the Emmy Award for the best syndicate series and this was the first performance that came from the Republican Picture Studio, known for its low budget but high-power shoot- em-up in the 30's and 40's. <br /> <br /> The Republic was one of the first Hollywood studios to leap to the small screen that was still in its infancy. But in studio relationships, as a producer of TV-cellulose fiction, it would be short. After this show, they started with another format they were known for, the series of adventures, the "Commando Cody" and other series, but like this, they didn't last more than 39 episodes. The Republic was also at the last stages of the studio; it would end the Hollywood term in several ranks of the Revue Studio series, such as "Soldiers of Fortune", the original "Dragnet" and "Kit Carson" before they finally closed the doors in 1959. <br /> <br Anyway, "century stories" were not so bad for an apple, his calling card was a story based on authentic numbers in Western history, mostly illegally like Black Bart, Johnny Ringo, John Wesley Hardin, Dalton Bros and Pleasure. Later, Jim Davis, known for his role as Ewing Patriarch in "Dallas", put a pleasant job in the lead role as Matt Clark, a fictional rail detective who must fight these laws, played by veteran and soon veterinary characters. <br /> <br /> There are two amazing facts: incidents happen at different times, some in the 1880s, some at the turn of the century, but Clark is never older. And Matt is also happy to get into two cute female detectives like Sidekicks, Frankie Adams, played by Mary Castle, and her substitute Margaret "Jonesy" by Jones, Kristine Miller. Lone Ranger could only be a companion. This time can be spent with Tonto for so long. <br /> <br /> "History of the Century" is the production of Studio City TV from Republic Pictures Corp. In 1954, 39 episodes were made, 39 of which are public and DVD.
