I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza was a brighter god he had to offer if he could have found the courage to break out of Hollywood and lead the opera he could have been to America Caruso, everyone says he might have been, but in any case he has a fantastic introduction to art that doesn't let it bones and if it is. see a movie where you can see why Mr Lanza is still in the house for discussion. Someone tells Pavarotti that I'm telling MARIO LANZA.If it is a DVD for the movie itself, it must be restored and VHS is not good enough, but it should be the only Lanza movie on the DVD, others are bad bad and boring.
