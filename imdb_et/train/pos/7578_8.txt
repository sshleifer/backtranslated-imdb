Shintar√¥ Katsu, who played the dark sword game "Zatoichi" in a total of 27 movies, completes Hanzo's trilogy with this great film in which he can love the ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> The big stick, which is often used for justice, is forever retired. <br /> <br /> Feeling his usual insecure self, he tried those who steal from the treasury to borrow money that was useful to those who couldn't afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual amazing sword competition and great man skills were with the blood. <br /> <br /> I want to miss him.
