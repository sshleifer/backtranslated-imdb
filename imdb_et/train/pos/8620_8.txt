I finished the 139-minute version (widescreen) with some friends and we blown away. I'm not worried about what others have said. What filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The big battle is tiring. After that, we were stunned that there was about 30 minutes to go there, but it didn't leave us completely involved and entertained. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that almost destroyed it and it was terrible music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballad are not here, and every time we use them, we all laughed. It's ugly. You have been warned, but the story and storytelling keep you grounded. <br /> <br /> There are a number of outstanding moments that make you give behind the camera. There is a lot of quietness and slow motion photography. I really wish I could delete the music, but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Get in touch with it. It's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you don't expect and that is very refreshing.
