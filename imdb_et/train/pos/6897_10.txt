It was released on DVD in France several years ago - I want it to be published again with English subtitles. Don't mix it with Penelope Cruz's remake, which gives a poor rating. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller to marry a king's daughter. He leaves the army and rides. But her love is Gina Lollabrigida in her early film. I'm not breaking the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a big loss for moviedom.
