My children have recently seen the attacks of this exhibition - both the earlier episodes of N and the later ABC family - and they love it. (I didn't know that the show had lasted even after the first or second season) I'm curious about what made all the cast changes - I've seen them being described as "very public" and searching for half an hour on the web hasn't shown anything else as endless comments on how early episodes were so much better than later episodes. (Personally, I don't see a big difference - scripts and themes remain largely the same - but they lose a great person along the way.) My daughter has put a DVD on her wish list, so maybe the land to illuminate special features and comments on all this. I also want them to have made some self-expressive changes - such as "Boy Meets World" where they dropped a little sister throughout the season, and if another actor later plays with her, they will ask her where she has been and she says " upstairs "or, if the high school graduation mark" Minkus "appears, they ask him where he has been and he says" there ", pointing to a part of the classroom that has never been shown by the camera before saying," Hey, Mr. Turner , wait!" and drives off the screen (Mr. Turner is another character who left) Oh well - maybe this is a real Hollywood story about it or something? I was pleased to see that Aunt Hilda's aunt showed - she was always one of my favorites - it's too bad that it would not have been an overwhelming majority. (Zelda's candle just didn't cut it for me)
