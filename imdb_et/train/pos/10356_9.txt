In August 1980, a child in Azaria Chamberlain and his parents, Lindy and Michael, caused an interruption in the alleged murder of a child, which was a very angry nation. The media and the public had already blamed the accused couple and had convicted and bleed. Serious justice followed. Michael and Lindy Chamberlain argued that, as the tents near Ayers Rock in downtown Australia, dingo had taken his ten-week-old daughter out of his tent when preparing to eat in the barbecue area. Nobody believed them. Lindy was charged with his child's murder and Michael's accessory. The whole country was whispering with ritual slaughter. The Chamberlain trial ended before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to blame him, but the jury looked at the pressure from the public and the media. How could we even sit as a people? What are we, how can we expect to know? If there is no absolute proof and no reasonable doubt, Chamberlains should have been acquitted. <br /> <br /> The film by Fred Schepis unequivocally and wholeheartedly supports the argument of John Bryson's novel that Chamberlains were completely innocent of them. The fact that Dingo actually took Azariah to his child on the night of Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi has been a great hit with the blood cancer nation's mood, the devil worshiping the "truth." He shows Australia in a rather uncertain light as people who were totally obsessed with Chamberlains' remuneration! His scenario, compiled with Robert Caswell, vigorously irritates emotions and surely finds the audience sad and angry about the justice that has occurred. <br /> <br /> Excellent Meryl Streep gives an incredible result when a woman is charged with the most terrible acts. He brings the hardest Aussie hardest to life, ready to stand up against the charges and straighten the world. Even his accent is almost, but not quite, on the ground. Very good work for this commander. Sam Neill is as good as Streep as faithful in the beginning, but then cheated Michael, who is unable to understand why their world is falling apart, and he is doubting his Christianity. He, like Streep, has a great emotional strength that moves you deeply. All support is great, some of Australia's best actors and actors play a part. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also great for the photographer's director Ian Baker, who is amazed by this great ground (especially Rock). Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton gives a chat. <br /> <br /> For all Aussies, this must see a shocking look in the mirror if we want the state to do with the family who just wanted to deliver justice and know the truth. As Michael Chamberlain said, "I don't think anyone really understands what innocence means ... ... to innocent people." <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even when you look back at Fred Schepisi's understanding of justice that hit Chamberlains, who lost in 1980 to Ayres Rock Azaria Baby is still emotionally powerful and honestly touching. <br /> <br /> Schepis and Robert Caswell have expertly handed John Bryson a novel on the screen, saying that Michael and Lindy Chamberlain have gone terribly wrong to rest, with a new born daughter, Azaria, dingo right after a couple of days after the family tent. Media speculation and brutal public rumor Lindy was accused of murdering his child and Michael was accused as an accessory. There was little more in the media than the trial, and it was decided for the Australian people that Lindy had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, although there was no motive or little evidence other than indirect evidence. br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is in the upper form as the accused woman fighting with Australia to prove her innocence. He is truly fantastic and the only thing that fails him is the true blue Aussie accent, although he makes his level the best ocker. You may ask why the Australian top actor was not played, but the star power is probably the answer. Along with Meryl, there is the same impressive Sam Neill who is outstanding as a man who sees his world falling apart while he feels unable to do anything. Strong Aussie casting provides steadfast support. <br /> <br /> Editing Jill Bilcock is very timely, Ian Baker's cinematic and other harsh visuals are brilliant, and Bruce Smeaton's music is in part. It really has to be for all conscientious Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
