This film is the most cultured film of metal. Preparation: The child will receive the final recording of his favorite artist Sammy Curr, who recently died in the hotel fire. He plays it back and calls him back to get revenge on heavy metals for those who torture him. Every true metal fan enjoys this movie, and if you're a metal head banged by jocks, play Sammy Curr's album back ......... don't expect him to be fictitious, well with this movie and watch it with his fist in the air, head to head beating and volume 11!
