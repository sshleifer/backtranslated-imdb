This is a fantastic Amicus horrorantology that has 3 great stories and a fantastic performance! All the characters are fantastic and the movie is quite cool and tense, and Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are just amazing! It is very underestimated and my favorite story must be the third "sweets sweet" and all the characters are very nice. Some of it is predictable and the last story was incredibly disappointing and quite boring! This is an awesome Amicus horror anthology that has 3 great stories and fantastic performances, only the last story disappears! I say it must be seen! This is a fantastic story with a lot of tension, and the killer Dominic is really horrible, and it has also worked very well! It was an ideal way to start a story and for the most part it is unpredictable, plus a twofold twist is shocking and quite creepy!. Grade A <br /> <br /> Story 2. ("Waxworks"). It's a definite story everywhere, with great performances, but the end is pretty predictable, but it's still horrible, and it's quite tense, Peter Cushing did an amazing job and I couldn't believe how young Joss Ackland, I really enjoyed this story! . Grade B <br /> <br /> Story 3 ("Sweets Sweets"). This is the best story here because it is extremely horrible and all the time unpredictable, it is also a nice twist! Christopher Lee did an amazing job and Chloe Franks did a great job as a young daughter, and the end is quite shocking!. I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've ever seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> Story 4 ("The Cloak"). This is a terrible story that is really weak and uncomfortable. ? Grade D <br /> <br /> The direction is great! Peter Duffell is doing a great job here with a fantastic camera work, great angles, a somewhat creepy atmosphere and a very fast pace! <br /> <br /> Action is fantastic! John Bryans is great here because the narrator, he had some great features, I just wanted him to have more screen time. John Bennett is very good because he was very strong and was very intense, he was especially good!, I liked him a lot. Denholm Elliott is great as Charles, he was vulnerable, showed fear, was very pleasant, and I loved my facial expressions. Joanna Dunham is amazingly gorgeous! And she did a great job of what she had to do as a woman, she was also with great chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is incredibly horrible as Dominic, he was scary and got a job very well! Peter Cushing is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is pleasant, purposeful, charming and, as always, he had a class in class! (Cushing Rules !!). Joss Ackland is fantastic, as always, and it seemed so young, I barely recognized him, his accent was not so thick and played a different role. (Ackland Rules). Wolfe Morris is scary and did what he was supposed to do well. (Lee Rules !!). Chloe Franks is adorable as a daughter, she is somewhat horrible and gave one of the best childrens activities I've ever seen! I loved her. Ask Dawn Porter is beautiful and was great as a babysitter, I liked her a lot! Jon Pertwee bothered me and was quite blissful and completely strange, nor was he with Ingrid Pitt. Ingrid Pitt is beautiful and does a normal vampire thing and does it well! <br /> <br /> The rest is good. In general, you have to see!. **** Of 5
