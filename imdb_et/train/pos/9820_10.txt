This is very good for a TV movie. It is a distress in the suburbs of the 1970s and neighbors who certainly do not want to be. The worst and most disturbing part of the film was when punk teenagers killed a family member. Teenagers do everything to distract and harass this poor family. But the boy! The father / homeowner will certainly not take the puncture of the punk adolescents lightly and will quickly become terrible due to the lack of police assistance. He stands against them and protects his home and family. Very good actor. I can add. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV when I was like 8 or 9. I've never seen it on TV and would like it. Definitely good! This is a kind of film that can be caught at night in the late night and cannot be stopped at the weekend or filmed in the afternoon. This is something they no longer show. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth it!
