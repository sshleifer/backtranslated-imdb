I've seen this movie more than once and there is always someone who complains about the "obvious design" of the plot. But then - it's part of Petzold's game: he's playing with genre rules. <br /> <br /> It's very nice how the unlikely story of two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meets again is reflected in another, even less likely story that girls make pain. This film is a journey between journey and fiction, it is more about potentials, things that could have happened in the past or that may happen in the future, if it is about actual events. It's reverie, kind - enough enough to have lots of motives, Freud could have found an interesting way to analyze his dreams, like all the "doppelganger" stars. <br /> <br /> I also think that "Gespenster" may be interesting to look at compared to the current Asian film: Petzold's daily urban architecture also feels awkwardly uncomfortable, strangely familiar. This movie is not clear. To describe it as a story of two girls who meet and finally become friends and lovers, or as a story of an orphaned mother who is looking for her missing daughter from Europe, it does not say clearly about the nature of "Gespenster" at all.
