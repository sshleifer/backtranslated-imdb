This is correct. The film is better than the book. Don't make me wrong, I love this book. But the film is so much better. This film features the best Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall. (I haven't seen anything else about Scatman Crothers and probably Danny Lloyd.) Some of the ideas used in this film are better than those used in the book. But I already talked about what is in my mini-series commentary. But I was little. The movie is recorded in a better location than the mini-series. And REDRUM scenes are scary as in the book. So if you are looking for a big movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But hope that every night there are 3 weeks of nightmares
