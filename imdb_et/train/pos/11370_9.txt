Spoilers - as much as I describe the signs and their relationship with the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a high quality movie. The theme is instantly grim and grim. The character of Stephen Rea, Burakov, is simply an enchanting temptation. When he is properly released to him, his hangdog, a persistent expression of character well. He is, as we would say in England, the character of the TV series inspector Taggart, because it sees three murders a week. Well, this is not exactly accurate, because Chikatila has been working for several years ... <br /> <br /> You get a real feeling of the blindness of the USSR bureaucracy, which is perfectly represented by Joss Ackland (who often seems to be intended) Such a role) . <br /> <br /> The key character (and I am writing this as a remake of Snatcher Invasion in BBC1) is Donald Sutherland's "Mikhail Fetisov". His quiet support from Burakov is steadfast. And it runs through Perestroika and drives FBI involvement in profiling. Brilliantly. <br /> <br /> It's black, as far as I am.
