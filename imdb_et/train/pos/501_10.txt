I think it's still possible to be the best Star Trek series, I say POTENTIAL .. we all know there is a chance that they will drop the ball and run out of ideas ... BET I HOPE NOT! For those who haven't seen it ... IT IT! Without such a tedious "PRIME DIRECTIVE" that floats over your heads every time they come into contact with races, it can be cool .. and Scott Bakula was undoubtedly a great captain quality and Vulcan Babe is too hot (Get to know the decontamination) I gave it to FULL 10 ... it blows away all the other series openers. I hope it will last longer than 7 years ...
