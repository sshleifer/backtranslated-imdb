Simply put, I enjoyed this movie. The reason for my interest and pleasure was not related to anything other than the subject itself. I had heard my mother's and grandmother's stories of how Northern England's working life and attitudes had been (as they experienced) before, and that is an interesting idea that seems to faithfully represent what they told me. Particularly paternalistic but overflowing father who "knows" what is best for his family, with this stubbornness when this paradigm is challenged. (There hasn't been much change!) <br /> <br /> People who have shown the game are probably disappointed with the film, because the story is not easily transmitted through different media. In some ways, the film is a historical document, and I personally enjoyed it, just because it was a social phenomenon.
