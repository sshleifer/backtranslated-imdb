Although not seen in many movies, you have seen many movies since then. <br /> <br /> Not one of Grant's or Loy's best movies, they're doing great efforts. After all, using so many talented and very strong casts, you know that laughs are there. <br /> <br /> The film is lightweight, has some dramatic spotting, but keeps the plot moving and you can smile all over. <br /> <br /> A great example of a classic American movie ticket that has been a test of time. <br /> <br /> A sure Saturday afternoon price, hard on the popcorn.
