Not a bad martial film. The fighting scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job of directing his first film without Van Damme. The story worked with no fraud and too much blood. Scene Jeanette Francess has a good story that works. It would be nice to see something different in his genre. She likes art and has strong women. IT was definitely worth it. I recommend the film to all lovers of drama and martial arts.
