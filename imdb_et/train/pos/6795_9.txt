One of the most intelligent series shooters of recent times. ZODIAC KILLER offers the imagination and history of one of the most notorious serial shooters. The filmmakers unexpectedly create a good overview of the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac is interested. Others want to know more about this enigmatic offender. Unlike many successive killers, Zodiac was not at all crazy, but a very methodical and self-project. The director here plays the viewer's expectations and pulls it out. The film is built as a mystery of murder or a "cold case" style thriller. It is a horror film in an intelligent research / procedural style that pushes gore action out in search of cheap excitement. <br /> <br /> Some people don't like movies on video. This attitude is very old and provincial. It is an attitude and a view of movies that puts technical questions on entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is undoubtedly a low budget movie, but the more discerning viewers look beyond it and find a carefully designed legacy.
