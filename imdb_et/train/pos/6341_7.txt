Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's "serious" performance ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I've always thought that his real genious lies in physical comedy. This does not mean that he is a fantastic, talented actor: these bosses of academic awards don't seem to like him so much, he has never received a (truly earned) candidate or prize. Well, any "institution" that names 11 Oscars should not be serious, like "Titanic". <br /> <br /> With a review. "The Grinch" is the most enjoyable, best-looking, best-performing, enjoyable seasonal movie because of "Nightmare before Christmas". Both films also seem very similar to their very stylized sets and the premise that someone is stealing Christmas. Both are done by their main actors such as the villains (one of the higher levels than the other), both offering a strong moral lesson and both being truly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It means you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll and Grinch is a human. But a person who is so incredibly expressive, so fluid, that so physical, so unreal, that never gets to the film. He may be fun, he may be a sad soul, he may be angry. He lives in a three-dimensional world of three-dimensional people. He jokes, laughs, shouts, and finally saves Christmas. I loved this movie in bits and can't wait until it comes out on the DVD. This is one of the movies you really enjoy in 10, 20 years. So timeless as they come.
