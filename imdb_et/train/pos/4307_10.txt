Well, maybe not just before Rodney King's rebellion, but even a few months before it was enough time. My parents said they saw it and the next thing you know the police got right and LA got burned to the ground. It just shows racial relationships in America. The plot has white Mack (Kevin Kline) and African-American Simon (Danny Glover), who become friends after Simon rescues Mack's life in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, the film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that free violence is really cool ... until he gets off. There is also existentialism in the film: Mack and his family understand that they do not live the way they really want. it came a lot earlier. Perhaps we can never have stable racial relationships in this country. But in both cases, the Grand Canyon is a great movie. This confirms that Kevin Kline is my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
