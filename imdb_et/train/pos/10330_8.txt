In fact, it is about 3 of the short stories of Somerset Maugham. The first one is Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is released from his church because he cannot read or write. So what does he do? Of course, opens a tobacco shop. <br /> <br /> The second is Mr Know-All, which was actually a story I read for the school 6 years ago and immediately forgotten until I heard a familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes and also very good. It worked better on the film than in my book, but then maybe it was just the last time I was 14 years, after that. <br /> <br /> The third one is almost let down. Almost an hour long, just drag and drop. It's not all that bad, but not as quick and spooky as the last 2. I looked at this first quarter of the hour and then left it for the last quarter and found it still worthwhile and really wasn't it! <br /> <br /> Generally, I give 8, 9, and 6 people respectively.
