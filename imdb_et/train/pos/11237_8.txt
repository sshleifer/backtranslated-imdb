Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-lasting internet fan film that has been completely made against the love of the series and has to look at the Trek fans. The production quality is extremely high for the fan film, although it is sometimes possible to say that it is on a green screen. However, it does not take general experience. CGI ships are both fantastic as well as space battle scenes ... On the negative side, I can say that in previous episodes (and even occasionally in new ones) some actors / actors may have roles in their lives, but again this does not take away from the general experience of Star Trek's new interpretations . The cast and the team are really special here, and as a whole, I would recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9.
