The Internet database lists it as television programs. And yes, it was in the MTV series, which was shown in the "Oddities" program, after "Head" and before "Aeon Flux" when I recall correctly. But the version I was looking at this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes that run together as a film without any tedious credits or within the next fifteen minutes to wait. <br /> <br /> You have the story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a super-hero, a Julie social worker or a leopard queen, a Sarah girl who should listen less to The Smiths and Mr. Gone who can't keep their heads. And then there are other strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie because some of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and what are dreams. Maybe they are all real or dreams. Maybe there is no one sign. Maybe there is only one and dreams of others. You have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had comics before the show and it was one of my favorites. The work was remarkable and the story was original - unlike everything you find in Superman or Batman. It bends your mind and holds strong adults without being obscene or offensive. The exhibition was mainly based on the same exact theme (now it only moves) and the same story ... ensuring that the beauty found in the comic is reproduced faithfully. It was the best show that appeared in the "Oddities" hands down. This is "Donnie Darko" before such a thing was ever. <br /> <br /> The most striking thing is that it never became a second movie or TV series, but I am not saying it is disappointing. Keeping it simple, they have sealed this film in gold and kept it free from stains caused by successive failures.
