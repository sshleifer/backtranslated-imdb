Traveling by train across Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet with each other and decide to stay in Austria. The next morning, Jesse will return to the United States and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite songs, really one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a low budget movie with a very simple and real story, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect and the dialogues are stunning. The direction is amazing, giving Celine and Jesse feelings to the viewer. I've just finished my review number in the 1000 IMDb and I pick this important number for "Before Sunrise" because it's a very special movie for me. I do not understand why this film was not put on the Oscar, with a great scenario, direction and performances. Yesterday I was probably watching this movie for the third or fourth time and I still love it. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
