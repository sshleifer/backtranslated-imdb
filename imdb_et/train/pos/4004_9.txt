"Mom" is this extraordinary film making - it's going to get you thinking, it won't pull the punches - and eventually it will leave you thinking. There is a lot of open-minded character about the character of a driver. Anne Reid (which I knew only briefly about her performance in a Victoria Wood-led project and thought it was a good comedienne) is very good here. Not a stereotypical widow housewife who was perfect in marriage and maternity at all. And not first that freely clergyman and adventurous. He plays his character with just the right letter that tells the truth (well, it made me). Powerful cast. Great script. Really European Renaissance Cinema
