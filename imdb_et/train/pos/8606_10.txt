It seems that this movie has no average land! Most of them are in a dream, and like most dreams, it's often silly and illogical. It's also a great production with great songs and fine performances, especially our angel. surprise and joy. At one point he gets an excerpt from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (who has a lapdog for a strange reason), then on the beach "Aloha Oe"! <br /> <br /> This is a surreal comedy - it's tremendously entertaining when you get into it.
