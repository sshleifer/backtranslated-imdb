I saw this movie on television when it came out and never seen it. During my lifetime, I did not remember the title and just stumbled upon it by checking Roy Thinne's film credit. Great, dark and spooky TV horror movie in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Don't be afraid of darkness"; and "Satan's Girl for Girls", all lost Satanic Classics. I also think it has many parallels with Clint Eastwood's classic "High Plains Drifter". Why aren't they releasing very few movies, especially when you consider all the latest garbage that fills Wal-Mart's discounted DVDs? Most of these staples are post-cult, so sales should not be a problem.
