Looking at this film as a phenomenon of school learning, this film was an interesting and different approach. Presented as a series of video recordings made by two disrupted men (I cannot refer to persons killing boys or teenagers), preparatory months leading to zero days (the code of the day they attack) the film tries to present the situation from the other end of the weapon. They seem to suffer from their painful pain, but focus on direct preparation of the word. The problem is that emotions are little direct. The only point where emotions were overwhelming was the end, as expected. But it has happened until this moment, it is never clear why they are planning it. We are told the obligatory story that they were mocked, but the film also seems to be against it. Without destroying the film, it is easy to say that it was a big experiment and had equally big intentions, but it is small due to sloppy filmmaking. All managers are amateurs to promote homemade video, but the story and consistency are weak. The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot, but also does not provide information for such an event. The end is steep and does not feel that it ends up with everything that the movie started with.
