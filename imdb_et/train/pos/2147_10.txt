I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Being aware of the long train movement, cycling from the train station, soup views and other well-featured typical scenes, I certainly got my own recognition for the movie I really liked. In Japanese life, colors have been painted in this life, but while enjoying this movie, you don't have to speak Japanese. Mouth tricks were largely subtle; I found him highlighting a soft filter called Tamako Tamura, making his majesty, a little fine, but most of the directors' tricks were so gentle that I was completely drawn and just danced with my characters. Or shouted. Or laugh out loud. Wonderful. A +.
