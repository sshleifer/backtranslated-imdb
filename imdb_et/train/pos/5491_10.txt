Even if we know how the story ends, it's a thrilling airfield movie that plays almost like a political thriller. During a period of turbulent peace, we meet Hugo Chavez as a charismatic man with a greater life, with an unbreakable relationship with mestizos, who make up 80% of the population, but has previously been closed from Venezuelan political process and oil resources. He seems to be committed to them as they are to him. He travels to the country at a passionate pace, reaching out to the crowd, treating huge crowds, hugging and kissing ordinary people, accepting letters with scraps of paper and listening to requests for help. People are excited that one of their number has made this country the highest post. There is electrical hope and optimism that makes a better change into an inevitable barrier. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. The pure blood of Castillia, a Spanish elite who is a small minority but previously controlled all the wealth, is full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most unexpectedly fun moments in the film is when Ann Coulter's appearance, at the exclusive gate of the residents, complains about mestizos, "they have no struggle or sacrifice." Later, the speaker talks about meeting "to keep your home servants - they could be supporters of Chavez." Duh! Of course they are. <br /> <br /> In a late-night interview alone with a film crew, Chavez shows something about his soul when he talks about his grandfather's story. He may be a sensitive, poetic person, albeit with an unpleasant, even clown humor (as we saw when he turned to the United Nations and called Bush's fuck.) <br /> <br /> Then the storm will gather when the coup organizers demand mass protest and cynical manipulate their supporters when changing the route at the last moment and marching in the Presidential Palace, knowing that it is surrounded by Chavez supporters and that violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot will come when the snipers on the roofs will come to Chavez's supporters, some of whom will come back. Fox News's local equivalent shows this fire and claims that Chavez's supporters are massacres of protesters. Then the camera pulls back and shows that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protesters took a different path. Needless to say, empty street material was altered by rabidly anti-Chavez private TV channels (who had spurred continuous propaganda, calling Chavez mentally ill and Fidel Castro sexually fixed.) Right after the coup, we see the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters set up in public, how they had manipulated the situation carelessly for the lives of both supporters and opponents. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are still in this chaotic heart, a rapidly changing situation when a military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. Finally, Chavez gives up to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to resign and is thrown away to an offshore island where the plane is waiting for her - where? USA? How can the rest of the cabinet members avoid the big armed conspiracy arrest and win over the right-wing generals and extremely wealthy businessmen who are closely associated with the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If your only knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela is in the US media, you don't know anything. He is not an "unelected tyrant" and is not a "decree" - he is tremendously popular, has chosen and chosen several times over 60% of the votes (which George Bush Junior has never achieved) and his dedication to the ordinary Venezuelan people is ultimately the reason why the coup failed. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie of an extraordinary emergency man. The skills of filmmakers are unobtrusive and the story is that the story develops through Venezuelan voices at every level, from barrels to presidential palaces, noisy scenes, chaos, and confusion, showing a single whole that is tense, riveting and moving. Don't be skipped!
