Love Trap is not short, it is obviously a full-length feature film with a duration of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> While writing this, I can also talk a little more about the trap of love. I often ask what makes Love Trap different ... that is how I answer this question: 1) It introduces the symbols - especially one - that the film has never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) It shows more truth about love and deepens deeply into the concept of love than any other US film ever made in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as the story is told, it's different from the love you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It provides a very timely overview of the different cultural issues inside and outside the black community. <br /> <br /> Over time, people will see that the trap of love in this era is as complete as possible with original creation, joyfully refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a rare moral game full of thought. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for full and accurate information about this movie.
