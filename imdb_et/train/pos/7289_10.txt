It was one of the first CREEPY movies I ever saw ... I was at that time for about 5 years. It scared me GOOD! But that night I put one eye chewing gum like a monster ... and my mother was very upset. He had to cleanse my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled DOUBLE ASK! Now this movie! Hey, this is the time it was a great movie. This driver, sitting in the lab counter top, was as real as it got back. And if your 5 it's very SCARY! Kids now days are spoiled with special effects that show too much and do NOT leave your thoughts imagined. Your mind can imagine things that are much sharper than special effects! (IMO)
