Ogre is a film made from television in Italy and was not meant to be a continuation of the Demons, as Lamberto Bava even mentions this in an interview with the Sheirk Show DVD, but it was called Demons III to be part of a demon series. Music Demons and Demons 2 had 80's rock music, while it is horrible music and the first two were horrible fears Demons III: Ogre is an architectural horror, so Demons III is not the right track for Demons, but I still have Music is scary and it adds a tone to the bird that the movie is in, Ogre is another thing I like about the movie. There are two more films that are classified as demons III and are black demons (Demon 3) and church (demons 3). Demons III: Ogre is a good movie as long as you don't compare it with demons and demons 2.
