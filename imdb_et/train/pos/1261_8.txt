I liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) give reliable performances and Harris is delightful. The lighting and shooting angles of some Harris scenes make her face really sad. Ultimately, the surprising plot makes it interesting. Not a big movie, but enjoyable. I gave it to 7 out of 10.
