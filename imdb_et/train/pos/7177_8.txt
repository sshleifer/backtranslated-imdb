I was so entertaining throughout this attentive documentary and I was expecting a good time to pass through the tubes (my local video chain), and that was unexpected. I like a good documentary / special interest, but it was definitely cordial, honest and nostalgic, if you want, look back at the youth. The child's imagination is exciting and it starts with a big story. Rent it or buy it if you like a good, humorous and entertaining documentary. Mr. Stein and the company are definitely far from the production of neighborhood video cameras from bank custody and gay rings that make people look one. They all seem quite successful because they are respectful fields and it was good to know that they are still good friends. The DVD has some extras for other good documentaries and has many of Darren's most outstanding productions, including Crazy News.
