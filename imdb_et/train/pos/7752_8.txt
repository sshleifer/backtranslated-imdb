Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Just as easy and he succeeded. Not only for your purpose, but also for making a great movie, especially visually. He knows how to use pans, slow motion sequences, frame tracking, crane techniques, etc. This gives the film a very relaxing feeling. <br /> <br /> The story is the life of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: the party they all participate in, which is also the turning point of this movie. The beauty of this picture is not about how the characters affect each other (compared to a similar, naturally better film, such as Magnolia). I just don't think it was Barman's idea. Beauty lies in the details of different experiences that people undergo, which change or interrupt their lives. Barman has very successfully said a few stories that describe little experience. He knows people ... ... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the movie is also a great, but no surprise, because we know that Barman is also a very successful singer and musician with his band dEUS. Music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing, contributing to the film's sunny and smooth feel. At other times, we hear funky pop / rock melodies that give some scenes the strength they need. Was it a runtime that broke me? Or were the last scenes that were fresh and accurate as scenes? I can't think of it ... <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful sunny movie that will pick up Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> (This is the wind that flows through the girl's hair in the sunny afternoon, making it even more beautiful; it's a fresh breeze that makes you relax when it gets crowded when someone opens the door; it's a breeze that carries a perfume from this beautiful girl sitting next to you in a park with whom you just met a week ago, it's a breeze .....) <br /> <br />
