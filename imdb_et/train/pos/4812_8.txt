Initially my husband was forced to go because he was amazed by the royal families of Britain and their history, and he did not go to the cinema. While viewers should not wait for electrification, this film is very well done and the visual side is no other. In many ways, it helps to dispel the myth that Victoria was an unhappy unstable landfill woman, usually seen in photographs. She was a bright intelligent and, according to her past history, an entertaining happy young woman. His love for Albert was the essence of true love, and even if you only think of the number of children he carried (9), they must have a passionate relationship. All of this is well documented in the film. For this purpose, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend have been cast, who performed sound performances by Victoria and Albert. Shoot Victoria to defend. There was at least one murder attempt in collaboration, but no shot / s hit anyone. I also found it odd that Victoria's mother and Sir John Conroy allegedly widened their intimate relationship. It is quite likely that this relationship was the cause of Victoria for both mother and Conroy. I also found it strange that the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne is being perceived as romantic or at least a potential romantic. He was already at the end of his 50s when Victoria reached the throne, and while the marriages between older men and young women were common in this era, the film depicts Melbourne as a terrifying 30 Prince Albert. Albert was probably a competitor, but he could never marry a little under his house, and Albert was a handful that would have been acceptable in any case. <br /> <br /> All the time I have in the cinema has worse times and brown spots with my wife can't be bad either.
