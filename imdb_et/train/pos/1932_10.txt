I think I usually approach the comedies of the film festival with a low expectation that they are always "peculiar" and that any proposed humor is derived only from the simplicity of the characters in a complex context. In the case of Big Bad Swim, it was extraordinary that the director was able to preserve the integrity and development of his characters in his movie, while finding the scene after ridiculous humor. It was complicated, perhaps partly due to the sharp work of DP, I have rarely seen in indie and even less so in comedy. Special note here: Paget Brewster, in turn, Amy's math teacher. After seeing this performance, I do not understand why Brewster has not been heard by a larger audience. It brings together the necessary combination of anger and pleasure with a role that actually helps to achieve this potential in this picture. This is a great job that deserves a bigger audience. Waiting for the director and casting it!
