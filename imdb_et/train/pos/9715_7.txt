Here's skinny, it looks like it's much older than I thought it was. But it's still cool. Bicycle mechanisms are cool and the story works mostly. There are some character issues that I hope you will work yourself out in Part 2 and my biggest complaint that it seems to be MACROSS call waiting. Not only animation style, but also several character. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY MACROSS. Mechs are similar to both MACROSS and other characters. It's not really small children, it has graphical violence, nudity, and graphic sexual content. So a short story short, I'll give it a cool MACROSS with 7 stars.
