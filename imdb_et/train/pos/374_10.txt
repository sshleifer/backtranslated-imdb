Rating "10/10" Masterpiece <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I heard Spielberg comment that he wanted to make a movie here and there again. Mr Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this film - along with Schindler's list - is your best. Even Oprah works well in this! <br /> <br /> I have the greatest story and drama realism. Such things happened and are still happening in the world.
