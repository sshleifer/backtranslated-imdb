In China, which was the lowest real gold, it was a small dull thriller. They did the same thing "Detour" a year ago, which is probably one of the best low budget movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Strangler is basically one movie full of fog and shadow. Techniques used by most studios in the poverty line to hide or absent kits. But here it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming Merciless) strikes the sex by killing those who are involved in his unlawful execution for murder, and gives the viewer some compassion. His last victim is to be the daughter of a ferry ... ... he focuses his anger not only on those who are directly involved with his fate but also with their relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone's coma that moves to her style. He offers himself to the offender to stop killing, but when the audience faces, the stranger sees his gesture as good, as a sign that his mission has been completed and returns in the future, somewhat corrupted. When Ulmer (who led "Detour") led the "Strangler", he hangs on the nearest tree and the gutter's job is done. But who complains? It is not a story that is the main attraction, but a reflection of sets, lighting and general mood. It's behind Detour, like the best hour of the People's Republic of China
