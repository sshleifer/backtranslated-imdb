This movie is fantastic on so many levels ... and none of them is the level it was supposed to be fantastic. <br /> <br /> Remember this: If you look at Shaun of the Dead and the other latest zombie movies ... be they good or bad ... This is the formula they use. This is what makes zombie films so big. <br /> <br /> And what makes it better is the story of the movie. A simple web search gives you everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not the case. There's never a point where you think you're going, go ahead with it ... ... it moves well and the corners are fine. It's a sporty, little Italian zombie number. <br /> <br /> So terrible, it's wonderful! If your language spends a lot of your time ... rent it, buy it, love it. <br /> <br /> Superb Empty Mark: When you watch this on DVD, please note that the menu screen has sound effects under musical scores ... Well ... this is because music was lifted directly from the trailer ... which is probably the only workprint of this music that still exists. long enough.
