I really enjoyed this movie. The action was terrible, as was the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized for. The only part of this flick that I would change was the end. The death of the creature was too harsh for the Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this movie. Jeff Combs probably played the Messiah figure and the creature (or shark if you wanted) represented anti-Chirst. There were some particularly scary scenes that had this "end of the world". I noticed it only after I looked at the third view of the classic creature function. I know many people don't get references to Christianity, but if you look closely, you can get it.
