I'm a home-based writer and diagnosis Murder is my lunchtime companion - good, clean fun, good humor and nostalgia at Dick van Dyke's show. When we were all innocent (and how innocent is the diagnosis of murder). I especially liked other nostalgia figures like Joe Mannix. Bad guys are always busy, good guys continue. The stars enjoy themselves well and they don't take the ball too seriously. <br /> <br /> One beef: Why were so many villains women or at least females? Amanda was too dizzy. It is hard to imagine that he really does something as merciless as autopsy. Lunch !!
