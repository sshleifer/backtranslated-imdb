This is one of those films that happen during the Saturday afternoon surfing and you get it in and finally look at the whole thing. I thought it worked well and it really made me feel. Although this is a bit slow, focusing more on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it is never boring. We don't really see too much of all the kidnappings they were so legendary, and most shootouts happen when the police have hit them. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job by nature. It is difficult to imagine turning a cold girl killer from a cool state girl, and I enjoyed the fineness she brought to her role. <br /> <br /> Overall, the effort is above average, especially given that it was made for a TV movie.
