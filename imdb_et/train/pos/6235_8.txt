This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R films have great dancing, but cheerful romance. It is still screaming, but not as expressive as other films. <br /> <br /> This movie includes not only great dancing but also pleasant characters and a number of good songs. Music is the central theme here and it is nice to add Rogers one solo. He was not only a super-dancer, but a very beautiful woman and a huge face. Of course he also dances with Fred and they are always on the dance floor looking for a fun couple. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, when watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on television, the real first time I saw that I saw this young Harriet Hilliard. Not surprisingly, Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although she was in this short early 30-year hairstyle, she immediately felt her voice. Also in this movie are the performances of Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I have not come out of Balli yet. I can't find him, but I know he's here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, except in the first third of the movie, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - though better westerns - is also pleasant. <br /> <br /> This is just a nice, good-looking movie and good if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
