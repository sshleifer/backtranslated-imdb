It took a long time for the title to be found on a special video deck in Berlin and I was happy to find the English version with Dutch subtitles. I think this is one of the best horrormovies. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie a black comedy. I have to admit that I couldn't laugh when I first saw it (and it was the second time!) On the one hand, Trelkovski seems so shy and even cute about his shy behavior, but on the other hand he wins this boy on the playground and there's no explanation. But the weakest thing is, of course, his transformation with Simone Choules and the fact that he does not know who he really is. Her hallucinations are the most terrible in this movie. Of course, this is all in her sense, but is it the apartment that brings this woman out or it was before she moved - I think it's an interesting question. His schizophrenic behavior is hard to understand and terrible to see that his two sides or identities are fighting against each other. As a result, he cuts his hand first and then jumps out of his window. But this terrible cry - does it mean that everyone is repeating over and over again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian things? The fact that he looks like a mummy in a hospital - it's not an incident, but my sight.
