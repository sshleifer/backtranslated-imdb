I've had this movie on tape for years and I started to watch it again this morning (waiting for my lingerie --- how ironic!) Mostly because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel's title music. I went through the first hour and a half that showed how wonderful the direction, writing and performances are. The film is like the letters of the 50's British stars: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thesiger, an outdated giant of textile factories. Not to mention Alec of Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not the character-like players, but such charming, charismatic leaders. It is a scientific fiction that is its purest form and also a drill comedy. All the time classic and I hope no one will ever try to do it!
