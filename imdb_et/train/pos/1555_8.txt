After looking at the rather sloppy WW1 spy thriller, Mrs Lili (1969), which was this afternoon on television with Julie Andrews, I thought maybe I had seen a much better WW1 spy-thriller. All I remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. He only took a short search to IMDB to find Fraulein Doctor. When I admitted the title, the memories came back. In the course of time, the fairly well-established story of events such as Kitchener's death and the 1918 German attacks is right. She also has a female spy who is more credible than Julie Andrews! Like other reviewers, the first and strongest memory was the scenes of a well-produced battle and the men and horses of gas masks. If you are interested in war films and especially WW1, this is a movie you should see if you have the opportunity.
