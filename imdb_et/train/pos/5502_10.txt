Whether this film is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good Chavez is. It really is to show how Bolivarians saw it, Chavez's way to see it. Although supporting a film may seem wrong and biased, I think the viewpoint in the film is entirely justified. The Venezuelan people through the Venezuelan private media company saw only one aspect of the coup, the neoliberal side. This movie shows us how Bolivar saw it. Call this propaganda, I say it's a call made by you.
