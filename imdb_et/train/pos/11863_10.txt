Perhaps it may be the best film ever made and if it is certainly not one of those burning to your students, as what Brian De Palma has to offer is a great film work. First of all, there is the touch of Brian De Palma, who once again proves that he may be one of the best directors, Al Pacino is a great force on the big screen of an immortal hero (Tony Montana). many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (a chain with a chainsaw where Tony sits in a bath that is as large as the living room of most people) has many great lumps (how many times is the word "f * ck" used "), there are great little details (Pan-American world that shouts" The World is yours ") or the great discomusic of Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be called that is not sublime here and that is just "The Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat", one of the best gangstermovies ever made!
