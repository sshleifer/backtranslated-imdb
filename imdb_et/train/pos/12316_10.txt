Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark Chinese Ghost Story, one of the greatest ever wuxia piano films, is a beautiful and romantic love story, as well as an impressive choreographic martial art that should belong to every film lover's collection. Hong Kong Superstar Leslie Cheung plays a travel tax collection that spends the night in a haunting temple. While in the temple, he encounters colorful characters including swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, Tree Devil and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by lovely Joey Wong. To relieve him of the evil tree's clutches, he has to rebuild his body and travel to the underworld to win an even more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> Not enough good things to say about this movie. Stimulation is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and a fever stamp should leave you with little chance to breathe. Chemistry between tragically tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too early) allows the viewer to feel both. Indeed, all action is so viable and full of life, I would say it is one of the most fun viewing experiences I've ever had. Lots of credits go to Wu Maile to portray his mysterious swordsman Yin. The surprising man of his disgraceful sword-like hell, who rejects evil, leads to some moments of great humor and traditional HK drama. An excellent score, lush cinematic with eye-opening colors and crazy action that is politely finished with Ching Siu Tung, this great movie. Find a copy everywhere. 10/10
