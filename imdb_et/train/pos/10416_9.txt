Like Arab Nights, this movie plays with storytelling conventions to feel there is a plot, a plot and more plot: it opens up what seems to be a blind person frame setting that tells the story of your life, then comes back in a blow that takes us to the blind presence where we discover that about half of the story is still coming. (It has to be admitted that the other side is not the very first to meet the first promise.) Like Arab Nights, it seeks as many Middle Eastern folk motives as possible to cram into one work. Released genealogy, beautiful princess, flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, crowded market, evil evil, jewelery ... I don't know why it all works, but that's it. Everything is just so beautiful. Sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is particularly beautiful. As usual, it sounds in Hungarian; but he somehow persuades us that he is Hungarian in Persian.
