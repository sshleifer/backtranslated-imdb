Barbra Streisand is this Hollywood story. His performances and songs are one-off and special films in large halls. The scene where Kristopherson introduces him to an unexpected audience against the crowd and against him, but to relocate them with his excellent "Woman In The Moon", is one of the best examples of how great a great performer can win over the audience. That's pretty. The scene where he saves Evergreen is the best in business. Everyone is alive, no lips synchronization, very special. The strike is often criticized for being a Diva, but he is presenting it. She is a majestic singing "At a second glance. She deserves an Oscar and Paul Williams got to Evergreen. Christopher also had his moments that are much more than his movie performances." one from 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic March), although I've always enjoyed the music broadcast of Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954. I haven't seen a DVD yet and don't know its quality.
