"Tintin and I" hit me first as a masterpiece. Photography and editing are truly breath-taking (almost anti-Dogma). <br /> <br /> We follow the life of Tintin's drawer Hergé through an open heart interview in 1971. The Tintin series was drawn against the background of the great ideological struggles of the 20th century. In their midst, Hergé has its own demons to fight, and much of his drawing activity seems to be an attempt to defeat them and escape to the world of perfection. <br /> <br /> While impressive photography features panoramic views of Tintin's album drawings, as well as some of the album's stories and stories, Hergé's story is completely spoken through interviews and archive materials, never through reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Hergé lived a real, patient artist of restless life. But the fantastic world that came from his imagination continues to amaze readers over and over again.
