My name is Domino Harvester. {EDIT * dizzy * CHOP} My - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Playback} <br /> <br /> I've never seen a director come across so many styles before. It is now obvious that most people are not familiar with Tony Scott's dirty, flashy, dizzying editing techniques. If I have to choose between love and hatred, I would say I love it. From time to time, this line was disturbed, but the end result was pretty good and it is nice to see your style and originality with a creative director (even if he borrowed heavily from MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic edge appears as Keira Knightley plays the role of dirty badass hunters Domino Harvey and even his dialogue seems strange. Otherwise, he will play badly because I hated his character very much and did not want to agree with him, no matter how much he suffers. We follow Domotos during his lifetime joining other bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbas and Edgar Ramirez. The team gets into the FBI and suddenly, in reality, Christopher Walken's television production company has shown a contract (what does Christopher Walken do for each film by the way?). I think this is a smart movie technique because now Tony Scott is free to use as much terrifying MTV / Reality Show editing material as he likes. Then it becomes MTV culture paste. <br /> <br /> It follows that the story is being spoken at an amazingly fast pace, with a lot of violent strong language and weapon violence. There are funny jokes; it is all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a pretty enjoyable mess. Ultimately, it is so broken in so many ways (the actors are trying too hard to make their characters "cool" for one) but it works. I give her a weak 7/10, which may seem generous compared to the general consensus of the film's audience who appreciated this movie? but I feel he has some good ideas and they were well filled. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
