As his first Hollywood director, Henry Brommell whimsical yarn, all of which is impenetrable to the melancholic authenticity of impenetrable marital status, and moisturizes so that the father-to-son business is equally absorbent. The film is staged and consists of a perfectly assembled cast and fast, family-conscious scenario (including Brommell) that brings life to an otherwise tired genre. As a bonus, "panic" offers subtle, acute humor unexpectedly, undoubtedly a charming and highly appreciated surprise through its worshiping, insecure, low-key star, which is always cool, especially thanks to his work. <br /> <br /> Everlasting William H. Macy again draws our hearts like Alex, an unhappy, torn, middle-aged spouse and father who find comfort in the most dubious people: a young, attractive, equally confused 23-year-old named Sarah ( Neve Campbell), with whom the psychologist's office meets in a waiting room, where he is waiting for Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) to discuss his growing zeal to give up his family (Donald Sutherland) family business. Alex, whose passion to lead a new life, fears fear of his dictating father's disappointment, makes Sarah a futile fiction that ultimately leads him to understand his wife's spouse and undeniable responsibility, and, more importantly, he, a good father to his six-year-old son Sammy loving David Dorfman). <br /> <br /> Henry Brommell's brilliant "panic" in Hollywood is rare (rarely) except for the 2002 journey, which has been a concept since 2000, and it creates two controversial genres (organized crime, family drama) exciting, a warm part of watching a movie that is steadily strong in both directions? it is one that retains its extraordinary, rarely caliber and brilliant sincerity over the years to come.
