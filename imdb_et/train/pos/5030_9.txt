Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually the original. It wasn't the same old recycled mess coming out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on video because I didn't know it even before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you won't regret it. Distances are formed all the time and the twisting is excellent. <br /> <br />
