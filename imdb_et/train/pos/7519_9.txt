NOTICE (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Friday, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines a fine biopsy on the legendary pin-up queen Bettie's page. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably the best known because he has been dancing a few years later as the next girl if nobody knew who he was, despite the notorious story of Vanity Fair on other media, but despite the fact that here are some co-staring roles, it seemed so far that his predicted stardom was less bright. Here, when the famous pin-up queen Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is indeed a bright star rising. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was a Tennessee who was born as a raised godly and family-oriented true girl who seemed to be an unwarranted object of lust and affection as she grew older. Gang-raping is not graphically depicted, nor is it a fine showing of his own father, which has fewer than decent designs for his relatives, which is important to understand how Lehi managed to get into the career of a possible actor in New York in the 1950s for a horrible life in fact, it was the time and place to catch the light from the bottle. What the Page did not know was that he was just when he arrived. <br /> <br /> Beautiful summer sweetheart, divine shape, Page is observed on one summer day in Coney Island, a black policeman asking to take his photo into his basement and finally Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) studios, who satisfy their kitchy but consider pornographic photos a unique client: fetish types. Although the Page is rather naive, he is undoubtedly intelligent and knows that his body is not sin and he sees the wood for disability in the sense that he is under control or at least follows what he is offered to work in that it is not indecent and he has fun in his increasingly dressed portraits - until the Congress witch hunt for some scapegoats to make pornographic images of crime. <br /> <br /> Talented filmmaker Mary Harron and her screen-writing partner Guinevere Turner ("American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol") simplify the bio-limits quite properly and maybe a bit too hasty, with whom Bettie Page really was, although they fairly represent their era of dusk. Many thanks to the talented operator Mott Hopfel for his dark black and white images, as well as the scattered color segments that resemble the timing of Douglas Sirk's films for his melodramatic manifestations. Part of the feminist treaty and part of the American dream filled the story finely with the performance of his ensemble, including the comic Bauer and Taylor, smut and brother Harris, who had a wine day as a taste of wine and preaching. It's fun to see Strathair's somewhat stunted as a senator for the campaign for justice, when he portrayed Edward R. Murrow, the news bulldog on his last trip to Good Night and Good Luck. But <br /> But really did Mol have a truly subtle talent that is unobtrusive but deeply moral and the most important intelligent Bettie Page, letting his bare nudity bare his bold nudity and now-considered-tore-and-quaint boundary - kitschy is a man's fiction for decades and is still a bookmark of human sexuality in this country and perhaps worldwide. Mol is perfect and looks like his portrait theme until his conscious smile. The real Bettie page was not known to be involved in the project, but apparently he was blessed and still lived a somewhat lonely life, referred to in recent moments, to find Jesus and put his "notorious" image forever. Shame, because this film is strangely submissive to his subject, radiating to all who see their naked glory.
