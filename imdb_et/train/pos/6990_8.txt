Bela Lugos appeared in many of these low-budget coolers Monogram Studios in the 1940s and Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. <br /> <br /> Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps and kills young brides and then extracts fluid from her body so she can keep her aging woman young. After a reporter and doctor staying at home and discovering that he is responsible for the brides' deaths, the next morning the police will know their murders and the crazy scientist will be shot and fall shortly thereafter. br /> You've almost been in this movie: the assistants of the scientist consist of an old action, worship and dwarf (his sons), thunder and horrors in Bela's house. Bela and her husband find they sleep better in the coffin, not in the bed of the movie. <br /> <br /> Corpse Vanishes is worthy, especially for Bela Lugos fans. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
