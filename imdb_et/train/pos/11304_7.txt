I'm not sure under what conditions Visconti's James Cain's novel "Postman always rings twice" (I'm not even sure if Viscount was acquiring book rights), but the resulting film is definitely interesting. This is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the best 1981 version), but thanks to Visconti's superb direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual pair), this is essential for Noir fans. Visconti interferes with the neorealism and the sensitivity of the young man with great influence. However, the film is not perfect. My main complaint is that the film is too long for its own use; the story is moving very slowly (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better on short time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who keep the viewer interested. Anyway, as far as I like this movie and remakes, I think no one has made the final version of Cain's highly acclaimed book.
