This is one of those films - Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that keeps the audience interested again and again. Oscare has rarely won light films, but anyone who made Soapdish casting deserves it. Even after one film has seen and knows what's coming, it's still enjoyable to see how the different facets of the plot are developing. True, all drama is melodrama; but it is perfectly suited for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoop Goldberg: "Now why can't I write * t?" I think it is unfortunate that TV and website censors call for all this unnecessary sewer.
