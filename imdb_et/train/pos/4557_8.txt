I thought Hugh O'Conor was amazing as young Christy Brown, and he earned more recognition for his role. I couldn't believe how well he played that part. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also great. My favorite scene is where boys play football and Christy uses his head to stop the targets and then hits the penalty! The amazing performance of two Christians (and others).
