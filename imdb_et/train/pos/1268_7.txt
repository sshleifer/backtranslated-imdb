Just Cause takes part in three films, Cape Fear, Evil Defiance and Lamb Silence, and mixes it up to get a good movie thriller. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a professor of liberal law, married to former district prosecutor Kate Capshaw, and he is a crusader against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee's buttonholes at the Connery conference and persuades her to handle her grandchild's complaint. He is sitting on the death row because of the murder of a young man. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this Florida county, he is opposed to a harsh sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is about as merciless as his own crimes, as Orson Welles was in touch with evil. Later, after Connery gets a judgment that has been proven, she feels very well. At this point, the film will take a decisive turn to the lack of evil in Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> Say that not everything seems to be soft to say. The cast rotates evenly in some good performances. Particular mention should be made of Ed Harris, who plays Hannibal Lecter, as Underwood's death penalty. He makes your skin crawl, and he starts to think of Connery again for some of these comfortable liberal spaces that he has based on his convictions. Many confirmed liberals I know have thought quite differently when they become victims of crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, the opposite is equal. Many laws and procedures conservative, if they ever participate in the wrong end of the criminal justice system, want to prove that all their rights are indeed guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not the end but a process and never endless for the whole of society. I think if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be.
