This is a film for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not entertainment. Lars von Trier creates the atmosphere of post-war Germany. You have been absorbed into the dream and you will only let out at the end of the credit. The plot is necessarily in second place, but it is still a fascinating story with difficult problems. Just wonderful.
