In September 2003, Jonny Kennedy, 36, died. He had a terrible genetic condition called 'Bullosa (EB)', a dysphoric epidermolysis, which meant that his skin literally fell to the slightest touch, leaving his body in the debilitating ulcers and leading to the final fight against skin cancer. In recent months, Jonny has decided to work with the filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a film that was first broadcast in March, an uplifting, confusing and provocatively humorous story about a single man. The film was also a celebration of living life, deviating from the gloomy reality of EB. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and for the first time in March 2004. The boy whose skin wilt has become the most talked about documentary of this year. It attracted nearly five million viewers, and after screening, the public donated more than half a million pounds to DEBRA for charity. The Jonny Kennedy Memorial Foundation is designed to raise another half a million to ensure that Jonny Kennedy leaves for one million pounds.
