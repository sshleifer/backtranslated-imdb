Brilliant movie, next best movie Drunk Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on the original VHS and I haven't seen this movie for 15 years, but still as good as it was. Action was terrible and duplication was even worse, but the features that make this movie (and many other old-fashioned Chinese kung-fu films) great. Choreography is fantastic and the story is basic. I've never seen a 36th chamber in Shaolin, but I know it's the same movie, but Gordon's slogan is played by San Te, but San Te has played a different character in the 36th Chamber. It's a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung-fu.
