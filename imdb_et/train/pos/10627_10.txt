What is a real independent film? At day and age, where the last mainstream Hollywood fad must be tough and top-notch, I am sorry to say that what the public tends to perceive as an independent film is usually nothing more than a smart marketer. > <br /> That's why we should be happy to have films like "hate minutes". On the whole disc, this film is part of the fact that it is against its template (indie horror film). Love it or hate it, "hate" is not afraid to be what it is, and when you watch this movie, you get the real idea that Kallio (director) did not make this movie just to fake. he is about to tell stories. Good. You can find this movie in the horror film section of your video store, but don't be fooled, this story is also about love, good people pushed over the edge, and the oh-far light at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect smoke or Evil Dead ripoff, stay away from this movie. But if you dig the finer points of the horror / intermediate channels, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell made this movie, and I'm sure he's proud to tell someone it's not "Evil Dead". Bruce has never tried to put his "ash" on the bank and it is obvious that he did not participate in "hatred" so he could do it. <br /> <br /> My advice to all of the dead people told by Mr Campbell is to check this movie anyway and see what Mr Kallio and Mr Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> Action is well done, although there is nothing oscali caliber about this movie (perhaps deliberately), it is good to see compassionate shows in horror. So often, the actors in these films do not seem to be "hateful", it seemed that all the actors took their careers very seriously, never used a typical horror movie campines. <br /> <br Technically, "hate" is about as competent as an indie movie. Editing is fast, cinema is good at budget, and "hate" keeps pace fast, without any attack points or lack of bad climates. <br /> <br /> All in all, hate must not be all these multi-million dollar counterfeit indies, but I personally can't see it. This is a film made by people who really care about the media. People who got into their pockets of broken ass pulled their nicks and hats out, threw the wind gently and made a fucking good movie. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
