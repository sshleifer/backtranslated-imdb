Joan Fontaine celebrates this Victorian era as a film. She convincingly persuades a married woman with an outstanding side and sets her sights on a rich man, Miles Rushworth, who is played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is pretty good at Miles. Miss Fontaine did her part perfectly - at the same time she was clever, calculating, innocent, scared and charming. It takes an actor with extraordinary talent to pull it out. Joan Fontaine seemed wonderful in Travis Banton's elegant costumes. The film also features Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
