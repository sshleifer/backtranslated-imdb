Film stands for life. <br /> <br /> The world sets itself up for innocent and clean souls, and everything is "Happy End", like the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent soundtrack, a mix of Serbian neofolk, gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very refreshing visual poetics. <br /> <br /> The viewing experience is like you. is sucked in another colorful, romantic and sometimes tough world. <br /> <br /> As Mr. Kusturica's movie should be.
