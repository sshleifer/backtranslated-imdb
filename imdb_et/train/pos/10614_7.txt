Three girls (all female media team, including Barbara Bach, a cultural figure, not the least) who visit a small town to cover the festival will end up renting the house, they should have avoided like a plague. Well done little shockers who suffer a little from some of the superfluous dialogue scenes and rather thin lines (which don't hide their secrets very well). Particularly one of the main topics is quite disturbing (like: vintage-shot material) and this is basically what the film is booming. Performances and cinematography are pretty much above the parameters (compared to many other films from the late 70s / 80s of the same film), but what really makes this film is a rather long climax of the basement. From the moment when Keller Junior's character was introduced, her performance was loosened in my jaw and it didn't close until the end of the movie. A very pleasant surprise to see the actor Sydney Lassicki (who was a funny joke in "Kuski nest", and now "without seeing") is one of the leading roles.
