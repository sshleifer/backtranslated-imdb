This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I love to dance and ran to the movie shop. We had to get it. Without violence and such a warming story, this is a great movie to relax and just enjoy your night. I would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.
