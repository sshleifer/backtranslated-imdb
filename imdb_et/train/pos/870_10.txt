"Read my lips (Sur mes l√®vres)" (which is apparently unlike the idiomatic resonance in French) is a funny, double-contemporary story about office politics that suddenly becomes the captain of crimes, as the unusually matched characters slip up and down the ethical and sensual slippery slopes. <br /> <br /> Two drivers are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (whom I have never seen before, despite her long restart in French films) and even more unpleasant than the usual Vincent Cassel's sexy and / or menacing look and voice for some US films). <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie is its security at a competitive real estate agency and it is an opponent. The other half is adapting to its milieu as an ex-con and its key to this milieu. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Jacques Audiard uses intelligently the woman's isolating hearing power as our perception, turning the sound up and down to hear how she does it (so cumbersome than usual when audience members speak), also visuals as sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> No characters work as expected (he does not like such a flexible victim in "People's Enterprise", not in individual interaction, not in scenes, not in the general arc of unpredictable sketches (well, until the last picture, but the heck that the audience was waiting to do this) when we move from a passionate modern office to a passionate disco to romantic and criminal enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> There is a side story that is thematically redundant and unnecessary, but it only gives us a few minutes to get our breaths back <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites of the year! <br /> <br /> (originally written on 28/22/2002)
