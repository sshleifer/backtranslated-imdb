Very good movie. A classic sci-fi movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers more foreigners. We see the leaders of the Rebel Alliance and many Imperial troops. The Emperor is somewhat original in nature. I liked Ewoks, representing somehow indigenous people and Vietnam. (Great references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke, the best of the saga. In the return of the Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory event where he performs Vader's redemption and returns with Anoda Skywalker's spirit with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives sadness and tear. The biggest scenes in Star Wars are this movie: When Vader turns to Emperor. Luke watches and finds the convenience of seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (Hayden Christenssen is not the 1997 version). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to Darth Vader to protect Leisi. Despite having a good ending, this movie has a deep dark side. I felt there was much more than an eye. And as always, John William's music brings classicism to the Star Wars universe.
