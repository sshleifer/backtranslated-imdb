I dug out some old musicals out of my garage and this is one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. It won two Academy awards for the best picture of 1951 and the best scenario. A story about an American painter in Paris who is trying to make it big. Nina Foch is a complicated tool and is very interested in helping her, but she soon finds she loves her. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls on the beautiful mother, Leslie Caron. His main dance partner and I have to say that they are fantastic on the floor and otherwise. Also famous French singer Georges Guietary sings. So if you like good smooth dances and fun scenes full of Oscar Levant's pounding piano finger, George Gershwyn's songs live with this colorful pearl forever. 8/10
