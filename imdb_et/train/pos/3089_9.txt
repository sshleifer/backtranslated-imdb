I was against it because apparently ABC has licensed this exhibition to Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It was my surprise because it was to break anything from Chinese listening. But I started reeled in, as cast and story lines are just NYC enough and thoughtful. Something too unbelievable though I think it is very stereotypical to write Damien as a potential black man with a page !! This has been the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and I'm sad to learn from IMDb that I can't wait to see the 2nd season when I return to the US. I am as disappointed as other commentators that it showed a lot of promise and quality and taste. However, as the characters are approximated, people will probably find it more difficult to see if there are several episodes in the beginning.
