when my sister said this movie was good, I had a second idea, but I looked at it and it was really funny. In principle, the film is made of a strange girl who goes to a small town where someone likes her and she just wants to go there and her aunt's reading doesn't go so she can go. but it's not that easy. In this movie, you see terrible humor, a witch, a spell / recopies book, a spiritually challenged uncle and a dog. You understand the meaning of the word freak a anyway I hope you run out and try to find that really old movie. I hope you like what I have to give her 0 .... no I'm totally funny, giving her 9 hopes that you will realize that you are laughing, screaming and you can just offend. <br /> <br /> I really love you: Dakota can email me at dakota_loves_it @ hot mail.com
