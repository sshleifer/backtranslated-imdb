I looked at it a few years ago. I remembered it in very mysterious situations and as a mixture of melancholic things, such as Dorothy's destiny and Bogdanovich's personal future. and more. Today I am waiting for the DVD version at any price, please! <br /> <br /> The country and easy listening to music are very well chosen from the first second, a little blue, but also happy. /> <br /> All the characters are great for me, in a funny situation, great acting and lots of dialogues that have made it a cult film for me and for the many people I met on the Internet or in cinema clubs. It may not be an accident. <br /> <br /> I think the title is hope for life! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know it may be a special comment on the movie, but the fact is that I like it very much, I think the movie celebrated me and I didn't forget it ever.
