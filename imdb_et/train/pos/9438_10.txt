This is one of the greatest films ever made. It's a classic of all time. The character played by Ned Beatty passes through one of the greatest images ever shown. He's a low, almost useless, overweight insurance seller. He is proud of his ignorance and appreciates, however, that "inverted hicks" are unknown. When he congratulates the old man on his hat and the old man replies, "you don't know anything," "the tone is set. It's true. He really doesn't know anything. But one background comes later, the man is practically a warrior. The old man is dead forever, left in some distant woods, soon under the water of hundreds of feet, and what is Lewis, our terrible guide? Lewis is a philosopher / hunter / warrior and he is almost nuts. Burt Reynolds proved himself in this film in 1972. Who would not want a friend like Lewis to be forced to know about the dangers of a forgotten / soon-lost world, as our unfortunate passengers come in. This film tells us so many levels. acts as a full action / adventure, with excellent cinematography and deliberate grinding frequency. It acts a bit of a horror film, a threat and an enemy of almost surrealistic treatment ke red with his "sow" Ned Beatty. But it also works as an art film, using an incredible amount of symbols to convey the truth that goes into our hearts. I've seen this movie at least fifty times and every time it comes, I find I have to watch it. You have to look at it a few times to even understand it. This is one deep movie. This is one well-functioning film. And that's one story. I gave it to 10 out of 10 and put it on my 10-fold biggest film ever made with Schindler's list, Casablanca, taxi driver and Sling Blade. Movies that think of you. Movies that lead you to think further. Movies using STORY to make your point without trying to preach to you. If you think you know you're giving freedom, you could, but you might not. It's really so good.
