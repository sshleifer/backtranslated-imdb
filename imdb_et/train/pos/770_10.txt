I love Tudor Chirilat and maybe that's why I enjoyed the movie so much. Two days before the movie premiered, I went to see her concert. I saw the "zmeu" before the movie trailer and video and I thought I had it all ... I was wrong: instead of a good movie I helped big! i FELT movie. it was sad .. it was funny .. but most of all it is in the picture LOVE .. i can't even start describing the soundtrack .. so i don't :) i'm not a movie critic .. i can 't describe it more with words .. The vague description of my glove is all because I missed the game, thank God for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistas, thank you to Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA.
