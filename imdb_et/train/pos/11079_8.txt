I always like to see movies that make you think, and don't just drop your audience answers. "Revolver" is one of these films, and although many reviewers have said it is difficult to follow, it is a bit concentrated and open. First time. True, it is not comparable to other entertainers, such as "Ordinary suspects" or "Memento", but in itself a smart and thoughtful film. The other thing I really liked about this movie is how it's fucking pretty. Every scene, the angle of each camera seems to be timed. When you see it, you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So ... to watch ... open it and enjoy it. If not, nobody said "Revolver" is for everyone. And this is my 2 cents.
