Having seen many Greek films, I feel very doubtful about most of them. But after watching it, I felt surprised. Movies are great, without much try. You cannot claim that the scenario is so great or photography is perfect or something technical. This is a real story and it takes place in the forgotten places of God in the Greek countryside. The film is like a stomach and I really want things not to be like that. Obviously, this is something other than the Xenophobia (ignorance) of the Greek people. The problem with this man is not that he has been convicted. The problem is that he's not one of those people. He's different and they don't want them (that's why all the good things he does, turn him boomerang). And he also talks about the apathy of people, because there are people who are against the king's hunting, but they dare not say their opinion. Finally, you clearly see that the hypocrisy of society is religious and attempts to act as God says, but at the same time acts so unfairly to the king. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. Ultimately, this very bad story will be a positive lesson, which means you can understand and only be part of this society if you want to become one of them. If you want to stay different and even alone, you are lost (and it is far from reality). I think it's tragic that the story is real and it should be a clock for everyone. The main actor does not comment because he has already been awarded the prize and I believe his game was great. A little comment on Hatzisva (played by a policeman), he is like a dinosaur, he has played a lot of roles and I am sure this role was very easy for him, but he plays so big that you can't deny him a big bravista. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
