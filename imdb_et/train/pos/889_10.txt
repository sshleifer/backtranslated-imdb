It is one of the best Hong Kong (action) movies with a tense and exciting story as well as great fighting scenes. This Sammo movie has everything, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero. This is the only martial arts film that interests me rather than just waiting for struggles. Sammo Fans-It's Black It (see also East Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao's Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter Fat Dragon.
