This movie can be really bad, but it's a lot of fun. Bad behavior and bad direction increase the hysterics of the film. The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you go to this movie, waiting for the first Conan or Excalibur, you hate it. If you look at it in a good mood and agree to it, have fun. Watch this scene where they try to hang the brothers in their movie the most fun. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 did it!
