Being the first Lion King fan, I waited for this movie, but I knew it wasn't as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are cautious about direct video because I also have their confusing feelings. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Lion King 1½, I was trying to find out what that movie was like from my own point of view. Am I so committed to the Lion King that I beat on certain scenes, or am I going to just accept this movie on Lion King's story? Most of the time I found myself over the last mentioned. <br /> <br /> Lion King 1½ is definitely your sweet and funny moment. Timon and Pumbaa stole the exhibition on the first film and certainly made a movie that focused around them. People just love these signs! The favorite of the movie is the assembly of Timon & Pumbaa, which takes care of the young Simba and the surprise of having some great fiery. <br /> <br /> I could have done a lot of fun with a lot of bathrooms, as the real reason that everyone worshiped at the beginning of Lion King's Simba child. I think these jokes are meant for the younger (which is ultimately the target audience. I don't think many kids are really worried about Disney's profit margin for direct-video movies.) <br /> <br /> I say I was somewhat annoyed when they directly link the movie scene to the sites. I'm just too familiar with the original that these scenes just left me like white thumbs. There would be something about music or voices that would just disturb me. <br /> <br /> As for music, it wasn't too bad, but it didn't expect any classics with this movie. At least LK2 had beautiful ballads, "Love finds its way." As for speech work, this film was well done. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a good job as always, and even the new cast members, classic comedy actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (known as Marge Simpson) did a good job. You can even enjoy these great talents with the virtual Safari on the DVD. This feature is definitely very fun !! <br /> <br /> So everything in Lion King 1½ is not the perfect movie, but it's cute and fun. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun and easy-to-see vision of the Lion King masterpiece from the perspective of our funny friends. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Rating: B (good)
