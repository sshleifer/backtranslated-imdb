Of course, it may not be classic, but it's full of classic lines. One of the few movies my friends and I quote all the time and it's fifteen years later (maybe it was too many times in Cinemax!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he doesn't seem to figure out how to play it - but he is surrounded by fantastic pain, who knows exactly how to play it. Looking for a movie that would make you happy? That's it, but rent it with friends - it makes it even better.
