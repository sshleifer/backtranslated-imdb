Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. Great twist. Great eye candy. It's one of Wes Craven's biggest films, "Scream" and "Nightmare on Elm Street". This may be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), who is in trouble with a hotel manager, is late to bring Red Eye back to LA. He has little knowledge of being followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack Ripper (Murphy). They have a couple of drinks and they sit together on the plane. Later he reveals to him that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secret of internal security, who is staying in the Add Hotel. And what to do with Lisa. Well, he should have moved his room to the upper suite so they could bomb him if he didn't murder Ripner's father (Brian Cox). Indeed, drawing and producing a story gives it extra zinc and side characters and side jokes really add to it. It's definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. Certainly worth it. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of the 4 stars
