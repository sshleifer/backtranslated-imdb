Full House is a great show. I'm still growing today. I started watching it when I was 8 years old and now I'm 12 years old and I still watch it. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. he's my favorite. he had such a sense of humor. if there are people in this perspective who hardly look at the exhibition, you should because you get attached to it. I started this after the first show that just happened to be the first episode in 2002. I really think this exhibition should go to many generations in families. and it is also great because it is a suitable show for all ages. and for all parents, it teaches children lessons on how to go about their lives. nothing happens like violence or swearing. this is just a very good sit-com. I'll give him 5 out of 5. what do you think? OH and the best time to watch it is when you're sick at home or in an old office. This will make you much better. Trust me that I am hardly sick at home, but I still know that it will do you better. And for anyone who thinks the show is stupid, it's too bad for you because you can't get that far in life even when you're happy with your life. you really should watch it and you get it. I'm just telling you what happened to me, and everyone else who started watching this awesome example. well, I gotta go for lunch. remember that you have to start looking at the full house and soon!
