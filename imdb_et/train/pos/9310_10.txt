wow, how can I even discuss this movie without tears coming in my eyes? It was definitely my year - highlighting my life. As raptor graphics were not amazing enough, award-winning editors used exactly the same frame throughout the movie, even if the background did not match the scene settings. Oh, what a genius. And while the film is full of holes in the plot (for example, some t-Rex-type animal clips that should have a raptor and one of the main moments when Pappy finds the torture chamber, "Colin's girl shouts" and ends) I will never forget the shine that Raptor has Planet. Thank you for your Sci-Fi with another classic.
