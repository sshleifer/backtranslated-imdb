Unfortunately, the DVD is not yet available, but it is worth continuing with TCM or VHS. The secretary believes that his boss is wrongly accused of murder and boldly takes many dangerous signs to establish the truth. A movie with lots of twists and dark streets, none of which! The Jazz Bands, where our hero is looking for information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, although it's in a very low budget and made black and white during World War II. Despite the low budget - Long Island seems somewhat mountainous - this is the film of the original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actor discovered by Howard Hawks, who knew these things a lot, pouring the worst women in their age - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - who emigrated to Hollywood and brought a very original fresh vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines never gave such a big part, and eventually she was badly produced on the west coast.
