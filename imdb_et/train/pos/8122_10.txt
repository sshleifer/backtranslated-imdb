I never saw this movie before I tape last year. I was amazed and entertained. It has all the elements I love in a Sci-Fi story, book or screen. There are social comments, speculation and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something terrible and amusing about looking at the 1936 view of the "distant future" of the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> I think it must be visible and not just Sci-Fiers.
