Mario has been invited to the princess peach castle cake. When Mario gets there, it turns out that Bowser has kidnapped him! Mario must save the day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore something he wants. She can just go around, climb trees, try to find 1-ups, find secrets on the level and much more. You can spend four hours in one level. There are no deadlines. There are 16 worlds with several stages, and there are star doors that need a certain number of stars. When you get to these stars, you have to play the stage and fight with Bowser at the end of the stage. In order to access certain worlds, you need several letters to enter. There are so many things to do and so many hours to play, I don't see anyone like this game. That's great. This title is a game that made sure that the N64 had a good life. Every 3D disc game we know has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are common examples. Super Mario 64 is one of the biggest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10 If you have N64, buy this game. It's hard to find, because nobody sells $ 5 for a child on a pawn. Perfect 10.
