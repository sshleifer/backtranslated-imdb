Deathtrap gives you every turn, every time, in fact, his biggest problem is that there are so many turns in the movie that you never get, and often it makes no sense, though they usually try to surprise you. The story is very good, except that it has so many turns. The scenario is very good with great dialogue and letters, but you can't catch the whole development because of the twists. Especially Caine's performances are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Snow can be directed. Visual effects are fair, but most of them are actually in the game and are fake. Turns the road a lot but still works and is worth a look.
