I didn't bother to see the movie in theaters, though I remember hearing this name over and over again. Finally, I watched it this week and joy. For some reason, I was expecting it was not very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stuck with it and then I found myself completely drawn. I read a lot of other user comments and I was impressed by how many people talking about his struggle in the circle, but it was wonderful for Diana that she was a real fighter in life. All he needs is to find his place where he is, and the circle helps him get there. Very intelligent story and I'm surprised that this is the first time for Michelle Rodriguez - what a great job. Adrian and his coach were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> This film is a little rough around the edges, but it's not the slightest. The story, the will and the performances outweigh all the mistakes (which usually arise with indie film making). An unknown image of a girl who finds herself and triumphs her circumstances and K.O. Michelle Rodriguezile!
