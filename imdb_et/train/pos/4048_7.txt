Rohmer tends to use his traditional French middle-class portraits to talk about the drama of the costume of the aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. What is more attractive about "La Anglaise ..." (except the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetic that Rohmer has achieved. The pictures are also digitally decorated and look like baroque pictures. At some moments you can't really say whether you are watching a movie or a series of pictures of the Louvre Musseum. Every shot is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My Price: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- /> <br /> ----- --------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - ----------- -------
