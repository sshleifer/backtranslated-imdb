Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has been thrown away by his wife because he is one of the most annoying neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he just can't do that job, so he drives his friends' house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) has recently been divorced and lived in a bachelor's sky. Smoking, gambling, eating chicks, eating and never cleaning it is a paradise for him. Well, with suicide attempts, Oscar decides to let Felix move. At first it's a heaven-made game, Felix bakes and cleans up and helps Oscar to pay their alimony on time, but soon Oscar is for women and Felix. today's world would probably be gay) not ready to move on. They call a couple of British birds and they find Felix so gentle that soon they and Felix will cry and talk about their family life, neglecting the Oscar. That is, he explodes and throws him out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as it seems, and soon he will have an upper hand. My favorite quote "You leave little notes on your pillow. I told you 158 times that I can't keep a few notes on my pillow." We're all out of corn flakes. F.U. "I took three hours to figure out F.U. was Felix Ungar!" In Neil Simon's game (who also wrote the script), it has a certain theater. Set and repartee and appearance feel completely playful (better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have great comedy chemistry and they have appeared in Grumpier Old Men's movies and Out to Sea, repeating the same finicky / slob roles, but with different names (to make sure I am on salary issues, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> This movie is like chocolate dipped strawberries. The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is sour, juicy and bright red (if you don't get them greedy). They are almost polar opposites, but together they contrast each other and make an excellent dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
