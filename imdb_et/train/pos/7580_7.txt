As far as I have enjoyed the Hanzo razor films, there are certainly three enough: "Who has received gold?", The latest adventure of a Japanese lawyer with an impressive package, is a rather enjoyable part of Pinku's cinema, but offers little new ideas despite being a humble step, despite the humble fear. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a female ghost and looks like she is going to explore the supernatural territory that may have taken the series in an interesting new direction; Unfortunately, after the horror is nothing more than Scooby Doo-style roses (a baked treasury officer who wants to keep people away from the lake where he hides the gold), director Yoshio Inoue has introduced the recycling of familiar elements from the first two films the result is a pretty outdated thing. <br /> <br /> Hanzo is once again conducting an investigation that requires him to question women with his mighty penis, cutting off his enemies and abusing his bosses. On the way, we get wild slaves, good-natured rape (Hanzo forces women who stop evaluating their intentions) and bloody sword struggles. <br /> <br /> If you have already seen and appreciated the first two films, you can also look at this queue to complete the set, but warn it is probably the least satisfactory of all of them. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7.
