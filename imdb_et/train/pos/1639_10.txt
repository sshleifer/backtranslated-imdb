Fabulous actors, beautiful scenery, tough reality. I do not specify all the other reviews of the reviewers because you get the picture! But the film is not cunning. Reality kills pigs and other livestock to survive. I also have a book by Elinore Randall Stewart's homeland. I read it several years ago, I have to read it again, because I just looked at an updated, remastered DVD of the movie. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy the video for several years, finally bought it from a video store that went out of business. But Yippee! The DVD is now on sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but worth it. This is the movie I look at until the end of my days!
