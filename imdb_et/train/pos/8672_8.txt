WWE's last PPV in 2006 turned out to be a hit with fans, but for only one reason was there a ladder party that was supposed to be only against Paul London and Brian Kendrick William Regal and Dave Taylor. But since the recent crap PPV was from Dismember to December, WWE knew he had to do something to talk to the fans again, it turned out useful when he introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz and announced the match would be a match. <br /> <br /> The game was brutal and one of the best ladder I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a mess. Johnny Nitro didn't even check his partner, they just did something like nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal didn't do anything except for some ladder shots. Finally, the titles of London and Kendrick were retained. <br /> <br /> Kane won the MVP of a good inferno game elsewhere on the spot when he put the MVP on a fever costume. Chris Benoit fell into Chavo Guerrero's decent match, Gregory Helms won Jimmy Wang Yang to maintain WWE Cruiserweight with a firm tight. <br /> <br /> But the main event was complete confusion, with King Booker and Finlay taking John Cena and Batista. The activity was dirty and no one was interested in who Batista chose for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Kane won the MVP inferno game. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Tag team titles against the Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal ladder match. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to maintain a US title decent match. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms won Jimmy Wang Yang to maintain the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman won The Miz in a terrible game. <br /> <br /> Undertaker won Mr Kennedy's last race. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista won King Booker and Finlay in the interrupted game. <br /> <br /> General Class - B
