This film deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among today's aging. As one who has been exposed to many families facing the potential of Alzheimer's or at the formal stages, I would recommend that every healthcare provider recommend this film to every family facing the trauma of the disease. The purpose of the film is primarily to talk to the patient's family and to reach the center of the fight. Casting is excellent and dramatic depiction is prominent with a very leading plot line.
