8 simple rules for dating My teenage girls were happy. The gifted Tom Shadyac participated in the project. This meant that comedy would be nothing less remarkable, and that is what happened: the exhibition remains one of the freshest, most funny examples of the most beautiful. Every line, facial expression, election choice, scene, everything was perfect. There was no episode after what I thought, "A man who wasn't as good as the rest". Each of them was special. Again, this is the kind of perfectionism we expect from Tom. For those who don't know, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (First Film), The Nutty Professor (First) and Liar Liar. Quite slow. He's not a director here, but his magical touch seems to be in every episode. The family consists of: <br /> <br /> Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): Nice, slightly neurotic, may be a thrust from time to time working as a sports writer. Unfortunately, John died in 2003, with joy in reminiscences and almost definite cancellation costumes. <br /> <br /> Mom: Cate (Katey Sagal): A fire who doesn't fall in love with Katey when she was married to children? Al Bundy was our hero. Our viewers gave him the respect and love he never had. But without Peg's unspeakable, parasitic, lazy lifestyle, Al would probably have been another Chicago father instead of the confusion that Peg (in fact) caused. Katey was then a MILF and it's still: brune (instead of redhead) and just as bad as ever. Cate is a conservative mother and a loving woman. I know it sounds boring but comedically fits perfectly. Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played by Kaley Cuoco perfectly): Almost never the idiot has played so well. In addition to Gobile's seized development, Bridget can be a gift for this gift. Bridget is low, self-centered, not very bright and then slippery. It plays a stupid blonde role better than absolutely anyone in IMO. Perfection. One of the highest points in the show. <br /> <br /> Geeky's daughter: Kerry (Amy Davidson): brune and geek; It seems neglected, undervalued and neglected most of the time. She is Bridget's younger sister (actually she's older than her) and two extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes with our great entertainment. <br /> <br /> Son: Rory (Martin Spanjers): was the second most funny character in IMO before Ritter passed, then John goes, new characters are coming and Rory is not the wise-breaking verbal-maker he used before: it went mostly the character of David Spade. <br /> <br /> These characters were key to John Ritter. Unfortunately, the unpleasant fun of Larry Miller (one of my favorites) didn't get much time on the screen. He played with Pauli's collaborator / competitor. After aortic dissection, Ritter paid his life in September 2003 (September 11), and the exhibition was interrupted for a while. No one thought it could come back, but later it made a few new additions. It started with the second stage of the show and the new characters were: <br /> <br /> Tough, confident headmaster: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there in talks. It was the first time I saw him. I have a word I use. His performance was very impressive. It was sad that he hadn't been presented before. He also plays Cate's potential love for love after Paul's passing. Gradual progress towards this point (which would have been crazy at the beginning) earns a lot of praise from the creators. It was done slowly, carefully and perfectly, with constant respect for Paul (Ritter). <br /> <br /> Attitude Grandfather: Jim Egan (James Garner): Adding a surprisingly welcome series, he was a cannon feed for endless "old" jokes, mostly ... <br /> <br /> 35-year-old unemployed wisdom splitting half man: CJ (played by David Spade at a surprisingly funny height): I knew Spade was funny, I just didn't know he was funny. Somehow, Spade's very familiar presence within her character (unlike the distinctive character) seems to be understandable because she is comic and she is in a comedy performance. This unfortunate feeling is like someone who sees someone borrowing David Spade's films, talks and features (awards, etc.) and offers Spade's voice and comedy style, except that it's Spade. By this I mean you realize that he is not trying to play anyone else or a completely new character: he is a funny, funny spade we know, and he takes it to the absolute top of the humorous formula. Every line he said, every sarcasm to which he was born, all the classics, literally. Spade was CRAZY-funny; so, so funny. <br /> <br /> The humor and drama of the show rose both after the show, but the viewers thought, "John went, it's not the same." This is understandable given that we are talking about a group of people (American viewers) who gave a "Yes Expensive" ride but caused Andy Richter's control over the revocation of the universe. As the quality of the exhibition increased, its ratings fell. Soon, unfortunately, it was no longer. <br /> <br /> And last time I saved the best: Fans with married children are a treat. And boy, what the treatment was. I still tremble just remembering it. It is a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to break it, even if I did it right on the pretext of "spoiler ...". Suffice it to say that this is something you will never forget. I know I'm not :-)
