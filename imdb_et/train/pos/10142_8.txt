Perhaps it is just because I have the fear of hospitals and medical things, but it got under my skin (grace). This piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and satisfactory when they come to the movies of revenge. Not only did it feel like I had a lot of hatred for a screw tongue and a lot of sympathy for a "screw", I felt sad and disgusted in some places, which is really a rare and pleasant thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself. Some parts of the "Hellraiser" are very memorable, but come more like respect than imitation. This is a heavy hand piece that doesn't offer much to the viewer, but I like to attack the film once and for a while. This piece brings it out and does not appologize. I liked it a lot. DO NOT look at the pudding while eating.
