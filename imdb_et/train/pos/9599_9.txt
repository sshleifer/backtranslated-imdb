I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and there was no dry eye in the house. It is incredible to see not only what the great person Darius is, but also the amazing team that is too young and so long. <br /> <br /> It also made me wonder how nasty MTV was and how they could give a positive opportunity to engage and inspire them, they fell. Shows whether they really care about young people and their viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and heart-warming real story ... take your tissues, but it's nice to see how today's young people care and inspire them.
